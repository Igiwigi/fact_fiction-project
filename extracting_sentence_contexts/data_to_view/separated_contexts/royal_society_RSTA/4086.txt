But the figures
found for P and As bear no such simple relation to each other, or to the refractive
index of N, the first member of the same chemical group. Unless, therefore, the
results of M. Le Roux were inaccurate, it appeared that no simple generalisation
could be made which would embrace all the elements whose indices were known,
But the coincidences exhibited by the halogens and the inert gases were so striking
as to induce me to attempt to repeat the work of the French physicist, and to verify
his conclusions. In this desire I was encouraged by the fact that M. Le Roux
himself speaks of the accuracy of his results with diffidence, owing to the great
difficulties involved in the experimental method he employed. The earliest researches on the indices of the permanent gases were made with a
hollow prism, but this was afterwards abandoned for the more accurate method of
interference bands. But, having to deal with substances whose vapour density is
inconsiderable except at high temperatures, for which the interference method seemed
unsuitable, M. Le Roux reverted to the older plan.
