transgenerational pathogen avoidance behaviour. This occurs directly in the exposed generation and persists for four generations after exposure [45,46]. (6) 5.

exposed parents after a single parental exposure and in the grand-offspring after three generations of pathogen priming [108]. Purple signifies proteins required for
