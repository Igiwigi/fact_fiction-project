VI. An Arrempr To Estimate THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE oF THE DOUBLING-PERIOD
FOR SPECIES IN THE CASE OF THE FLOWERING PLANTS, AND THE PRESENT RATE
OF OCCURRENCE OF Speciric MUTATIONS.

Objection has been raised to the assumption of “ specific mutations * on the ground
that no such phenomena have been observed. “ Though undeniable as possibilities ”
Dr. Barrson wrote in a review of ‘ Age and Area’ (‘Nature,’ January 13th, 1923)
‘we have to consider what warrant for such guesses” (as Coleus elongatus being the
immediate parent of C. barbatus, and so forth) “can be drawn from the observed facts
of variation. The answer is quite clear that up to the present scarcely anything com-
parable has been observed.” To such an argument the reply seems to me to be that
we are not likely to observe the actual occurrence of a viable specific mutation—it is

far too rare an event—unless or until we discover how to stimulate such mutations
artificially. This is in fact the answer already given by Dr. Wrtxis (‘ Age and Area,’
p. 212): “Lord RayzxieH has estimated the period since the Eocene alone, which
covers but a portion of that occupied in the evolution of the higher plants, at 30,000,000
years. But if we suppose one mutation in 50 years to survive, we should get the whole
