Granit, one and all must consist of four modulators—two red, one green and one blue;
moreover, the latter must have wide curves, as shown in figure 6 of Granit’s publication in
Neurophysiology—not the narrower modulator response curves illustrated in figure 2 of that
communication. If by chance the blue modulator was missing from the dominator make-up,

it would not seriously affect the shape of the curve; but if either of the red ones, or the green
component, were missing, a very misshapen curve would result. From the evidence that
the curves are all alike, we may therefore assume, as Granit does, that in fact the composi-
tion of all dominators is the same, each consisting of three, or possibly four, modulators.
Since 36 % of all nerve fibres give a dominator response, and since, as we have just stated,
every one of these must be connected to at least three—and possibly four—receptors, it
follows that, on the average, for every six foveal receptors, two act as separate modulators,
each being connected with its own nerve fibre; the remaining four are connected together,
to link with a single nerve fibre having a dominator response.

Now the acuity for fine detail, given by a dominator, must be inferior to that given by
a modulator, because, as has been stated, the dominator consists of four receptors which
act together as a single physiological unit; so that dominators, if present in large numbers,
will cause serious deterioration in the appreciation of fine detail. But it is well known that
the detailed perception of the human eye can only be adequately explained on the hypo-
