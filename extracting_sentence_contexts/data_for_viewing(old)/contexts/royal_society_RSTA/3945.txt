performed using a Thermo-Finnigan Neptune multi-collector inductively coupled-plasma mass
spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) at the University of Bristol (Black Sea sediments) or a Thermo-
Finnigan NeptunePlus at ETH Ziirich (all water samples). Zinc and nickel were introduced into
the mass spectrometer in 0.3 M nitric acid via a CPI PFA nebulizer (50 pl min“!) or a Savillex
C-Flow PFA nebulizer (50 pl min~!) attached to an Aridus. The analysis consumed approximately
30 ng of Zn or Ni. For Zn analyses, Ni was measured to monitor a potential interference on “Zn
from 64Ni, and mass 68.5 measured to monitor potential interferences from doubly charged Ba
species on Zn isotopes. For Ni, °°Fe was measured as a monitor of a potential interference from
58Fe on °SNi. In all cases, these measured interferences were negligible. Mass discrimination was
corrected using the double spike, as detailed previously [3,17,19,54]. All the double spikes in our
laboratory are cleaned of other elements before use, by passage through equivalent columns to
those we use for samples, and to allow spiking of the same sample for multiple elements despite
the fact that for example the (uncleaned) Zn spike contains small amounts of Ni impurity, etc. All
Ni and Zn isotopic compositions are given in standard notation as follows relative to the NIST
SRM986 and JMC Lyon Zn standards, respectively:
