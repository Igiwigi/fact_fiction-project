The pressure difference that induces the flow is switched on at time t = 0.

Our analysis is restricted to the moments when a meniscus stays sufficiently far away from the
capillary’s inlet and outlet ends. We fulfilled the calculations for capillaries of different lengths,
from Ly = 10 to Ly =50; however, the results reported below are obtained for Ly = 10, when we
already obtain a sufficiently long dynamics unaffected by the capillary’s ends.

The governing equations are supplemented with the boundary conditions. The motion on a
long time scale (the average motion) is primarily set by the pressure difference that is imposed
between the ends of the capillary. The reference point for the pressure field is set at the right
(outlet) end (pz =0). The pressure level at the left (inlet) end of a capillary is always set as
pi =8L/Re. In a single-phase flow, this pressure difference, (p1 — p2) = 8L/Re, will generate the
Poiseuille’s flow with the flow rate Q = 2/3. The actual flow rate will in fact be lower due to the
action of capillary forces.

At the walls, for the average velocity, we set the no-slip boundary condition (wu = 0), the absence
of the diffusion flux through the wall (04/(dy) = 0) for the chemical potential and the condition for
the concentration field that defines the condition of neutral wetting (the contact line is orthogonal
to the wall, the molecules of both liquids interact equally with the molecules of the wall), which
is defined by 8C/(ay) = 0.2

2We would like to note that for displacement flows the choice of the static contact angle is of little significance. The static
contact angle defines the shape of a static meniscus. A displacement flow is, however, determined by the dynamic contact
angle, whose value is independent of the static contact angle, and it is instead defined by the flow rate [13,14]. Thus, an
accurate setting of the wetting properties would be a secondary issue for the current problem that is left for another study.
