and Plate 18, figs. 2 and 4),

The pterygoids have a considerable vertical extent at their anterior ends, where
they meet the transverse bone on the outside, the palatine and vomer on the inside.
They pass up between the transverse and the palatine, and viewed laterally they are
seen to grip the transverse bone (Plate 17, fig. 1, and Plate 18, fig. 3) as Corr has
deseribed,* one process passing above and another below it. The pterygoids meet
each other in the middle line beneath the basisphenoid and become intimately
united with each other; from this place of junction a knife-like process of bone
projects downwards, Behind the junction they again diverge and proceed outwards
to the quadrate, but the posterior rami are missing in this skull, except for a small
portion near the origin on one side. Mr. Goopricu having reminded us of certain
facts which suggest that the posterior rami may be
separate elements, we examined our photographs
in search of a suture in this region and found to
our satisfaction that it really exists, being situated
precisely at the point where the ramus branches off
from the main body.

Broom has recently succeededt in showing the
form of the labyrinth of the ear, by dissolving away
the surrounding bone; he has drawn attention to
the extraordinarily large size of the vestibule, and
identified the foramen ovale as the aperture at
the extremity of Owenâ€™s hypapophysis, and the
