rhythm is difficult: FGCMs can show a diurnal rhythm mirror-
ing that of circulating GCs, but this rhythm can only be
documented in animals that defecate multiple times per day
[124,126,127]. Intestinal transit time, which regulates FGCM
excretion rate, is influenced by physical activity; rodents excrete
GCs more rapidly during the active versus passive phases [123].
Total faecal mass influences FGCM concentration, which may
not reflect circulating concentrations [126]. Thus, FGCM
measures provide a useful estimate of GC production in free-ran-
ging animals with appropriate methodological considerations
and biological validation for each species [125].

More relevant to this review is the fact that faeces are
excreted in discrete periods, and therefore, faecal steroid
measures reflect a physiological average of circulating steroid
levels over several hours or days. These measures represent
an estimate of overall production during both low- and high-
production periods. Also, most studies necessarily use oppor-
tunistic sampling and estimate mean steroid production across
long periods (weeks, months). Because GC production is
affected by many variables and because faecal samples have
inherent limitations, accurate quantification of individual
differences in GC production requires frequent within-individ-
ual sampling over a significant period. From current studies, it
is difficult to know whether high-mean FGCM levels reflect
