Were we in a position to make even a rough estimate of the number of species of
flowering plants that has been killed-out, (45) would give us an approximate value for /.
But unfortunately we are not at present in a position to give even a lower limit for this
figure, which would give an upper limit for *. If, merely as a numerical illustration,
we take i as 2, 2 takes half the previous limiting value (e = #) or 2-9 million years,
new species come into existence at about the rate of 1 in 26 years, and species are killed
out at about the rate of 1 in 52 years.

So much for the scheme of continuous killing-out. Let us now turn to a scheme of
cataclysmic killing; supposing that a series of practically instantaneous cataclysms
occurs, each sweeping off a certain proportion of the then existing species. However
crude, it seems to me that such a scheme is a slightly closer representation of the facts ;
at all events, a comparison between the consequences of such a scheme and the scheme
of continuous killing will show whether extreme differences in the time-incidence of
destruction on species have or have not any important effect on the estimated doubling-
period.

Suppose then that each cataclysm kills off the same proportion q of the existing species,
a proportion p surviving: that the cataclysms recur at regular intervalsÂ¢: that there
