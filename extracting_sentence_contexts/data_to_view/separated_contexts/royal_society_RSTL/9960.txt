In the course of a few minutes the difference sank to —0'01, that is, a
little below its original amount. Amputating half of the remainder of the petiole still
attached raised ib at once to — 0023, but it s0on sank to —0:017. Clipping off the
stump of the petiole which still remained, produced only a slight increase to — 002,
Throughout these experiments the excitatory variation exhibited the same character,
We have thus before us two sets of facts relating to the electrical influence of the petiole
on the leaf, viz. : (1) that a current through the petiole, if directed towards the leaf,
renders the attached and proximal end negative to the distal, and (2) that removal
of the petiole produces the same effect. I am unable at present to explain either of
these phenomena. The nature of the electrical relation between the two organs which
underlies both must remain undetermined until it is possible to make further
experiments.
