especially amongst younger users and more time spent online generally.

— Online services becoming more resource demanding, including increased complexity of
webpages, sometimes made up from hundreds of media files. Video streaming rates have
increased from around 1 Mbs~! in 2005 to around 7 Mb s~? for Netflix today.


— The availability of online content has exploded over the period, progressing from video
streaming of short social network videos in 2005 on services like YouTube to 30-60 min
programmes from television catch-up services in 2015, and feature films through video-
on-demand content providers such as Netflix, which can last in excess of 2h.

The Cisco report [1] also highlights the interesting fact that metro traffic (traffic remaining within
local/city areas) will surpass long-haul traffic in 2015, and will account for 62% of total IP traffic
by 2018. One key reason for this, as will be explained in detail later, is related to the increasingly
significant role of content delivery networks, which bypass long-haul links and ensure content
(such as popular videos) is delivered directly to the metro.

There are various approaches to the question of how long we will continue to see exponential
traffic growth. Extrapolating the historical growth trend implies that the growth will continue
at the same rate simply because it has continued to do so for several decades (the so-called : =
Nielsen’s law (e.g. http://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth/)). Others argue that 3
exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely as physical limits will be reached. Also, video
has always been known to be the so-called ‘killer-app’, and once consumers can access as much nee)
video as they can consume, the bandwidth growth will finally level off. Research has estimated :
