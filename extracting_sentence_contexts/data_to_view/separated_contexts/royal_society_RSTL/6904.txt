Of the three internal temporal convolutions (Plate XIX. fig. 5), the upper one, con-

Scealed in the dentate fissure, mm, and corresponding with the corps godronn6 of authors

(the dentate convolution, H.), is present, but very small, the fascia dentata being only

zjust recognizable. The middle internal temporal convolution (1-1) (pli temporal moyen

Zint6rieur, GR. ; uncinate, H.), continuous upwards by the narrow ridge (+) with the

convolution of the corpus callosum, and ending forwards in the wnciform tobule (ww)

Sllobuls de Vhippocampe, GR. ; and crochet of Vicq D'AzYR), is relatively narrow and less

Zprominent in the Bushwoman's brain, the crochet being particularly small. The 7ower

= temporal convolution (99), which in fact is the same as the lower external temporal, and

2is marked off from the middle one by the parallel fissure of GramroLem (2-2) (collateral

E fissure, H.), is very broad, though smooth. The secondary sulci of these convolutions

E are chiefly longitudinal, and more simple than in the European brain. The middle con-

Z yolution (19), that above the collateral fissure, is traceable round the very tip of the

x occipital lobe, and, curving upwards on its hinder aspect, joins the middle and lower

Z V occipital convolution; the lower one (9) unites more directly with the lower occipital

E row.
