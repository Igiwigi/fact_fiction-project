Explanation of these apparent anomalies was made, when it was shown that the diurnal
Sariation derived from a mean of all the observations must in all instances be regarded
the joint effect of two distinct variations superimposed upon each other, proceeding
Afrom different causes and having different laws, viz. the occasional disturbances, and the
Tegular solar variation. Hence it was natural to imagine that in passing from the parts
of the hemisphere where the regular solar variation predominated, by reason of its
greater amount, to other parts where the disturbance-variation should predominate,
differences, of the nature of the s0-called anomalies, would present themselves in the
tesults which should comprehend their joint effects. Still, however, in attempting, with
the yery limited knowledge that was then possessed of the differences that might be sup-
posed to take place in the disturbance-variation in different localities, to apply this mode
of explanation to particular cases, doubts have been entertained of its sufficiency to meet
the phenomena in all cases. The fact which has now been established by the compa-
Tison. of the disturbances at Point Barrow and Toronto, that the prevailing disturbance-

deflection at certain hours of the day may be easterly at one station whilst it is westerly
at another, augments the probability, that, whenever the effects of the two classes of
phenomena are separated 80 that the approximate laws of each may be known, the
apparent anomalies will disappear, and the solar variation will be found, after the
disturbance-variation has been eliminated, to correspond in its times of easterly and
westerly elongation with the order of the phenomena as generally observed in the same
