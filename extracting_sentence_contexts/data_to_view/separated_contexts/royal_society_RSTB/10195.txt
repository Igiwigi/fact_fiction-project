The polarity along a third axis, the
left-right (LR) axis, has yet to be studied in-depth at a cellular level in a
well-controlled manner, until the recent development of several in vitro cell
chirality systems [1-7]. The establishment of the LR axis is critical for living organisms [8]. In fact,
all vertebrates exhibit asymmetry along the midline of the body (also known as
handedness or chirality) in the positioning and morphology of internal organs. A deviation from such an arrangement often has severe consequences,
especially when one or two organs are in mirror positions (i.e. situs ambiguous). When all internal organs are on the opposite side of the body (i.e. situs inversus),
the individual can be healthy, although some may suffer from diseases such as
Kartagener syndrome.
