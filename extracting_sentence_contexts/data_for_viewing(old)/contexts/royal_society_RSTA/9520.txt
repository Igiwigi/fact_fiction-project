rature correction to the observed values of CE/Qdé the latter are brought to the
values they would have had if the rise of temperature had been zero. Then, by
taking the mean of all the maximum, all the medium, and all the minimum values of
CE/Q dé, thus corrected, and substituting these in the three above equations, the
most probable values of §,, 4, and & can be deduced. The values of 8, thus obtained
show a distinct variation with the barometric height. This variation of the specific
heat at constant pressure with pressure can be calculated by means of equation (7),
p. 387. In the case of steam, at a temperature of 104°5° C., if S is expressed in
joules/gr. deg., and 1 cm. of mercury is taken as the unit of pressure dS/dp = 0°0013,
this means an increase in the value of S of 0°065 per cent. for an increase of pressure
of 1m. of mercury. Experimentally, the value of dS/dp is found to be about twice
as great as this, but, taking into consideration both the smallness of the correction
and the fact that the barometer only varied by about 2 cm, during any one series of
experiments under identical conditions, the agreement is very satisfactory. A pressure

correction of 0°1 per cent. per centimetre has been applied to the results calculated as
above in order to reduce them to the values corresponding to a pressure of one
atmosphere. The variation of the specific heat with temperature, indicated by the
experiments made with different values of dé@, was directly measured in the case of
each calorimetric arrangement in the following manner. With a constant value of
the flow a series of experiments was made in which only the value of d@ was
changed. The observations made in the case of two such experiments with the
