That the simple relation which has been shown to hold good when the sun has
reached a certain altitude does not apply in the case of low altitudes, is distinctly een
from the aboye-mentioned figures. When the swn is only a few degrees aboye the

n, the disturbing phenomena of opalescence come into play, and the values of the
er and yet undetermined terms of the expression become $80 large as materially to
t the result. It is only in the case of the Heidelberg observations that the first
terms of the series express the relation as low as 8? of altitude, and this is to be explained
by the fact that the observations at Heidelberg were made at an elevation of 1900 feet,
-above the sea-level, and therefore at a situation above a great portion of the denser
layers of the atmosphere in which the phenomena of opalescence are most marked.
The curves on fig. 4, Plate XXTI., shov the rise and fall of monthly chemical intensity
with the hour of the day for the months of January, February, and March 1867, and
April, May,-and June 1865; those on fig. 5, Plate XXII., give the same for the last six
gonths of 1865. Figs. 6 and 7 show the same for the twelve months of 1866.
> The mean monthly integrals of chemical intensity for each month from April 1865
April 1867, as obtained from these curves, are contained in the firss column of the
Ellowing Table. In the second column are given approximations to this integral
tained by taking the average of the daily means as given on Table IT. (pp. 557 and 558).
Bro third column contains the average amount of moisture for the month, in grains per
abic foot ; the fourth the relative humidity for the month ; the fifth the average amount
