processes.

Any kind of magnetic stress built by the convective motions that reaches the corona will be
strongly affected by the various processes mentioned above. For instance, the chromosphere
appears to be filled with magnetic field, even in the quiet Sun, despite the fact that the
photosphere is sub-adiabatic, which thwarts the expansion of emerging magnetic flux into the —
regions above [85,86]. Therefore, it remains unknown under which conditions small-scale flux [=
emerges into the chromosphere. The challenge facing the researcher is thus to combine all these
ingredients into a model of the entire solar atmosphere, taking into account all important effects
while discarding those that have little impact on the build-up, transport and dissipation of the 1S
energy flux heating the outer atmosphere. Da

4. Partial ionization effects 28

In this paper, we will concentrate on ion-neutral interaction effects among all the possible [8
physical processes from the photosphere to the lower corona. The chromosphere is partially
ionized: ions are coupled to the magnetic field, whereas neutrals are not directly affected by the
