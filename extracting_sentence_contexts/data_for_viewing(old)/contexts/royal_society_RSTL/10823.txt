required when the electrodes are placed at a distance from the orifice. From this we
may infer that very rapid vibrations may exisb in the liquid at the orifice, which are
only propagated along the jet when the stream attains a certain velocity.

Very similar results are obtained if the jet nozzle be made of platinum, and the
jet be allowed to strike upon the rounded end of a platinum rod placed at a little
distance from the orifice. The current may be passed in either direction between
nozzle and rod. The best sounds are obtained in the telephone when the end of the
rod is a little beyond the © vena contracta.”

It is evidently impossible to include any length of the jet at a distance from the
orifice in a circuit, without transforming it into a _nappe ; and I have therefore taken
advantage of the fact that s0 far as vibrations are concerned the nappe has all the
properties of the jet stream itgelf. The nappe formed by the impact of a steady
Jet against an extended flat snrface is of about the same diameter, whatever may
be the distance of the 8urface from the orifice, 80 long as it is formed from the
continuous portion ; but the intensity of the disturbances transmitted to ib from
the orifice increases with the distance, as for the jet itself. The simplest way of
passing a current through it consists in allowing the jeb to strike normally upon
the exposed end of a platinum wire imbedded in an insulator, snch as ebonite, which
is impervious to, and unaffected by, the liquid employed. The jet spreads out from
the point of impact as a nappe, which comes in contact with a platinum ring
imbedded in the same surface. - The wire and ring are made to serve as electrodes.

A very «imple form of apparatus is shown in section in fig. 8. The jet tube, J,
