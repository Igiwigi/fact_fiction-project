ground speed by varying their air speed which may then reach 5 m./sec. or more for short
periods at least. Farther away from the ground, air speed seems less influenced by wind
speed, and at sufficient height is presumed to be entirely uninfluenced, unless temporarily
in very turbulent air. These conclusions are also consistent with the optomotor theory, but
there is an urgent need for further measurements of air speeds in known conditions.

Height of flight, among low-fliers, depends on the wind speed in much the same way as
taking-off and settling; locusts ascend somewhat in lulls and descend in gusts. This accords
with the optomotor hypothesis of a preferred retinal velocity attainable at a height which
decreases with the wind speed. Higher fliers are less responsive to wind-speed changes in
accordance with the hypothesis of a maximum compensatory height above which no opto-
motor responses occur, this height increasing with the wind speed. The optomotor effect of
height is quite unconnected with the fact that wind speed generally increases with height,
a fact which in no way alters the hypothesis but which does complicate its detailed investiga-
tion and application. The optomotor effect is geometrical, varying directly with height,
whereas the wind speed does not change so fast with height. But since the wind speed does
increase somewhat with height, locusts climbing in moderate winds will tend to suffer
backward drift, compensated by reducing height, with the result that sustained flight in

moderate winds should be predominantly up-wind at low heights. This seems to fit the
available data reasonably well and to agree with oneâ€™s general impression, but more and
more precise field measurements are required.
