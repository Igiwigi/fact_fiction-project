As we stressed, the transition probabilities on voting preferences (and in fact data from
psychological studies; cf. [16]) are not doubly stochastic. Next, we find the components Qj of the
generalized quantum observable B = (Q;, Q2). From expressions (4.14) and (4.15) and by taking
into account the probabilistic form of the coefficients (5.6), we obtain

To calculate the absolute value of the sum, one can use the formula
