follicle fraction was scraped off and collected using centrifugation
(300g for 10 min). The pellet was suspended in trypsin and incu-

both 70 and 40 ym filtres, washed twice in PBS and pelleted
using centrifugation for 5 min at 300g [40]. Epithelial hair follicle
cells were H2B-GFP positive. Interfollicular epidermal cells were
