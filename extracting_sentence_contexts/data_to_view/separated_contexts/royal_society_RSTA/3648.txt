majority of instances, however, no boundary is obtainable under these circumstances. the faster, has been noticed for a few cases, e.g.,

But if at the beginning of such an experiment the concentrations of the two solutions
ave proportional to the transport numbers of the respective cations (or anions), then a
stable boundary results which travels with the current. Such a ratio of concentration
is automatically brought about during electrolysis, when the slower ion follows the
faster, and once this condition is established the margin so produced may be made to
move backwards by altering the direction of the current, and this may be repeated a
number of times without losing the boundary, although its velocity has been proved
by experiment to be less in the backward than in the forward direction, The
stability of this margin is easily understood from the fact that the potential slope in

* For the investigation of acids and bases it is impossible to employ gelatine solutions in the cathode
and anode cells respectively, as these are immediately destroyed by the H and OH ions; for these, there-
fore, a partition of earthenware was substituted at the one end, and in order to prevent as far as possible
movements of the solution through the membrane, the open limb of the apparatus (K, fig. 1) is dispensed

the two solutions is so adjusted that the velocities of the two ions is the same, This
is, however, only strictly true for what may be called the reverse direction, for the
first moments after reversal of the current, since the change in potential slope no
longer hinders diffusion between the two solutions, but aids it, and hence the

resistances become altered, and so also the potential fall and the velocity. The

boundaries that have been investigated in this direction are 3 Cl and Cu at and
so,

both of these are quite permanent when the current is reversed, and are not lost even
after 2 hours, their velocities becoming, however, steadily less. The Influence of Hydrolysis in the Indicator.
