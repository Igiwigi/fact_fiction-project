increased. Taking the speed at the lowest temperatures at 10 a minute, the variations
are as follows :â€”

439. Advantage has been taken of the fact, elicited in the experiment described in
par. 437, in the construction of radiometers having flies of a spiral form.* By cutting
a thin disk of aluminium into the form of a spiral, then drawing it out corkserew
fashion, and suspending it on a needle point in a tube in the usual way, the spiral
rotates very quickly on exposure to light after proper exhaustion. The upper surface
of the spiral is blacked, and it is kept of as large a diameter as will conveniently go
in the tube, In this form, as in the turbine form of radiometer, the black surface is
always exposed to the incident light instead of being alternately in light and in
darkness, The driving surface is greater in this form than in the usnal kind of fly,
