outwards, and is propagated in the ventricle without regard to the arrangement of the
muscle bands.

Rates or PROPAGATION.

What the rate of propagation in the mammalian ventricle may be is aâ€™ problem not
easy to solve. It has been attempted by Gorcu; he used a base-apex lead and
- measured the interval between the onset and culmination of the chief deflection,
considering this time to be the base-apex transmission interval. .Now a measurement
of this kind is justifiable only if it be known beforehand that the natural excitation
wave hasa simple spread along the muscle fibres and exactly in the line of the
contacts. Both premisses were assumed by Gorcu; but, as we can clearly show,
neither is warranted by the facts. It is impossible to calculate and express the rate
of propagation even approximately, from the times at which the natural excitation
wave appears at given points on the ventricular surface, even if we have accurate
estimates of these readings. The course of the excitation wave, relative to a pair of
surface points, is not the same for different regions of the heart. If we use our own
estimates of the surface readings in this fashion, the calculated rate varies from several
hundred millimetres per second to infinity. Evidently the wave may start between
two contacts. Still more important, it may not spread to any extent from one muscle
element to another, but may be separately initiated in a large number of small areas
through a special system of distribution ; such is indeed our thesis.

It is necessary at the outset to study the simplest forms of propagation, forms of
propagation which are, in a measure, subject to control. For this purpose we promote
