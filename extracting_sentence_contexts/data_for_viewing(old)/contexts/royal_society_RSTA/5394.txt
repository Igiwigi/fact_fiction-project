(b) Enduring uncertainties: challenges and new opportunities

While the identification of discrete time slices reduces variability in proxy climate data used to
evaluate models, and will place tighter constraints on the design of climate model experiments,
it is not a panacea for the Pliocene. Moving to a time slice will lead to a reduction in the amount
and geographical spread of proxy data available for data-model comparison, particularly in the
terrestrial realm. Issues of bioturbation, varying accumulation rates and the potential for different
proxy methods to monitor different parts of the water column in different parts of the year all
remain [55]. Furthermore, while the selection of the first Pliocene time slice was partly based on
the fact that the interval will minimize the potential bias introduced by orbital forcing, it does not
remove it entirely (figure 5c). This means that orbital forcing will change to a degree through and
around the studied time slice. Therefore, time slice sensitivity experiments with climate models
are warranted to fully explore orbital influences on regional climates.
