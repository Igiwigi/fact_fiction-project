THE COAL MEASURES IN EAST GLAMORGANSHIRE. 151

Equisetales, must lie at an intermediate position about 60 feet above water level and
would diminish in their number with either increase or decrease in the height of ground
from this critical level. (See accompanying Chart VI (a).)

Explanation of Chart VI, Part (a).
(@) The “peak points ” represent the asswmed height of land surfaces above sea-level
that give dominance to different classes of plants on the 29 horizons.
(b) The “ peak points ” below sea-level represent the actual mean thickness of strata
intervening between the coal seams of the 29 horizons and denote the amount of sub-

= sidence of the sea-floor to form the strata from one seam to another. S Lycopodiales = 0-20 feet (wet flora); Equisetales and Cordaitales = 20-100 feet

3 (intermediary flora) ; Filicales and Pteridosperms = 100-300 feet (dry flora). H Two significant facts come to light:—(q) pairs of seams, widely separated from one
another, show dominance of fern and fernlike plants or dry flora, and (6) pairs of seams,
close together, show dominance of the Lycopodiales or wet flora.

3 Fauna.

a Faunal remains on the whole are somewhat rare, and of the different genera, Car-

oh honicola, Anthracomya and Naiadites are sometimes very rare. At other times they

ES appear in well-defined bands, but how far such bands extend laterally is not known.

5 A significant fact is that on horizons where plants of the class Lycopodiales are
5 dominant, shell bands generally occur. Further, the shales in such bands are of a
2 carbonaceous nature.
