In this preparation a number of threads, forming a tangled mass and lying
free in the protoplasm of the ventral canal cell, are to be seen. These threads stain
like chromatin, but there seems no reason to consider them as other than portions
of a disorganised nucleus. Even if they be chromosomes, they do not confirm
Drxonâ€™s statement as to number, for although they cannot be counted with perfect
aceuracy, it is clear that there are more than eight, in fact the number seems to be
even greater than twelve. PENETRATION OF THE PoLLEN TUBE. The details of the passage of the pollen tube down the nucellus have been worked
out by Dixon (14),

When the tube reaches the oosphere wall it seems to become fused with it
(figs. 15 and 16); in no case was the pollen tube seen to pass beyond the wall, it
never seemed to penetrate into the actual substance of the egg as has been so often
described by older observers.
