It also helps to account for the retinal direction effect of Stiles
& Crawford (see ยง 123). A warning must be given, however, that factors of an unknown
kind may be present which may either facilitate, or inhibit, the process of cluster formation. What is wanted is independent evidence that such clusters do in fact exist in the retina. Suppose such evidence to be forthcoming, then a further question would arise, namely,
why is it that these clusters do not disclose their presence in normal vision? This point will
be considered in Part XII.
