However, the pressure loading corresponds
to a ramp profile (shockless compression); therefore, the desired strain rate can be obtained in the
tested sample (approx. 10°-10° s-1 according to LaLone & Gupta [41] and Zinszner [42]). More
recently, this testing facility was used to investigate the tensile strength of an alumina ceramic [13],
two SiC ceramics [14] (figure 3a) and an ultra-high-performance concrete [23]. However, high-pulsed power technology techniques also suffer from several limitations due to
the fact that these experiments are complex and costly. Moreover, these experiments are limited to
small samples due to the fact that the applied magnetic pressure is inversely proportional to the
square of the electrode’s width (Laplace effect), and the rise time associated with each device is
fixed and cannot be easily changed. In addition, due to strong electromagnetic perturbations, the
use of electronic devices (pressure gauges in the samples, ultra-high-speed camera) can also be
problematic.
