166 MESSRS. A. V. HILL AND W. HARTREE ON THE

We see from these experiments that the work done by a muscle in shortening
rapidly when suddenly unloaded is less than the potential energy it contains, and
considerably less for large loads; moreover, Experiment 1 shows that, as the
rapidity of shortening diminishes (with increasing “equivalent mass”), so the
amount of work obtained increases. These facts confirm the theory discussed in
connection with fig. 7 above, and have a considerable bearing on the mechanics of
muscular contraction, as will be shown later.

There seems, therefore, to be little doubt that the theory employed to explain the
thermal effects of loading and unloading, as shown in figs. 1—5, is correct.

(5) Appiication To PHysroLoGicaAL PROBLEMS.

The importance of the phenomena described here can be discussed best under two
headings : (a) in relation to the heat-production of muscles, and (6) in relation to the
mechanics of muscular contraction.
