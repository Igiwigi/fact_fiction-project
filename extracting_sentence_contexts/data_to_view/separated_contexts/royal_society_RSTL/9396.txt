But, as the strength of the
induction shocks was only slightly more than minimal, the exhaustion consequent on
every strong contraction 80 far diminished the irritability of the tissue that when,
during the process of relaxation, another shock gf the same intensity was thrown in, the
stimulus was only strong enough, in relation to the diminished irritability of the partly
recovered tissue, to cause a feeble contraction. And these facts tend still further
to substantiate the hypothesis whereby I have sought to explain the phenomena
of artificial rhythm.

(3.) Upon the whole, then, I think that this hypothesis may be properly accepted
as a full explanation of the artificial rhythm; but whether or nob the hypothesis is thus
accepted, the facts which ib is adduced to account for remain as remarkable and signi-
ficant as they were before. That these facts are remarkable no one will dispute ; the
degree of their significance will depend on the degree in which the inferences I draw
from them appear to other physiologists of the same legitimate character as they appear
to myself. These inferences will perhaps be considered somewhat bold, as they
certainly must be considered premature ; and were it not that I think physiology may
gain, while it cannot lose, from healthy speculation on such facts as those which are
now before us, I should prefer to postpone for the present any further treatment of
this subject. Nevertheless, as all the experiments I have hitherto made tend, without
exception, to substantiate my views, ib will at leas be interesting to describe those
experiments in connexion with the theory which led to their being tried.
