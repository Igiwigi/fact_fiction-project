observations from Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP) with simulation results to demonstrate
that, during the 1-5 March 2013 event, chorus waves caused a relativistic electron flux increase
by more than one order of magnitude during the first 18h, while during the recovery phase the


coupled radial diffusion and the pitch angle scattering by EMIC waves and plasmaspheric hiss
controlled electron dynamics. Along the same line, Katsavrias et al. [80] suggested that during the
March 2013 intense storm the chorus-driven acceleration of relativistic electrons exceeded the Pc5-
driven losses. Finally, Kanekal et al. [81] indicated that the combined effects of local acceleration
and radial diffusion are even more complex during events with overlapping drives, as these
mechanisms act differently on population with different 4 and K values.

Regardless of which one is the dominant acceleration or loss mechanism, the fact that they
are not necessarily defined by geomagnetic activity adds more complexity to the response of the
outer belt. Schiller et al. [82] showed that during a period of weak geomagnetic disturbances there
was an enhancement of approximately 2.5 orders of magnitude for 0.6-1.3 MeV electrons in less
than 13h. Along the same line, Katsavrias et al. [83] showed that, during a period of continuously
positive Sym-H index, outward radial diffusion via ULF waves combined with magnetopause
shadowing resulted in a relativistic electron PSD dropout of two orders of magnitude.

6. Summary and discussion

After more than two decades of renewed interest and detailed research on the Earthâ€™s outer
radiation belt, its exact response to solar eruptions and to their subsequent interplanetary and
geospace disturbances is still under debate.
