For comparison, we show figure 4b the rupture-length L; distribution of the 1D model covering
the larger-b region than the one studied in [40], which just corresponds to the magnitude
distribution shown in figure 4a. The distribution in 1D exhibits an exponential behaviour for
a wider range of intermediate and larger events. In particular, such an exponential behaviour
seems to persist up to the maximum size. In that sense, region 3 of the 2D model seems to be
absent in 1D.

Related to this observation, the maximum rupture-length seems to be considerably longer in
1D than in 2D. If one operationally define here the maximum rupture-length L; max by the L,-value
whose frequency is of order 10° to the maximum frequency, it comes around L; max ~ 300 — 400
in 2D, whereas it is around L; max ~ 1000 — 1500 in 1D. The reason for this difference might
partly be due to the fact that the bc-values are different between in 2D and 1D, ie. be =37 in
2D versus b, = 19 in 1D, so that the same b-values may effectively have different meaning when
scaled by the corresponding b,-value: here L;max is an increasing function of b in the range
of b-values studied. The other reason, perhaps more important one, might be that, in 2D, the
rupture-length distribution in region 3 exhibits a clear downward behaviour which serves to
shorten the L;,max-value. Since region 3 corresponds to larger events where the anisotropy of
