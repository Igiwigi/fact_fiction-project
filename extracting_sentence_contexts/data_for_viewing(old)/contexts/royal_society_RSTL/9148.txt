£ ih in these experiments was in the case of an individual cut into eight segments, in such a
"w way as to leave one lithocyst in the middle of each arc, Four of the segments were

| then deprived of their lithocysts, and the paralyzed and unparalyzed segments were left
j in the same basin at a temperature of about 45* F, The water was changed once in
21 every twenty-four hours, and all the eight segments were perfectly healthy at the end of
the sixth day. Next night, however, the temperature rose, and in the morning of the

i seventh day all the segments were dead.
id I have dwelt thus at length upon the differences between the results yielded by Dr.
A Ener's experiments and those yielded by my own, because, although these differences
Py L refer to points that were of minor importance at the time when Dr. Engr published
E his paper—a fact which, doubtless, led this observyer, 80 well skilled in dealing with the
S great and peculiar difficulties that attend such an investigation of these and allied
S organisms, to neglect repeating these subordinate experiments a sufficient number of
{: times,—still it will shortly be seen that, at the stage which the inquiry has now
& reached, it is of great importance to be in possession of accurate and precise data with
E regard to the points which we have just been considering®,

S Perhaps, however, it is desirable to state that my own histological work was merely of a cursory nature, suffi-

7 plan, however, I deferred all systematic inquiry concerning the histological part of the subject till the more
4 important of the physiological experiments should haye been completed—not because I underrated the import-
