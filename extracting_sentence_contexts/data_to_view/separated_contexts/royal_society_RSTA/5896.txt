Some drawback of these methods
are the necessity of generating a model Hamiltonian beforehand, and the fact that grid-based
methods scale exponentially with the number of dimensions. Both limitations can be addressed
using another common representation of the nuclear wavepackets employing an expansion
in terms of time-dependent Gaussian functions [25-33]. This representation has the strong
advantage that it avoids evaluation of the Hamiltonian integrals over multi-dimensional grid
by using Gaussian integration when possible, or by using a local approximation motivated by the
fact that Gaussian functions have a limited spatial extension. This approach is particularly useful
for on-the-fly simulation of molecular systems for which the potential energy surfaces are not
known analytically (see for instance the integralsâ€™ approximations described in [34-36]). However,
a severe drawback of the Gaussian expansion is that Gaussian functions are not double-valued
functions.
