Neural dynamics in vitro cortical networks. (a) Simultaneous intracellular recordings from two neurons in organotypic cortical slices in response to a single
electrical stimulus at t = 0 ms. The polysynaptic activity in both neurons provides a measure of the recurrent neural network activity. The fact that both neurons fire
with a high probability within specific time windows across trials (overlaid traces) demonstrates the reproducibility of the network dynamics and the presence of
temporal information. Data shown consist of 20 superimposed traces obtained from the red and blue neuron (adapted from Buonomano [48]). (6) (i) Simultaneous
recordings from several L-IV neurons using calcium imaging shows stimulation-induced spatio-temporal patterns of network activity generated as a result of internal
dynamics of the network. Light microscope image of a somatosensory thalamocortical slice preparation.
