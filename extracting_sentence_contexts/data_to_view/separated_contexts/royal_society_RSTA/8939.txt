We now expand the generating function. On well-known principles we
can assert that the coefficient of a‘ in the expansion is the homogeneous product-sum
of order k of unity, and of the whole of the a, 8, y, ... products which occur in the
denominator factors of the generating function. The elements, of which we must
form homogeneous product sums are, in fact, ,

because we have before us the well-known symmetric function formula

of weights one to infinity.
