This philosopher discovered that a wire conducting an electric current was,
during the interyal of transmission, in a state of magnetic induction. Such a
discovery, at such a time, was most fortunate ; and not on this point only, but
on various others, it excited the attention of all the most distinguished philo-
sophers of Europe. The number of interesting facts which were thus elicited
will always form a prominent feature in the scientific history of the nineteenth
century, but the greater part of them are unconnected with the present inquiry;
I shall therefore only refer to one or two, which have an important bearing
upon the question under investigation. As 80on as I was informed of this
interesting discovery, I was anxious, by experiments as nearly similar, as cir-
cumstances would admit, to those I had adopted with the iron ball, to elicit in
this case also the laws which govern the reciprocal action of the wire and the
needle; and after a pretty long series of experiments I arrived at this conclu-
810Nn, Viz.—

*'That the force of each particle in the wire on each particle of the needle
varies inyersely as the square of the distance, and that the nature of the force
is tangential, that is, such as would place a needle, neutralized from the earth's
magnetism, always at right angles to the direction of the wire, and to the
direction of the line joining the needle with the centre of action of the wire.”
This law, with an account of the experiments from which it was derived, was
read to the Royal Society, May 22nd, 1822, and was afterwards published in
the second edition of my Essay above referred to. While I was thus engaged in endeayouring to elicit the law of action be-
tween the wire and the needle, M.
