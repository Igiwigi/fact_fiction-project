as the remains of transverse walls in the trachew,* a view which he ha
abandoned in favour of the true explanation.+
The arrangement of the cells, two or three of which are often placed ir
above one another (see fig. 44) is quite inconsistent with the former view, ยฅ
negatived by the fact that no such transverse markings are seen in a tangentis
It is important to notice that the radial cells in question do not, as a}
continuous radial series, and thus differ from the true medullary rays, ยง
present in Sphenophyllum insigne. (Compare Plate 83, fig. 44, with Plate 8:
It must, however, be pointed out that the absence of continuous medulla:
not constant even in S. plurifoliatum. In the outer layers of the second,
continuous radial tracts of parenchyma, sometimes several cells in breadth, mak
appearance. (See Plate 75, photograph 22.)
The description given so far applies more especially to that part of the seo
wood which is formed between the angles of the primary xylem; we may term
of the wood interfuscicular, using this term for the tissue formed betweert
protoxylem-groups, in contradistinction to that which is formed opposite t
the latter the term fascicular wood will be used. 4
The fascicular wood is sharply distinguished from the interfascicular, as ge
transverse sections. (See Plate 75, photographs 19, 20, and 21; Plate 83,
This is due in the first place to the much smaller dimensions of the fascicula
The secondary wood is necessarily thinnest opposite the prominent angle
primary xylem, for the general outline of the wood becomes circular as
secondary growth is established. The number, both of tangential and radia
however, usually greater in the fascicular region, so the reduced size of the
here is easily explained.
