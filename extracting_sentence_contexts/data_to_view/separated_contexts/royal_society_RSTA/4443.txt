On the other hand, when the system under study is represented
by a very disordered state, that is when all the p;-values oscillate around the same value we
obtain H ~ 1, whereas F ~ 0. One can state that the general FIM behaviour of the present discrete
version (equation (2.4)) is opposite to that of the Shannon entropy, except for periodic motions
[22,23]. The local sensitivity of FIM for discrete PDFs is reflected in the fact that the specific
‘i-ordering’ of the discrete values p; must be seriously taken into account in evaluating the
sum in equation (2.4). This point was extensively discussed by Rosso and co-workers [22,23] in
previous works. The summands can be regarded as a kind of ‘distance’ between two contiguous
probabilities.
