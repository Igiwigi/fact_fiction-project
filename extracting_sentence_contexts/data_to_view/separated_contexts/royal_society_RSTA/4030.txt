was, however, published after my paper had been sent to press, and I was therefore
ignorant of his elegant results. Expressed in the notation which I have adopted, his
method is as follows. Tt is evident from the expression of the function {(s, a, ) as an asymptotic limit,
that its importance lies in the fact that it is a solution of the difference equation

f(a+a)—f(a)=—*,

when s has any value, real or complex. [From this result we see at once that we
should expect that, when s is a positive integer, the simple ¢ function should be sub-
“stantially a derivative of the gamma function, and when s is a negative integer, a
SBernoullian function.] Now when X(s)>1, the simplest solution of our difference
epmation is evidently
