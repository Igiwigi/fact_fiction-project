is the force per unit volume at each place tending to accelerate the motion of the
matter, whilst

é (E+ ! [-B))

is the force tending to accelerate the motion of the element of electricity e.

The electrical terms in the first of these results are consistent with those obtained
by Larmor* and others, but the magnetic terms, which are in fact analogous with
the electrical terms depending on the dielectric polarisation, are fundamentally
different from those obtained by these authors. Further, since
