mals is considerably under the influence of the nervous sys-
tem ; but what is the nature of the connection between them ?
whether is the brain directly or indirectly necessary to the
production of heat? these are questions to which no answers
can be given, except such as are purely hypothetical. At
present we must be content with the knowledge of the insu-
lated fact: future observations may, perhaps, enable us to
refer it to s0me more general principle.

We have evidence, that, when the brain ceases to exercise
its functions, although those of the heart and lungs continue
to be performed, the animal loses the power of generating
heat. It would, however, be absurd to argue from this fact,
that the chemical changes of the blood in the lungs are in no
way necessary to the production of heat, since we know of no
instance in which it continues to take place after respiration
has ceased.

It must be owned, that this part of physiology still presents
an ample field for investigation.

Of opinions sanctioned by the names of BLack, LAPLACE,
Lavols1ER, and CRAWFORD, it-is proper to speak with caution

acid is eyolved, the inspirations are much diminished in frequency, and the blood in
