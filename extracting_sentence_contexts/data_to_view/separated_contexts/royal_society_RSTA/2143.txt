Thus the value of « is not bounded and there is instability. Hence we
have the result :-—

TueorrEM XXXIV (K):—Every natural motion of a holonomic conservative system
which is a natural motion under no forces (or, more generally, which takes place along a
geodesic of the manifold of configurations) is unstable in the kinematical sense, provided
that the velocity does not vanish for any finite value of t.

The motion of a sleeping top is a natural motion under no forces. It is therefore
unstable in the kinematical sense, a fact intuitively obvious when we sarin an
increase of spin without moving the axis. Another interesting case is that of steady motion in which all the curvatures except
the first vanish. Considering only a conservative system, we have from (7.661)
