The Jones polynomial emerged from a mysterious background of mathematics
and physics and seemed to fit into no general framework. But shortly afterwards,
Witten showed how to interpret the Jones polynomial in terms of a quantum field

heory in three dimensions (Witten 1989). In fact, this relation between knot invariants and particles goes to the very
yeginning of relativistic quantum field theory as developed by Feynman and
others in the 1940s. The basic idea is that, if we think of a classical particle
moving in space-time, it will move in the direction of increasing time. However,
within quantum theory the rules are more flexible.
