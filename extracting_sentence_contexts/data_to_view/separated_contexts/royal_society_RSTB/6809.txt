4, THE SKULL

The skull of Palaeospondylus is invariably preserved so that the ventral or more
rarely the dorsal surface is uppermost on the rock: a specimen preserved in lateral
view has never been found. This provides very strong evidence that the skull was
dorso-ventrally compressed in life. In the majority of specimens very little displace-
ment of the individual elements of the skull is found; in fact so rare is displacement
that great difficulty is usually experienced in determining whether certain structures
are fused or merely articulated with one another. However, in three instances con-
siderable dislocation has taken place, and these specimens, R.S.M. 1893-68-3
(figure 10, plate 22), R.S.M. A. (unnumbered), (figure 12, plate 23), I.C.S. 1171,
proved invaluable for interpreting the morphology of the skull. Dean (1900) also figures
a dislocated skull (his figure 4, plate 1).
