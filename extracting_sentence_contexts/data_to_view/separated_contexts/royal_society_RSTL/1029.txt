And, what renders the experiment still more strik-
ing, the diameter of the bore of my musket is exactly the same
as that of a common musket, except only in that part of it
where it joins the chamber, in which part it is just 80 much
contracted that the bullet which is next to the powder may
stick fast in it. I ought to add, that though the bullets are of
the common size, and are consequently considerably less in
diameter than the bore, means are used which effectually pre- $
vent the loss of force by windage; and to this last circumstance
it is doubtless owing, in a great measure, that the charge ap-
pears to exert 80 great a force in propelling the bullets. That the conical form of the lower part of the bore, where
it unites with 'the chamber, has a considerable share in pro-
ducing this extraordinary effect, is however very certain, as I

have found by experiments made with a view merely to ascer-
tain that fact. I will finish this paper by a computation, which will show
that the force of the elastic fluid generated in the combustion
of gunpowder, enormous as it is, may. be satisfactorily ac-
counted for upon the supposition that its force depends solely
on the elasticity of watery vapour, or steam. It has been shown by a variety of experiments made in Eng-
land, and in other countries, and lately by a well conducted
set of experiments made in France by M. pe BETANncouR, and
published in Paris under the auspices of the Royal Academy
of Sciences, in the year 1790, that the elasticity of steam is
doubled by every addition of temperature equal to go degrees
of FAHRENHEIT's thermometer.
