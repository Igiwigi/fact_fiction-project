be produced in a specific temporal pattern [13,17,18] and
paying attention to the position of the nut on the anvil, the
orientation of the stone with respect to the nut, the trajectory
of the strike with respect to the nut, the kinetic energy of the
strike and the control of the stone at the end of the strike
[19,20]. Perhaps this set of requirements explains why cracking
nuts with a hammer is rare, despite the high nutritional value
of nuts (see ยง3b).

Stone tool use! in chimpanzees, inferred over 150 years
ago (cited in [9]), was considered as induced by captivity
and proximity with humans until several types of tool use
were observed in the wild [21]. In fact, chimpanzees possess
extensive tool sets and the tool set of each population reflects
adaptation to local ecological conditions and cultural differ-
ences [22-24]. Chimpanzees use tools for foraging, as well
as in social and symbolic contexts [23]. Tool use in captive
capuchins was first mentioned in the sixteenth century in
chronicles of the first scientific expeditions in the New
World and its variety and flexibility thoroughly studied in
the past century (for a review, see [18]). However, only in
the present millennium has habitual tool use in wild capuchin
populations been reported, indicating that different popu-
lations have different tool repertoires and that tool use
occurs in foraging and social contexts [25,26]. To date, tool
