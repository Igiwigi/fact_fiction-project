This mutation
involved a slight increase in the size of the head correlated with the abortion of the
wing rudiments. According to Grassi, in Leucotermes lucifugus and Calotermes
flavicollis there are four moults in the ontogeny of the soldiers and workers, while
the sexual forms pass through five moults. This fact affords additional support to
my contention that the saris castes are to be regarded as modified nymphs.

a The true worker is readily distinguishable from worker-like forms by the reduction

& or total absence of the eyes, and by the further increase in the size and degree of

â€˜, chitinisation of the head and mandibles. In its general morphological features the

2 worker is clearly a less modified form than the soldier. Whether the former is
phylogenetically the older type or not is uncertain.
