Nevertheless, several physical contexts have been found where TN
are an exact description of the ground states of gauge-invariant Hamiltonians (e.g. 2D toric code
that is an Ising gauge theory) [31]. More recently, this framework has been successfully applied
to LGT-related problems. In fact, TN represent microscopically the local Hilbert spaces and at
the same time are tailored on a real-space wave function representation, so they can be used to
describe real-space locality and local symmetries altogether [32-35]. As previously mentioned, TN is naturally free from the sign problem [36]. In fact, for one-
dimensional systems a number of successful studies have demonstrated the power of TN for
HEP problems [37-39] and lattice gauge theory calculations [40-46].
