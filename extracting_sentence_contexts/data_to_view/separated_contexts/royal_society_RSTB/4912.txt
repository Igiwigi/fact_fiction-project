The midrib may be absent
or may be present at the base of the leaflets, or for a variable distance along them. If the leaflet lies in the matrix with the lower side uppermost, the midrib will be clearly
seen, but if the upper side only is exposed the midrib may appear much less conspicuous. Tn such circumstances, the fact that we have only recognised one form-species of leaf
does not rule out the possibility of its original connection with two genera. But some further considerations have come to light. In the preparation of cuticles
of these leaves it is found that, while some specimens seem to have had a firm texture
