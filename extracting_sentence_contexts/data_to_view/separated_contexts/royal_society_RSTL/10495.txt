The following (& 5-16) is a summary of the results stated in the paper referred
to above as © Part I.,” illustrated by figures taken from that paper.

$5. The firs effects of loading are in many cases somewhab uncertain. This may
be ascribed to the fact that continuous portions of any sample of wire differ more or
less in thermoelectric quality, and the yielding which occurs during the first loading
is apt to make some variation in the precise position along the wire of the hot
junetion. On the whole, however, the experiments agree in showing that the first
effect, of loading an annealed iron wire is negative; that is to say, if there is no current
before the load is applied, the effect of a moderate amount of load is to make a current
flow from the unstressed to the stressed portion of the wire through the hot junetion. MAGNETISATION ON THE THERMOELECTRIC QUALITY OF IRON. 363

This is in agreement with observations published as long ago as 1856 by Sir W.
