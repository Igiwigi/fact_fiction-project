The general conclusion to be drawn from the two tables is quite plain. There is
a very decided correlation between ancestor and offspring, which fluctuates,
according as the relative genetic constitutions of the clones are more or less obscured
by environmental modifications, but which shows no diminution as the scale of
ancestry is ascended, This is specially well brought out by the summary Table IV,
giving the mean coefficients for the different orders.

It is clear, therefore, that the 57 original ancestors belonged to a number of
different biotypes which have reproduced their characteristics generation after
generation, so far as they were not obscured by environmental modifications (if these
had been absent the correlation must have been unity in each generation). Genetic
variation has not been detectable, as is shown by the fact that individuals do not
resemble their parents any more closely than they do their great-great-grandparents.
The characteristics of the individuals of each generation are determined, apart from

environment, solely by the characteristics of the genotype of their clone, and not in
any way by the individual characteristics of the parent or any other particular
ancestor. The results are therefore in complete accord with the views of inheritance
in mixed populations upheld by JoHannsEn.

There is another method by which we can determine whether there was any
inheritance of intraclonal variation. The material for this is provided by the fact
that two lines were bred from each clone, so that in each generation a pair of
members of each clone was selected for parentage. We can see therefore whether
