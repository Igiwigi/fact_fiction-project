This is due to the fact that the measurement in the basis {|i), |j), |k)} represents a joint measurement
of the three projectors P;, Pj, Pr, with Py = |a)a|, « =i,j,k. We may call the above perspectives,
respectively, the ‘observable perspective’ (OP) and the ‘effect perspective’ (EP). In EP, we
are interested in the value assignment to effects of a measurements, independently of which
measurement the same effect appears in, e.g. the assignment of {0,1} to the effect |i)(i|,
independently of which basis |i) belongs to. In OP, we are interested in the assignment of a value
to observables, independently of which joint measurement they belong to, e.g. the assignment of
a value to P;, independently of whether it is measured together with P; or Py.

The equivalence of these two perspectives is due to the fact that the KS theorem is discussed
in the context of sharp measurements. This is no longer true if the measurements we are
considering are unsharp. The discussion of unsharp measurement is necessary for the connection
of KS-type contradictions with experimental tests. In fact, due to practical limitations and
unavoidable experimental imperfections any actual implementation of a quantum measurement
will correspond to an unsharp measurement.


In the next section, we will discuss how to connect the above notions to experimental
procedures involved in tests of quantum contextuality, by providing an operational interpretation
of them, and what are the corresponding physical assumptions.

3. Experimental tests of the Kochen—Specker-type contradictions

In the above formulation of the KS theorem, we used terms such as projector, orthogonal vector,
commuting operators and so on. In order to design an experimental test, each of these abstract
