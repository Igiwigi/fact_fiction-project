In the case of the Isopod Asecllus
Z(Vax BEeNEDEN) the 8egmentation is entirely similar to one of the forms observed in
=Menilla, the nuclei multiplying to the number of eight, and the vitellus then dividing
Sat once into eight spheres. In view of the total dissimilarity of the adult forms, this
Wdentity in segmentation is a striking instance of the independence of the yolk-
Scleavage from the adult strueture; and it would be clear, from this case alone, that
-Sthe particular form of the s8egmentation may be wholly determined by secondary or
:Zadaptive causes. E This fact is rendered especially conspicuous from the astonishing amount of variation
Shown in the Renilla 8egmentation. This variation concerns nob only 8mall details,
Sbut also features which are usually held to be characteristic of quite different types of
Edevelopment. Hence we can see how readily the form of segmentation might be
Eacted on by natural selection, for advantageous variations would certainly tend to be
#preserved and harmful ones destroyed.
