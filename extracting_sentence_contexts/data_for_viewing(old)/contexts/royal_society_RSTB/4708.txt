lower down, through the foramen magnum,

The exoccipital bone does not yet reach the supraoccipital (fig. 6), and the whole
of the margin of the foramen magnum is cartilaginous ; the lower extremity of the
paroccipital process is still unossified (fig. 6, po). There is no separate foramen for
the hypoglossal nerve in either X, Y or Z, but the nerve issues through the foramen
lacerum posterius, together with the vagus-glossopharyngeus group ; HonigMann
finds the same in his earlier foetus of Megaptera (20, p. 82).

The two occipital condyles of Skull X, as already noted in the previous section of
the paper, are feebly differentiated, and are relatively wider apart than they are in
later stages of growth (cf. figs. 2, 6); and they do not extend so high up the sides
of the foramen magnum. Except for the fact that they project. to a small extent
only, they present the appearance that one associates with the condyles of the
mammalian skull generally. In Skull Z, however, the two condyles have already
character: a character due to the fact that the
curvature of the two condyles, taken together, is that of a hemisphere.
