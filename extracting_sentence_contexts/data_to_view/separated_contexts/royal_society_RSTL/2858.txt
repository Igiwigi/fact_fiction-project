7. the main
battery circuit is likewise completed, and the primary current will flow in the direc-
tion I., II., TTI., IV.; while the extra circuit, although apparently connected, as in
fig. 6, with the zinc, is in fact connected with the copper, as in fig. 5, by means of the
main battery connection, and will convey the extra current from the iron through the
electrolyte to the copper, and from the copper through the galvanometer back again
to the iron in the direction 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. It will be seen that the two currents coincide in their direction in that part of their
circuits which is common to both, viz.
