help in one particular way. Increases in fecundity differ in
their demographic consequences from increasing one recipi-
ent’s survival. The number of new individuals competing for
local resources can potentially become much higher when
current fecundity is increased, but we hesitate to state that
the effects on demography are strongest with fecundity effects
in general: depending on the system, adults helping each other
might create such substantial lifespan improvements that could
lead to particularly slow turnover in demographic processes.
All this remains underexplored.

Third, our current theoretical understanding of ‘who
helps whony’ is poor. The fact that offspring are the recipient
of help (which then is modelled as a fecundity-benefit for the
parent) is probably based on nonlinearities in fitness curves
of the type presented by Whitlock et al. [78], or based on
asymmetries in reproductive value and social value of the
type presented in Rodrigues & Gardner [80]. But as the
curves, reproductive value, and social value change with
age, and effects of help in general are not invariant with
respect to time if a social group experiences demographic
changes [32], it appears that the field could very usefully
work towards integrating ontogenetically determined asym-
metries with analyses of selection to improve a partner’s
fecundity or survival. We therefore hope that conclusions
