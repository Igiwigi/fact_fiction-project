It may therefore be considered that the method is 80 far complete in detail that ib
may be with adyantage described for publication, notwithstanding that it is manifestly
capable of improvement,

At an early stage of the inquiry ib was found necessary to devise 8ome convenient
method of examining solutions of salts, and ascertaining the best material from which
to form electrodes,

On @ method of photographing spark spectra of the elements with solutions of their
compounds.

In the examination of 8ubstances for the purpose of chemical analysis it is un-
desirable to use metallic electrodes even when, this is possible, owing to the fact
that alloys are nob generally of a homogeneous character, and the sparks pass from
only one or two spots situated at the surface of the electrodes. A better means of
Judging of the composition of a mass, whatever be its dimensions, is afforded by
80lutions, because the amount of metal volatiliszed by the spark from mere points of
the 8ubstance is exceedingly small—according to Messrs. LockYER and ROBERTS not
more than 00001 gram. (* Studies in Spectrum Analysis,” LockKyER, p. 226). Messrs.
Parry and TouokER (* Engineering,” vol. xxvii., pp. 127, 429 ; and xxviil., p. 141) in
the examination of iron and s8teel have made use of the charcoal points firsb used
by BuxsgN, and by dispensing with a Leyden-jar have photographed the lines
characteristic of metallic solutions in 8uch a manner as to render them comparatively
free from the air spectrum. This method does not appear satisfactory to me, because a
prolonged exposure is necessary, and with the reduced density of the spark, fluted
