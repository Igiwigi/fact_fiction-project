The error in setting the axis normal to the surfaces was estimated not
to exceed 5 minutes of are. As the cylinders could be tilted more than this without
increasing the readings, there was no reason to suppose that the setting was not
sufficiently accurate, even when taking readings to 0°°0001 per mm. This conclusion
is all the more reasonable in view of the fact that readings concordant within about
0°°001 per mm. have been obtained by a number of different workers for the optical
rotations of sodium light in thin plates of quartz, set to axis by the rougher methods
generally in use. 5. The temperature was maintained at 20° C. by means of a generous flow of water
at constant temperature.
