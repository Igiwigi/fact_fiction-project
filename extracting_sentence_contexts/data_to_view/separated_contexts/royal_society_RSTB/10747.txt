Although Kikuchi & Pfennig briefly discuss learning in their section
‘Unexplained Phenomena’, here we have advocated an additional explanation for imperfect mimicry based on the receiver's need to make decisions while
learning how to differentiate mimics from models.

eye-of-the beholder imperfect mimicry is an anthropocentric projection adaptive peak at perfect mimicry to relevant

developmental and perfect mimicry cannot be achieved (or is only achieved at cost) No opportunity to improve imperfect mimicry
genetic constraints (or adaptive peak at imperfect mimicry)
chase-away models evolve away from their mimics leaving a ‘phenotypic gap’ non-equilibrium dynamics
telaxed selection the same level of protection afforded whether the mimic is perfect selection neutral beyond certain point (a
or imperfect plateau)
mimetic breakdown mimicry is no longer beneficial due to paucity of models or absence No selection, or selection away from mimicry
of predators
perceptual exploitation the imperfect mimic has more of an effect on receiver than a adaptive peak at imperfect mimicry
perfect mimic
satyric mimicry a chimera with mixed signals confuses the receiver even more than adaptive peak at imperfect mimicry
a perfect mimic, at least when rare
multiple models mimics evolve a ‘jack of all trades’ appearance somewhere between adaptive peak at imperfect mimicry
several models to maximize their protection
multiple predators imperfect mimics face selection to dupe generalist predators while adaptive peak at imperfect mimicry

kin selection while individual selection favours perfect mimicry, imperfect mimicry adaptive peak at imperfect mimicry
can be selected if it better protects others with the same trait
character displacement competition displaces phenotypic optimum away from perfect adaptive peak at imperfect mimicry
