SUCH are the means by which the frame of the more perfect animal is formed into
a whole, and the function of sympathy and its other more complicated functions
above enumerated effected. A powerful connexion is establisghed among all parts of
each of the systems into which the functions arrange themselves, depending on each
being regulated by a leading power which influences every part of the system to which
it belongs, and in its turn is influenced by every part of it : and these systems them-
selves are intimately related in consequence of the neryous, the leading power in the
vital s8ystem, by means of the control which the sensorial power exercises over it,
being employed in the accomplishment of many of the sensitive functions, and the
Sensorial power, the leading power in the sensitive system, in one of the most im-
portant. of the vital functions; by both systems not only depending for the main-
tenance of their organs on the same powers, but more or less directly on each other;
by the powers common to both systems being under the influence of the leading prin-
ciples of both ; and by all affections of whatever part, whether original or sympa-
thetic, necessarily influencing both its sensitive and vital nerves, and consequently
the central organs of the system to which they belong. FROM the whole of the facts referred to in the preceding paper, the great outline
of the laws which regulate the functions of the more perfect animal is derived. The
parts of which it consists, from the complicated nature of the subject, being very
numerous, it is necessary, in order to place it in a clear point of view, concisely to
recapitulate them; and as in the preceding paper, I commenced with the more

simple, and was, by their intimate connexion with the more complicated powers, led
to them ; I shall in the recapitulation, that they may be viewed in both directions,
begin with the more complicated, which by the same means will lead us to the more
sImple powers. BESIDE the mechanical powers, of which the living animal evidently partakes in
common with inanimate nature, it possesses, we have seen, four distinet powers, ap-
parently peculiar to itself, having no direct dependence on each other, but each de-
pending on the other three, for the maintenance of its organs; the sensorial, the
nervous and the muscular powers, and the powers of the living blood.
