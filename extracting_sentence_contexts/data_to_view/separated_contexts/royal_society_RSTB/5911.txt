This separation accentuates the open condition of the anterior end of the
fissure of Sylvius. The anterior limits of the poles do not reach as far forward as the
tips of the frontal caps; almost the whole of the under surface of the frontal lobe is
visible ; the temporal pole fails in any way to hide the orbital sulci which are clearly
marked on the left side, and thus it is probable that the anterior perforated space was
considerably exposed. The fact that the anterior limit of the poles does not reach
as far forward as the tip of the frontal cap disposes of the question whether the frontal
cap in the higher apes is in any way homologous with the frontal cap in man—the so-
called frontal cap of Broca. The examination of a series of anthropoid brains using BropMann’s cortical areas
as criteria for homology shows that the tip of the temporal pole lies in the same trans-
verse plane as the frontal cap or in some cases actually anterior to it. BropMann’s
charts show that this level is the place where his areas 4 and 6 occupy the cap.
