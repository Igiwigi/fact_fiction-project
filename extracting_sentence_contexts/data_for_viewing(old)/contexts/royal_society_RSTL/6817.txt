we have
S(m, n, p)=2mnp,
S(m?, n) =n([m] +M),
Sm?) =I[mP+M(m—2).

37. In confirmation of the formula S(1, m?)=[mP+M, it is to be remarked that
we take through the line 1 an arbitrary plane, this meets the curve mz in m points, ar
Joining these two and two together we haye 4[m]? lines, each of them meeting the cur
m twice and also meeting the line 1; that is, the lines in question are generating lin«
of the scroll S(1, m?). The line 1 is, as already mentioned, an (h=)(4[m]*+M)tup!
line on the scroll; the section by the arbitrary plane is therefore the line 1 take
(4[mPF+M) times, together with the before-mentioned 4[m] lines ; that is, the order «
the surface is [m]+M, as it should be. This is in fact the mode in which the orde
of the scroll S(1, mm?) was originally obtained by Dr. SALMON.

38. As regards the formula S(n?)=3[mP+M(m—2), suppose that the curve m is
(7p, 9) curve on the hyperboloid, we have as before m=p+g, M==—pg, and the formul

becomes
S(m)=3[p+gF-pap+ga—2),
=FI[p]ÞP+I[2}Þ,

which is
