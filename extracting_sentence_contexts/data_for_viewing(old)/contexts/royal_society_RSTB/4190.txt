are closed by a coating of vaseline, while the intercellular spaces are connected with
the outer air by cutting the lamina into strips. In this way the well-known fact of
transpiration in saturated air was demonstrated, and a rough method of correcting
transpiration for varying hygrometric conditions was pointed out. This method has
been used throughout my work.

The transpiration of a greased and slit leaf has also been used for investigating the
direct effect of light on transpiration.* The intensity of the light was not measured,
the plants being simply exposed to a north, or in some cases east, light of the same
varying character as that of the ordinary porometer experiments. It was found that
with the laurel (P. lawrocerasus) the direct effect of light varied much, the average
being Light/Dark = 132/100, with ivy Light/Dark = 136/100. In order to get a
convenient approximate number, I have assumed that the direct effect of light for
ivy and for laurel is to introduce a factor 133/100, or 1°33,
