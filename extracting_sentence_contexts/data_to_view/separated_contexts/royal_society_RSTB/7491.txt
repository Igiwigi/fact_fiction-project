The
modified catalyst reacting with Y, at a rate proportional to Y, restores the catalyst but not
the morphogen_X, by the reactions V+ Y> W, W-+C+-H, of which the latter is assumed
instantaneous. It should be emphasized that the reactions here described are by no means those which
are most likely to give rise to instability in nature. The choice of the reactions to be discussed
was dictated entirely by the fact that it was desirable that the argument be easy to follow. More plausible reaction systems are described in ยง 10. Unstable equilibrium is not, of course, a condition which occurs very naturally.
