If
the remagnetization process is not quasi-static, there is no universal expression for the distribution
function W. Actually, one has to solve a kinetic equation in order to construct this function. The
fact is that such an equation in general form has not been derived yet.

However, in the case when external and effective anisotropy fields are much weaker than [3

It is written here using the operator of infinitesimal rotation J, =e x 0/de. Without a doubt,
the assumed constancy of the length of the antiferromagnetic vector does not mean that its
orientation kinetics is described by Brown’s equation.
