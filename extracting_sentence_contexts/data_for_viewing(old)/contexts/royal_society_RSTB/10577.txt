used the term ‘tokenization’ to refer to the process by which ‘types’
of perceptual feature (e.g. colour and orientation) are bound together
to create perceptual ‘tokens’ (visual objects)—cf. Zimmer and Ecker
[51]. Theirs is a model of visual attention, (visual) working
memory, and the attentional blink [52], and is not intended to
address the semantic type—episodic token distinction as used here.
