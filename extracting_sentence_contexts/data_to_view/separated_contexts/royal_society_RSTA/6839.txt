These winds ultimately spread over the
whole of the North Sea, and though they varied appreciably in strength from time to time,
they remained at gale force until noon of 1 February and even longer in the lower half
of the North Sea. From wind records available, the gale was quite abnormally severe,
particularly in the northern areas of the British Isles. Eastward-travelling depressions approaching the north of Scotland do not generally
veer into the North Sea, tending rather to pass over Scandinavia, and it is a significant
fact that the last storm surge which caused serious flooding in the Thames, on 6 and
7 January 1928, was associated with a similar incursion of a deep depression into the
North Sea. J. R.
