Using the
proposed PostP technique (figure 11b) we were able to clean the classification in a more effective
way than with a standard technique (figure 12a).

With the plain COS classifier, as for the previous dataset, we needed to reverse the classification : 7

in order to produce meaningful results (figure 12b). If we apply the proposed PreP pre-processing : 3s
method to the hypercube, we can remarkably increase the performance of the classifier, as shown 1
in figure 13a, so that there is no need to reverse the classification and its performance is better : EY
than that of the other classifier tested. In fact, the COS method equipped with the proposed : 3
pre-processing method is producing a more natural plume shape than the one produced by any [3
other classification technique tested. So the pre-processing technique allows us to transform a :8
known failing classification method into what appears to be an extremely successful classification 8
algorithm. We observe that the numerical range of the COS classification of the raw hypercube :&

spans approximately the interval 0.92 and 0.94, while that of the pre-processed hypercube is
between 0 and 0.5.
