important additional thermodynamic and energetic information that is usually lost in the
infinite-system limit. Therefore, it would seem wiser to focus on understanding better the
fluctuations of thermostatistical variables in finite systems, such as those of virial quantities on
the r.h.s. of equation (2.6), instead of discarding finite-system thermodynamics on purely habitual
grounds [27]. Dogmatic insistence on the thermodynamic limit N —> oo is about as useful as
insisting on the Newtonian limit, corresponding to speed of light c — ov, in relativity. In both
cases, things may become simpler, but one is missing out on relevant physics.

(iii) Clausius relation and Carnot efficiency

Campisi [9] showed recently that the inverse Gibbs temperature Tg! appears naturally as the
integrating factor in the Clausius relation for virtually all practically relevant physical systems.
This corroborates the fact that the Gibbs temperature Tg should be identified with the absolute
thermodynamic temperature T, unless one is willing to abandon the Clausius relation. Moreover,
the non-negativity of the Gibbs temperature directly implies that Carnot efficiencies cannot
exceed 1.

(iv) Thermodynamic potentials can be ‘non-local’

It is sometimes argued that the Gibbs entropy cannot be the ‘correct’ thermodynamic entropy as it
is based on the integrated phase-space volume @, which is a ‘non-local’ quantity that arises from
a summation over states in an extended energy range. This argument might appear superficially
appealing but it is ill-founded for (at least) two reasons. First, the microcanonical averages
appearing in equations (2.5) and (2.6) are computed purely locally on the energy surface in
phase space. Yet, the Stokes theorem implies that they can be related to the enclosed phase-space
