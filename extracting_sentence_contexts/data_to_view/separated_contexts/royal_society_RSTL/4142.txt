But to account for the different conditions which determine the number and

character of the bands, and the limits of thickness, as well as which of the two
arrangements before described, will produce them, it is necessary to consider more
precisely the relative refractions of the plate and medium, or the amount and direc-
tion of the retardation ; and it is found that on such considerations we obtain an
expression which includes these conditions ;—the difference of sign corresponding to
the 40 arrangements: while it assigns the number of bands which will be formed be-
tween any two given rays, or throughout the whole spectrum, with a given thickness
of the plate. (13.) In the comparison of theory and observation, the broad facts,—that bands
will be produced in the respective cases by the one or the other arrangement,—as
well as their general character, —show an entire agreement with theory. The more precise comparison of the number of bands formed throughout the
spectrum, or within certain definite spaces of it, though in some cases unayoidably
imperfect from the difficulty of distinguishing the bands, yet upon the whole gives
accordances as good as perhaps can be expected. (14.)
