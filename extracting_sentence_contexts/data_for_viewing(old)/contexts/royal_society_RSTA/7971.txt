that whereas no true peroxide is formed at any stage in the cycle, a certain amount
of “ oxidizing agent,’ to which KI is sensitive, is present in the gases at the end of
the exhaust stroke, and at the beginning of the inlet stroke. The experience gained
during the present work suggests that the experimental arrangements were hardly
suitable for obtaining precise results ; for one thing, the valve operated over too
large a crank angle.

The view that the initial combustion product of certain fuels may take the form of
a “ peroxide,” and that high local concentrations of such a compound in the last por-
tion of the engine gases to burn, may constitute or produce the reaction centres which
propagate the enhanced combustion characterizing “ knock,” has certain attractive
features. In support of this theory, reactions with potassium iodide have been
observed during combustion experiments by several workers,} but in view of the fact
that potassium iodide reacts with many substances other than ‘‘ peroxides,” the pre-
sence of these latter compounds has not yet been proved. On the other hand, Bone,
in his extensive researches on combustion of hydrocarbons, has never detected the
occurrence of peroxides by the titanous reagent prior to the aldehyde stage, and
insists that combustion proceeds according to the “ hydroxylation ’’ theory, and not
by any process of “‘ peroxidation.”

The uncertainty regarding the nature of the early stages of combustion in a petrol
engine led the authors to attempt a more detailed investigation into the matter
than had previously been effected. To this end apparatus was constructed whereby
samples of the cylinder gases could be extracted at various points during the cycle,
and analysed, not only for initial and terminal components, but also, by special
