this form a plexus of nerve cells at the hinder surface of the oesophagus which I illustrated
by photograph (1940, plate 41, figure 4). These also run to the dilator musculature.

From the most anterior part of the nerve ring, that is, between the right and left supra-
oesophageal ganglia, and just dorsal to the point where the labral connective makes its

junction, there arise three nervesâ€”one median and two lateral (figures 15 and 16). The latter
are stouter than the middle nerve and run directly forwards to end in an ovoid ganglion,
referred to by Sewell (1926, p. 323) as the optic ganglion. Sewell states that he was unable
to trace the nerves forward from the ganglia to the eye, which according to Gruvel (1905,
p. 408) is a single mass, presumably median. I agree with Sewell. There is no trace of
a median pigmented eye, and the nerves appear to end at the ganglia. Each so-called
ganglion contains two large conspicuous cells, a fact which although he does not mention
it, it is clear from his text-figure 18 that Sewell also observed.

The small median nerve runs forward on a sheet of tissue but in a tortuous manner, and
not straight forward as do the lateral nerves. In its twistings it gives off various branches,
until at the edge of the sheet there occurs a distinct, but small, ovoid structure also con-
taining two relatively large cells. This does not appear to represent the end of the nerve as
it continues its ramifications after the swelling has been reached (figure 15).

I suggest that of these three nerves the two lateral represent the lateral constituent of the
tripartite nauplius eye. The median represents the median constituent, together with the
frontal nerve, such as occurs in ostracods.
