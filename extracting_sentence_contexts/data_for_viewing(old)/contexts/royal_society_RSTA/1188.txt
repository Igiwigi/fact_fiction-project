plight of Desdemona, which orbits between the larger moons Cressida and Portia. Using orbital
data from the Hubble Space Telescope [6], Cressida’s 47:46 outer Lindblad resonance falls at
62 657.4km, whereas Portia’s 13:12 inner corotation eccentricity resonance falls at 62 667.1 km.
Desdemona orbits uncomfortably within this 9.7km gap, at a=62658.4km. In isolation, either
resonance could be stable, but the juxtaposition of the two is not. Configurations such as this
are the reason that the system appears to be chaotic over remarkably short time scales of
approximately 10° years [4,7,8].

In addition to the above, there is one exact resonance in the system. Perdita is locked into
Belinda’s 44:43 outer corotation eccentricity resonance [2,3,6]. However, the best-fit analytic
description of Perdita’s motion reveals a libration amplitude of 200°—a physical impossibility,
because libration cannot exceed 180°. Further analysis proceeds, but the implication of a large
libration is that Perdita is barely inside the resonance. It may, in fact, straddle the separatrix
that defines the boundary in phase space between resonance and near-resonance. Such a result
provides further, albeit preliminary, evidence for chaotic motion, perhaps on time scales much
shorter than the approximately 10° years discussed previously.


Between the Portia group and the innermost classical satellite, Miranda, lie two additional
moons, Puck and Mab. Puck is the largest of the inner moons, with a resolved diameter
of approximately 160km in the Voyager images. Tiny Mab is closely associated with the
ring, a broad, faint dust ring discovered in Hubble images [3]. This ring occupies much of
the orbital space between Puck and Miranda, but has a distinct peak at Mab’s orbit. This
association clearly suggests a relationship between the ring and moon; most likely, the
ring comprises fine dust that has been ejected from Mab’s surface. The w ring has another
