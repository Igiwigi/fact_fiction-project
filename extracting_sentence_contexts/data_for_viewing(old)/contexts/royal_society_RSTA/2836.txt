When these sections all vanish, each p(x) is (up to reordering) of the form

Zy [3

where each A, is of the form (3.2). But the form of Ay forces Zz); = Z2; =0 for each | € X, so each
p(x) is in fact block diagonal (up to reordering), of the form discussed in remark 3.7. Hence these
sections have no common zeros. a
