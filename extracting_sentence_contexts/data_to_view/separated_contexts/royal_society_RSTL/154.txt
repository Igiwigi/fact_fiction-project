'S Movers chemistry, notwithstanding its rapid advancement

J during the few last years, still presents to its cultivators several |
Z interesting objects, both of analytic and synthetic inquiry.

= Among the former, the decomposition of the muriatic and of
Z. certain other acids, holds a distinguished place; for our curio- |
{2 sity respecting the nature of these bodies, is strongly excited, ]
Z by the influence which the discovery would have on the general |
3 doctrines of chemical science, as well as on the explanation of

3 individual facts. The theory of the formation of acids, for ex-

EZ ample, one of the most important parts of the new system of

E chemistry, must be regarded as incomplete, and liable to sub-

V version, till the individual acids now alluded to have been

S resolyed into their constituent principles. To the best of my

E knowledge, however, we are not in possession of a single fact

a that gives the smallest insight into the constitution of the

muriatic acid; and the attempts to effect its analysis, can only
therefore be directed by the analogy of the decomposition of
other bodies, which, from similarity of character, are arranged
in the same class,

One of the first objects, in the analysis of a compound body,

$should be its complete separation from all other substances,
which, by their presence, may tend to introduce uncertainty
into the results of the processes that are employed. But it is
seldom that a simplicity so desirable can be attained in the ob-
jects of chemical research ; for, agreeably to a known law of
affinity, the last portions of any substance are separated with

D peculiar difficulty ; the force of attraction appearing to increase,
a as we recede from the point of saturation.
