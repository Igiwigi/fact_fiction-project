During
such tests the uteri were kept under inspection and no peristaltic or antiperistaltic
movements were observed. The length of tube traversed by the sperms was about:
seven centimetres, a distance that would be covered by the straight-away swimming
of a rabbit sperm in a little less than twenty-five minutes. The fact that it required
about two hours to cover this distance is consistent with the observation that sperms
do not swim straight ahead, but with great irregularity, and that what has been called in
this paper their rate of diffusion may reasonably be expected to be much less than their
rate of individual locomotion. In consequence of these results I agree with MarsHaL
(1922, p. 174) in his second assumption, that sperms ascend the uterus of the rabbit as
individuals by their own locomotion and not by other means. This conclusion is
consistent with the observations of Lim and Cao (1926, 1927), who by a surgical opera-
tion reversed a segment of the rabbit uterus without, however, inhibiting pregnancy.
