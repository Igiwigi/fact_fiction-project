‘density. The investigation is in continuation of a previous one,* in which Carbon
Dioxide, Air, and Hydrogen were the subjects of a similar enquiry over low ranges of
Gensity. It appeared to me desirable to extend the observations more especially in
he case of carbon dioxide, because of the extended knowledge we already possess of
hs isothermals, and the fact that its critical temperature is within convenient reach.
Sther physical properties of the gas have also received much attention of recent
Bears. It is also readily procured in a nearly pure state.

Such that liquid is present at the lower temperature ; and in the other, to a junction

% in satisfactory agreement with the record of the old. It reveals, however, the fact

at the linear nature of the variation of the specific heat with density, deduced from
“the former results, is not truly applicable over the new, much more extended range of
Sbservation. For convenience the chart at the end of this paper embraces the former
zesults, and the present paper is extended to include the entire results on the variation
St specific heat with density where the range of temperature, obtaining at each
Experiment, is approximately the same: that from air temperature to 100° C.

& Part ILI. of this investigation will contain an account of experiments on the varia-
on of the specific heat with temperature when the density is kept constant. The
Glivision is for convenience of reference.
