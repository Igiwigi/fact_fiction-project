In (a), incorporation into 8-cell stage pre-implantation
Mouse embryos is done by aggregation, typically referred to as ‘morula aggregation’. In this assay, contribution to lineage is based on 3D position, but should be complemented
with co-immunostaining to establish at least partial molecular identity. EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; FACS, fluorescence activated cell sorting; H2B, histone H2B;
NLS, nuclear localization signal. In (b), incorporation is achieved through microinjection of cells into the blastocoel of early blastocysts, followed by implantation and analysis of
the conceptus, typically at embryonic day (E) 9.5. In this assay, contribution is based on expression of a fluorescent reporter in the placenta.
