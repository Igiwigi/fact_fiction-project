The increased
time scale which is thus provided can be of considerable value. An example of two
records obtained at Olveston with this instrument is included in fig. 4, and it will be
seen that the distance between the successive lines of the spiral has been much reduced
in comparison with that in the other instruments, from 3-0 to 0-7 mm., by altering the
diameter of the driving rollers which provide the lateral movement of the clock. It
will be seen that the deflected trace described by the pen during an earthquake has a
slight wavering appearance, and this is due in some measure to the fact that the hour
spindle of the clock does not move smoothly, but in jerks as a consequence of the
escapement mechanism. Itâ€™should be noticed that the recording is unaffected by the
closeness of the lines. In some circumstances it might be of great advantage to have
recording of this type, either for obtaining a more extended time scale as in the present
instance, or alternatively, using the more usual time scale, to provide an instrument in
which the record needs to be changed only once in 4 or 5 days.
