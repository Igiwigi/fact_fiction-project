Kosti¢ [2, pp. 80-81] gives an example of
explanation using Watts & Strogatz’s [3] small-world graph model and the
spread of infectious disease. In topological explanation, the explanatory relation (the relation between the explanans

and explanandum) stands between a physical fact or a property and a topological prop-

erty. In the Watts & Strogatz [3] example, we have seen that the explanation of the
physical fact is a function of the system topology, i.e. in this example, small-world
topology shortens the path lengths between the whole neighbourhoods, and neigh-
bourhoods of neighbourhoods and in that way the infectious disease can spread
much more rapidly. These types of examples push towards regarding network models as explana-
tory of physical facts in ways that do not fit with taking explanations to provide
information about causal dynamical or mechanistic interactions. THE ROYAL SOCIETY
