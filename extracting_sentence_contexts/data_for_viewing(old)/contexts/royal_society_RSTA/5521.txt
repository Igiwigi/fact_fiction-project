evolution of machine and humans. In both cases resulting in an augmentation that in turn can be
further augmented through symbioses.

A corollary to this outcome is there is no longer the fear of machines taking the upper hand
on humans, of an AI potentially working against humans or at the very least making human
intelligence irrelevant. The convergence points to a symbiosis that, however, will not necessarily
be of the commensalism type. It may turn out to be of a mutualism type, where both machines
and humans benefit.

6. Conclusion

The scenarios presented in this paper are in some ways unexpected. As such, they may also be
perceived with scepticism and concern. The very fact that machines may benefit from humans
could scare many people. Yet, as we provide machines with self-learning capabilities and with
goals of continuous improvement, it is only natural that machines will benefit from their
interaction with us and from their existence in an ecosystem where we are both ‘living’.

As shown in figure 1, machines feed on

— Sensors, embedded sensors, wireless sensors, sensors networks

— Actuators, MEMS, smart materials, optogenetics

— Communications support, mesh networks, self-creating networks, 5G, 6G and beyond
