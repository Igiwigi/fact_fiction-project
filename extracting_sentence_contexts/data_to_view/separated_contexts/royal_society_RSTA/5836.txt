flux densities, this fact emerges from the adiabatic decomposition, where the main contributions
to the flux are represented by the ground state elements. Finally, in figure 82,b, we show the probability and translational probability densities for the
electronic case. They excellently reproduce the functions derived from the coupled calculation,
see figure 3.
