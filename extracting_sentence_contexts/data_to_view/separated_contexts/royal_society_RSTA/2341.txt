Furthermore, also in these cases, studies with isotopic variants could help to shed light on the
dependence on internal excitations. There is another challenge which applies more to the ion—atom merged beams studies than the
DR measurements. Given the fact that there is often a large difference in mass between H} and
the collision partner, the Hy beam usually would have a rather low kinetic energy to be able to
match the velocities of both beams. This leads to problems with the ion beam orbit inside the CSR,
since the Earth’s magnetic field will disturb the trajectories of light- and low-energy ion beams. While storage of H} at 300 keV, for example, is straightforward, already storage at 60 keV energy
(which can be provided by the smaller ion source platform) may lead to much shorter ion beam
lifetimes.
