cannot be the inducement ; that the emigration of the winter
birds is less complete than that of the others (the spring mi-
grators) ; that some species breed here, especially the wild-
duck and wood-pigeon ; that the redwings and fieldfares are
the most regular and uniform in their appearance and disap-
pearance, and most probably never risk the trial of incubation
here ;* that they quit the country temporarily in severe and
long continued frost through want of food, and return to it
again at the approach of more temperate weather ; that the
arrival of water-birds forebodes the approach of intense frost,
the usual return of the winter-birds, a thaw ; that examina-
tions of the latter prove them to have taken long flights be-
fore their return, and sets the fact of temporary migration
beyond the reach of doubt.

I have then made a digression, and introduced some obser-
vations on the singing of birds ; and in a third part, given
some additional particulars respecting the different sizes of
the generative organs of birds, as they appear at different
seasons of the year.

* I must be understood by the word « here,” to mean that part of Gloucester-
shire under my own obseryation,
