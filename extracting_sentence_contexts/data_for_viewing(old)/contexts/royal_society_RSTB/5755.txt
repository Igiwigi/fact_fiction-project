was accepted for use in making up the solution into one containing 0-9 per cent. of
glucose and 6 per cent. of borax, as required by the quicker method. The results
obtained agreed very well with those given by the method of removing glucose by
means of yeast. The difference between the glucose estimations by the different
methods might have been due to the presence of laevo-rotatory substances or of
optically inactive reducing compounds. If compounds were present which were
laevo-rotatory and non-fermentable, these would have given an unmistakable
negative reading after the yeast treatment. In the portions which were treated with
. yeast, zero polarimeter readings were obtained after the yeast treatment, while the
results of the copper reduction tests were negligible, as shown in the table. It appears,
therefore, that the higher results by the SHarrer and HarrmMann method must
have been due to optically inactive reducing compounds, which are formed from the
glucose during the sterilization of the alkaline medium. This follows from the fact that
while the glucose used in the experiment was a pure sample giving concordant analytical
