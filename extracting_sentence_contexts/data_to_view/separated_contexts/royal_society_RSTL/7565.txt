nodes; it is therefore a wnicursal sextic; this 8uggests the theorem that the sextic surface
is also wnicursal, viz, that the coordinates are expresible rationally in terms of two
parameters ; I have found that this is in fact the case. In doing this there is no loss
of generality in supposing that a=b=c=1; and assuming that this is $0, and putting
als» —1+h=k, 1+h=h,, and therefore 2h=k+hk,, we have

A=—3kh,
B=— khw—(t+k,),
C=— B=—2+(k+k)(vy—20),
D= 3z(22y—zw). The equation of the sextic surface being, as before,
AD*+4AC+4BD—3BC*—6ABCD=0,
1 say that this equation is satisfied on writing therein
