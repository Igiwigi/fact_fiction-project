ABEL ON FIRED GUNPOWDER.

would have been predicted from the comparatively small proportion borne by the
oxidising agent to the oxidisable constituents in the mining powder. It will be seen presently that the experiments with mining powder presented
other features of great interest in addition to those elicited by the chemical
examination of the products of explosion. In concluding our observations on these,
we 8hould point out that fresh confirmation is afforded by this experiment of the fact
insisted upon by us, namely, that hyposulphite must be classed among the invariable*
products of explosion of gunpowder in closed 8paces. An examination of the three complete series of results obtained by the explosion of
