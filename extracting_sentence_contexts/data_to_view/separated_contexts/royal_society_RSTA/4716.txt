contradicting the assumption that guy isa homomorphism. Hence .%, cannot be embedded as a

This result demonstrates the power of the functorial viewpoint; recall that the individual
algebras 4 (M, J) and ,(M, J) are isomorphic for all 4,4 € R. Thus, the distinction between the
theories lies in the fact that there is no way of choosing such isomorphisms in a natural way. In
this sense, the physics represented by a theory is encoded in its functorial structure.

4. Local physical content and dynamical locality

We turn to the description of the local physical content of a theory .&/ : Loc — Phys, in a causally
convex region O of space-time M (there seems to be no obstruction to generalizing the
background category if desired).
