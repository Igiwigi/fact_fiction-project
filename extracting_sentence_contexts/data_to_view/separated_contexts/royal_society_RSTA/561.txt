This relationship and how it is
represented in climate models also needs further attention before we can fully assess the role of
the vegetation feedback in West Africa during the Holocene.

5. Conclusion

The comparison of the SW cloud and vegetation feedbacks across PMIP simulations for the LGM
and the MH clearly shows that the SW cloud feedback is one of the major sources of uncertainty
between model results. This factor was fully discussed by Yoshimori et al. [11] for the LGM,
together with the fact that half of the models produce a negative feedback at the LGM, whereas
it is a positive feedback for future climate [4,6]. Here we show that the different model properties
for the LGM SW cloud feedback also hold for the MH when analysing the annual mean cycle
of this feedback at the scale of the NH. In most models the SW cloud feedback counteracts the
effect of the ice-sheet forcing at the LGM and of the insolation forcing at the MH.
