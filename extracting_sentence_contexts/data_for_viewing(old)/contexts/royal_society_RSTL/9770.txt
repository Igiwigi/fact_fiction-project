(IV.) Ezamination of the method of the five-plate induction balance.

The theoretical accuracy of this method rests on the asumption that the distance
between the plates may be considered small in comparison with their diameter.
When this condition is not sufficiently considered, it is easy to see tha it is not
likely that correct results will in all cages be obtained, for 8uppose that in lieu of the
plate of glass a thin sheet of metal of considerable 8ize is interposed between the
fourth and fifth plates of the balance, it ought to be needful to withdraw the fifth
plate by an amount equal to the thickness of the sheet. One can apprehend that it
will be actually necessary to push it in, but to an extent which it would not be easy
to calculate.

Some doubt is also thrown upon the practical accuracy of the method by the fact
that Mr. Gorpox has arrived at the very unexpected result that the specific inductive
capacities of glasses change with the lapse of time,

In order to satisfy myself on the point I had a rough model of a five-plate induction
balance made, The instrument is far too rough to give minutely accurate results if
the method were good, but I believe it is sufficient to 8how rapidly that it cannot be
used with safety. The insulation was not perfect, and no attempt was made to
enclose the instrument, or shield the connexions from casual inductive action, The
Plates are all 4 millims. thick ; they are, as in Mr, Gorpox's apparatus, 6 and 4 inches
diameter, Each plate is 8uspended in a yertical plane by two rods and hooks from
