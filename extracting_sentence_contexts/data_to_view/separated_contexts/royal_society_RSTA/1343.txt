The in-material radius r extends by A~”, since it is perpendicular to the director. The cone angle ¢ is then
given by y = arcsin A’. These facts are encoded in the cone deformation y, (r) in the text. (b) Two circular director patterns
separated by a bisecting straight-line interface (red line). The actuated state is two cones meeting together with the same
height. (c—e) 2D symmetric pattern and their actuated configurations. The centres of cones (black dots) form square, triangular
and hexagonal lattices. (Online version in colour.)

hexagon; see figure 4, last of (c), (d) and (e) respectively.
