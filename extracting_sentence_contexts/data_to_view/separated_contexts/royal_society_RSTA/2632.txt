They are scattered mainly in
the topmost soil and arrive in massive numbers on the detector. The lead walls used in the MURAVES hodoscopes will act as ‘minimum muon energy’
selectors, with a turn-on point of ~1 GeV. In fact, our final deployment will consist of four (not
three) XY layers, with the fourth layer sitting behind a 60 cm thick lead wall (figure 12) used as an
antiveto counter. We plan to install three 1 m? muon hodoscopes inside the containers (figure 13). A fourth slot (with its accompanying lead block) will be used for special calibration runs with the
hodoscopes pointing away from Vesuvius towards the open sky.
