is remarkable that in this respect his data were much more nearly correct than those
subsequently obtained by Hirer, whose mistaken conclusions, afterwards rectified
by Zunvz, Lorwy, Bour, and Barcrorr, made it for long very difficult to form a
coherent theory of mountain sickness.

Paut Brrr concluded that all the symptoms of mountain sickness are simply
those of want of oxygen ; but several subsequent observers have questioned this con-
clusion, and attributed the symptoms to other causes, in whole or part. Mosso, for
instance, has supposed that lack of carbon dioxide (“acapnia”) isa cause of many of
the symptoms, and Kronecker has even invoked mechanical factors as a cause. We
hardly think it necessary to refer in detail to these theories, which are undoubtedly
incorrect. A full and very clear discussion of them by Zunrz and his co-workers has
recently been published.t It will also be seen in the sequel that every new fact recorded
by us is in harmony with JourDANET's and Pau Bert's explanation.

+ The experiments were made in presence of a high percentage of COs, and Brrr was not aware of the
influence of this CO, in averting death from want of oxygen.
