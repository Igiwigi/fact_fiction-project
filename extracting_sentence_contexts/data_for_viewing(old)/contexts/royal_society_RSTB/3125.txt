984 PROFESSOR H. H. W. PEARSON:

The external characters of the female flower are well known, and its morphology
has been the subject of much discussion.* The flower consists of an axial ortho-
tropous ovule surrounded by two envelopes, which arise in acropetal succession,
I have no new facts bearing upon the homologies of these envelopes; they are
conveniently designated as “ perianth” and “ integument ” respectively.

The perianth first appears as a ring round the base of the ovular cone; at first
equally developed all round, it early commences a more rapid growth at two opposite

next appears as an equal ring; it eventually becomes slightly and unequally lobed
in the antero-posterior plane, each lobe being further incised. The perianth quickly
overtops the integument (ef: figs. 20A, 25) and maintains its advantage until the
