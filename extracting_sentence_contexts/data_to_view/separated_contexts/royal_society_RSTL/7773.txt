But starting from D, the tangent at this
point besides intersects the curye in (z—2) points, each of which is a position of c; and
from each of these drawing a tangent cBa to the curve, we have the curye © consist-
ing of these (y—2)(X—3) tangents, not passing through D, but intersecting the given
curye in the three classes of points c, B, a, viz. the number of intersections at each point
cis =X—3, at each point B it is =2, and each point @ it is =1; and we have thus
the equation

(1=3—#) +2(6—%=—%)+(X—3)(b—-Þ—Þ")=0,
where the numbers (4, 3, '), (c,, yo, y,), (b, Þ, ') refer to the correspondences (D, a),
(D, B), and (D, c) (or what is the same thing (a, B)) respectively.
28. Correspondence (a, B). We have
P=X—2, P=2—2,
and thence
b=a+X—4+2A
=—37—3X+2z,

which is the s0lution : the value obtained above was b=1+z, and we in fact have iden-
tically
i+z=—37—3X +2. It was in this manner that I originally applied the principle of correspondence to inves-
— tigating the number of inflections of a curve, regarding, however, the term x as a special

s0lution ; it is better to put the cusp and inflection on the same footing as above.

[ Since b—8—PB'=24A, we have here

| e=>y—#/=(X—6)A,

Q y=7=(X—2)(a—8),

jE e=2(KX—2)(x—3)+(X—6)(—2x—2X+2+8)
- =—2X*+8X+8x7+(X—6)E;
S this is in fact=2r+(X—3)z, viz. we have
5 2r=X*—X +80—3t
i (X—3)z=(X—3)(—3X+8)=—3X*+9X +(X—3)z,
Z and therefore

S viz. the united points (a, c) are the 27 points of contact of the double tangents, and the
S z cusps each (X—3) times in respect of the (X—3) tangents from it to the curve.
