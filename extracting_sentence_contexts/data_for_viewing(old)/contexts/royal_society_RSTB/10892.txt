and the success of contact tracing is, like all Ebola interven-
tions, determined by the extent to which communities trust
and give accurate information to those attempting to curb
the outbreak [123].

One proxy indicator as to the success of contact tracing is
the proportion of new confirmed cases who were already
being monitored as contacts of known, existing Ebola cases.
These contacts can then be followed up with temperature
checks for the 21 day incubation period and receive prompt
isolation if diagnosed with Ebola, thereby improving treat-
ment outcomes and reducing exposure to further potential
contacts. In fact, modelling from early in the outbreak in
Sierra Leone and Liberia identified that contact tracing
(with prompt isolation and infection control) could have a
more substantive effect on the epidemic than even potentially
curative medical therapies [124]. Despite this, evidence from
Guinea and Sierra Leone suggested that contact tracing was
far from adequate at this time—as a result, few new cases
were from identified contacts and chains of transmission
proved stubbornly difficult to interrupt [119,125]. Alternative
approaches focusing on community-based early detection
over contact tracing proved more effective in simulations
based on epidemic data [126]. In contrast, the rapid public
health response to the various ‘tail end’ epidemics across
