S. M. 4. and
Fellow of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge. My LoxrD,

Read Jan. 24, Þ' TAKE theliberty of laying before
200g: your Lordſhip the following paper,
containing a variety of facts and experiments, which
I have endeavoured to apply to ſome Optical in-
quiries. Beſides the experiments originally contrived and
made by myſelf, I have repeated moſt of thoſe
which I have quoted from others. Sir Iſaac Newton, in his Optics, has ſhewn by

a ſeries of experiments, that the ſeveral differences
of colours, exhibited by thin tranſparent plates, are
occaſioned by their ſeveral thicknefles; and that
therefore the tranſparent parts of bodies do, ac-
cording to their different ſizes, refle& rays of one
colour and tranſmit thoſe of another; and conſe-
quently that the bigneſs of the component parti-
cles of natural bodies may be conjectured from
their colours; fince the particles of thoſe bodies
moſt probably exhibit the ſame colours as a plate
of


(x ]

of equal thickneſs, provided they have the ſame
denſity.
