THE BRAIN OF THE ABORIGINAL AUSTRALIAN 359

S.5.R. (Plate 19)—Again the sulcus paroccipitalis is broken up. The incisura
parieto-occipitalis (212) passes on to the dorsal surface and is bifurcated. The
horizontal sulcus immediately lateral to the incisura is all there is to represent the
horizontal element of the sulcus paroccipitalis. There is no sulcus occipitalis
transversus. It may be represented by the slight branching of the posterior end
of the sulcus identified as the horizontal element, or it may be in part included
in the medial operculum ; it is impossible to say. The sulcus parietalis transversus
is confluent with the pars horizontalis sulci intraparietalis. The arcus parieto-
occipitalis is not in any way elongated, in fact rather contracted, so that the question
as to whether dolichocephaly plays any part in the open condition of these sulci
must be ruled out. It seems more reasonable to attribute the condition seen in
these two hemispheres to lack of development of the parietal lobe.

Group 2

In this group the arcus parieto-occipitalis is well defined. The sulcus paroccipitalis is
broken and the cortex of the arcus parieto-occipitalis is continuous with that of the post-
parietal lobule either anteriorly or posteriorly. ‘There are two specimens included in
the group :—S.13.R. and Q.1487.R.

S.13.R. (Plate 27)—The posterior end of the sulcus paroccipitalis is buried on
