of this Survey cannot be forced into accordance with any astronomically determinec
facts of observation without a liability to introduce errors, arising from deflections of
the plumb-line in astronomical observations, which far exceed the errors ordinarily _
generated in the triangulation. Moreover, other errors would arise, more minute, but —
becoming very sensible in long distances, from the errors in the numerical elements of
the earth’s figure which were adopted as the basis of the geodetic calculations of
latitude, longitude, and. azimuth. If the triangulation were to be forced into
accordance with the astronomical determinations, it would become seriously distorted
in parts and unfitted for employment in further investigations of the figure of the
Earth. Thus, in the final reductions, the lengths of the base-lines and the geometrical
consistency of the angles were alone taken into consideration, the only astronomieally
determined elements which were employed being those which were adopted for
Kalianpur, the station of origin of the calculations.
