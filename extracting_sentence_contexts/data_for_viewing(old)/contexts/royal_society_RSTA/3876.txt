(f) Ice simulations including polygonization

The influence of polygonization on the final microstructures was tested by analysing a series of
simulations that include the ELLE polygonization subloop (i.e. experiments with suffix _N). These
models were carried out in both pure and simple shear deformation and with different amount
of recrystallization: 1, 10 and 20 DRX steps per deformation step, respectively (figure 11b,d/f).
When polygonization is active the differential stress reaches a steady state earlier than in the case
of the corresponding simulation without this routine (dashed lines in figure 8). Polygonization
does not affect the final strong LPO regardless the amount of DRX. This applies to both simple
and pure shear cases (figure 11a-d and e,f, respectively). The lack of influence of polygonization
is probably due to the fact that new grains have lattice orientations close to those of their parent
grains. However, the incorporation of the polygonization process, and therefore the development
