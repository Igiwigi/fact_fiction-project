Considering that the halving and quartering of the stomatal surface were done by
eye, the result is satisfactory.
But when we ask where lie the entrances of the streams of air indicated by the


TRANSPIRATION AND STOMATAL APERTURE. 417

outer arrows in fig, 1 which emerge inside the chamber, the answer is not clear. It
is certain, I think, that the stomatal surface of the leaf outside the porometer
provides ample inflow,* since cutting the leaf through close to the porometer chamber
does not seem to increase the rate of flow, and this ean only mean that the fall of the
column of water is ruled by the capacity for outflow and not by inflow. However
this may be, there remains the fact that the flow of the air is through intercellular
spaces. This raises the question whether or no these passages can be supposed to
vary in size under changing conditions. From what is known of the varying turgor
of leavest it does not seem impossible that this is so. In any case, the inter-
cellulars are huge passages in comparison with the stomata, which must, I think, be
held to be masters of the situation.{

A fault in the method used by me is that the illumination of the stomata within
the chamber is necessarily not so good as that of the rest of the leaf, or of the other
leaves on the branch, so that a comparison between the transpiration of the whole
branch and the porometer readings is not accurate. The plan followed by BaxtsÂ§
and by Miss Srer|| is free from this defect. In my experiments the leaf is supported
on a glass plate with the stomatal side upwards, the flange of the chamber pressing
