trary, a most important geological fact is established; namely that an area (twenty
miles in length and eighteen broad, and perhaps more, if the shelves on the banks
of the Spey be included in it) has been raised 1278 feet above the level of the sea,
£0 equably, that no deviation from the true curyature of the earth can be discovered
by the ordinary means of leveling ®.

Section X.—Speculations on the action of the elevatory forces, and conclusion.

If we choose to enter on speculative grounds and to reflect on the secondary means
which have cansed these equable moyements, two solutions occur. But first I must
remark that the crust of the earth seems to yield easily to the forces which have
acted on it from below ; when we observe a brick-wall dashed to pieces by a cannon
ball, or a pane of glass by a small stone, we say that both are fragile and yield
