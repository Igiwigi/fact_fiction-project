Dr. WAGNER gives 18° C. at
8 km., but his values for the centre of a cyclone depend on two ascents only. M. RykatcHEW gives much smaller differences, but the barometric heights are not
defined in either case, the tables being simply headed “ cyclonic” and “ anticyclonic.” About the actual fact there is no doubt; it was stated by M. TrrsszRENC DE Bort
long since. It would be of interest to know if the distinction is more pronounced in
England than on the Continent, but the question is somewhat involved. Cylones of

any depth are rare on the Continent, except perhaps at Hamburg and Pawlowsk, so
that the opportunities for studying it are not so good there as here.
