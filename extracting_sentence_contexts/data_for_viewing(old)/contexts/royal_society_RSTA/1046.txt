bonds within the single fibril family (inter-cross-

collagen, microstructure, cornea, keratoconus, is dependent on the degree of the cross-link and,
parametric analysis therefore, on the density and stiffness of the bonds.
We analyse the mechanical response of the system
according to the type of interlacing and on the
stiffness of fibres and bonds. Results show that the
weakening of transversal bonds is associated with a
marked increase of the deformability of the system.
In particular, the deterioration of transversal bonds
due to mechanical, chemical or enzymatic reasons
can justify the loss of stiffness of the stromal tissue
resulting in localized thinning and bulging typically
