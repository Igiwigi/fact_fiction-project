cleavage of eggs was examined in cultures made on about six different occasions,
and from living material. Molgula oculata was cultured at the same time to act as a
control.

In the first place it can be stated with all assurance that unequal cleavage in the
case of the first division is a rarity and equal division is as typical of the first two
cleavages as of any other ascidian egg. In the second place, the cleavage of the egg
as far as was followed, differs in no way from that described by ConKuin for Styela
and other forms, and the micromeres and macromeres of Lacaze-DuTHiers must have
been the four small relatively yolkless posterior blastomeres* and the more anterior
and yolkier blastomeres respectively, formed at the fourth cleavage. These may be
seen in fig. 17, and the pair derived from the vegetative hemisphere are those responsible
for the formation of tail muscle cells when the tadpole stage exists. There is, in fact,
no difference at this stage between these two species of Molgula, although they represent
the two types of development, also the developmental course so far is identical with
that deseribed by Conkuiw and Castie for other families and orders. So that as an
explanation or cause of the abbreviation of development, the course of early cleavage
may be eliminated, The cleavage of the eggs of Molgula retortiformis, Molgula arenata,
and Bostrichobranchus (Eugyra) pilularis was followed in cultures made at St. Andrews
and Woods Hole during the summer of 1927, and it was seen that as far as the 16-cell
stage at least, it was perfectly typical and took the course just described.

Gastrulation was observed in the case of Molgula occulta and Molgula retortiformis,
and while opacity of the eggs made it hard to follow, it seemed to be typical and similar
to that of Molgula oculata and Molgula citrina that were used for comparison in the two
