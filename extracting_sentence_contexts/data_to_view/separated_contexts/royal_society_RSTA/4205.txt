reading“at a third station and the corresponding temperature readings at each station,
give us all the data necessary for calculating the value of gravity at the third station. The necessity of observing the temperature arises from the fact that the rigidity
of fused quartz threads increases with increase of temperature. The effect is, of
course, complicated by the changes which take place in the dimensions of the threads. The nett result is that as the temperature rises the “stiffness” of the threads
increases.
