The first mention, s0 far as I am aware, of experiments in which the evo-
lution of heat from fluid friction is asserted, was in 1842 by M. Mayer, who states
that he has raised the temperature of water from 12* C. to 13? C., by agitating it,
without however indicating the quantity of force employed, or the precautions taken
to secure a correct result. In 1843 I announced the fact that © heat is evolved by
the passage of water through narrow tabes*#,” and that each degree of heat per 1b.
of water required for its evolution in this way a mechanical force represented by
