+ The development of a parotic ridge above the hyomandibular is apparently of little importance :
it is well developed in the larval Amiurus (Krvprep, 1919, p. 16), but is entirely wanting in the larval
Ictalurus, a closely related genus (RypER, 1887, p. 541). { For further notes on the parotie ridge in various fishes see ALLIs (1920—* Spheno-pterotic
ridge ”’),

§ The inward expansion of the labyrinth would also explain the fact that a portion of the auditory organ
is supported by the parachordal in some fishes. || Three septa are all fully chondrified in Acipenser, Polypterus, Amia, Lepidosteus, Clupea, Galaxias
Salmo, Gymnarchus, Amiurus, Sebastes, Pleuronectes and Solea ; in Anguilla, Syngnathus, Siphonostoma,
Gadus, Cyclopterus and Gasterosteus the anterior septum is absent at all stages of development.
