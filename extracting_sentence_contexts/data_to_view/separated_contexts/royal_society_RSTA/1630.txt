For instance, the high-frequency power
in the convection zone of the MURaM simulation is about two orders of magnitude larger than
that in the Bifrost simulation. In the latter one, the high-frequency power increases very steeply
in the photosphere, such that it becomes even bigger than in the MURaM simulation at about
800 km in height. Noteworthy is also the fact that the increase of the high-frequency power seems
to flatten for all models near 1000 km (the exception being the MURaM simulation, where the
flattening is less pronounced). The CO5BOLD simulation is the only one which shows a steady
increase of the high-frequency power, whereas the other models reveal local minima between 200
and 500 km. Given the significant differences in the power distribution between the various models, in
particular at high frequencies, caution is advised when using them for energy flux studies.

(b) Phase difference spectra between selected heights

We now turn our attention to the phase difference spectra between selected heights in the various
models, i.e. the measured dispersion relation between these heights.
