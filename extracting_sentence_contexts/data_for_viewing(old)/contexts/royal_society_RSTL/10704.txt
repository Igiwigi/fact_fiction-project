fontanelles (6g. 7) in ib; the main fontanelle is yery large and heart-shaped, the
front and side growths of the tegmen cranii being slight, The generalised occipito-
auditory bones leave the very limited and rounded tegmen tympani (t.ty.) soft ; in
front, the bony matter forms a good margin in front of the foramen ovale (fig. 8, V.).
Then more than half of the orbital walls are cartilaginous (0.s.), and in the middle of
each gpace is the rather mall optic fenestra (TT.).

The girdle-bone (fig. 8) is in rudiments right and left, and there is no mesethmoidal
hone. Each hony tract is composed of a large cochleate cranial part, separated by half
S its width from its fellow, and perforated by the orbito-nasal nerve, To this part there
AQ is a handle growing out at more than a right angle, and ending in an adze-shaped
S dilatation (fig. 8, pa.).
= The fact is that the arrest of the bone towards the middle—above and below—is
= accompanied with an overgrowth beyond the proper alz of this region, and the whole
= palatine tract, which has no ectostosis of its own, has become ossified from the ecto-
© ethmoidal, 80 that its three regions, ethmo-, pre-, and post-palatine, are all used up to
5 form the handle to this-curious © lateral ethmoid.” The well-developed roof and floor
2 of the naxal region (figs. 7 and 8) are entirely unossified ; there is a short prenasal (p.7.),
= the nostrils (e.n.) are almost tubular, and are defended by the normal valves (1.0.u./.).
E: Below, the internal nostrils (4.7) are very wide apart, because of the breadth of the 8nb-
S naxal lamine (fig. 8); these end in broad ear-shaped angles, outside, and near the
= middle haye small apiculate pro-rhinals ( p.y.),

S The pterygo-quadrate region is feeble, and the well-shaped, and distinetly-jointed
JF pedicles (pd.), are a long distance apart. The pterygoid-bone ( pg.) has not ossified
