experiment. 'A, represents a retort or bulb of pure gold, weighing about 6500
grains troy, and containing nearly ten cubic inches 'of air. B, is a tube also
of pure gold, which at its outer end is firmly united by a small gold collar to a
similar tube, C, of pure silver; the hore of the latter tube is larger than that
of the gold; but to prevent any undue influence from the unequal heating of
the air contained in them both, and to confine the operation entirely to the
gold bulb, the two tubes are plugged by wires" of the same metals, 80 as to
leave a yery minute crevice for the air to pass. The outer part of the tube C
is kept cool with a wet towel, to protect the stopcocks and flexible tube D.
The tube D completes the communication of the air bulb with the glass
reseryoir E, which is intended as a substitute for. an inconvenient length of

* These experiments only furnished me with one fact new to myself; namely, that cast iron acquires
a permanent increase of bulk by each successive heating ; for the cubic contents of the retort used,
as determined by the weight of pure mercury contained at the temperature of 80%, were as follows :
Before the first experiment... , 9.13 cubic inches.
Aﬀer the first fire ...... -. 9.64 ;
Afﬀter three fires 4.4 ves 10.16

And the augmentation, which is more remarkable, exceeds the dilatation due to the temperature to
which it was exposed; for as iron expands .0105 in 180 degrees, the increase of bulk upon 10 cubic
inches should be .105 X 3 = .315 at 1800® Faun., or near the melting point of silver : whence it
may be concluded that the dilatation of iron is not equable, as has been also proved by Messrs,
DvLoxG and Pzvre.
