by an amount which is approximately constant and equal to 300 units. If, however
the hydrogen atoms present in the same molecule be substituted in succession by
chlorine, it is evident from the comparisons given that the effect diminishes as the
number of chlorine atoms in the molecule increases.

The different values given by the two comparisons may partly be due to the fact
that the effect of the linkage of carbon atoms among themselves is different from
that of a carbon atom to an oxygen atom, and partly to the effect of the molecular
complexity of methyl alcohol.
