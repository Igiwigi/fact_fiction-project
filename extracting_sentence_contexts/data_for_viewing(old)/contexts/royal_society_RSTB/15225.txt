rents generated by hyobranchial movements (ie.
hydrodynamic transportation) to move the food in the oral
cavity. By contrast, salamanders that display a metamor-
phosed morphotype (i.e. salamanders that have undergone
a metamorphosis of their hyobranchial system) use con-
tact-based transportation where the tongue contacts the
food carrying it across their oral cavity (i.e. hyolingual trans-
port) on land. However, during aquatic feeding,
metamorphosed morphotypes may apply either contact-
based hyolingual or hydrodynamic transportation (or a mix-
ture of both). The fact that metamorphosed salamanders
may use a combination of hydrodynamic and _ contact-
based transport might be explained by the fact that the ton-
guesâ€™ adhesive system may not be sufficient to perform the
terrestrial contact-based transport of food in water. How-
ever, the post-metamorphic tongue can still push the food
and currents of water across the oral cavity in front of it.
Consequently, and contrary to findings regarding food
ingestion, both caudal and rostral hyolingual transport
seem to depend more firmly on feeding apparatus mor-
phology than on the surrounding medium. While our
observations seem to provide a clearer picture, future com-
parative kinematic studies are needed to corroborate our
predictions.
