decnssation. TI could discover no fibres that remained on the same ide, neither are
there any which traverse the chiasma from one nerve to the other without pas8ing on
into the brain ; neither does the commissura transversa HALLerr, which is stated by
Gorrscue * to be present behind the chiasma in Teleostei, appear to be present here.

With regard to the deep origin of the nerve (figs. 18 and 22), the principal part is
derived from the anterior end of the optic lobe, where the fibrils of origin occupy
nearly two-thirds of the width, comprising in fact the whole of the first, or external
layer. The fibrils appear to be derived from the cells mentioned in the deseription of
the lobe in question. In addition to this origin 8ome of the fibres are derived from
the hypoarium. Berroxcrt denies this origin, and is of opinion that bundles belonging
to the anterior and posterior commissura transversa have been credited to the chiasma
by mistake ; but, unfortunately for this idea of BgeLLoxG, these structures do not
exist in specimens of Plagiostomata that I have examined. My reason for including
the hypoarium as part of the origin of the optic nerve is this ; if very thin horizontal
s8ections of the chiasxma be examined at the point where its posterior margin abuts on
the hypoarium, several fibres are to be seen passing into ib, dispersing through that
body, and not returning into the chiasma, If they were simply passing through to
some other part they would retain their formation as bundles and would not separate
into single fibrille. I have not actually traced any of them into a cell, but, neyerthe-
