OF THE PARALLEL ROADS OF LOCHABER. 681

Althongh the data thus furnished by the position of the glaciated snrfaces and
erratic blocks are not numerous, still they are sufficient to lead to the conclusion that,
on the Ben Nevis range the ice-sheet may have extended to a height of from 3,000
to 3,500 feet ; and on the hills to the north of the Spean to a height of not less, and
possibly more, than 2,000 to 2,500 feet. The facts may seem somewhat conflicting,
but eonsidering the complicated movements that must have attended the growth of
the ice-sheet, they can hardly be otherwise until we have more precise data respecting
the direction of the strizz and the origin of the boulders (se Map, Plate 46).

For this great mantle of ice necessarily commenced with local glaciers descending
from every mountain range, and, as those of one group became confluent in the glens
of that group, they flowed into the wider intervening valleys, where they met with
the glaciers of other ranges. Here they would consequently become subject to much
mutual interference, causing deviation and deflections from their normal course into
lines altogether aberrant and dependant upon the relative mass and force of the con-
tributory glaciers. In the Alps at the present day the glaciers do not go beyond the
first local stage, being confined to the separate slopes of each mountain group, and
