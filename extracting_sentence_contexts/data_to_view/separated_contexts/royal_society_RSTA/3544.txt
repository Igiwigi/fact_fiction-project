Stated
otherwise, above 53 HRC the materials have reached a near-maximum degree of embrittlement. These data validate the capability and sensitivity of the experimental set-up to provoke,
detect and quantify HE even at low hardness levels, i.e. in the range of 35 HRC. The fact that
quenched and tempered steel with hardness as low 35 HRC begins to exhibits a small but
measurable degree of loss of fracture strength must be carefully considered in the context of the
experimental conditions. These results were obtained under extreme experimental conditions of
hydrogen concentration and stress applied in pure bending. The combination of these conditions
is outside the normal spectrum for bolted joint applications, and therefore not directly applicable
to mechanical fasteners without additional conversion and correlation, as will be discussed in the
following section.

(c) Quantifying hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility: NFSo,

The ratio ISL}.2v/FF expressed as NFS»1.2v is a normalized measure of the HE susceptibility
of the material, at a given concentration of hydrogen absorbed during the experiment, precisely
under an imposed cathodic potential of —1.20 V.
