wealth (or at least, income) and fertility in industrial settings
requires a broader understanding of how domestic labour,
and not just market labour, is allocated. More specifically,
the institutional incoherence apparent in many countries
means we should not be surprised to find a negative effect
of female labour market income on fertility. When the
demands of domestic labour fall mostly on women, time con-
straints alone may force women to choose between domestic
versus market labour [79,80].

The inability of Becker’s economic model to fully capture
relevant aspects of reproductive decision-making across
different cultures most likely reflects the fact that the model
is itself highly ‘culture-bound’ and limited to a specific time
and place, namely early post-war America. Indeed, Becker's

model builds in at its source many of the features of the clas-
sic nuclear post-war American family, including its particular
division of labour (where men are assumed to possess a rela-
tive advantage in the labour market) and stable long-term
unions; clearly these features are not universal. If we relax
these assumptions, then we can potentially account for at
least some of the cross-cultural variability we see. Yet, even
in the USA, Becker’s model does not always hold up. For
example, Musick ef al. [64] found that, contra Becker's
