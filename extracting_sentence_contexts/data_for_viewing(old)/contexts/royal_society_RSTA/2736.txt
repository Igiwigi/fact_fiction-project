due to their non-observability) while independently co-formulating vector analysis and Prof.
Henry Poynting’s energy-flux theorem. This impressive catalogue of achievements in the realms
of the electromagnetic theory was complemented by his many technical achievements in electrical
engineering practice. He also invented the coaxial cable, for which he was granted a patent.
He was responsible for the discovery of the necessary conditions required for ‘distortionless’
transmission of telegraph signals and invented the practical means by which this could be
achieved—perhaps among the most important of his achievements. This list is complemented
by the many improvements in practical telegraphic and telephonic systems he contributed over
his lifetime.

His achievements (with the correct attribution) are not well known, yet they are profound and
wide-reaching. The so-called ‘Maxwell Equations’ or ‘General Equations of the Electromagnetic
Field’ [1], as presented in every undergraduate physics textbook in the world are in fact in the
form presented first by Heaviside, in the language that he independently developed for the
purpose (alongside W. Gibbs, known for ‘Gibbs phenomena’ in Fourier theory). This ‘recasting’
alone is a major achievement, for which Heaviside was given credit by Heinrich Hertz [2].
Maxwell had published his two-volume work A treatise on electricity and magnetism in 1873 [3].
Heaviside first came across this seminal work as part of his ‘self-study’ regime while he was living

(his only paid work, which he left in 1873 at the age of 23 to concentrate on his studies). It was his
time in Newcastle that would influence his research interests for the rest of his life. It is the aim of
