4, of the octagonal lighthouse tower. The analysis of data from accelerometer 4 gives a similar
trend shifted towards the south.

The accelerations recorded for all vertical axes of the sensors are presented on figure 16, after
filtering with a high pass order 3 Butterworth filter cut-off at 1 Hz (the effect of gravity has been
offset by subtracting the mean value of their accelerations from all measurements). Accelerometer
a2 shows a significant effect of event 2, and a3 and a4 respond to event 1 of wavel.

RMS spectral density versus frequency analyses were also performed for the signals
corresponding to the vertical axes of the accelerometers, after filtering with a high pass order
3 Butterworth filter cut-off at 1 Hz. The first frequency peak of the structure (3.66 Hz) appeared
for all accelerometers except n°4 which showed however a first peak at 1.7 Hz. This effect is likely
to be related to the fact that this accelerometer is not attached to the masonry structure, in the
vertical direction.

(e) Determination of damping coefficient

A damping coefficient was determined by means of visual fitting to the acceleration data
(without filtering) of an exponential decay model (corresponding to searching for the logarithmic
decrement) considering only one mode of vibration, with the first frequency peaks determined
after §4e. Equation (3.1) is applied for Ag” if t> to” and for Aq’ if f> tot. The parameters ay, amb’
%, amb are the upper and lower bounds of ambient accelerations before the event, ay ‘ay are the
positive and negative scaling factors to fit to the starting point of the decay models, f; is the
frequency and ¢ is the damping coefficient (figure 17).
