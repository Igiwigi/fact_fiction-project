This seems to
show that the action of air, if it is driven through the screen,
is insensible,

Experiment 10,

Having placed a screen of coarse gauze above the pewter
plate at + inch distant, an excited needle of sealing-wax was
Substituted for that of brass. I observed the extent of the
oscillations, and then setting the plate of pewter in motion, I
was surprised to find that the returning arc (contrary to the
direction of the plate's motion) was almost invariably in-
creased, generally at the first, and almost constantly at the
second oscillation, and that the arc in the same direction was
diminished. f

So unexpected a result naturally induced me at first to
attribute it to some error in the observations ; but on repeat-
ing it many times, and having measured the greatest error
which the means I employed were susceptible of when used
even a little carelessly, I found that half a degree was the
greatest error I could make in reading off the oscillations, and
that this retrograde motion was in many cases equal to three,

four, or five degrees; so that the measure of the observed
fact was from four to eight. times the extent of the greatest
possible error of observation, even admitting it to take place
at both extremities. It is/true, I did not always observe this
retrograde motion ; but in twenty experiments the needle,
screen and plate, not being always at the same relative dis-
tances, I noticed it seventeen times.
