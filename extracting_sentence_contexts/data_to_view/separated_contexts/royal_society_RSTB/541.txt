per acre (= 22Â°4 kilog. per hectare); the amount has declined to less
than the average in the later years, and, coincidently with the continuous and
diminishing growth, the percentage of nitrogen in the surface soil has been
considerably reduced. The loss by the removal of even such small crops, together
with that by drainage, has, therefore, as a matter of fact, not been compensated by
free nitrogen brought into combination, either by the plants, or within the soil. QUESTION OF THE SOURCES OF THE NITROGEN OF VEGETATION. 105

agricultural crops, the percentage of nitrogen in the surface soil was also greatly
