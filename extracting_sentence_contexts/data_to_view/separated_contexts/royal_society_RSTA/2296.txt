The
mean volume of mercury withdrawn in four very concordant experiments was 30 c.mm.,
so that actual determinations carried out at this room temperature would have been
1 part in 20,000 toolow. The experiment was repeated at a room temperature of 16° C.,
when the volume of mercury withdrawn was only 10 c.mm. ‘The inference is that, at
the room temperatures obtaining in series 5, the correction would have been negligibly
small, and this is confirmed by the above-mentioned fact that differences of 2° C. in
this temperature region had no detectable influence on the results. It was unfortu-
nately impossible to make blank experiments at these lower temperatures, unless we
had waited for the winter. The error just discussed does not affect the first four series, where, after the hydrogen
residue had been admitted, and a rough adjustment made by running out mercury,
the ice in the baths was replenished before the final setting.
