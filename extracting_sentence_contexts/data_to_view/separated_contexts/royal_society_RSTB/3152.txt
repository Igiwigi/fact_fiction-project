ASSHETON ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE UNGULATE PLACENTA, AND

respects the character found in the sheep, more especially in the mode of destruction
of the uterine epithelium and in the close application of the trophoblast to the
maternal tissues (VERNHOUT (109) ). D.—Eptrome. The following facts are the chief additions made in this paper to our knowledge of
the morphology of the mammalian placenta :— .

1. An account of the development of the placenta of a ruminant (the sheep) which
is shown to occupy a position approximate to the deciduate type of placentation—

(a) The trophoblast shows a distinct tendency to form two layers which are
compared to the plasmoditrophoblast and cytotrophoblast of the deciduate
type.

(b) A destruction of the uterine epithelium takes place and no recovery is made
over certain areas till after parturition.

(c) A layer of foetal tissue (trophoblast) becomes applied to the maternal tissues
in the cotyledonary areas which has hitherto been believed to be uterine
epithelium,

(d) A direct protoplasmic connection is effected between foetal and maternal cells.

(e) Extravasated maternal blood forms lacune in which the shorter villi and
bases of the longer villi lie bathed, thus leading up to a condition
characteristic of the deciduate type.

(f) The foetus is restricted to the lower part of the uterus, while the upper parts
of the horns become specially active in secretion and even exhibit a general
destruction of tissue to form pabulum.

(g) At birth a large amount of foetal tissue is left within the uterus.

(h) The sheep, as regards its placentation, is partly deciduate, partly non-
deciduate, and partly contra-deciduate.

2. A revision of the terminology of placentas is proposed on the basis of the
behaviour of the trophoblast layer of the embryo.
