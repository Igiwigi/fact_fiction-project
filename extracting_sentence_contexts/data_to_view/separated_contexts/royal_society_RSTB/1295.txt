J. LISTER ON THE LIFE-HISTORY OF THE FORAMINIFERA. In 1883, Munrer-Cuatmas and ScHLUMBERGER (25) communicated to
Académie des Sciences the fact that the phenomenon of dimorphism occurs also
several species of the Miliolide. Thus, in Biloculina depressa, v'Ors., there are t
forms (see wood-cut, p. 405): A, with a large central chamber 200-400 p in diame
and with an outside diameter of the shell of 2°10 millim.; and B, with a small cent
chamber 20 in diameter, and an outside diameter varying from 1°5 millim.
2°64 millim. The interesting fact was also brought forward, that in this group the:
is a very marked difference in the mode of growth of the two forms.
