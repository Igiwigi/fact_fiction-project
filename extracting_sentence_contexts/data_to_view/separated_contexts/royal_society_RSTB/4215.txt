These spacing experiment curves, on the
contrary, all show a slight check during this rise, but this difference from the ideal
form merely decreases the definiteness of our final results, and does not alter them
qualitatively. The rise is, of course, due to the successive steady increase in the number of later
flowering branches on which flowers are ready to open. This part of the flowering-
curve is, in fact, a reduplication of the growth-curve of the central axis during the
time when the latter was producing the flowering branches. *

* A conception of the branching system of the plant as a kind of scaffolding upon which bud after bud
is formed, each to open as a flower after a well defined time, has been found very useful.
