Results obtained by imaging and analysing DNA origami will likely be a poor predictor
of performance for real biological samples where problems of out-of-focus blur, non-specific
background, light scattering and other sample aberrations exist. Thus, the resolution claimed
based on DNA origami needs to be thoroughly investigated in this context and efforts made not
to mislead the researchers interested in real biology. In fact, a new quality metrics for microscopy techniques of the relative deviation between
nominal and real life resolution in different biological situations needs to be introduced. After all,
conventional fluorescence microscopy rarely achieves its theoretical limit. However, the relative
deviation is much smaller than in MINFLUX.

(d) The choice of biological sample for resolution claims

For the lateral spatial resolution, so far, MINFLUX imaging has been done on NPCs [20],
microtubules [24], mitochondrial MICOS proteins [25] and post-synaptic protein PSD-95
[20].
