and $0 also is the manner in which the night action grows up, until very prominent,
in the winter months, through the strengthening of the cold action (3006.), when the
sun is towards the southern tropic and in the weaker parts of the segments. The
assumed principles of this action have been already given in the case of St. Peters-
burgh (3010. &c.).

3019. The magnetic meridian is much to the east of the astronomical meridian,
where the warm region passes it, especially in winter, for then the sun crosses it about
10 o'clock, and in summer about 11 o'clock. Hence the swing ought to be earlier
in winter than in summer, though, because of the slower angular motion of the warm
region in relation to Greenwich (3015.), it ought then to occupy a longer time; and
yet, as above said (3018.), be, by reason of distance, of smaller amount. All this ap-
pears to accord remarkably with the fact. The swing begins at 17" in the winter but
not until 19* in the summer, and ending at the same hour at both seasons, namely,
1 o'clock, is much longer in its occurrence in winter than in summer. It begins earlier,
because the magnetic meridian is s00ner passed than in summer ; and the reason also
appears why the extension in time is at the beginning rather than at the termination
of the 8wing ; for, because of the declination, the warm region is at the same hours
much less east of the magnetic meridian in the morning and much further west of it

* Mean declination 22? 51' W. Mean inclination 69* N.

can be expected in assigning the time of any given change.
