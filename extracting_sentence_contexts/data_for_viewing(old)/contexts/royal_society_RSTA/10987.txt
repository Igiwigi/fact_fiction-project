the effect of pressure on metals and the nature of the movements resulting from it;
and, in two papers read on March 16 and May 18 respectively of the same year,
Ewrna and RosENHAIN} describe a series of investigations carried out by them on
the same subject, and which cover practically the same ground and yield the same
results, It is pointed out that all simple metals when examined under the microscope,
are seen to be allotriomorphic aggregates of metallic crystals, the structure being
precisely that of a block of marble.

When the metal is deformed by compression or tension, the effect being identical
in both cases, the movement is found to be due to the distortion of each grain by
slipping along gliding planes, with or without the accompaniment of twinning. This
was observed in gold, silver, platinum, tin, copper, lead, cadmium, bismuth, antimony,
nickel, iron, steel, and various alloys, It is in fact in this way that metals move or
“flow” when submitted to pressure or impact.

Polysynthetic twinning was found to accompany the movement on gliding planes,
in the case of most of the metals enumerated above, both phenomena often presenting
themselves in the same grain.

Miace shows that in the case of soft iron, gliding can take place along six planes,
and that twinning is probably also developed by pressure. Ewrine and RosENHAIN,
in their first paper, give three photographs of the same surface of soft iron showing
the results of progressive deformation of the constituent crystalline grains under
pressure, which photographs could not be distinguished from those of thin sections of
the marble described in the present paper at corresponding stages of deformation.
