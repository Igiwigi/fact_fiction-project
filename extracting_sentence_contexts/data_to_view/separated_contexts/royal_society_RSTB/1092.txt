The effect of the vapour in the room was increased, perhaps, by its
dissolving in a warm bath containing 0°6 per cent. saline, which mixed with the blood
of the animal was employed for irrigation, &c., of the nerve structures. Although
the failure might have been due to other causes (exposure, &c.), still the fact of its
not occurring when special precautions were taken to avoid the excessive evaporation
of ether into the room and the contamination of the saline, leads us to conclude that
the cause mentioned is at any rate a depressing factor which ought, as far as possible,
to be excluded. The use of chloral or morphia would undoubtedly entirely exclude any error of this

of the kind which we have undertaken.
