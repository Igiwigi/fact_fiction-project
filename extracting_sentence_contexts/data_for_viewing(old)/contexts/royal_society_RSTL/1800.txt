vessel of muriatic acid ; no action takes place ; but if touched
with a zinc wire it presently becomes covered with bubbles,
copiously disengaged from every part of the surface.

6o. In the circumstances of M. SERRULAs's experiments, it is
therefore obvious that his mercury must have been always
sensibly impregnated with potassium and the supernatant
liquid, a solution of potash ; and that it was 80, is proved by
the effects of the electric current, which agree precisely with
those I have stated, as being always produced in such cir-
cumstances (Articles 18, 28;) but the cause assigned to these
effects by Mr. S. viz. the electro-positive energy of the pellicle,
is proved not to be the real one by the simple fact, that the
violence of the motion is always proportional to the cleanli-
ness of the surface, and is greatest when there is no pellicle at
all; besides which, the pellicle here consisted of metallic bis-
muth, a substance incapable of producing any such effect as
shown in Art. g8.

61. The gyration of the fragments is produced as follows :
astrong Voltaic excitement takes place at the point of contact
of two metals s0 different as mercury and potassium. The
mercury becomes strongly positive, and the floating frag-
ments negative. The circuit is completed by the alkaline
liquid; and the mercury, being alloyed with a portion of po-
