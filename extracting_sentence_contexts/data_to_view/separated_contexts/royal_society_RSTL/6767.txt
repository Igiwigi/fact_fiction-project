that if any one ſhould be induced by it to think, that
the uſe of glaſs for windows may be of much greater
antiquity than is commonly allowed, or even as old
as the fragment, which occaſions theſe remarks, he
may find other probable reaſons to corroborate his
opinion. As, firſt, that there ſeems to have been a

and conſequently it ſeems reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that
the latter of theſe applications could not be: long in

the authorities produced above, that the former
of theſe uſages did aQtually fubſiſt in the age (23)
of Pliny; and therefore before the deſtruftion of
Herculaneum, where he loft his life (24). From
whence we may draw no improbable conclufion,
that the latter deſtination of plates of glaſs, (viz,
for window-fences) did likewiſe precede the ſame
event, L

Give me leave to add further, that this preſump-
tive argument in favour of the antiquity of windows
made of plates of glaſs receives an additional force
from the cloſe relation, which -muſt be allowed/ to
