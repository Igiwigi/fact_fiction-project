is appreciably uncertain. The most probable value for this point, as deduced from these observations of
REGNAULY, is given by different authorities as 448°-38, 448°°34, and 447°-48. In view of this uncertainty, and also of the fact that the Meyer tube apparatus is
so entirely different in its construction from that employed by Recyavuir, we deemed
it advisable to obtain some further evidence as to the validity of the application of
ReeNavur's value of dt/dp to our experiments. As our own observations happened
to be all made within a small pressure range, we selected from the records of the
platinum thermometers in regular use at Kew Observatory, the results of the different
determinations of the sulphur-point made with thermometers K.1 and K.3, and from

these, caleulated by least squares for each thermometer a formula representing the

variation of pé with pressure, from which, by combination with the known value of
d. pt/dt, we obtained two concordant values for dt/dp at 760 millims.
