NATALITY DERIVED FROM HIS OBSERVATIONS AT BUDAPEST. 851 The figures of this table differ in a slight degree from those contained in No. TV, in
consequence of the fact that for all those cases where a given maternal age is combined
with different paternal ages, we are obliged to take the latter in one average figure. *

We deduce from the examination of these complementary age advances :

__ 1. That the complementary age advance of the husband is the greatest if the
wife is young, becomes always smaller with the advancing age of the wife, and turns
finally to the minus side (denoted in the Table V. by a heavy line) with the oldest
wives ; that is to say that, with these latter, the isogen natality is secured only if the
father is younger than the mother, This can be at once perceived by the following
extract of Table V.
