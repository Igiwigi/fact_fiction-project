ated in the absence of A. As Gerstenberg [89] points out,
however, an alternative possibility is that causal judgements
depend on hypothetical simulations of the future. That is,
people may judge that A caused B by imagining a potential
future scenario in which A is absent and B therefore fails to
eventuate. Building on previous work [90], Gerstenberg
sought to disentangle these explanations by presenting adult
participants with scenarios in which counterfactual past simu-
lations and hypothetical future simulations should have in
principle produced opposite causal judgements. Results
showed that participants’ judgements closely matched the coun-
terfactual simulation account, suggesting that people may in
fact mentally travel back in time and consider alternative
pasts when attributing causality. Intriguingly, although the par-
ticipants in this study were adults, Gerstenberg concludes that if
children of a certain age were to show the same pattern of
causal judgements in an equivalent task, then it would suffice
to attribute these children with a capacity for counterfactual
reasoning. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that, in other contexts,
children’s causal attributions and counterfactual judgements are
often incompatible [91]. The relationship between counterfac-
tual and causal reasoning—and the question of whether one
form of reasoning has primacy in human development—will
remain subject to debate and further research [92].
