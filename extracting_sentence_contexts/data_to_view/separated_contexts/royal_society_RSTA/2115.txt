Mechanistic studies of brucite-driven reduction or polymerization of any
C, N or P will be required to substantiate any of these ideas. However, we do reiterate that ferroan
brucite may be able to power important carbon reduction reactions. For example, Barge et al.
[47] recently demonstrated that Fe(OH)2 could drive the reduction of pyruvate to lactate; when
Fe(II/III) bearing green rusts were present, pyruvate and ammonium could react to form the
amino acid alanine.

(c) Connections between brucite and microbial metabolism

Ferroan brucite is rarely discussed as a substrate for microbial metabolism, despite the fact that
it is such a potent reductant. Fe(II) in brucite may serve as an electron donor when coupled
with oxygen, nitrate or other powerful electron acceptors, similar to microbial Fe(II)-oxidation
of basalts or olivine (e.g. [48-50]). Microbial Fe(II)-oxidation could be particularly prevalent
in moderately alkaline Mg-HCO3~ fluids (i.e. ‘type I’ fluids sensu Barnes & O’Neil [51]) in
serpentinizing systems, where more oxidizing fluids would react with ferroan brucite, and the
Fe(II) is predicted to be fully converted to Fe(III) in smectites or ferric hydroxides such as goethite
or pyroaurite, depending upon the environmental conditions.
