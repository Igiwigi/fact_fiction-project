The total time of experiments divided
into a series of frames with length At. The moments of time at which the level of BZ inhibitor grows rapidly correspond to
chemical excitations in the medium. Time frames in which the droplet was excited are marked with symbol 1, whereas the
others are labelled with 0. (Online version in colour.)

The fact that one finds a droplet giving the best answer does not solve the problem completely. An additional effort needs to be made by the observer to interpret this signal and to find a useful
classification rule which can be difficult [58]. Note that in the approach presented here, the output
of the network is limited, for simplicity, to a single droplet.
