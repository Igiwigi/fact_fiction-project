Earlier plasma mirror experiments were optimized to obtain contrast : a
improvement by minimizing losses. In those cases, the reflectivity was measured to saturate at aS]
105 Wcm7?, i.e. the experiments of Gilicze et al. [26] were carried out at lower intensities. Here, : =
investigations for higher intensities are reported together with the study of conversion to x-rays. ao

The motivation of these experiments lies in the fact that a broad range of nonrelativistic intensity
could be covered, which allows us to obtain a clear picture of these phenomena. In comparison,
measurements were also carried out with pulses of moderate contrast of 5.5 x 10Â°, when the
prepulse intensity was high enough to generate preplasmas.

2. Methods

Our laser system used in the following experiments is an updated version of the Szatmari-type
hybrid-excimer laser system [29].
