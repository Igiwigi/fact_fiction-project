LIGHT ON DIASTASE, AND ITS BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE, 179

centims. of salivary diastase solution were placed in a quartz-fronted cell, and screened
by alcohol in the outer cell; 10 cub. centims. were placed in a similar cell without a
screen, and 10 cub. centims. in a paper-covered cell. These were labelled A, B, and
C. They were exposed to the electric arc for 9 hours, the temperature rising to
81°C. 5 cub. centims. of each were then made to act on 25 cub. centiis. starch
solution for 1 hour 40 minutes. After titration, the weights of cupric oxide were,
A, 0398 grm., B, 0218 grm., C (standard) ‘0438. There was a destruction in B of
50 per cent., but in A of only 9 per cent., so that the alcohol was a very effective
screen, Further experiments and observations with the spectroscope led to the
conclusion that this reagent is like glass in its opacity to the ultra-violet rays, The
protection it affords is not perfect, which is probably attributable to the fact that it
allows all the blue and violet rays to pass, for, as we have seen, these are most likely
deleterious, though to a less extent than those of the ultra-violet region.

The impossibility at present of preparing an extract of chlorophyll which can be
used as a satisfactory screen to a diastasic solution during illumination, renders the
proof of its possible protective power very difficult. Various considerations, however,
that will be discussed more fully later, point very strongly to such a conclusion,

The Fate of the Rays of Light Absorbed.

In studying the mutual relations of light and diastase it becomes of interest to
ascertain what is the fate of the deleterious rays themselves. That they destroy the
