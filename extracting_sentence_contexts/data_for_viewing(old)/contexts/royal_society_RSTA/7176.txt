The marked difference in heat sensitiveness of Service and dextrin azide, together with
their close chemical similarity, makes a comparison of other sensitiveness tests for these two
initiators of particular interest. Knowledge of the activation energy for heat sensitiveness
makes it possible to determine how far other sensitiveness tests merely involve the production
of local hot spots, by mechanical means, and how far other activation mechanisms are
operative. This aspect of heat sensitiveness is briefly described in § (d) and is referred to more
fully in part IIT (4).

A point of considerable practical importance, which emerges from the experiments
described, relates to the effect of grit on Service azide.

A point of theoretical interest arises from the fact that dextrin azide is more sensitive to
heat below 416° G, so that if the action of grit friction is to be explained by the production
of local ‘hot spots’ these must involve temperatures considerably above 416° C in the case
of lead azide.
