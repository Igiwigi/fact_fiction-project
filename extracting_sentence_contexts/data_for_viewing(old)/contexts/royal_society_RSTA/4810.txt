2. Schrédinger’s black cat

Consider the following simple gedanken experiment. If a given radioactive atom decays (within
a certain period of time) then a massive object—which could in principle be a cat in a box—is
propelled into a black hole. If the radioactive atom does not decay, the massive object remains
some distance from the black hole in question.

The mass and hence size of the black hole are therefore dependent on the decay of the
radioactive atom. As shown in figure 1, let the size of the black hole in the case where the
radioactive atom does not decay be equal to the radius r(t) of the event horizon #+, where t
labels a family of space-like hypersurfaces which intersect #*. Figure 1 shows a second null
surface lying at a radius r’(t) > r(t). If the radioactive atom decays at time f; then while for ft < fy
it appears that this null surface will escape to future null infinity, .%*, in fact after the object has
fallen into the black hole, increasing its mass, this null surface becomes trapped. The second null
surface can be assumed to correspond to the event horizon of the black hole in the case where the
atom decays. Hence at to < fy, the size of the black hole is bigger if the atom decays at f; than if


it does not. If the mass of the ‘cat+box’ is large enough, then even at times to < f1, it is possible
that r’(fo) > r(to). In the conventional language of quantum theory (assuming the whole system
is unobserved), the black hole at the earlier time fy must be considered a linear superposition
of black holes of size r and r’. Here we pursue the possibility that quantum physics is indeed
underpinned by some causal hidden-variable theory. Hence, let the decay of the radioactive atom
at t; be determined by the value of some hidden variable 4. Then, according to the discussion
above, the size of the black hole at fo < t; is both well defined (i.e. not a superposition of sizes)
