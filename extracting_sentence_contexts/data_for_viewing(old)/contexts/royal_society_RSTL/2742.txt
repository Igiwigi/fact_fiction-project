world through the muscles of voluntary motion, excited by the nerves associated with
them. Thus it is necessary, as we have by direct experiment found to be the case,
that the organs of the neryous system $should be placed under the control of the
sensorial power. Through the same channel, we have seen, this power also, in some
of their functions, controls the muscles of involuntary motion ; and we have reason
to believe, although the point has not been ascertained by direct experiment, all the
powers of the living blood. And such, as appears from facts aboye referred to, is
its influence on the neryous, and through it, on the muscular power, and we haye
reason to believe on the powers of the living blood, that it can not only excite, but
impair and instantly destroy all these powers, according to the nature and power of
the causes which influence its organs.

The circumstance of the muscular, as appears from facts aboye referred to, being
the moving power of the blood in the vessels as well as the heart, greatly extends
the influence of those powers which control it, namely the neryous power properly
80 called, and the sensorial power acting through it. 6

The only respects in which the sensorial power is related to the Subject of this

paper, are in the impressions it receives from the nerves of sensation, and the func-
tions in which it cooperates with the nervous and muscular powers. Sensation and
yolition are the only sensorial powers employed in the maintenance of life.
