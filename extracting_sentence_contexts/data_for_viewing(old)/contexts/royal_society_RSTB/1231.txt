how these three rows of cells originate, and in accurately radial sections I have
seen such an arrangement. The structure of the sporangium, which I found
typical though not constant at this later stage, is that shown in fig. 37; the e
of fig. 36 has undergone anticlinal divisions, so that the wall, of which it forms a)
consists of a single line of cells ; cell (ii), which is the archesporium, divides
tudinally and transversely, so as to form a group of sporogenous cells, which abu
three sides directly upon the wall of the sporangium, while the base is in contact q
the tissue derived from cell (iii); this has undergone longitudinal division into
and these cells divide repeatedly in a transverse direction, so that two primitive 1
of cells, not three, occupy the interior of the stalk, But this almost dia
regularity may be often absent, and some sporangia present appearances such as #
in figs. 38 and 39 ; the explanation of such irregularities as these is to be found it
fact that the archesporium consists not of one cell, but of a row of cells, and that
walls separating these do not always run in radial planes, but sometimes obliqi
so that even a perfectly radial section, cut very thin, may include paris derived |
distinct archesporial cells; this has probably been the case for the parts a and
the figs. 38 and 39, In the latter the periclinal division of the cells of the w

periclinally ; the inner of the resulting layers again divides, the innermost layer }
the tapetum ; there is often some irregularity in the details, and it is to be speÂ¢
