on the process with the observance of additional precaution,
(the mercury being first boiled in the tube, before admitting
the ammonia, and till remaining hot when the gas was passed
up), I have obtained from the alkali less than double its vo-
lume of permanent gas, viz. 280 measures from 155, or at the
rate of 180,6 from 100. The variableness of the first set of
results arises, I believe, from the uncertainty of the quantity
of ammonia decomposed. For if the smallest portion of mois-
ture remain in the tube, a little ammoniacal gas will be ab-
sorbed, and will be slowly given -out again as the electriza-
tion goes on, thus rendering the actual quantity submitted to
experiment greater than appears. It is probable, also, from a
fact which I shall afterwards state, that mercury itself, unless
when heated, may absorb a small portion of alkaline gas.
The proportion of the hydrogen and nitrogen gases to each
other in the products of ammonia decomposed by electricity,
I am satisfied, by recent experiments (June, 1809) is as
nearly as possible what you have determined, viz. 74 mea-
ures of hydrogen gas to 26 of nitrogen. The nearest ap-
proximation I have made to these numbers is 73,75 to 26,25.
Our only method of analyzing mixtures of these two gases,
(viz. by combustion with a redundancy of oxygen) is not, I
believe, sufficiently perfect to afford a nearer coincidence.
The extreme labour and tediousness of the decomposition of
ammonia by electricity, influenced me to attempt the discovery
