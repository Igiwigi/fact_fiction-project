Recently, they have been shown* to exist in old wood of the so-called
Pityoxylon chasense, where, curiously enough, they had been mistaken for resin
canals, and were regarded by PENnnannow as the basis for referring this otherwise
Araucarian or Cordaitean form to the Abietines. I have also found traces in a
specimen of Araucarites (so labelled in our collection, but without data as to its
horizon), whose trunk measures about 15 cm. in diameter, That the trace does
persist is shown by the cases above cited, and by the fact referred to before, that
the Cordaitean leaves remained long attached to the stem (see Section 3a), these
forms belonging to the geological period when the deciduous habit had not been
attained. That they have been overlooked in mature fossil wood is not strange,
since they are difficult to observe, and even in the living forms have not
been recognised until recently. The writer believes that many more fossil forms
with persistent leaf traces will be found when the importance of this feature is
realised.
