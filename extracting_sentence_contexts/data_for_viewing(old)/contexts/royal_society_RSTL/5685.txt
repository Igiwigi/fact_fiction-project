The arteries were larger than ever seen before ; the calibre of that above noted being 3+.
and there were a good many blood-corpuscles adhering to the walls of the vessels. It
is probable that the small posterior segment of the cord had become impaired in its
powers, but that it was still acting to some extent was evident from the circumstance
that after its removal at 10» 56m a.x., the vessel was found increased to 4®, and in con-
8equence of the arterial dilatation, the stagnation of the red corpuscles, which existed in
several parts of the webs, was almost entirely dispelled, although the action of the heart
did not appear to have been changed. During the next half-hour the artery was
measured four times, and was in every instance found to be still 4* in diameter. I may
mention that T measured the posterior segment of the cord immediately after its removal,
and found its length to be one-sixth of that of the whole cord; it was in fact little more

as one-fifth.

This case shows that the extremity of the cord acts as a nervous centre for the
But the experiment of the 2nd of June proved that after the removal of the greater
of the posterior half of the cord, the vessels still remained under the control of the
nervous system *. Hence it is clear that the neryous centre for the arteries is not con- w
fined to any limited region of the cord. in
