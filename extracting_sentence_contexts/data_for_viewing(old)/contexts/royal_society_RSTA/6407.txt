assessed the joint game and followed the canonical distribution, equation (2.9) using A, jij With a
p-value of 0.012.

Using statistical ensembles, we show that the observed results do not violate the vNM
independence assumption. However, this is only part of the picture, as some anomalies in the
observed distributions can only be explained in a quantum framework.

Looking more closely at the data, we see a clear pattern in the students and traders, where (i).
A is preferred more than what is canonically represented. To understand why this is, we need to
look at the temperatures of each cohorts choices for each game.

Each cohort represents a distinct but uniform population; each game must have the same
temperature for each cohort by the third law. The fact that they do not suggests that something is


skewing their choices at the quantum level. The students had temperatures of $2.0 and $0.23 for
games (i) and (ii), respectively. The traders had a similar pattern of $0.29, $0.12 and $0.23 for games
(i), (ii) and (iii), respectively, suggesting that they are less risk-averse than the students, while
retaining the ambiguity aversion [3], the preference for (i).A. We can modify the Hamiltonian by
adjusting the off diagonal matrix elements to account for the observed quantum interferences
[2], seeking to get a single coefficient that collapses the observed tradersâ€™ preferences to have a
uniform temperature. We can follow a similar procedure for the students.

The stronger preference for the guaranteed return of choice (i).A is apparent for both cohorts.
However, it results in a lower overall utility for both. While the traders could evaluate the joint
