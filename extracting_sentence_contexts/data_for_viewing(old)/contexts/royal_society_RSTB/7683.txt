direction of the wind of the order of 10-20 miles.’

The major eddies, according to Giblett, show the same abrupt rise and slow fall in wind
velocity, while the numerous, small-scale eddies are not elongated in the wind direction.

The elongation of the air masses in the direction of the wind might provide an observer,
who was himself being borne by the wind, with a clue as to its general direction. As Williams
(1942) says: ‘An insect would be subjected to a pressure from the direction from which the
wind is blowing during the sudden advent of a gust, and a much weaker pressure on the
opposite side as the gust dies away.’

In order to respond to these forces, the insect would have to be equipped with suitable
receptors which would record the fact that some part of its body was taking up the new wind
speed more quickly than other parts. The wings themselves could act in this way: locusts
observed being carried on a gusty gale sometimes had their wings blown forwards over their
heads (p. 183), the flat wings being more readily caught by the wind than the body (cp.
Williams 1930, p. 384). But there was no evidence that these locusts were orienting to
this unusual situation, for their orientation was the same as that of locusts flying in winds
that were strong, but not violent enough to blow their wings forward over their heads.

There is, however, evidence of the existence of special aerodynamic sense organs on
Acridids, in the shape of patches of hairs on the frons and vertex which are sensitive to the
flow of air past the head (Boyd & Ewer 1949; Weis-Fogh 1949). Stimulation of these has
been shown to initiate flight itself once the insect is deprived of a foothold and, during flight,
to initiate contra-lateral (compensatory) turning responses when the air flow comes from
