It is worth noting that the effect of the high-frequency stochastic excitation from the bulk
material is connected with a change of the effective stiffness. This provides the factor (1 + xe)
instead of 1 at variable Xp. Increasing the value xe? from 0 can lead to an extreme response of
the amplitude if the slow-time excitation has a constant frequency near the eigenfrequency of the
system at xe” = 0. This means a realization of a stochastic resonance. Figure 3 presents an example
of the manifestation of this effect in a numerical simulation.

The equivalence of the stochastic pulsation of the mass and increasing the stiffness relative to
the averaged motion is a fact of not only principle but also practical significance. The knowledge
about the structure of the averaged equations shows a way to tune the operating frequency to
keep the system in resonance. This tuning can be provided even though the characteristics of the
stochastic excitation in this system are neither theoretically known nor directly measurable. Let
