Tables XXXII-XXXVII.—Ancestral correlations for adult measurements (cor-
rected), polyclonal population, large strain.

With the same omissions as for birth measurements.

Tables XXX VIII-XL.—Ancestral correlations for the corrected measurements,
polyclonal population, small strain.

Tn compiling these tables, one brood was omitted owing to the extreme pathological
smallness of the new-born young. It must also be recorded that in one generation
one line of each of two clones was kept for a few days under slightly different
conditions from those described in the text as the general conditions. This fact is,
however, only recorded for the purely formal reason that it constituted an exception
to these conditions.* It certainly had no significant influence on the correlation
coefficient.

As stated in the text, four generations were combined to construct these tables.
Hence a number of individuals appear in them twice, both as offspring of their
ancestors and ancestors of their own offspring. Also each ancestor was taken over again
with each of its separate offspring. The total numbers of separate individuals dealt

* The only other exception in the whole S. exspinosus experiment was that on one occasion during the

life-time of Generation 4 three days instead of two elapsed between the changing of the water in the
