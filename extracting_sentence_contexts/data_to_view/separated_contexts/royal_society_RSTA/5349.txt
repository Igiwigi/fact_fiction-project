As I wrote in 1973 in the preface of my book with
Giles Hunt on A General Theory of Elastic Stability [11]:

For several years the first author was blissfully unaware of the classic dissertation of Prof
W. T. Koiter which had surprisingly lain largely unknown since 1945 and has in fact only
recently been translated into English by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of
America. This was indeed most fortunate since the weight of Prof Koiter’s contribution
could well have discouraged him from proceeding with his own development of the
subject. As it transpired, the full significance of Prof Koiter’s work has filtered slowly
into our consciousness in a gentle stream, moderated by the Dutch language and by our
temperaments which have invariably preferred to explore the field for ourselves.
