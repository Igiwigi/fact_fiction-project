The author believes that if it were possible to obtain perfectly pure carbon
electrodes, then the resistance of the are between them would be very high, so high
that it might be impossible to maintain a true are between them at all. He is of the


328 MR. W. DUDDELL ON THE RESISTANCE AND

opinion that traces of impurities, such as the vapours of the alkaline earths, are
essential to provide the carriers of the electric charges in the vapour column, so as
to render it conducting and the electric are as we know it a physical possibility.
Unfortunately it has not, up to the present, been possible to obtain pure carbon
electrodes in order to test this theory. In favour of it is, however, the known fact
that, given an are of fixed length and current between the best commercial solid
carbons, then any addition to it of such substances as potassium or sodium reduces
the P.D. required to maintain the are and its resistance and increases its stability.

The difference between the 11-millim. and 9-millim. Electrographitie carbons
mentioned above is probably caused by the last traces of impurities having been
more completely expelled in the manufacture’ from the 11-millim. size than from
the 9-millim.
