By this device the system was brought
under control. This form of apparatus was abandoned on account of an unexpected form of
attraction which caused the masses, m, m, to rush to the walls of the vacuum vessel
and cling there indefinitely. These forces are very strong and existed despite the fact
that there was a complete “ earthed” system of aluminium tubing lining the vacuum
vessel and that the suspension was “earthed.” After separate investigation this effect
was attributed to radiometric-pressure, which cannot be avoided in this form of vacuum
vessel. In the final form of apparatus, to be next described, there are two distinct sets :
(a) where the attracting masses are cylindrical; (b) where these are spherical.
