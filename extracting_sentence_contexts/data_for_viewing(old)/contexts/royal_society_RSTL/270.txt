beyond the focus, and then brought it towards the mirror till
the diameter of the luminous circle was the same as before,
In this position the degree of illumination appeared so far in-
ferior to that before observed, as to admit of no hesitation in
the decision.

Before I proceed to detail the experiments which follow, I
must premise that of the eight persons who at different times
were employed in making the observations, six were perfectly
unacquainted with the subject of inquiry, and two of the six
distinguished in the column of observers by the letters C, and
W, were servants, It will be seen, that I did not trust myself
to make any observations till the fact I sought had been suf-
ficiently established by others to leave no fear on my mind
that I might be influenced by any preconceived opinion.

I drew a line across a card, which line I divided into tenths
of an inch. The mirror was placed at the distance of fourteen
feet from a candle, and the card moved in the reflected light
within the focus till the diameter of the luminous circle was
equal to the width of the card, in which position an observer
was directed to remark carefully the intensity of the illumina-
tion. The card was then suddenly carried far beyond the focus
and brought slowly towards it till the observer pronounced
the intensity of the light to be the same as before, at which
