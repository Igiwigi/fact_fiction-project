the carbon atom directly bound to nitrogen seems to be principally due, not to t
direct physiological influence of the substituted methyl group, but to the chem
instability which the introduetion of this group confers on the molecule. What t
exact nature of the chemical change is which accompanies the manifestation of t
physiological action it is impossible to assert for want of experimental data. It m

who was the first to study the remarkable change in the colour of arterial blood, fi
bright red to chocolate brown, which is noticed whenever nitrites are administe
has suggested that it is the result of the formation of a combination of the nitri
with the hemoglobin. The fact that later observers have shown that the actu
colour change is due to the production of metheemoglobin, and may be brought abou
by substances other than nitrites, has caused this suggestion of Gamerer, which
strongly supported by his experimental data, to be lost sight of. Our own rest
have led us to believe that the combination of the nitrites with the haemoglobin, ¢
with some other constituent of the blood, is very probably the first step in th
chemical change which unquestionably occurs when a nitrite is brought into cont
with the blood or with muscle. Chemical decomposition, however, doubtless ver
quickly follows this initial combination, especially with the higher and less sta
compounds, Preliminary experiments made with the object of tracing the chemie
changes which nitrites undergo in the body have proved that these compounds
