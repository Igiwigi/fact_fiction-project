The number of vertebree in particular is a valuable character, Anguilla vulgaris
having on an average about seven and a half more vertebre than the American eel
(ca. 114°7 against ca. 107°2—ef. fig. 1). If we take the trouble of counting the
vertebra, it will be only a very few specimens per thousand which cannot be referred
with certainty to the one or the other of the two species. This fact has proved
of great importance in the investigations at sea, since it was found that the
larvee of the European and of the American eel are mingled together in certain
areas of the ocean.

Fic. 1.—Number of Vertebre in 266 eels from Denmark (Anguilla vulgaris, top graph), and in 266 eels
from Mass., U.S.A. (Anguilla rostrata, lower graph). In spite of the enormous area of the European eel, statistical investigations
failed to demonstrate the existence of local races, as has been done with so many
