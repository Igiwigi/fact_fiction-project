Now the two integrals just quoted will give
irregularly sinuous time-curves, the average extent of a sinuosity being of order 1/s,
Thus, the varying simple vibration

will have entirely changed in amplitude and phase after a time of order 1/s. It
will therefore be impossible to produce sensible interference with time-differences of
more than 1/s. This is another aspect of the fact that for lines of width s (measured
in frequency), the maximum path-difference for interference is of order 1/s.

ยง 62. We can look at the same matter from yet another point of view. We may
go back to the composition of the radiation from a gas.
