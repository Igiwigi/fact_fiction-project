In the living animal a nerve cut off from direct communication with the brain and spinal marrow
but otherwise uninjured, will, as Mr. Bxovts has shown, long retain this power, as we should & priori
have expected, It retains its healthy structure, and its communications with other neryes,

themselyes the source of a similar influence. The former is evidently their
peculiar function, and it is s0 improbable that they should perform another of
$0 different a nature, that it would require the most unequivocal proof of such
a fact to induce its belief. The power of the nerves is not only as far as we
see derived from the brain and spinal marrow, and s0on ceases and cannot be
renewed when they are separated from these organs, but is, as I have already
had occasion to observe, at all times proportioned to the degree of excitement
in them ; nor can an instance be adduced in which a cause of increased ner-
vous power makes its impression on the nerves themselves. For its degree as
well as existence, then, the power of the latter depends wholly on the former
organs ; and this observation applies as strictly to the ganglionic as to the cere-
bral neryes.
