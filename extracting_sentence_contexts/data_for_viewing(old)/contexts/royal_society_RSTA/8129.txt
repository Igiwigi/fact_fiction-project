Comparison with Plasticity of Glass at High Temperatures.

It has already been pointed out that von Misksâ€™ second assumption that p= v
would be true if the equations of plastic flow were identical with those of a very viscous
fluid. Tt is known that when glass is heated to such a temperature that it flows slowly
under a direct load or a bending load, it behaves like a very viscous fluid and in fact


THE PLASTIC DISTORTION OF METALS. 347

slow plastic distortion of this type is used in order to measure the viscosity of glass at
temperatures at which it is beginning to soften. As has been mentioned in connection
with plastic flow in metals, most of these tests have been carried out under conditions
like that of extension under a direct load, where the type of distortion is determined by
the condition of symmetry alone.

Experiments on the plasticity of glass have in fact been limited to determining the
rate of distortion for different loads under varying conditions of temperature, etc. It
