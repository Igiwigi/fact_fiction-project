conclude from the data that the mechanical effect of the autumn is just as important
as the chemical effect of the winter; and it is, moreover, one that is practically
irremediable.”

The statement that the winter dip is slightly greater refers to the partial correlations
obtained after eliminating the effects of temperature ; we are here only concerned with the
total effects, and it is apparent that Hooker’s data contain substantial evidence for a
real deleterious effect of Autumn rainfall. In other respects the series of correlations is
not out of harmony with several of the Broadbalk plots, the characteristic period of
winter damage is clearly recognisable in both, and we may identify the positive corre-
lations obtained in late Spring with the minimum of damage observed on several of
our plots at the same season. The July values also are suggestive of the more highly
nitrogenous plots on Broadbalk. The fact that Hooxnr’s series appears to incline on
the whole to more positive values than are observed in our regressions is not improbably
due to the inclusion in his data of yields from lighter lands, more susceptible to summer
droughts than is the heavy loam of Broadbalk ; in addition his mean rainfall is some
four inches less than in out series.

The earlier half of the series, in which the Broadbalk plots are most alike, is alone in
contradiction to Hookerr’s series. Of course, if strong meteorological correlations
existed between the several parts of the year, no resemblance need be expected between
