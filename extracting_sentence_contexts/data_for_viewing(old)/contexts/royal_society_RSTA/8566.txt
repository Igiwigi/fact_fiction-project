lines in the Table. The values for each of these were divided into three groups with
which were sandwiched four groups of observations of the “ helix effect ” (see above).
The means of the latter are given in Table I., under “ helix.’

Their values are large—over a centimetre on the scale—the case chosen for illustration
being one of those in which the R effect was overpowered by that of the helix for the
purpose of causing both 0, throws to be in the same direction (see above). The true
sign of the R effect is that of the observed 0, after subtracting from this the corresponding
helix throw ; this difference being given under “ 0, corrected for helix.’

It might have been expected that correcting for the helix effect in this way would have
brought the values of 6, for m-} and m— to equality. That it has not done so is due
to the fact that the helix effect as measured is greater than that which accompanies
the R effect, because in the case of an R effect the helix acts on magnetism which is

reversing, and its effect is due to the difference between two opposing forces, whereas,
when measured directly it is due to a force in one direction only. It will be seen from
the figures that a smaller value of the helix effect is in fact required to bring the corrected
values of 0, to equality. There is no error arising from this cause, however, when all
four values of 9, are taken into account.
