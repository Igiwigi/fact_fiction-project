XXX.) three
nerves from different sources given to the tongue, four to the
throat, and nerves in most perplexing intricacy to the neck ;
when he finds one nerve with numerous ganglia or knots upon
it, and another without them ; when, in short, after a minute
dissection of the nervous system, he finds a mesh, or network,
spreading everywhere, it is not surprising that the seeming
intricacy and con≈øusion. should make him, in despair, resign
enquiry. But the Author of this paper being forced, in the


400 Mr. BELL's experiments on the structure

course of his duty, to go minutely over the | demonstration' of
the nerves, year after year, without allowing himself to resign
the subject merely on account of its intricacy, and finding the
facts which he had to explain in his demonstrations of the
anatomy, quite inconsistent with the received opinions, he
gradually, after much study, was enabled to decypher and to
read that language, of which the character had hitherto been
imperfectly known ; and now even the youngest students are
brought to comprehend so-much of the subject, that the idea
of chance, or accident, or real confusion among these nu-
merous branches, is entirely dismissed ; and what remains
unexplained has, by the success of our past enquiries, become
a subject of peculiar interest, from the conviction, that attention
to the minute anatomy, under the guidance of cautious and
fair induction, will sooner or later lead 'to a comprehension
of the whole system. Statement of the: object of the paper. The Author means to limit his present enquiry to the nerves
of respiration.
