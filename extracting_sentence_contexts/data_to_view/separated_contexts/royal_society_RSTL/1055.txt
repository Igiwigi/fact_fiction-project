But it is painful to
me to differ from any writer of character in the statement of a

fact, where the truth is equally accessible to us both; and not-
withstanding the respect I willingly bear towards a name that
has both acquired and deserved considerable reputation, I must |
confess that it appears to me highly problematical, whether
this celebrated experiment be a reality, or only an ingenious
device. But some facts, which it will so0on be in order to relate,
will show (I think very clearly) that I rest my suspicion upon

_ fair grounds. In the mean time I feel it incumbent on me to
reply to the general principle of the objection, and to deter-
mine by experiment how far it is deserving attention. Now, if there be any validity in the objection, it should ne-
cessarily follow, that if an opportunity was given for the semen
to pass by the tubes to the ovaries; we might, by opening an
animal at a proper time after coition, detect some disposition
in the fimbriated extremities of the tubes to apply the semen,
by first approaching, and afterwards embracing the ovaries ;
and this action ought, according to the common theory, to take
place before the usual sign of conception is at all evident on
those bodies, which in the rabbit is 80mewhat apparent in six
hours, but unequivocally marked in twelve.
