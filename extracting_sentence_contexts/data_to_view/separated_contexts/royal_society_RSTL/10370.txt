to
Leguminosz, and nob 5 per cent. to Miscellanere. Taking the average of the four separation-years there was, in fact, nearly three times
as much gramineous herbage per acre as without manure, nearly twice as much as by
the ammonia-salts alone, and not far from twice as much as with the mineral manure
alone. Reckoned in the same way, there was, on the average, not much more than
one-twentieth as much legumineous herbage as without manure, rather more than
with ammonia-salts alone, and only about one-hundredth as much as with the mineral
manure alone. Turning to the total miscellaneous species a little more is yielded on
the average by the mixed nitrogenous and mineral manure than withoub manure,
about one-third more than by the ammonia-salts alone, bub even less than by the
mineral manure alone.
