Excepting a few lines in the red region and the fainter lines,
nearly every line was measured in two orders, which ensures a correct relation
between the different regions of the spectrum. Tt was stated above that the spectra of the new gases are composed of bright and
well defined lines; it will be seen, however, from the tables, that certain lines are
marked as being diffused, which may appear at first sight to be rather contradictory. The explanation is to be found in the fact that the distinctness of the spectrum and
the definition of the lines depend to a great extent upon the pressure of the gas in
the vacuum tube. If this pressure exceeds a certain small amount, the whole
appearance of the spectrum is altered, for it tends to become confused, and at times
