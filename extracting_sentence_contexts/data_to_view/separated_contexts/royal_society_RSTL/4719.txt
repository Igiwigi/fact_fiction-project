Those
S which, on the other hand, constitute the exterior of the constricted osseous cylinder,
V are considerably smaller, and towards its terminal margins become subcompressed. = We now also find that the osseous plate, constituting the floor of the neural canal,
Â© extends across the entire vertebra, and that its anterior and posterior extremities
EZ blend with the contiguous margins of the osseous cylinder. It is in fact a rudi-
EZ mentary vertical plate, serving the same purpose as that of the Ray, fig. 28 g; only
= instead of being developed, as in that example, direct from the osseous cylinder sur-
V rounding the chorda, it is formed at a distance from it, being attached to it only by
= its anterior and posterior extremities, the central portions of each being separated
Z from one another by a semicircular mass of cartilage.
