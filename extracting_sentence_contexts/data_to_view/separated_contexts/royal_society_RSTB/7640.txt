tion does not allow of determining if any gape was present. Outline peculiar; for about
the first half of its life the outline of the shell remained elongate-oval in a vertical direction,
but later the direction of growth changed so that the axis is directed antero-ventrally at
an angle of about 45Â° to the horizontal. That the direction is antero-ventral is confirmed
by the fact that, in the earlier stages, one side is gently convex (the anterior), and the other
is more or less straight and vertical (the posterior), the same condition as is found in many
Recent species. Umbos opisthogyrous. Ventral outline sharply and narrowly rounded, its
culmination, as indicated by the growth lines, being closer to the posterior margin than
to the anterior margin.
