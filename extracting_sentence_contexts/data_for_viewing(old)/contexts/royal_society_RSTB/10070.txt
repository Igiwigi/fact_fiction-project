careful data collection and analysis—and the feedback
between them—has progress been possible.

Due in part to conflicts between economics and conserva-
(d) Potential for better data tion, there has been disagreement on the nature and
magnitude of effects of sea lice on wild populations
[13,26,48,67,68]. One major challenge to research has been
the inability to undertake ecosystem-wide controlled
experiments. This means that, by necessity, manipulative
studies are rare compared with correlative studies. Even
when manipulative studies have been possible [3,69], debate
and controversy have persisted [70,71]. Another major chal-
lenge is the fact that a negative statistical result does not
necessarily translate to a negative biological conclusion. This
second challenge arises because simple lack of evidence is not
evidence of lack of an effect, particularly if the statistical power
of the approach is low. Fortunately, larger datasets increase
statistical power, and a spectrum of ecological conditions
gives the possibility of more closely emulating randomized
trial conditions found in experimental manipulations.

As the aquaculture industry continues to expand and
wild fish populations decline, new pathogens and novel
transmission pathways will emerge in both farmed and
wild populations, raising similar questions to those asked
