These two photographs were both taken at a
magnification of 280 diameters. This transformation 8 = « + 6 is an exothermic one, and gives rise to the halt in
the cooling curve that we first see in our cooling curve of Sn 10 at 500°, though, as
we have shown (fig. 13), the same transformation can be detected by the microscope
even in Sn 6. In fact, this change of solid 8 into a complex occurs at or a little below
500° in all alloys from Sn 6 to Sn 20, It is marked in our diagram (Plate 11) by the
broken line b’C’/XD,. It must be borne in mind that at this temperature the alloys
are rigid solids. Sn 12. 20°3 per cent. by weight of tin.
