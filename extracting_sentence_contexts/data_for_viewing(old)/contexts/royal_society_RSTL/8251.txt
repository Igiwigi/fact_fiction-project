& These errors were now treated in the ingenious way employed by SEIDEL (Unter-

suchungen, p. 41)—a Table was formed in which the zenith-distance was the argument
tor both horizontal and vertical columns; the errors were now entered at both points of
intersection corresponding to the pairs of altitudes to which they belong.

When the lesser zenith-distance is the argument for the vertical column, the sign
given in the Table was retained, in the other case the 8ign was changed; in this way all
the errors come to stand on one side of the diagonal as they are in the Table, and on
the other side with changed signs. The vertical and horizontal columns were now
examined to see whether one particular sign predominated in any part. In fact the
following corrections of the yalues of pz were found to be indicated :—
