other oxidizable substances, and the existence also of a comparatively high proportion
of oxygen in the gaseous products appear to indicate the occurrence of reactions in
the course of the preparation of gas and residue, by the gradual deflagration of the _
powder, which were distinct from those attending the ordinary explosion of powder in

a confined space.

'The very considerable differences between the results of our analyses and of the expe-
riments of BUNsEN and SCHISCHKOPP and of L1NCK appear therefore clearly ascribable
to the fact that the deflagration of gunpowder, as carried out by them, cannot be
expected to furnish results similar to those produced when a charge of powder is
exploded in a confined space under considerable pressure and in one operation.

A This conclusion receives support from the results of analysis of powder-residues
J published by FepeRow. Those products which he collected from a cannon in which
5 3 Ib. of powder were fired furnished analytical results much more nearly resembling
by those obtained by us than those of Buxs8EN and SCHISCHKOFF ; the proportion of sulphate
5 was similar to that obtained in many of our experiments, and therefore very much
=) below that of the German experimenters, while the proportion of sulphide was very
S considerably higher than the largest amount obtained by usâ€”a result, we believe, not
= difficult of explanation. In the residue collected in a glass tube by firing small
EZ quantities of powder (blank charges) in a pistol, which therefore were not exploded
