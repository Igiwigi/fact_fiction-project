the limiting
factor does not appear to be diffraction by the pupil as Shlaer supposed. The results obtained by Shlaer and his co-workers in the case of Landolt’s ‘broken C’ test,
also appear to refute Shlaer’s hypothesis which was advanced in the case of a grating test
object, but which should also apply to the Landolt test, because it is in effect a grating
consisting of only three bars. If the pupil diameter was in fact the limiting factor, then acuity should increase with
increase in pupil diameter, as well as with the use of shorter wave-length light. That neither
of these expectations from Shlaer’s hypothesis is found in practice, is shown by their results
which are given in table 85. In this case also, since the experimental results are independent
of pupil diameter and of the colour of the light, some limit other than diffraction of the
pupil seems to be involved.
