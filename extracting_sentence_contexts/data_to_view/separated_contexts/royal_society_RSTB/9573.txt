The usher LPS from the IM to the OM. This bridge cannot form unless
OM is a clear target. In fact, colistin, a polycationic lipopep- the OM translocon is properly assembled, which relies on the
tide antibiotic, is thought to permeabilize the OM by coordination of the lipoprotein and beta-barrel assembly path-
binding LPS, enabling access to its suspected lethal target, ways. The publication of the LptDE translocon structures will
the IM [62]. If a molecule that affects the OM is not lethal enable studies of the mechanism of LPS insertion and further
on its own, it could be effective in combination with an anti- the development of LptD-targeting molecules.
