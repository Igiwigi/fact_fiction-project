This is the expression for the length of an are of a logarithmic ellipse, the intersec-
tion of a cylinder, now become circular, with a paraboloid whose semiparameter k=0;
therefore the dimensions of the paraboloid being indefinitely diminished in magni-
tude, this intersection of a finite circular cylinder by a paraboloid indefinitely atte-
nuated, must take place at an infinite altitude. We naturally should suppose that
the section of a cylinder which indefinitely approaches in its limit to a circular cylinder,
by a paraboloid of revolution, would be a circle; yet the fact is not 80. The inter-
section of these surfaces, instead of being a circle, is a logarithmic ellipse, whose
rectification may be effected by an elliptic integral of the second order, as we shall
now proceed to show. In the first place let us conceive the paraboloid as of definite magnitude, and the
cylinder to be elliptical; its semiaxes as before being a and 6.
