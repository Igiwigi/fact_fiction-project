r—n! 2ixé = Qik (n—n’') t = Qic z nt,

so that, in terms of the quantity denoted by g,

«=4(1+m)g. This example is chiefly useful here as calling attention to the fact that n’, while
not exactly equal to 1, is near to it, and consequently the factor d/(n?—1) is only
small of the first order in m,. The same weakness occurs in the terms in ¢~', ..., in
the solution. —
