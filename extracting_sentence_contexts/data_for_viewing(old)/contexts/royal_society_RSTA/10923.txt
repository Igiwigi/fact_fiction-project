corresponding change.

Sn 22, Chall at 570° (not reproduced).

The polygons, still very varied in tint, are now crossed and sometimes margined by
massive bars of , but there is no lace either in the bars or the ground.

Sn 22. Chilled at 565°, a slow-cooled chill (fig. 60).

This is certainly below the last, or D’, halt on the cooling curve, a point marked in
the cooling curve of this alloy by a somewhat sloping flat. A lens now shows massive
bars and curved bands of » dark on a light ground. A slightly higher power brings
out the fact that this ground is full of paler bars and of lace bars, the effect being even
better seen in fig. 61. Thus the crystallisation has taken place in at least two stages:
at first the massive » bars formed, and, secondly, the mother-substance broke up into

a copper-rich and a tin-rich phase. The lace bars are probably, as we said in
discussing Sn 21, due to the similar breaking up of » bars that were too rich in
copper for the final equilibrium. As in the ingot of Sn 21, chilled at 580°, the paler
bars were probably intermediate phases.

A chill at 560° is very similar to that at 565°, but shows better the separate
