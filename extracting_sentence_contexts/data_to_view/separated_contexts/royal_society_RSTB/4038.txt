It is evident on comparing the numbers that a simple perfectly indifferent
regrouping, by which some of the endemies would gradually become more common,
and some of the “wides” more rare, would reduce all to much the same level of
commonness, with approximately equal numbers under every heading. It must of course be made clear that we are here dealing only with averages, but the
numbers under each head are large enough to give averages that may be fairly well
relied upon, We may safely say that on the average the local endemic species are the
rarest, those of Ceylon and Peninsular India next most rare, and those of wide
distribution commonest. Having thus traced, on the grand totals of species of each type of distribution, the
result of the summing up of the endemic flora, as compared with the other two
sections of which the Ceylon flora is composed, we may go on to show that this result
is not one which simply comes out on the total, but also holds in detail, and is not due
to any such fact as that some one or two families are very rare, and might be regarded
as being driven to the wall. The detailed figures show the results given in Table VI. Looking this over, we see that the whole range of the rarity of the Ceylon endemiecs
is only from 39 to 4°9*, working with not less than 14 species in a group; and in fact
a great proportion even of the families with only a few endemies, which are put
together in the list, also come within these figures.
