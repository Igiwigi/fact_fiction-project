Dr. TYNDALL has also made similar
observations on the flank of the Mer de Glacef, from which it appears that the motion

of the upper was there rather more than twice that of the lower surface. These obser-
vations may or may not determine approximately the ayerage ratio between the velo-
cities of the upper and lower surfaces of a glacier; but they leave no doubt as to the
fact of the sliding movement. Again, it is observed that existing glacial valleys, and
those which are believed to have been such in former times, always indicate, by their
8moothed and striated rocks, the sliding movements of the glaciers they formerly con-
tained. In fact, few glacialists at present, I imagine, will doubt the existence of this
8liding motion, or that it forms a considerable portion of the whole motion of a glacier ;
and T believe that the experiments above described afford an adequate explanation of
the cause and character of that motion.
