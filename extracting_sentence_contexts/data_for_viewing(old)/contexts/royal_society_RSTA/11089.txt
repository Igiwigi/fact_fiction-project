passed with the water from the steam chest, the temperature of the wiredrawn steam
became lower by nearly 0°35° in about 10 minutes, and remained at this lower value
so long as the drainage was thus restricted. This decrease of temperature was
clearly noticeable, and, though its amount was relatively small compared with the
increase of wetness in the steam in the steam chest, its existence seemed to impair in
a slight degree the deduction that the condition of the steam was always the same
just before entering the orifice.

There is, however, one point to notice which has not previously been mentioned,
and which was suggested to the author by Professor REYNoLDs as accounting for this
peculiar difference observed in the temperature of the wiredrawn steam; the water
in the boiler is certainly not free from air, and even a small quantity of air in the
steam entering the steam pipe with the steam, owing to the fact that a large quantity
of steam leaving the boiler is condensed in the pipe and steam chest, would, if the
actual steam drained away is very small, represent a much greater percentage of air
entering the orifice with the steam than in the steam leaving the boiler. With good
drainage of steam and water from the steam chest, this percentage of air would be
very much smaller and most of it would be carried away through the drain pipe on
account of its slightly greater density.

In any case, however, this maximum difference of temperature in the wiredrawn
steam is scarcely sufficient, considering the good drainage usually allowed from the
steam chest in the experiments and the general accuracy to which the results
attained, to justify the conclusion that the conditions of the steam just before passing
the orifice was ever materially altered.
