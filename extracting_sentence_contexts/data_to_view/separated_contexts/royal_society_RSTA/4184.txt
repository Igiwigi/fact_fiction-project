However, possible complicating :
factors are related to lifestyle, the lack of physical activity, smoking, obesity, poor diet, substance =
abuse, diabetes, hypertension, the cardiac side effects of antipsychotics and the imbalanced a
autonomic nervous system (ANS) during acute psychosis [1,6,7]. Two important differences from {8
other patient populations suffering from primary cardiac conditions (e.g. myocardial infarction, :
cardiomyopathy) and which present signs of cardiac autonomic dysfunction (CAD) need to be fA
taken into account. The first difference is the fact that severe CAD is not initially caused by major Dw
structural or functional alterations of the heart in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, it seems to :
be associated with an altered brain-heart interaction influenced by a lack of cortical inhibitory a
control over sympathoexcitatory subcortical regions [8,9]. The second difference from patient :S
populations suffering from primary cardiac conditions is caused by the relative ‘longevity’ of :
patients with schizophrenia when compared with more frequent shorter survival rates of cardiac
patients.
