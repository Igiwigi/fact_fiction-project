and the higher

Taking the axis of & in the direction of the length, we readily obtain by the same
process as before a 7ower limit to the resistance

= IE SIE T(T

where s denotes the section of the tube by a plane perpendicular to the axis at the point
z, an expression which has long been known and is 8ometimes given as rigorous. The
conductor (for I am now referring to the electrical interpretation) is conceived to be
divided into elementary slices by planes perpendicular to the axis, and the resistance of
any slice is calculated as if its faces were at constant potentials, which is of course not
the case. In fact it is meaningless to talk of the resistance of a limited solid at all,
unless with the understanding that certain parts of its surface are at constant potentials,
while other parts are bounded by non-conductors. Thus, when the resistance of a
cube is spoken of, it is tacitly asxumed that two of the opposite faces are at constant
potentials, and that the other four faces permit no escape of electricity across them. In
some cases of unlimited conductors, for instance one we have already contemplated—an
infinite solid almost divided into two separate parts by an infinite insulating plane with
a hole in it—it is allowable to speak of the resistance without specifying what particular
surfaces are regarded as equipotential ; for at a sufficient distance from the opening on
either side the potential is constant, and any surface no part of which approaches the
opening is approximately equipotential. After this explanation of the exact significance
of (53), we may adyantageously modify it into a form convenient for practical use.
