Developmental processes in different parts of the embryo
will need to be synchronized: protein levels will need to oscillate periodically in time. And the list
goes on. The surprising fact is, each of the tasks on our wish-list can be achieved by small networks
of interacting genes (figure 4) [32,33]. In ยง4b, we survey a few simple networks that are
able to generate, in principle, these various biologically desirable outcomes. Over the past
decade systems such as those discussed here have been explored experimentally by synthetic
biologists [34-36]: negative feedback for noise reduction [37,38]; positive feedback and the
flip-flop for bistability [20,3941]; and hysteretic and ring oscillators [26,4244].

(b) The dynamics of simple network topologies

Amplification by cooperative activation: consider a gene that encodes a protein Y and is regulated
by an activator X (figure 52).
