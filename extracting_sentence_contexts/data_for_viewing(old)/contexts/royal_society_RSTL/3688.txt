ash, each of which has an alkaline reaction, and would have restored the blue, or
rather prevented the litmus from reddening. $0 in the case of the common salt and
iodine (where by the way only one base is concerned), the chlorine, supposing it libe-
rated, would not have bleached the litmus, but would have combined at the moment
of its separation with some of the iodine present to form the terchloride of iodine
which has a neutral reaction. That very little decomposition does take place in
these instances I have no doubt, but that there is actually none is not proved.

There is however one difficulty not so easily overcome. Water is a binary com-
pound, and it might be expected that on mixing a hydrated acid and base, or on dis-
s0lving in water a alt, such as nitrate of potash, or nitrate of ammonia, a certain
amount of both the acid and the base would remain in combination merely with
water. That it is not 80, is proved by the fact that solutions of the salts just named
do not give up any portion of their volatile base or acid, even on boiling. Has a
limit to the action of the general law been here arrived at? Is water an exception
standing by itself? Or is there not an assumption in supposing that water is not an
integral part of the constitution of every salt when in a state of aqueous solution ?
To these queries I do not feel myself in a position as yet to make a reply.

Conclusions.

'The general conclusions arrived at in this paper may be summed up as follows :â€”

I. Where two or more binary compounds are mixed under such circumstances
that all the resulting bodies are free to act and react, each electro-positive element
