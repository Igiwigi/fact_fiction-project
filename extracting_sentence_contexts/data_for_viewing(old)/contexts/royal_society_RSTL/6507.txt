merely fibres of connective tissue,

Since it has been shown that many of the corpuscles in the connective tissue between
the mnscular fibres, and in other sitnations which are usually considered to be connective-
tissue corpuscles, are really connected with the nerye-fibres, and that the quantity of the
connective tissne increases as the muscle advances in age, it remains for those who still
maintain that this indefinite connective tissue is a structure developed specially for the
8upport or nutrition of higher tissues, to explain, according to their view, its absence
when the tissues are undergoing most active changes, during development, and when
they are soſtest and therefore are in greater need of support, and how and at what
period it comes into relation with the nerve-fibres—why it is more abundant on the
muzcles of the tongue and diaphragm of the mouse than on the muscles of the limbs, —
and many other facts which I have considered elsewhere, and which appear to me to be
not only strongly opposed to this view of the origin of this form of connective tissue, but
incompatible with it *.

In adult animals the connective tissue is too thick to permit our seeing the arrange-
ment of the very much more delicate neryous structure beneath it ; and the difficulty is
Further increased by the circumstance that the light must first traverse the muscular fibre
itself. The relation of the nerves to the sarcolemma remains constant ; but the connective
tiszue exists in greater quantity and is firmer and more fibrous in old than in young
muscles, and forms a fibrous stratum external to the nerve-fibres. If we attempt to tear
off this connective tisxue in order to see the nerye-fibres beneath it more distinctly, we
almost invariably tear away the nerves and vessels also ; for these structures are undoubt-
edly connected with the connective tissue.
