sedimentary series, and they seem to be entirely conformable throughout. That the
Turkana Grits are not found in the immediate vicinity of the escarpment may be
accounted for by the fact that either the Miocene lavas or Quaternary deposits extend
almost to its foot and may therefore hide the local development that would be expected
there. Dixey (1929) has suggested that those barren sandstones, the Adigrat Grits and the
Lugh Sandstones of eastern Abyssinia, may perhaps be regarded as of Karroo age. The
lithological likeness of these series to the Turkana Grits, as already pointed out by
Arambourg, together with the similarity of the overlying volcanic succession of basalts
and rhyolites, might well suggest that the Turkana Grits are also of Karroo age.
