3. It will be seen that the figures obtained by the acetylation method (average 19-74)
are considerably higher than those given either by the polarimeter method (average
15-7) or by the carbon balance sheet (18Â°5). This is to be explained by the fact that
the solution was fermented by yeast after the carbon balance sheet had been prepared
but before the polarimeter and acetylation estimations. Hence the glycerol formed
during the fermentation of the residual glucose by yeast, which would amount to from 0-5
to 1 gm. in weight, is not included in the figure 18-5 obtained from the carbon balance
sheet.
