The degree of temperature, the respective masses of
the different substances, the presence of other bodies, and many circumstances beside
these, are supposed to modify the result. The attempt has frequently been made to construct tables showing the relative
strength of affinity of different substances for some particular body, and GuyToN DE
Moxveav even endeavoured to give a numerical expression to them. In treating of
this subject the elaborate disquisition of Berman, © De Attractionibus Electivis,” must
be referred to; in which he illustrates at once the chemical fact, and the meaning of
the term, by supposing A to be a substance united to c, and that on the addition of b,
the c is excluded, and the union of the latter sabstance with A is brought about ; in
which case he says 6 has a stronger elective attraction for A than c has*. He, in
common with most ehemists both of his own and of later times, takes it for granted
that if b decomposes Ac, it does 80 completely. The Swedish chemist gives the results
of nearly 2000 reactions in one table, the first column of which exhibits the following
substances arranged according to their affinity for sulpburic acid, commencing with
what he conceived the most powerful :—baryta, potash, soda, lime, magnesia, am-

* The whole paszage runs thus ;—* Sit A materies, quam aliz heterogenez a, 6, c, &c. adpetunt : ponatur
ulterius A 79 c unitum ad saturationem (quod per Ac in sequentibus indicamus), addito 6, ejusdem ambire
unionem cum exclusione rov c, A dicitur fortius adtrahere b, quam e, vel etiam 6 gaudere attractione electiva
fortiori, quam e: tandem Ab, addito a, priora vincula laxet, b respuat, et ejus loco a eligat, hinc intelligitur a rp
b vi attractiva preepollere, et ratione efficaciz seriem quamdam constituere a, b, et c.”
