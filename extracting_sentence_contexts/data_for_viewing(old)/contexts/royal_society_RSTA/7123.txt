action in certain fuels can be explained as being due to the accelerating effect which hydrogen
has on the flame velocity. This reduces the time available for knock to occur in the ‘end-gas’,

is large, this effect must be swamped by an accelerating action of hydrogen on the ‘end-gas’
reactions themselves.

Lead tetracthyl has a profound anti-knock effect in hydrogen (figure 49). This is directly
contrary to the result reported by Egerton et al. (1935). It seems likely that their failure to
detect the anti-knock effect of lead tetraethyl is due to the fact that they were not able
entirely to eliminate pre-ignition when running on hydrogen (Egerton & Moore 1949).
