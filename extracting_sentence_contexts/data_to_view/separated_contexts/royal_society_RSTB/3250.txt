With recent
species of Lycopodium the Araucarie agree in having strobili consisting of spirally-
disposed sporophylls, each with a single megasporangium,* but in shape the
Lycopodium sporangium differs from that of the Araucariez, a matter of secondary
importance. A more fundamental distinction is the fact that in one case we have
a naked sporangium and in the other a true seed. One of the many advances of
first-rate importance which we owe to Dr. Scorr,t is the demonstration of the
production of seed-like organs by an extinct Lycopodiaceous genus. The genus
Lepidocarpon is peculiar in having advanced a stage beyond that of the other
members of the Lycopodiales in the conversion by means of an outgrowth from the
sporophyll of a naked megasporangium into an organ which, as Scorr says, must
be included in the category of seeds,

In discussing the affinities of Lepidocarpon, Scorr writes: “Those who hold to
the belief that the Gymnosperms, or a part of them, sprang from Lycopods, may
find in the discovery of Lepidocarpon some support for their views.”
