So, then

0°
Now, if we move the paths of integration in z and w so that their real parts are positive but small,
we can use the formula (4.1) to evaluate the integral over t; however, the imaginary parts of z and
w can be large. We believe (4.1) holds uniformly when the real parts of the shifts are < 1/log T
but the imaginary parts of the shifts can be large, as large as T!~¢ and even larger. This has not
been proved to hold for (4.1), but has been proved, as mentioned above, by Bettin [7] in the case
of the second moment.
Now we use the fact that

Da p(s + 2) = Da+z,p+2(8)

and, assuming the uniform version of (4.1), replace [>° W(t/T)Da,a(s + 2)D),s(1 — s + w) dt in the
above by

Next, note that
