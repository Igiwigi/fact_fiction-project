E It will be observed that, with comparatively limited manuring, the nitrogen

is is, no doubt, explained by the fact frequently before referred to, that the nitrogen
Sf ammonia-salts distributes much less rapidly and freely than that of nitrate of soda ;
And, therefore, even with less laxuriance, and consequently less active competition, the
growth of a more limited number is favoured.

The percentage of grasses in the total produce, nevertheless, increased considerably
from one 8eparation-year to another. The increase was, however, almost exclusively
due to the increased proportion of the poor and comparatively surface-rooting Fesuca
ovina, Agrostis vulgaris, Holcus lanatus, and Anthozanthum odoratum ; which col-
lectively contributed in 1867, 32 ; in 1872, 60; and in 1877, 67 per cent. to the total
herbage. Besides these, Lolium perenne, Avena flavescens and pubescens, Poa trivialts,
and Dactylis glomerata, contributed comparatively small but fluctuating amounts,
without very obvious tendency either to increase or to decrease ; though Poa trivialis,
