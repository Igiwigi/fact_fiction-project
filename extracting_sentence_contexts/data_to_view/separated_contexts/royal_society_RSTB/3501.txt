We
can still further emphasise the resemblance to the precipitate by now, in the dark or
a weak light, turning the vessel upside down, so that the film lies uppermost, when
the aggregation figure is at once again produced (Plate 33, fig. 18). These experiments
can be repeated any number of times, so long as the Euglenze remain motile. In
these experiments we might, in fact, regard the living Euglene as a precipitate
consisting of motile particles. In the last experiment, if, instead of turning the vessel upside down, we simply
remove the light, the Euglenze will at once begin to move upwards, and almost at the
same time a delicate reticulation will be observed in the film. Examination under
a low power of the microscope shows that here also we have a slight movement
upwards and downwards, as in the ordinary aggregation, and it is no doubt
explainable in the same way.
