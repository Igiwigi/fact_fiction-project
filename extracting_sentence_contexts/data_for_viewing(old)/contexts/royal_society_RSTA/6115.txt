It is worth noticing, in particular, that because of the duality symmetry we can always associate Dw
with any given solution a(t) of post-big bang type, evolving from the singularity, a new solution 12
a~1(—#) of pre-big bang type, evolving towards the singularity. But it is also important to consider [8
the dilaton behaviour. In fact, the growing curvature solutions [2] and [4] (of pre-big bang type) 3S
are characterized by ¢ > 0, while the decreasing curvature solutions [1] and [3] (of post-big bang ,
type) are characterized by ¢ < 0. A transition from the pre- to the post-big bang regime must thus
correspond to a transition from ¢ > 0 to ¢ <0.

The behaviour of the pure dilaton field ¢ (and thus of the string coupling, see equation (2.8)),
may be different, however. It may be appropriate, for this purpose, to rewrite the four branches
(2.13) in terms of the ¢ variable as follows:

ax(tt) =(4)*"¥4 and g(t) =(+Vd—1)In(th). (2.14)

It can be easily checked that among the branches at growing curvature, the solution a—(—f)—
corresponding to the curve [4] and describing an expanding pre-big bang configuration—is
