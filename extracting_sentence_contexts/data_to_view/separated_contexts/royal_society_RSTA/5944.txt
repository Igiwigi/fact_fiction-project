For the
sake of brevity, we only present results for pressure incident waves, since the ones for the shear
waves are completely analogous. It is possible to infer from figures 8 and 9 that the scattered field
changes radically while changing the size of the shield. This fact is of great importance to optimize
shielding devices in terms of the scattered field: while it is quite simple to design a metamaterial
shield, it is not possible nowadays to optimize the reflected wave, but here, a calibration of the
size of the shield gives the possibility of exploring the reflected energy and/or to focus energy
on the metamaterial’s boundary or in the near surrounding of the shield. This, in turn, makes it
possible to focus energy in specific points for eventual subsequent re-use. Localization effects on the metamaterial’s boundaries can be observed in both figures 8 and 9,
indicating that the size of the considered sample has a great influence in this respect.
