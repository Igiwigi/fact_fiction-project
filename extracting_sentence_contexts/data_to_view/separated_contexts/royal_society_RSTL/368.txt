A partial de-
pression of the spine is, however, no uncommon occurrence,
even in very-young elephants; and I am convinced it happens
from external injury. I have been surprised to see the violence
used (in herds of wild elephants just taken) by the large ele-
phants, both male and female, putting the projecting part of
the upper jaw, from which the tusks grow out, on the spine of
the young ones, and pressing them to the ground, while they
roared from pain. -

It has been tated, that the sagacity of the elephant is 80
great, and his memory $0 retentive, that when once he has re-
ceived an injury, or been in bondage, and afterwards escapes,
it is not possible, by any art, again to entrap him. Great as my
partiality is for this noble animal, whose modes of life and ge-
neral sagacity TI have had s0 many opportunities of observing,
yet a regard to truth compels me to mention some facts, which
contradict that opinion:-' The: following history of an elephant
taken by Mr. Leexe,* of Longford Hall, Shropshire, contains
many interesting particulars on this subject. The-elephant was
a female, and was taken at-first, with a-herd of many others,
in” the year 1763, by Rajah Kisnux Mavunick, + who, about
8x months after, gave her to ABpook REezan, a man of some
rank and consequence in the district.
