After this there
is a map (3) copying that sequence of amino acids to produce our protein. Our analysis above
considers the minimal work needed to achieve map (3). At this point we actually have four copies of the information giving the protein; the DNA
segment, the mRNA, the ‘fictional sequence of amino acids’ and the actual protein. Next, the
‘fictional sequence of amino acids’ is broken back down into its constituent amino acids (leaving
us with the DNA, mRNA and protein, along with the baths) in a thermodynamically reversible
map (2’) that recovers the thermodynamic cost of map (2). After that the mRNA is broken
down into its constituent nucleotides in a map (1’) that (in an idealized process) recovers the
thermodynamic cost of map (1).
