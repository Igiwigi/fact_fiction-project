considerable effect. Humidity has no effect on the duration of life, but much on
the mortality, the optimum being at or near saturation, at least for tachinoides. But
individual puparia differ greatly from one another in this matter, two out of 15
emerging at 30°C and 11% relative humidity, ie., a saturation deficiency of
28-1 mm.

Physiological studies made on the puparium show that humidity affects the loss
of weight, which is nearly proportional to saturation deficiency, even over a wide
range of humidity and at two temperatures. The material which is lost is water,
and the puparium does not compensate for high evaporation by burning fat or other
reserves, and so producing water of metabolism. The high mortality observed in
puparia of tachinoides at low humidities is therefore due to loss of water. The
puparium, in fact, behaves very like a fasting Cimex (MELLANBY, 19326).

The effect of experimental conditions is much influenced by the age of the
puparium. The temperature which is fatal in middle life is some 2° C (3-6° F)
higher than that which is fatal at the beginning or end, Table XVII. Puparia in
middle life can also survive longest if submerged, Table XIX. It has also been
observed, under a great variety of external conditions, that death (detected by sudden
loss of weight) is commonest at the beginning or end of the puparial stage. It is
clear, therefore, that experiments, if they are to yield precise or comparable results,
must be made with puparia of known age.

It is a matter of some interest that the differences between the puparia of Glossina
tachinoides and submorsitans are slight. But when they differ, that of tachinoides is the
