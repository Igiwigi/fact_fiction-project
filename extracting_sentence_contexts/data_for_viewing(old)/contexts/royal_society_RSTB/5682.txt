From this stage two changes occur together. The posterior rim (or ventral lip of
the blastopore) grows dorsally and lifts the mesodermal cells to the level of the chordal
cells, while the two ares of chordal cells, 16 in all, slide in to form four columns of four
cells each (five in the case of Clavelina), in line with the main axis of the embryo. At
this stage there are yet but 16 chordal cells, the blastopore is on the point of closure,
and the neural groove appearing. Growth in length now commences. The neutral
folds first appear at the posterior end and fuse dorsally to form the neural canal, and
for a very short while this is connected by the neurenteric canal with the archenteron.
The connection, however, is rapidly obliterated by the posterior growth of the
notochord.

The whole of the growth in length posterior from the blastopore, in fact, seems
wholly to be dependent on the notochord, and it becomes desirable therefore to
see how it is effected. As already described, at the moment of closure of the blastopore
there exist 16 chordal cells, arranged in four rows of four and one cell deep (see
fig. 18, H, J). From the figures of both Conxiin and Van BENnEDEN and Jutin the
final number of notochordal cells seems to be from 60 to 64, and they become eventually
arranged into a single column. Therefore, during the elongation of the notochord and
the formation of the tail, several changes occur. Two divisions of each notochord cell
must occur to change the first number of 16 into about 64, and if the figures already
referred to are examined it will be seen that this process is coincident with the sliding
movements that result in the formation of a single and long column of cells. During
the first division of the notochord cells, which is a horizontal cleavage, the wpper and
the lower four rows of four cells thus formed slide and interdigitate to form an upper
