These are in fact the integro-differential equations (6.10) reduced to real form.
We observe that L”’,., is a function of the F-functions only, and M”, a function of the
G-functions only.

Let us now consider the case where u, is an odd function of » ; d?u,/dy® is then also odd,
and we have by (6.17)
