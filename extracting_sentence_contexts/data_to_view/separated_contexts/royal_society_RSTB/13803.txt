This loop updates the intended results of
the motion for sensory surfaces and limb positions as well. Third, the cerebellum in mammals has been repurposed from
its marine role in sensory predictions, such as filtering the effects
of water turbulence caused by respiration through gills on the
body surface [215] and calibrating the effects of unexpected ves-
tibular challenges on upcoming visual and somatosensory input
[216]. Massive input from the motor and premotor cortex, and in
fact most of the cortex, via the pons and deep cerebellar nuclei,
registers the proposed movement and corrects it for the altered
load of variable limb positions, and the body state (for example,
fatigue, damage or pain) [217]. These computed updates are
conveyed back to the motor thalamus via an entirely new tract
in mammals, the superior cerebellar peduncle. Finally, the hip-
pocampus receives a processed version of the ongoing cortical
state via the entorhinal cortex, as part of the recording of succes-
sive scenes generating an autobiographical timeline, and linking
successive scenes to generate an allocentric space, or generate a
trajectory of a planned movement through a previously gener-
ated space [185,203,218].
