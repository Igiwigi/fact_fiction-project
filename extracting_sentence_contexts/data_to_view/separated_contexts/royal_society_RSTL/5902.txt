In other experiments numbers approximating
to these were obtained. We have not the data to determine with certainty the precise mode of the formation
of this body. The simplest hypothesis which coincides with the ascertained facts, is
that 7 equivalents of the graphic acid give by their decomposition 6 of the new body. We have 7(C,, H, O,)=1512 and 3(C,, H, O,)=990 and 1512 : 990: : 100: 65:48, 69:48
being the amount of residue found. On this view it would be possible to form the new substance by the elimination of
water, carbonic acid, and carbonic oxide from the original body, according to the equation

7(C,, H, O,)=3(C,, H, 0,)+6H,0+6CO,+5CO.
