a very regular dome. It is confined to the higher parts of the island and the upper
Sparts of yalleys. Though nearly allied to, it is easily distinguished from the
Foregoing by its arching narrow delicate leayes, and its few large druped fruits.
t is also a very much smaller plant. But certain trees on the island scem to
Spossess characters intermediate between these two species and may he hybrids.
Fhis is, however, a difficult matter to settle. Tts local name is derived from its
Bommon use as a rafter for huts, for which its close-grained and hard wood when
ture well fits it.
Z These are the only two species T found on the island, but Sir Henry Barkly has
Zent home figures of two (and of one a specimen) other species from the island. These
Are P. wtilis, Bory, and P. odoratissimus, Linn, f. His figures and specimen of the
-Jormer are most distinetly those of P. Â»tilis, Bory, but whilst T do not dispute the
Fact that this plant may have existed or may exist on the island, T may notice that
ir Henry Barkly's drawing and specimen are of a tree grown in the Botanic Garden
In Mauritius from $eeds which Mr. Duncan is said to have brought from
Rodriguez. T think this takes away considerably from the value of the observation,
Zspecially as the trees Mr. Horne pointed out to me as from Rodriguez are growing
Flosely surrounded by Mauritius ones. At the same time I may remark that in the
Foung state, hefore many branches have been given off, P. v/ilis, Bory, and P.
Fieterocarpus, Balf. fil., are 80 much alike as to be almost undistinguishable,
Smd I may have in that way missed P. wtilis, Bory, in Rodriguez. As to P.
Fdoratissimus, Linn. f., I can only say I never saw it, and it must be very scarce, if
there at all ; and it seems to me very strange that such a very marked form should
be unknown by the inhabitants, especially as several of them were employed
- by Mr. Jenner, the magistrate of the island, at the request of Sir Henry Barkly,
