FS,
concerning the Formation of Pebbles.

o

Dear Sir,
Read April 2. YN my late Searches after Sands, Peb-
74: bles, and other Foſlils, in our County

of Norfolk (forme whereof 1 had the Pleaſure to ſend
you not long ago) I made ſuch occaſional Obſerya-
tions on the Situation and Condition of the ſeveral
Bodies 1 met with, as Reaſon muſt, I think, ſuggeſt
to eyery Man that conſiders them. I ſhall trouble
you with no Hypotheſis, nor form any random
Gueſles, to account for ſuch their Situation, and the
Condition wherein - they. are found ; but, if a Rela-
tion of true Facs,- and Concluſions naturally dedu-
cible therefrom, may proye acceptable, they arc in-
tirely at your Service. In all Strata of Pebbles, that I have yet examined,
there are ſome which are broken, and whoſe Pieces
lic together, or very near cach other; but, as Bodies
of ſuch Hardneſs could not be broken without ſome
conſiderable Force or Violence, their Situation
implies, that they ſuffered ſuch Force or Violence
as- broke their Parts aſunder, in or near the Place
whete they at preſent lie. Others again have had Pieces broken from them,
though not the leaſt Fragment of thoſe Pieces can
now be found :* From whence we , muſt conclude,
that whatcyer might be the Cauſe of their FraQture,
they muſt either haye been broken at ſome Place

diſtant from where they now lic, or the Pieces broker
from them muſt at ſome time or other haye been-
remoyed to ſome diſtant Place.
