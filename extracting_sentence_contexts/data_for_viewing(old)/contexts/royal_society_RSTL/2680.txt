sional irregular fluctuations would be inevitable. The influence of earthquakes upon
the temperature of hot springs is also admitted; and it would be very desirable to
know from continued observations whether abrupt changes are not frequent, similar
but on a smaller scale to that, for example, which raised the temperature of the
Source de la Reine at Bagneres de Luchon by about 75* on the occasion of the
earthquake of Lisbon in 1755. Most curious effects have likewise occurred on occa-
sion of earthquakes to many springs *. Baron HumBoLpT did me the honour to
mention a cireumstance perhaps connected with a similar cause. Two springs in
South America, at a distance from any active volcano, have increased in temperature
by 4Â® centigrade since the period of his observations, as determined by M. BovussN-
GAULT.

It is a 8ingular fact that we are not only unacquainted with the progressive varia-
tions of temperature in springs during long periods of time, but even with the dinrnal
or monthly changes to which many thermal waters are probably subject. The nsual
Statement of the constaney of the heat of such springs at all seasons is abundantly
general, but perfectly vague. I have reason to believe that, except in the case of
particularly abundant springs, it does not hold true; but I am unacquainted with
any systematic experiments on the snbject, although I have made many inquiries
on the subject in almost every place I have visited where the medicinal importance
of the springs had rendered them objects of attention to physicians or intelligent
persons generally. Such information as I have been able to collect will be men-
tioned in alluding to the particular localities : T will only observe, that the abs0-
lute constancy of the temperature of springs is a circumstance in itself impossible,
owing to the variation of temperature of the uppermost strata through which they
