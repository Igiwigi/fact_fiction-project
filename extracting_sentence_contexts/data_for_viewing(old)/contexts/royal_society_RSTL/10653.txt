Z These experiments on the frontal lobes show a remarkable absence of any discover-
=ble physiological symptoms in connexion with the almost entire destruction of the
Sprefrontal regions, or anterior &wo-thirds of the frontal convolutions ; and only tem-
Eporary impairment or paralysis of the lateral movements of the head and eyes as
Athe result of lesions, extensively destroying the cortex at the base of the superior
and middle frontal convolutions (centre 12). In none of the cases, however, was the
destruction of this centre on both sides quite complete. Tt was most extensive in
Experiment 21, in which also the prefrontal regions were removed.
This case, however, owing to the s8ndden death of the animal sbortly after the
operation, did not afford much opportunity for observation of the effects of the lesion.
But negative facts of great importance were demonstrated in this case. There was
no affection of sensation general or special, and the limbs, face, and tail were capable of
voluntary movement.
There was apparent total paralysis of the lateral movements of the head and eyes,
and inability to maintain the upright position, though backward and forward moye-
