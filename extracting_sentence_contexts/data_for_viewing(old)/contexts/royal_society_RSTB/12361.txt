and across communities within cities. Answers will depend
on the particular social, environmental and_ technical
context of each city; in other words, there is no a priori
reason to expect ‘one size fits all’ solutions to cities’ climate
change hazards.

incorporating a systems view and redefining risk in the questions need to be addressed in the contexts of individual


cities: their local biome, climate and hydrogeology (e.g.
sources of surface and groundwater); the magnitude and
types of anticipated climate change hazards (e.g. droughts,
extreme rainfall, sea-level rise); their specific SET character-
istics (e.g. spatial segregation of risks, the age, type and
distribution of green and grey infrastructure, and the social
barriers to implementation of NBS); and opportunities to
combine green with grey infrastructure. An important
