It not infrequently happens that the same line occurs on two different plates taken
at the same pressure with different amounts of reversal (see page 149). ANDERSON*
has discussed the possible effect of the duration of the exposure on the widths of
reversed lines, but the plates taken during the progress of this research were all
sufficiently exposed for this cause to be negligible, and the determining factors are
the amount and the temperature of the vapour in front of the arc, which are liable to
variations on account of the fluctuations in the current which accrue from the
continual striking of the are, and from its comparatively short duration. On this account the photographs show an integration of the effects of the
temporary distributions of the vapour round the are, and in view of this fact the
labour of measuring the widths of the reversals has not been undertaken, especially
as the widths are different on different plates at the same pressure, but inspection of
the plates brings forward the fact that in general those lines which reverse similarly
are also displaced by equal amounts under pressure. For example, the lines b4, do,
d2,e1 are reversed symmetrically and have approximately the same widths of reversal,
and their wings are of the same nature ; it will be seen, too, that their displacement
curves also agree. Lines b1, cl, d1, e0 also reverse similarly and equally, and they
are displaced to the same extent (Diagram VIII., p. 151), The converse is not
necessarily true.
