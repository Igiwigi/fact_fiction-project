development of the true-blood system. Future researches will inevitably show that in
the Entozoa the blood-proper system is a very suhordinate element of the organism.
For the maintenance of the living solids, 80 striking in these animals is the © sim-
plicity” of their structure, the chylaqueous fluid will be found physiologically suffi-
cient. An attentive study of the fluids will result in the discovery of an unfailing
clue whereby in these animals to reconcile with physiological principles the paradox
of the arrangement and histology of the solids. By no other road can this desirable
point be attained#.

* I have recently studied with great attention the valuable contributions of M, StzvoLD! and M. Var Be-
NEDEN*? to helminthology. I am persuaded that these distinguizghed men have not yet discovered the path
which is destined to conduct the physiologist to a true understanding of the organization of the Entozoa, I
warrant this bold =tatement by the facts which already my own labours have enabled me to establigh. The
fluids will unerringly conduct the future student to a perfect comprehension of the 8olids. 'The 8olid elements of
these paradoxical organisms will ever remain insoluble enigmas if studied independently of, and without refer-
