This seems to reduce the cause we are looking for to an
alternative that may be determined ; for if it can be shown
that a disposition of the rays of light to be alternately re-
flected and transmitted cannot account for the phanomena
which this hypothesis is to explain, a proposition of accounting
for them by modifications that may be proved, even on the
very principles of Sir I. NEwTox to have an existence, will
find a ready admittance. I propose, therefore, now to give
some arguments, which will remove an obstacle to the
investigation of the real cause of the formation of the con-
centric rings ; for after the very plausible supposition of the
alternate fits, which agrees so wonderfully well with a number
of facts that have been related, it will hardly be attemptedÂ»
if these should be set aside, to ascribe some other inherent pro-
perty to the rays of light, whereby we might account for
them ; and thus we shall be at liberty to turn our thoughts

to a cause that may be found in the modifications arising
from the action of the surfaces which have been proved to be
the only essential ones in the formation of rings.
