Of the remaining families of the Ostariophyse the Characinidse closely resemble
the Cyprinidi in so far us the points now under disvussion are concerned, and of the
Gyronotidse it may be said that they exhibit a somewhat less specialized condition of
the ai-bladder and Weberian ossicles than any of the preceding families, although
Abviously related to the Cyprinoid type. oe The conclusion suggested hy these facts seems to us to be this—that, physiologi-
@lly considered, the most important distinctive features of the Weberian mechanism

Bulder, which in the former attains tis maximuni degree of specialization as an organ
@apied for the registration of varying hydrostatic pressures,
