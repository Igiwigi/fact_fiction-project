9 x 10°1 of petrol. To initiate the fusion reaction (3.1), the charged deuterium and
tritium nuclei must get close enough for the strong nuclear force to act and bind
the helium nucleus together. To get this close, they must approach each other fast
enough to overcome their mutual electrical repulsion. Thus, a gas of deuterium
and tritium must be heated to over 100 million degrees Celsius (10 KeV)—10
times hotter than the core of the sun—for sufficient nuclei to have the required

kinetic energy to fuse. This gas is in fact a plasma since, above a few thousands
degrees, inter-atomic collisions knock the electrons out of the atoms to form a
mixture of separated nuclei and electrons.

In the temperature range 100-200 million degrees Celsius the fusion power per
unit volume (Prusion) from a D-T plasma is given roughly by

Prusion ~ 0.08P? (MWm"*), (3.4)

where P is the plasma pressure in atmospheres. It is immediately clear from
equation (3.4) that the D-T reaction produces commercially viable power
densities (megawatts per metre cubed) at practically sustainable pressures
(a few atmospheres). The remarkably large D—T cross section puts fusion power
