This indicates that the values (34) for Â« and g, which accord well with the relation
between the induced and inducing fields in the case of the diurnally periodic variations,

are not consistent with it in the case of the slower, aperiodic, variation in the later stages
of a magnetic storm. While it was natural and proper, in the first instance, when
considering the daily magnetic variations alone, to try to represent the earth by a
uniformly conducting sphere, surrounded by an outer non-conducting layer, it now
appears that this simple model is inconsistent with the observed facts, when both the
daily and the storm-time variations are considered. 5.5. The discrepancy with the simple model (34) is further illustrated by fig.
