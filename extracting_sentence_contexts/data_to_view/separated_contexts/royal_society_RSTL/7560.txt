When the total number of conditions is 4, the question may be solved by
ZEUTHEN'S method, viz. by determining the line-pairs and point-pairs of the system 4Z,
with the proper numerical coefficients, and thence deducing the values of the character-
istics (4Z - ) and (4Z/). A few cases are in fact thus solved in Zxurux's work. 64. (2%) By the foregoing functional method. Tt is to be observed that there is a
difference in the form of the functional equation, and th

l : at the general solution is always
given in the form, Particular Solution + Constant, 80 that there is only a single con-

stant to be determined by special considerations.
