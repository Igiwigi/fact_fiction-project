Z cells, which in the perpendicular sections appear to be nearly cubical, are about 0025
Zin diameter. Plate LIV. fig. 36 is an enlarged representation of three columns of them
S as they appear in yertical sections. Plate LLV. fig. 29, h, shows how large a portion of
& = as bark is occupied by this tissue; but as we approach the periphery we find that its
= cells gradually become more elongated vertically, as shown in the enlarged figure 37,
& and gradually pass into the outer prosenchymatous layer (&), a few of the cells of which
Z are scen in the longitudinal section fig. 38, which is drawn to the same scale as
S figs. 36 & 37, At the outer surface the prosenchymatous cells have only a diameter of
E from -00083 to 0012. Cloxely associated with the stems jast described are considerable
S mumbers of smaller ones of yarious dimensions, including mere twigs, like that repre-
sented in Plate LV. fig. 40. The structure in all these 8maller stems is s0 exactly
identical with the large ones in every respect, save in the more cylindrical form and in
the shape of the yascular bundle, that, eyen had we no direct proof of the fact, there
could be no doubt as to their being portions of the same plant. Plate L,VI. fig. 39
represents one of the larger examples of this form.
The central yascular bundle (4) exhibits a crescentic section with incurved angles and
Vith three light tooth-like projections in the interior of the concave margin. When I
first called attention to these stems, IT had not ascertained the relation of the form just
described to that with the hour-glass bundle (Plate LV. fig. 28). Hence I proposel

putable evidence that the two are parts of the same plant, and that fig. 39 is but
