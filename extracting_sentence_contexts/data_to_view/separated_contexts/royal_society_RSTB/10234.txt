Synthetic languages

The transition towards a complex language is a recent one
and had an enormous relevance to human evolution. It is
also a hard problem [204]. One of the obvious facts is the gap
between the complexity of human language and any other
known biological communication system. The gap is due to
the presence of a grammar that allows the generation of recur-
sive structures of potentially infinite complexity [1,205]. Another crucial observation concerns language acquisition
in children.
