The talented editor of the Zoological Journal has also, in his review of Mr. Trome-
8oNn's work, expressed his doubts as to the universality of the fact of metamorphosis
taking place in the Crustacea; and in the eighteenth number of that work he has
stated the confirmation which his doubts had received by the publication of Dr. Raruxe's work, adding, that if there existed no optical delusion or other cause of
error in the isolated observations which Mr. Tromeson has given us, the difference
of organization between a Macrourous and a Brachyurous Decapod is much greater
than either analogy or anatomy would have led him to suspect.
