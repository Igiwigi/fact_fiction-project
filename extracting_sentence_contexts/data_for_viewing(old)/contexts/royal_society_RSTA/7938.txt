Let us consider an air layer 8 mm. in thickness and heated from below; when the
heater is switched on and tobacco smoke is blown in there appear, momentarily, a number
of columns of clear air which can be seen to be ascending from the lower surface, fig. 19,
Plate 4 ; this occurs only when the bottom is slightly warm. The instability disappears
almost immediately and the smoke forms a uniform layer in the space. After this :


A. GRAHAM ON SHEAR PATTERNS IN AN UNSTABLE LAYER OF ATR. 293

(a) The smoke comes away from the edges of the layer leaving a clear space about
1 em. wide all round. This indicates an ascent in the centre of the layer with descent
at the edges. The clear space is due to the fact that the smoke settles ; the velocity
of the air is very slow.

(b) Soon after the separation of the smoke from the edges a vortex roll forms along
each edge in the clear space.

(c) The smoke collects at several places and thins out in others.

(d) The number of these regions increases. This shows that as the bottom gets
hotter the number of centres of ascent gets greater.

(e) At several places round cells appear, more or less regularly disposed ; they have
very slow ascent in the centres, and are shown in fig. 16, Plate 4.
