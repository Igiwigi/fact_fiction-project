In theory, these issues can be studied in any species, but in
practice this work is constrained by the possibility of testing


individuals in the early stage of their lives. Most mammals and
birds are altricial and there are practical and ethical issues
related to the possibility of testing young individuals. Develop-
mental psychologists have devised clever experimental
protocols to circumvent such problems in humans, particularly
habituation procedures and_ violation-of-expectation para-
digms. However, this poses a further problem: the fact that
studies done at different ages may not be fully comparable
because of the different methods used. In fairness, there are a
few warm-blooded precocial species that could be investigated
at an early age; for example, guinea pigs, hares and wildebeests
among mammals, and ostriches, quails and ducks among
birds. To date, numerical abilities have been systematically
investigated in just one of these precocial species: the domestic
chick (see [88]).

By contrast, the vast majority of fish are fully independent
at birth. The same test can often be used in young and adults.
Manipulation of experience is generally easier in fish than in
