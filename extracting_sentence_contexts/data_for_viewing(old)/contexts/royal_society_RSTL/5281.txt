of doubt whether the propodium is developed or not, and this question can be settled
by embryology alone ; but for the present, I think, it may be fairly presumed that it
is represented by the tentaculigerous hood of Pneumodermon and by the tentaculige-
rous lobes of Clio; following in this case a very common tendency (exemplified in
all the Cephalopods and in many Gasteropods) to become developed over and in front,
of the mouth#®.

As Cuvier demonstrated, there is no © mantle” in Pneumodermon and ClioF ; the
body of these mollusks answering precisely to that of a Firoloides. The relation of
the gill-laminze and of the small anomalous shell in Pneumodermon sufficiently cor-
roborates Cuvigr's view. Gills are never placed upon the outer surface of a mantle ;
and if anything answers to such an organ it must be the small space covered by the
rudimentary sbell, so that the relations of the parts are, in fact, similar in Pneumoder-
mon to what we find in Firola and Carinaroides.

Finally, new parts, the * ale,” make their appearance in these genera and give its
character to the order (figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, ep).

Considering the position and relation of these organs as distinct developments from
the upper part of the sides of the foot, and the fact that their nerves arise, like those
of the foot, from the pedal ganglia, I propose to consider them as parts of the foot
and to call them the © epipodia.” It has been long since shown by Van Bexzpen
and others that they have nothing to do with the respiratory function.

In this subtype the intestine opens on the right ventral side of the neck, and dis-
