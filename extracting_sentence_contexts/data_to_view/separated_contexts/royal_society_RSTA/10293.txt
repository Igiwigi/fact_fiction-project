SS0ON after the discovery of the new gases, neon, krypton and xenon, by Sir WiiitaM
Ramsay and Dr. TRAVERS, in 1898, measurements were made of the lines of their
smission spectra by means of a large prism spectrograph in University College. In
‘pyiew of the fact that a large Rowland grating apparatus was at that time in process
Spf erection, it did not appear worth while to publish this first series of measurements,
‘Eis I was in hopes of being able to obtain with the help of the grating far more
Frccurate results than was possible from measurements of the photographs taken with
he prism apparatus. Since the commencement of this work three series of measure-
-Qnents have been published, one by Runce* of certain lines in the krypton spectra,
Sand two by Liverne and Dewar of the lines in the spectra of the light + and heavy {
peonstituents of atmospheric air respectively. All these measurements contain only
“the principal lines and, moreover, extend only a short distance into the ultra-violet
Segion.
