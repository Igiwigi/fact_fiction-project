substance is brought into contact with them, which distinctly proves the possession
of a voluntary power over the muscles connected with them, and which, as before
shown, are supplied from the moto-sensitive columns. Quantity of Respiration. The very important fact established by Dr. Epwanvs in the higher animals, that a
greater quantity of oxygen is required in the adult state in proportion to the capacity
of the respiratory apparatus than in the earlier or infant condition of the animal, and
that in a state of hybernation less even is required than in the infant state, is equally
true as regards also the air-breathing Invertebrata, particularly the class of insects. The larva of Tchneumon Atropos, STEPH., concealed within the body of the larya of
Sphinz ligustri, L1xN., and preying upon its substance, although provided with mi-
nute spiracles which lead into extremely delicate trachez distributed through its
body, and doubtless maintaining a certain degree of respiration, requires not a twen-
tieth part the amount of atmospheric air for its 8support which it requires in its perfect
condition. The larva of the wild bank bees, Anthophora retusa, STEPH., and Zucera
longicornis, STepn., and of many others, confined in their cells in the earth ; of the
Sand Wasps and Spheges, buried deeply in the soil ; of the Cerambyces and Ptinidee,
and other wood-boring insects ; and of the Searabei, Lucani, Tipule, and Musce,
many of which live in the most noxious and unaerated places, can exist for a very
long time in situations in which the same insects in their perfect state would s00n
perish.
