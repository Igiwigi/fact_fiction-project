In the general

& structure of the walls of the anterior chamber, and in the relations and attachments

;, of their principal sheets of fibres to fixed parts of the skeleton and to the tripodes,
Bagroides exhibits no perceptible difference from Macrones. We have described the
= walls of the air-bladder as being thicker and more rigid than usual, but this statement
A Aoes uot accurately apply to the antero-lateral regions of the anterior chamber, for
= there the walls are extremely thin over definitely circumscribed areas exactly
co-extensive with the post-temporal plates. In each area the wall of the bladder
5 appears to be formed mainly, if not exclusively, by the vertically disposed fibres of
2 the inner stratum of the tunica externa, with the addition of the extremely thin

â€˜2 tunica interna, Both areas bulge forwards into the concayities of their respective

"2 post-tomporal plates.

8 The Weberian ossicles are very similar to those of Macrones, except that the heel-

6 like process of the tripns is of nnusual length, being, in fact, as long as the posterior

or inwardly-euryed segment of the crescentic process. The intercalarium has tolerably
stout ascending and horizontal processes. Rita erucigera.
