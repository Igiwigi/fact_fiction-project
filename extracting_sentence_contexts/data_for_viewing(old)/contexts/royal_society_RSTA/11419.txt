gprobable error. We conclude that fecundity is most certainly inherited. The
‘gegression found is, however, only about two-fifths of what is required by the law of
Ancestral heredity.
5 (v.) It has ie suggested that fertility or fecundity might alternate in two
“wenerations ; when the offspring are numerous their offspring might have less fertile
ar fecund offspring. I do not see how this would be possible without its exercising
n influence on the correlation of two generations, for we must come to one fertile
a by an infertile generation. But I had made preparations in my alphabet of
‘nares for testing the correlation between mares and their granddams, and I went on
to the construction of a table, although the results for mares and their dams showed
‘Qne that whatever result might be reached, it would be within the probable error of
rthe observations. I reached this conclusion in the following manner: If we go back
Sne generation we introduce, owing to the nature of the gonad, so much fictitious
Exorrelation and so much in-and-in breeding that the coefficient of inheritance is
reduced to two-fifths or less of what its value should be according to the law of
Bincestr: al heredity. In going back two generations we come to fewer mares, to more
Sin- and-in breeding, and to just the type of famous old mare, whose breeder kept her
Bt the stud long after she was sterile. I expected accordingly a great “a gary al
= in the fecundity of granddams and a double drop, something like 3 x 2, in the
value of the regression as indicated by the law of ancestral heredity. ths would
Preduce the apparent regression to about 3 X 3 of ‘15, or to about *025, say, a value
about equal to the probable error of the table. The results actually reached are given
in Table XV., and we find, if the subscript g refer to granddam :

M,, = 6845, M, = °6232,
