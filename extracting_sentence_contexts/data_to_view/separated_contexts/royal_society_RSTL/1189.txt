E. and easterly along the
Flemish and Dutch coasts, until it is lost near the entrance
of the Sleeve, in the great body of tide from the northward
and eastward. The opposite tides which meet in the North Sea do not
meet in a line directly across any part of it, but in a diagonal
line, extending from the Kentish Knock to the entrance of
the Sleeve; where there is no tide, but a strong current,
which almost always sets from the Jutland to the Norway
side in the Sleeve; and which most probably proceeds from
the eddy, produced by the great body of water coming round
the Naze of Norway, meeting the remains of the western tide,
aided by the reaction of the Jutland shore. In fact, there is
hardly any tide observable between the Horne reef and the
entrance of the Sleeve. The tides thus meeting in a diagonal line in the North
Sea, gently and gradually blend their waters together, with-
out causing the least tumultuous appearance, exhibiting
merely a little foamy rippling, which can be discerned in fine
weather only, when the general mass of water is. perfectly
smovth. To prove farther that this is the nature of the tides in
this part of the North Sea, let a ship, for instance, sail from
North Yarmouth, or Harwich, for the Texel or Flushing on


between Fairleigh and the North Foreland. 227

the opposite coast, with the wind from the north-eastward, 80
that she can lay her course on the /arboard tack; the pilot
will prefer getting under weigh at high water, on the Eng-
lish coast, to take the ebb tide under his lee; and if he can
get half channel over during the ebb tide, or by the time of
low water on the English side, he will find a flood tide from
thence, setting along the opposite coast, which will also set
under his lee for six hours longer, running in the same direc-
tion as the ebb tide did on the English side of the channel ;
and thus he will carry twelve hours tide with him; whereas
had he continued on either side, he would have had a regu-
lar six hours tide each way; with this difference, that he
would always have the tide setting in opposite directions
on the one side, to what it would be on the other.
