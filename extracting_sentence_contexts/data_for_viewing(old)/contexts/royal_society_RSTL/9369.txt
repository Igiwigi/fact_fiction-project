DR. A. SCHUSTER ON THE SPECTRA OF METALLOIDS. 47

5. The Continuous Spectrum of Oxygen.

Wirrxer (Poa. Ann., 137, p. 350) has shown that when the pressure in his vacuum

tube is gradually increased, the background begins to be illuminated at a, pressure of
280 m.m. This illumination, according to him, firsb extends from the solar line E to a
point about half way between F and G. As the pressure was increased, the continuous
spectrum extended more towards both sides, bub chiefly towards the blue. I do not
"know whether this continuous illumination of the background is due to the same
cause as the continuous spectrum, which is seen under the cireumstances presently
to be described. There is nothing antagonistic to known facts in the assumption
that the vibration of the gas, though chiefly taking place in certain definite periods,
can be disturbed by mutual impacts in swch a way that a slight admixture of vibra-
tions of all periods is produced which increases as the pressure is increased. At any
rate, if this 1s the cause of the continuous spectrum which is seen under great pressure,
ib has nothing to do with the continuous spectrum which appears by a reduction of
temperature, and which is not the background to bright lines, but forms the whole
visible -8pectrum. The following facts seem to me to prove that oxygen at the
lowest temperature at which ib is luminous gives a continuous spectrum â€”

1. The wide parb of a GeissLER bube filled with pure oxygen generally shines
with a faint yellow light ; when analysed by the prism, this yellow light gives a
continuous spectrum.
