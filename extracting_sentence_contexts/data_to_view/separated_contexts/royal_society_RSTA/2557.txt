Hilbert leafed through them carefully and did not note anything.’ According
to Reid [20], Hilbert was aware of the changes but was not concerned. It is a fact of life that mathematicians do make mistakes. Another fact of life is that the majority of
them are of a trivial nature and can be corrected ‘without major changes to the statements’. There
are bad mistakes, related to haste, or complete lack of vision, where nothing can be salvaged. But there are also good mistakes, which show that there is something fundamental out there,
that we do not appreciate or comprehend.
