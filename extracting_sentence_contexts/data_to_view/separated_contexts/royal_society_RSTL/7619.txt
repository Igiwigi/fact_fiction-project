A few substances, of which the metamorphosis into gaseous products and yapours is
developed by much less powerful impulses from without than those just instanced, the
explosion of which is therefore determined by but little elevation of temperature or by

the application of slight disturbing impulses of a mechanical or chemical nature, would
appear at first sight only to a small extent snsceptible of modifying influences similar to
the above. The direct application of but little heat, or the production of a slight
increase of temperature by gentle friction or pressure, or by the development of chemical
action in some very small portions of the mass, suffices to explode the chloride or
iodide of nitrogen, or silver-fulminate; and the explosion of one particle deyelopes an
impulse s0 greatly in excess of that required to disturb the chemical equilibrium
existing among the molecules of the mass, that instantaneous decomposition ensnes
throughout. The great proneness to change of these substances when exposed to a
Slight disturbing influence, is illustrated by the fact that a concussion imparted to the
air in a spacious apartment in which the iodide of nitrogen has been placed, by means
of a small explosion or detonation, or even by the violent jamming of a door, suffices to
bring about the explosion of that snbstance. But even if these bodies be 80 confined
that an initial resistance is offered to the escape of the gaseous products of their explo-
sion, the violence of the detonation is greatly increased, the development of explosive
force being restricted to the instant of rupture of the envelope by the compressed gases. 'Thus the violence of explosive force exerted by a mall quantity of silver-fulminate, con-
fined in a case of stout shect metal, is very decidedly greater than if a corresponding
quantity be enclosed in metal foil, or freely exposed to air and inflamed in the same
manner.
