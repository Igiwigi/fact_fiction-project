OBSERVATIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ORNITHORHYNCHUS. 45

The portions of the blastoderm containing the streak and its environment were
removed for sectioning, double-embedded in cedar-oil-celloidin and paraffin, and cut
in series of 10 micron sections. Their examination showed that a primitive knot was
in fact present at some distance from what proved to be the anterior end of the
primitive streak (cf. text-fig. 7) just as we had previously found to be the case in
Specimens D and DD. It was situated pretty close to the cut edge of the
hemispherical segment in which it lay. It had escaped detection partly, no doubt,
owing to the difficulty of thoroughly investigating the margin of the hemisphere, but
partly also from the fact that the cellular tissue of the knot in this specimen was less
permeated by yolk spherules, and was therefore less opaque, than was the case in
other specimens of the stage. At all events we failed to detect the knot on surface
examination, and its apparent absence nonplussed us not a little, so that its later
discovery in the section-series came as a welcome relief from our perplexity.

The fourth specimen in our possession, representative of the stage under notice, is
designated in our list as Specimen Y. The circumstances of our access to this eg:
are somewhat interesting. Some few years ago one of us received from the Australian
Museum a spirit-specimen labelled as the pregnant left uterus of an Ornithorhynchus
shot on the Cudgegong River, N.S.W., on August 11, 1884, by Mr. A. G. Hamixton,
now of Mount Kembla, N.S.W.
