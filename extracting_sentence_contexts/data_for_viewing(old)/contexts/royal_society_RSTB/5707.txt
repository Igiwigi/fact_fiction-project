are considered by Bertin (1925) to be developed from the ‘common form at
Cambridge, Gasterosteus aculetaus var. gymnura. Since the variety semiarmata was
not found at other times of the year anywhere within at least twelve miles of Baitsbite,
the appearance of this variety in the Baitsbite shoal seems to support Brrrry’s theory.
This theory of the origin of this variety also supports the contention that one race of
fish only is present in the Baitsbite shoal. The belief that there is one local race here
is based on its constant appearance at this one place, and that the range of sizes is
constant.

This shoal of fish was rather heavily infected with Glugea anomalum (identified
according to SrempeLt, 1904). Schizstocephalus, on the other hand, was rare among
these fish. The frequency of occurrence of these parasites was reversed in samples
taken from habitats around Cambridge town, a fact which also points to the Baitsbite
fish being a pure race.

Methods of Obtaining Samples.

Where possible the fish were caught with a coarse-mesh tow-net. Where the water
was too shallow or too overgrown to use this, a hand ring net was used.

The collections made were of two types, those merely to collect male fish and those
intended to give a representative sample of the constitution of the race of fish at any
locality at one time.

When the tow-net was used at Baitsbite, it was sunk and drawn gently under the
