ROBERTS ON BIOGENESIS. Juices and tissues of animals and plants are capable of producing organisms without
infection by extraneous germs. In the third section the facts adduced in the two
previous sections are considered in their bearing on the origin of Bacteria and Torule,
and some of the alleged cases of abiogenesis are tested experimentally. The experiments were all contrived on a plan which fayoured not only the birth but
the continuous growth of any organisms which made their appearance. The materials
were both maintained at a suitable temperature and furnished with a free supply of
air, s0 that the changes initiated might have an opportunity of going on until their
nature became undoubted.
