A
gilt copper ball, cooled in a freezing mixture, was placed in fronk of the pile, and its
effect was neutralized by presenting a beaker containing a little iced water to the oppo-
Site face of the pile. A film of olefiant gas was sent, over the ball, but the consequent
deflection proved that the absorption, jnstead of being greater, was less than before. The ball, in fact, had been coated by a crust of ice, which is one of the best absorbers
of radiant heat. The olefiant gas, being warmer than the ice, partially neutralized its
absorption. When, however, the temperature of the ball was only a few degrees lower
than that of the atmosphere, and its surface quite dry, the film of gas was found to act
as a film of varnish; it augmented the absorption.
