This is adopted as the working hypothesis. 6. The increase in angle between the next two primordia after the isolated primordium,
is partly the direct result of the shift of the growing-point towards the gap between
them, and is partly due to the fact that the second primordium is displaced, relatively
to the primordia below it, in the direction of the wound. 7. It is shown to be in accordance with expectation that the increase in this angle
is greater after isolation of I, than of P,.
