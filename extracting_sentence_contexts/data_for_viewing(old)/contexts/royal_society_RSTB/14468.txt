having made their hypothetical prediction.

“Before correlating the judgements with one another, I subtracted par-
ticipants’ hypothetical and counterfactual judgements from 100 for the
situations in which ball B went through the gate. Participants in Exper-
iment 1 were asked to judge whether ball B would (or would have
gone) through the gate if ball A were not (or had not been) there. To
map these onto participants’ causal judgements in Experiment 2
when ball B went through the gate, we need participants’ hypothetical
and counterfactual judgements that ball B would not go (or would not
have gone) through the gate (see equations (2.1) and (2.2)).

7In fact, the causal knowledge that people bring to bear on this task argu-
ably goes beyond what is captured in Pearl's hierarchy. While structural
equations are a very useful formal tool for representing causal knowl-
edge, they do not naturally capture the kinds of spatio-temporal
dynamics that are at play in these physical interactions (see [101-103]).

Appendix A. Parameter search for the simulation model
The simulation model has two free parameters. One parameter
determines how much the ball’s velocity vector is rotated at
each time step in the physical simulation. The degree of rotation
is drawn from Gaussian distribution \V (0, pan). The other par-
ameter determines at what moment in time the block starts
moving out of the way. The time point is determined by
