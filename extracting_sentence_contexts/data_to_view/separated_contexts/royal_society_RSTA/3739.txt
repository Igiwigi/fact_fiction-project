This has been experimentally confirmed [23,24]. As
a result, in spite of fulfilling the condition that the particle size is small, the scattering near
the resonances is not small. This follows from the fact that, actually, the true conditions for the
applicability of formula (2.1) are q <1 and, additionally, q <1/n. This is easy to see in figure 1a,
where the total Mie scattering and Rayleigh scattering efficiencies as a function of refractive
index n are presented for a spherical particle with size parameter q=0.3 (R/A ~*~ 0.05). Rayleigh
scattering saturates at large n, but equation (2.1) loses its validity in the vicinity of the magnetic
dipole resonance at 1 = 10.3 and also in the vicinity of the subsequent resonances (as shown in
the inset of figure 1a).
