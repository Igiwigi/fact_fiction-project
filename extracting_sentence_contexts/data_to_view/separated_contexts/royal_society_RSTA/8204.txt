Actually, z,,, 6,, and ,, are well known under the respective names “ regular simplex,”
“cross polytope”’ and “ measure polytope.” In particular,
a, = {3, 3} is the regular tetrahedron,
6; = {8, 4} is the octahedron,

Ys = {4, 3} is the cube. Also

33 = {4, 4} is the “ squared paper ” pattern (1.5). REGULAR-PRISMATIC VERTEX FIGURES. 345

Tt follows at once from 3.53 that

the vertex figure and bounding figure of the reciprocal polytope, it is easily proved by

induction that the polytopes
