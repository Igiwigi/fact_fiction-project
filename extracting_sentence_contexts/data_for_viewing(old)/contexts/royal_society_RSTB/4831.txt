Throughout its passage through the venous sinus the artery is connected by branches
with the meshwork of the rete, and it is not possible to say where these vessels cease to
be afferent to the rete and become tributaries of the root of the lower lateral cutaneous
artery, though for the reasons stated above in the description of the latter artery (p. 232)
there is, I think, no doubt that at some point along its course the vessel receives blood
from the rete instead of contributing blood to it.

A comparative study of the hypobranchial system shows that these two great afferent
arteries of the supra-hepatic retia are homologous with the pair of small pericardial
arteries commonly given off from the hinder of the hypobranchial commissures to the
dorsal wall of the pericardium.

These vessels are in ordinary quite insignificant and in fact are seldom mentioned in
descriptions of the vascular system. They are briefly referred to by Parker (19,
p. 698, Plate 34, fig. 2) as unilateral and supplying the dorsal wall of the pericardium ;
and their roots are apparently indicated in Hyrtt’s figures of Mustelus and Zygana (Tf.2,
fig. 2, Tf. 3, fig. 2), referred to in the former case as epigastric arteries though dorsal
to the heart, and in the latter without designation.

A fuller account is given of them in Mustelus, Acanthias and Carcharias by Frercuson
(11). He says, p. 176 :—‘ From this same sinus [7.e., the dilated termination of the
median hypobranchial artery] a small paired artery passes backward on either side of
the median line beneath the dorsal portion of the pericardium at the lateral margin of
the cartilaginous floor of the pharynx formed by the basi-branchial cartilage ; after
anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side beneath the apex of the cardiac ventricle,
