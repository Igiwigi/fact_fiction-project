BerzeLrvs's methods of ascertaining the composition of
phosphoric . acid, that, of reviving gold from its oxide by
means of phosphorus, and that of determining the quantities
of phosphate and muriate- of silver formed from perphos-
phorane, .or the. perchloride. of phosphorus, appear to me
still more /exceptionable; yet his results on the quantity of
oxygen approach nearer to mine than those of M. DuLons. The' facts which 1 endeavoured to. establish respecting
chlorine, in a paper published in the Philosophical Transac-


322 Sir H. Davy's new experiments on some

tions for 1810, show that the proportional or equivalent
volume in which chlorine combines, is to that in which oxygen
combines, as 2 to 1; and it follows, that 10 grains of phog-
phorus in forming the white sublimate, or perchloride, ought to
combine with between 76 and 80 cubical inches of chlorine:

In experiments that I formerly made on this subject, by
admitting chlorine to phosphorus in exhausted vessels, and
ascertaining the absorption by introducing solution of chlorine,
I overrated the absorption. I did not at that time know, what
I have since ascertained, that a solution of chlorine in water,
apparently saturated with chlorine, by agitation with it in long
narrow vessels, will still take up more, by exposure to a great
surface, of chlorine in larger vessels.
