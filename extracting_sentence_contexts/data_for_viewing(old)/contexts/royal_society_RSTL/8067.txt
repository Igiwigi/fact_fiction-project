EZ The numbers in the above Table are smaller than those in the Tables already given;
bn but this may be owing to the method of equalization we have adopted, which will neces-
Y sarily tell very greatly in small periods.

ES Nevertheless there appears to be a certain amount of likeness between the march of
5 the numbers in the four periods which we have investigated, namely, those of Venus
[) and Jupiter, Venus and Mercury, Mercury and his Perihelion, and Mercury and

Jupiter.

We desire to record this rather as a result brought out by a certain specified method
of treating the material at our disposal, than as a fact from which we are at present
prepared to draw conclusions. As the investigation of these and similar phenomena
proceeds it may be hoped that much light will be thrown upon the causes of sun-spot
periodicity.

Tuly 11, 1870.—Sir J. Hensener has Kindly permitted us to append the following

remarks which he has made upon the foregoing paper :—

#* In all the aboye Tables equal angles have been supposed to be deseribed in equal times; there will be #

8light correction on this account for Mercury and his Perihelion.
