Tt was s0on found that by assuming for
each element and for each station a certain amount of difference from the monthly mean
at the same hour as the indication of disturbance, the records in each month might be
Separated into two portions, of which the smaller, containing the disturbed obseryations,
might be set apart for an examination of the laws of disturbance ; whilst the larger
portion, from which the disturbances had been thus eliminated, would become more
available for obtaining a correct knowledge and analysis of the progressive and regular
variations than when they were mixed up with the casual and transitory affections. By maintaining these asswmed discriminating or separating values (forming the cri-
teria whereby each observation was as8igned either to the disturbed or to the undisturbed
category), constant at each 8tation, the laws of disturbance in different months and
different years, if such laws existed, might be studied with convenience and security ;
and by s0 adjusting the values adopted at the different stations as to cause the number
of the disturbed obseryations at each station to bear nearly an equal proportion to the

whole body, an advance might be made towards an approximate estimate of the degree
in which the disturbing action prevailed in different parts of the globe. In the prac-
tical application of this scheme of first or primary analysis it was found that, provided
the elected separating value at each station were such as to place in the category of
disturbed observations a proportion equivalent to between one and two tenths of the
whole body of the observations, s8mall alterations within these limits occasioned no
8ignificant alterations in the derived diurnal progression either of the disturbed or of
the (for the most part) undisturbed observations,
The monthly records of a single year at any one of the observatories sufficed to mani-
fest an order and gequence in the ratios of the aggregate amounts of disturbance in each
Q of the twenty-four hours to the mean amount in the twenty-four hours taken as unity,
© Which placed beyond a doubt the fact that, casual and irregular as the disturbances
Z might appear in respect to the particular times of their occurrence when viewed in single
S days, they were in their mean effects strictly periodical phenomena; exhibiting, by the *
E character of their periodical variations, « dependence on the $un as their primary Source.
2 To this important fact the disturbances of each of the magnetic elements, the Declina-
& tion, the Inclination, and the Intensity of the magnetic force, bore concurrent testimony,
Z although the hours of maximum and minimum of their respective diurnal progressions
S were dissimilar; confirming in that particular the inference of the existence of distinct
S periodical laws in the disturbances of each of the elements.
'Z The bearing of this result upon the methods by which magnetical investigations could
=Z most successfully be proseccuted was important. It had been remarked at a yery early
Z date, viz. in the 1st volume of the Toronto Observations, published in 1845, p. xv, that
FH «if the disturbances took place without any systematic prevalence at certain hours
Z rather than at others, and with no systematic inequality in regard to direction and
& amount, their influence would be limited to a lengthening of the time required for
obtaining accurate mean values of the solar-diurnal yariation ; but that if systematic
V inequalities were found to prevail in those respects, it was obyious that no duration of
< the observations would eliminate their influence; and the diurnal inequality obtained
5 from the whole body of the observations, whatever might be the duration it repre-
sented, must include the effects of two distinct phenomena, viz. of the disturbances,
and of the diurnal yariation properly s0 called; these two phenomena having possibly
distinct causes, or at least distinct laws.” The conclusion could no longer be doubted,
therefore, 'that the first step in the systematic treatment of a body of observations,
whether for the purpose of studying the laws of the disturbances, or for obtaining a
correct knowledge of the more regular periodical yariations, must be to separate the
observations into two portions, one of which should include the more significant disturb-
ances, and the other should contain the remainder of the observations, from which the
disturbances had been for the most part eliminated. Our present concern is with the
treatment of the disturbed portion only ; the periodical variations of more regular occur-
rence are discussed elsewhere.

And here it becomes proper to recall the instructions regarding the casnal and trans-
itory variations contained in the Report of the Royal Society referred to in page 230,
in which we find this conclusion to have been in great measure anticipated, —the
importance of treating the laws and mutual relations of the disturbances as a distinet
subject of investigation clearly recognized, —and the probable results of such investi-
gation not obscurely indicated.
