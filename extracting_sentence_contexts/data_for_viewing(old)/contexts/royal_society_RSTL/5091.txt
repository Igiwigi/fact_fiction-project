Shange with oxygen extends through degrees above and below common temperature
-£(2861.), 80 inflections of the lines of force passing through the atmosphere, corre-
Spondent to those of the heating and cooling nickel, must take place to 8ome extent.
t is seen in the nickel results, that lines of force entirely outside of it do not for
.2that reason continue an undeviating course, but are curved to and fro in conse-
'Zquence of the disposition of other lines within the nickel; a result, which, without
Sreference to either one view or another of the physical action of the magnetic force,
Snust be as true in the oxygen case as in the nickel case, hecause of the definite

Sponds with the facts registered by observers, is a question which cannot be answered,

force of the atmosphere. In the nickel experiment the deflection is in places 30? or
$40®; in nature the effect to be accounted for is not more than 13 or 14 minutes.
