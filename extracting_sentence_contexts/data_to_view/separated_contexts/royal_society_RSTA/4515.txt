Rural electricity was a market failure,
and the government would step in where the market had failed. Pinchot’s aspiration for Giant Power was frankly utopian—that ‘the drudgery of human life
can be taken from the shoulders of men and women who toil, and [be] replaced by the power
of electricity’ [27, p. v|—but the argument presented for it was empirical. Pinchot stressed that
the report ‘proposes to deal with facts as it finds them’ [27, p. viii]. The epigraph insisted that
‘Electrical development has brought the Commonwealth to the threshold of momentous changes
in industry and transportation and in the life of the people ... To act wisely in this situation
facts must be our guide’.
