generalized RF distance

Figure 4. (a) Generalized Robinson—Foulds (RF) distances of NJ (orange), UPGMA (dark blue), parsimony-based (light blue) and molecular-based (green) trees from
the reference molecular phylogeny, compared with the density distribution of distances of a randomly generated sample of 10 000 random trees (purple curve). (6)
Generalized RF distances of trees based on discrete data (red), compared with the above trees reduced to the same sample. ‘pruned’, discrete-based parsimony trees
derived from a larger sample and pruned to the dataset matching the GMM data; ‘subset’, discrete-based parsimony trees derived from a dataset matching the
species in the GMM dataset. (Online version in colour.)
