all the remaining hemispheres are to a great extent capable of being interpreted.

In R.C.S.703.5.R., C.3.R., Q.2788.R., Q.1905.R., Q.1487.R., and S.9.R. the
anterior occipital and angular sulci are clearly defined, and the superior parallel
sulcus is represented by fragmentary sulci within the supramarginal lobule. There
is one feature of interest to comment on in passing as it often forms an important
landmark. In Q.1905.R. the sulcus occipitalis anterior is separate. The sulcus
annectans has been divided, as it were, longitudinally. This method of splitting
is fairly common in the human brain and it occurs along the line of the visuo-auditory
band of Exxior Smrru. It is of interest to note in these brains how the expansions
appear to be taking place on either side of this band which is the locus of the dynamic
centre of the parietal lobe already referred to. It is not within the province of this
paper to enter into the functional significance of this interesting morphological fact.

The hemispheres so far considered have been mainly on the right side. On the
left side, where the fissure of Sylvius extends further backwards into the parietal

region, the pattern of the sulci, although according with the general plan, is some-
what different. There are fourteen hemispheres, two of which are on the right
side, which are all essentially similar (C.3.L., $.10.L., S.6.L., S.8.L., $.2.L., S.11.L.,
S.11.R., $.3.L., Q.1905.L., Q.1487.L., Q.2640.L., O,2640.R., R.C.S.703.5.L., and
$.12.L.). It is unnecessary to describe each of these in detail. The description of
