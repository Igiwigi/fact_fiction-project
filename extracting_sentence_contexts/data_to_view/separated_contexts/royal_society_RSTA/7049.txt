This shows the existence of an infinite
simple group with finitely many generators. This proof is remarkable in that it is a non-
constructive existence proof: such proofs are not uncommon in analysis, but they rarely
occur in algebra and theory of groups. Recently Ruth Camm has constructed explicitly
a simple group* which is the free product of two free groups of rank 2 with an amalgamated
subgroup; this can then be generated by four elements, and in fact also by only two, and
requires infinitely many defining relations. It is an unsolved problem whether there are
infinite simple groups with a finite number of defining relations. One can vary Higmanâ€™s construction by taking more than four generators with corre-
spondingly more relations, that is by considering the group with generators a), dy, ..., 4,
and defining relations nay! liaise ah
