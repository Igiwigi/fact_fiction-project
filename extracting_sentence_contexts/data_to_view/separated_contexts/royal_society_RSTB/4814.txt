In the maxillary gland of the Ostracod the valve cells
and the duct cells are both ectodermal in origin, and hence together might be compared
to the complete nephridium with its nephrostome. But the fact that the valve rudi-
ment arises separately from the rudiment of the duct cells shows clearly that this can-
not be the case. More definite evidence against this comparison is the fact that the
valve arises before the duct. In stage IV the valve rudiment is distinct while there
is still no sign of the rudiment of the duct cells. If then the valve did represent a
nephrostome, the Ostracods would present the anomalous case of the nephrostome
arising before the nephridial duct.
