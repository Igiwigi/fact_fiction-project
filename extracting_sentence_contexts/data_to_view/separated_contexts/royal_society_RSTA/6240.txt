HRTEM images of type 2 diaphite from the Canyon Diablo hard carbon grains (figure 10) are
characterized by elongated (121) ¢ diamond domains parallel to (131) and subnanometre-sized
regions containing approximately 2.1 A fringes arranged in a hexagonal pattern. Németh et
al. [24] interpreted figure 10a as two- and four-layer thick {113} c diamond twins. However,
the DFT-based structure model (figure 10b) shows that such images are in fact consistent with
type 2 diaphite and indicate that these nanostructures correspond to a nanocomposite material
consisting of sp?- and sp*-bonded carbon regions. Type 2 diaphite contains c diamond, graphene
and interface regions. By changing the volume of these regions, various type 2 diaphite structures


can be generated and identified in HRTEM images (figure 10c,d).
