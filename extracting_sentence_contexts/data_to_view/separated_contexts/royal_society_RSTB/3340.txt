But this return is made
in accordance with the Spanish law and therefore, so far as Spain is concerned, such
argument will not apply. With regard to other countries it might do so; and
Table XIV certainly shows a very marked increase of M. in the total still-births. But Table XTV also shows that, instead of an increased proportion of M. in
illegitimate as compared with legitimate stillborn children, there is a decreased

proportion recorded, and, in fact, the figures for stillborn children apparently
accentuate this increased production of F. in consequence of illegitimate union. At the same time, when legitimate births and still-births are added together and
compared with a similar total result for illegitimate births and still-births, the
difference between the proportion of M. produced by these two classes of union
is slightly less than it is for births alone. I have shown this in Table IV, from which it would appear that the high proportion
of M. produced among still-births more than counterbalances the apparent differences
shown in Table XTV, and is responsible for this result.
