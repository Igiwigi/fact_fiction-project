This object is accomplished by constructing a hypothetical infinite population, of
which the actual data are regarded as constituting a random sample. The law of distri-

are sufficient to describe it exhaustively in respect of all qualities under discussion,
Any information given by the sample, which is of use in estimating the values of these
parameters, is relevant information. Since the number of independent facts supplied in
