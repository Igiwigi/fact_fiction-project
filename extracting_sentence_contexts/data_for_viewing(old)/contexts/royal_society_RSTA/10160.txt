Discussion of the Electrical Results.

A comparison of the values of the electrical resistivities obtained in the present
experiments with those obtained at 18° C, and 100° C, by JAcer and DresseLHorst,
shows that the agreement is not quite so good as in the case of the thermal
measurements, This is not likely to be due to errors of observation, as the electrical
measurements admit of greater accuracy than the thermal, It seems rather to point
to the greater influence on the electrical properties than on the thermal, of small
differences in chemical composition, or in physical structure. This is in keeping with
the results obtained by GriineIsEN* in the cases of copper and iron.

The influence of impurity on the electrical resistivities of metals is, in fact, so
marked, particularly at low temperatures,t that a comparison of the resistivities found
in the present experiments with those found by Dewar and Fremie (D.F.), and by
Kameriincu Onnes and Cray (0.C.), will serve as a test of the degree of purity of the
materials used,
