(P, P') are points having an (, «')
correspondence, and the number of united points is =a; (P, Q') are points having a
(B, B') correspondence, and the number of united points is =b, and so on. The theo-
rem then is

pla—z—s)+q(b—B—Þ')+ &c. + Supp. =24D,
being in fact the most general form of the theorem for the correspondence of two points
on a curve, and that which will be used in all the investigations which follow.

103. Investigation of the number of double tangents. Take P' an intersection of
the curve with a tangent from P to the curve (or, what is the same thing, P, P' cotangen-
tials of any point of the curve): the united points are here the points of contact of the
several double tangents of the curve; or if © be the number of double tangents, then
the number of united points is =2r.
