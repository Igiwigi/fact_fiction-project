If such parts happen
to be in the form of hanging pockets, the result would be an enclosed pit lined all round by
lamellar tissue. This is not infrequent in Dinophyllum and Amplexus with lamellar tissue, and
in Caninia and Dibunophyllum (figure 17, plate 5) with fibro-lamellar tissue. The fact that
thick septa do not occur in the peripheral region of such corals as Phaulactis and Bothro-
phyllum, is simply due to the cutting off of the polypal parts in this region by the continuously
forming dissepiments. Looked upon thus, it is only natural that excessive dilatation of trabeculae is compara-
tively rare and limited. For the trabeculae originate at the top of the polypal invagination,
while any soft parts left behind at lower levels are likely to assume the more primitive
function of secreting lamellar tissue.
