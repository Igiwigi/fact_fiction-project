In view of the importance of microseisms for forecasting purposes in India, an analysis
was made of all the storms and depressions which formed in the Bay of Bengal and the
Arabian Sea during the years 1924-27 as shown in Appendix A for one of the years.
The information given from meteorological sources in this Appendix has been extracted
from ‘ India Weather Review and Annual Summary,’ and does not, therefore, represent
what was known in regard to the storms when they actually formed and travelled over
the sea, but what was known about them after all the available ships’ logs were collected,
analysed and studied. It is found that in every case complete indication regarding
the existence of the storms in the sea can be obtained from the microseisms. The
analysis shows that some of the storms, which are declared to be severe from meteoro-
logical evidence, did not produce very well-marked microseisms. This was apparently
due to the fact that some storms are of very small diameter and affect only a small area
of the sea. The energy communicated to the surface of the earth in such cases is small
and the microseisms recorded at a distant Observatory are feeble. When recorded
under the conditions adopted in the Colaba Observatory, the microseisms must be 2

valuable aid to the forecaster, particularly for storms in the Arabian Sea, where informa-

tion from meteorological sources are often very meagre.

The method has been tried for forecasting purposes for nearly two years, and has been
found to give generally indication of disturbed weather over the Indian Seas earlier
than that obtained from the meteorological reports.
