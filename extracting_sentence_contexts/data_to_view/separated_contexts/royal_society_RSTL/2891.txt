although they retain a tinge of grey colour for a much longer period; the yellow

bands on the body and thorax are at first quite white, and it is not until an hour or

two has elapsed that the principal yellow band on the thorax begins at length to gain

colour, while it is seyeral hours before the yellow bands acquire their full shade or

degree of colour, During all this time the bee continues in an enfeebled state and

takes no part in the business of the nest, but secks for itself the warmest place among

the combs, and it is not until sometime after it has acquired its proper degree of
colour that it becomes active like the other bees, and is able to maintain its own

proper temperature. It is thus evident, that the same principle which has been shown

by Dr. Epwarps to prevail with regard to the young of some of the mammiferous

animals, that they are unable for a certain period after birth to generate and maintain

within themselyes a proper amount of temperature, but require to be cherished by
external warmth, regulates also the development of the individuals of this family of
Hymenopterous insects, from their pupa or nymph to their perfect state, and further
tends to prove to us how universal and simple are the great laws which regulate the
continuance of animal life. It is a curious fact that these bees do not incubate on the
cells which contain only laryz, the temperature of the atmosphere of the nest being
sufficiently high for them in that condition ; consequently the laryz at an advanced
period do not require s0 high a temperature before changing into nymphs as that
which has just been shown to be required by the nymphs before coming forth as per-
fect insects. This will be shown in some observations made on laryz in the nest
now under examination, at the same time with those just described, and also with
others which were made on nymphs. The temperature of the atmosphere being 76?,
some of the cells which were open and contained larva were exposed in the nest,
and the Nurse Bees therefore covered them lightly with dried grass, of which the nest
of this species of Bombus is usually composed ; but when the temperature of the
atmosphere a few hours afterwards bad risen to 73%5, most of the dried grass with
which these cells had been covered was remoyed, and the laryz were more exposed ;
the temperature of these cells and the laryz being 7774, while that of the cell of a
nymph, with the Nurse Bee upon it, in another part of the nest was 92*, and subse-
quently when four large females were nursing around it was 941, the temperature of
the atmosphere being still 72%5.
