parallel to the axis of the tube, similar to those obtained with smoke particles and
used for the measurement of amplitude,} has already received reference. This is the
only type of figure exhibited by the vibrating smoke particles, and hence it is clear
that other types of motion shown by cork particles have their origin in the inertia,

size or asymmetry of the particle, and not in the movement of the air itself. Once more
we have an example of the fact that smoke particles are tracing points, while fine cork
particles behave in a very complicated manner, largely conditioned by the relative
motion of the fluid.

Certain leading features of the behaviour of the cork particles will be described
here. Many peculiarities which will not be cited have been explained, but add little
to our knowledge of the motion. Between node and antinode particles can frequently
be seen which move rapidly in a transverse direction, the path being sinuous, and of
limited length. Photographs of such particles show that they are not of sine wave
form, as would be expected if they were due to a combination of a rapid rectilinear
motion across the tube and a periodic motion along the axis of the tube,* but show in
general a crowding up of the crests at either end of the trace. Such traces are shown
in figs. 41, 42, 43 and 44, Plate 26, 41 and 42 being obtained with a frequency of 75 and
