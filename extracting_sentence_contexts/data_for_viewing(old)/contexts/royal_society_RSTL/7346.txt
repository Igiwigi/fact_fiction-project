The Norwegian Foraminifera are tabulated with those from Baffin's Bay and Davis
Straits in Table IV., and with those from the North Atlantic in Table VII.

Mr. MacAnDREw, who has kindly supplied us with latitude and longitude of the
localities in the foregoing list, informs us that © these dredgings were all taken in shel-
tered situations among the islands and near shore ; occasionally a mile or two from land,
and frequently nearer, That at Omnoes Oe was made from the boat, and commenced
very near shore. The others in the list were made from the yacht, when we required
more room.”

Compared with the group of Foraminifera obtained at the Hunde Islands at similar
depths, those from the Norway coast present considerable differences; and this is mainly
owing to the fact that the specimens given us from the seven Norwegian dredgings were
only the larger and more conspicuous of a probably rich fauna ; but also, partly, because
the coast of Norway (excepting the neighbourhood of North Cape) lies in the © Boreal
Province,” and is far less under the chilling influence of floating ice than the American
coasts to the westward. The dredging from Rolfs Oe was taken within the © Arctic
Province.” 'The mixed sands obtained from the shells and sponges of Messrs. MACANDREW
and Barrerr's dredgings, and examined by ourselves, yielded many representatives of
the forms native to the Coralline- and the Coral-zone, though chiefly of small size.

The moxst interesting fact to be pointed out is the relatively great abundance of large
