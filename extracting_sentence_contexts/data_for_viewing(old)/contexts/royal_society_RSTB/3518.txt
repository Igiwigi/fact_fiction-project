On the completion of this stage of development the embryo has attained the full
morphological status of the gastrula. A. structural condition in Ornithorhynchus,
evidently requiring such an interpretation, formed the subject of a former brief
* communication by the present writers, published in the ‘Proceedings of the Royal
Society of London’ (’08).

In that communication we showed that in the egg of Ornithorhynchus of
9-10 millims. in diameter there is to be found a knob-like thickening of the
cellular wall of the blastodermic vesicle, constituting a very definite ‘primitive
knot.” This knot possesses a very well-marked gastrulation-cavity (“ Mesoderm-
siickchen” of Herrwia) with a wide blastoporic aperture; and it is, as yet,
a completely isolated and independent structure, in spite of the fact that a primitive

streak is already in existence, separated from the knot by an interval of considerable
extent.

At the time of writing our preliminary paper there were at our disposal only two
specimens illustrating the condition dealt with. Since that time two other eggs
have come into our possession which belong to the same period of development.
