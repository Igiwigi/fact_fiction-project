1. InrrRopucTION

The fact that there are two very large nerve cells in the central nervous system of
the squid, Loligo, was discovered by Williams (1909), who also gave a brief description
of their connexions. His account appears never to have been amplified, or indeed even
mentioned, by any subsequent worker until these enormous nerve fibres were ac-

that the whole giant-fibre system on each side of the body consists of the processes
of one of the two main giant cells. In fact the arrangement is much more complicated
