carpi radialis passes over two joints, viz.: the elbow and wrist, and the muscle is not
long enough to allow the elbow to be fully extended without its pulling on the meta-
carpal bones into which it is inserted, and thus producing extension of the wrist. In
like manner, the extension of the toes is due to the fact that their extensors, which
also pass over more than one joint, are too short to allow extension at the wrist
without their pulling on the bones into which they are inserted.

Gap* relates an exactly similar experience in connection with the posterior
extremity of the Frog. He found that by drawing on the ilio-psoas muscle, he
produced not only flexion of the thigh on the abdomen, but also of the leg on the
thigh, and dorsiflexion of the foot on the leg, in fact the extremity was placed
exactly in the position of a frog about to jump. The cause of this was found to be
the fact that the insufficient length of the ham-strings did not allow complete
flexion at the hip without pulling on the leg, and thus producing flexion at the
knee. Then as the tibialis anticus has its origin above the knee joint, dorsiflexion
at the ankle followed as a necessary consequence, the tibialis anticus in its turn not
being long enough to allow of such extreme flexion at the knee, without drawing on
the foot. The importance of these observations becomes apparent when we consider
the numerous fallacies which would result if these facts were not borne in mind when
we observed the various movements produced by stimulation of any single nerve root.
Stimulation of a root, in which extension of the elbow is represented, would also
produce extension of the hand and fingers, whether the muscles moving these parts
were truly represented in that root or not. If one muscle can directly or indirectly
produce movements at so many joints, it is clear that we must first eliminate the
indirect effects of the action of this muscle, before we can study the movements
