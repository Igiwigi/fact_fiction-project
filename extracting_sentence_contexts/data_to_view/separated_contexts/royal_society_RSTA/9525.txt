The observational data, on the other hand, are usually of
§o complex a nature, and so influenced by the latitude and longitude of the station,
‘Bhat the observer does not know what to regard as essential and what to consider
secondary. Moreover, the record is in nearly all cases photographic. Except in a

w of the better staffed observatories, the fact that a magnetic storm has occurred is
ot known until a day or two afterwards, when the photographic sheets have been

veloped. If a continuous succession of solar pictures and contemporary magnetic
-Bhanges could appear side by side during the actual progress of a magnetic storm, an
Bbserver would have a better chance of framing the right guess as to the nature of
Bhe solar link, provided corresponding events on the sun and earth are nearly
Simultaneous, or are separated by a constant small interval of time. In the case,
owever, of sunspots and the amplitude of the daily H range at Kew, during the

leven years 1890 to 1900, the results reached in 8.M. indicated a clear lag of about
fo days in the magnetic range, and they were at least consistent with a similar lag
gn magnetic “ character.” The results of the present paper do not suggest a lag in
“Snagnetic character,” but the rate of change of sunspot area near the time of
maximum “ character,” as shown in Table IX. and fig. 3, is slow, so that the question
@f lag in “ character” is still an open one.
