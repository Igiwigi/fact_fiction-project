It is probably very hard, if not impossible, to track the origins of FBPs. The origin of the modern 2 |
discipline owes much the famous Stefan problem that describes the joint evolution of a liquid and a

solid phase, a question considered in 1831 by Lamé and Clapeyron in relation to the problems of ar
ice formation in the polar seas. The problem is named after Stefan [1], who introduced the general : a
class of such problems around 1890, and performed both numerical and theoretical studies of the ig
phase-transition problems related to heat transfer. The rigorous analytical treatment exceeded the : s
tools of the time, and the difficulty may be understood from the fact that the basic existence and :&
uniqueness result was only proved by Kamenomostskaya [2] and Oleinik [3], once the notion of 2

weak solutions and nonlinear analysis were ready.
In the twentieth century, new directions were developed, and problems concerning free surface

flows, shock waves and water waves became of central importance. During the early 1950s until : &
the early 1970s, several mathematicians (such as Lewy, Stampacchia, Lions, Lax, among others) Dos
contributed to the growth of the field, and eventually the weak and variational formulation and : =
techniques for these problems were fully developed. The obstacle problem became a basic study : yy
case in the mathematical theory. There are many names here unmentioned, but not forgotten. The (3
book by Duvaut and Lions was probably one of the first to make an extensive list of problems aes
available to the mathematical community. At this stage of the development of the topic, the 22
