c ly or to a considerable extent, before the main discharge has in its passage along
he tube arrived at the tinfoil ; as there would be otherwise on such arrival a revoca-
jon of the impulsive electrical action in the tinfoil, that is the cause of the very
| liseharge that forms the hollow cone. But we are able to get quite clear and typical
b by this method, 80 that we are entitled to assume that the positive discharge
actually left the quasi-positive terminal beneath the tinfoil and proceeded along
tube with a velocity which we have already considered, forming the positive
-/uminosity on its path.
© The phenomenon which shows in the most striking way the rapidity with which
woitive electricity leaves its source is the production of positive-special in a high
\Snsion tube. Attention has already been called to the wide sweep which the thin
2ogitive column takes to avoid the spot at which the positive-special is being produced.
ow this avoidance is due to the fact that there is negative electricity there which has
2n left behind by the positive discharge caused by the positive impulses within the
foil. Thus the side of the tube beneath the tinfoil behaves precisely as a negative
i-terminal, showing that the positive must have wholly passed away from the
e at the time the advancing positive discharge arrives at the tinfoil, and has Jeft

2 The evidence is strengthened if we consider the case of negative relief produced, by
He use of a similar arrangement, at the piece of tinfoil that is nearer to the negative
-Srminal. Here we are able to compare directly the two cases of the relieving tinfoil
\Heing on the tube, and at a distance from it. And we find that there is no difference

Se are fairly entitled to conclude that the positive discharge passes off in a time shorter
