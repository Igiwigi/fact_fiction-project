During implantation, the blastocyst is growing in size and it simply makes
room for itself in the soft stroma tissue, no destruction of the latter taking place. But there is one very obvious difference in the details of implantation in Man and
Cavia. Whereas in the latter the lower, or anti-embryonal pole, constitutes the implan-
tation pole and is the first part to enter the endometrium, it is a very interesting and
significant fact that, just as the first attachment of the Pithecoid blastocyst is effected
by the trophoblast over the embryonal pole, so in the human blastocyst (¢f. TEACHER,
*24) that pole is normally the first to enter, as is shown by the fact that in the great
majority of the early human blastocysts which have been examined, the embryo is
attached to the chorion of the deep wall of the vesicle, opposite or nearly opposite
the site of entry, as is seen very clearly in Pl. 20, fig. 112, which I owe to the kindness
of my colleague, Dr. J. Fuorian. The figure represents a section through the decidual
swelling in which lies imbedded an early blastocyst (Bi I, Furortan, ’28, b, fig. 1).
