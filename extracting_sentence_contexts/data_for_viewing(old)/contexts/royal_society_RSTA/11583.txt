will suffice to describe the distribution of barometric frequency. The standard devia-
tions of B,, By, and 6 + 388, — 28; are 0°03673, 0°12022, and 02068; these give for
the probable errors of the means of the same three quantities (duly weighted), 0:00568,
0:01860, and 0:03200 respectively. Thus the probable errors are about 39, 0°5, and
71 per cent. of the observed means. Thus, while it is exceedingly improbable that the
mean values of 8, and f, differ much from their observed values, it is very possible
that the true mean value of the criterion is zero and not — 0°04495.* The compara-
tively large and opposite values of the criterion at Markree Castle and Stonyhurst
must, of course, be duly regarded, and a longer series of observations at these two
stations may some day serve to indicate how far their barometric conditions are
peculiar to local conditions of climate or of observation.

As a matter of fact, the curves corresponding to equations (iv.) or (v.) above were
originally calculated for all the stations, and drawn upon the diagrams as well as those
corresponding to (ii.), but the mean percentage error in frequency, when tested by a
planimeter, showed no very sensible improvement. An examination of Plates 9-17,
giving the graphical representationt of the observed frequency by the theoretical
distribution (the negative direction of # being towards high barometer)

Y = Y (1 + w/a)? e™,

amply demonstrates that this limit to the skew binomial suffices to satisfactorily
describe barometric frequency. The closeness of the approximation is one rarely met
with in the usual representation of variation by the normal curve of errors.
