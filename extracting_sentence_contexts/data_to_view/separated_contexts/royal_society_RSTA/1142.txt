In any case, it seems safe to assume that M = 50 is sufficient to
accurately evaluate the numerical stability domains of LBMs. In addition, the stability domains
obtained with the D2Q9-BGK clearly show a dependence on the grid mesh. This translates to
the fact that the grid mesh acts as a space filter which will automatically prevent the growth of
(spurious) waves with a particular space frequency. In other words, even if the LSA shows that
a particular type of LBM should encounter stability issues due to the growth of spurious waves
for a given set of parameters (Ma, v, etc.), they might not emerge during the simulation because
of the numerical sampling of the discrete wavenumbers, and the simulation might then remain
