Until the close affinities of the Lepidodrendra with the Sigillarizz was established by
actual observation, I do not wonder that M. BroNGNIART insisted upon his belief that
the latter were Gymnospermous Exogens. I do not see how this Gymnospermous theory
can be entertained any longer; but to make the facts upon which it was based accord
with our systems we must alter the latter. In the discussion which followed the reading of my memoir on Calamites before the
Royal Society in January 1871, Dr. CaretxTER threw out a snggestion which accords
with my own conclusions on the question.
