We have already shown in figure 7 that the orienting effect on the water molecular dipole
of an electric field applied anywhere in the system will alter the anisotropy and biaxiality. However, the density structuring and liquid phase of water under these conditions are not altered,
and so it would be impossible to uncover this change in the average orientation of the water
molecules by examining the density and hydrogen bonding measurements alone. In fact, for
