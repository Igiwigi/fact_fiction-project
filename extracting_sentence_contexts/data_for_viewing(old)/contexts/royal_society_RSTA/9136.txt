determined agrees with the theoretical distribution remarkably closely between the limits of 180° and
about 30° for #. On the other hand the discrepancy between the two becomes very marked for small
values of 9, indicating either the necessity for some modification of the simple theory in this direction, or
possibly the superposition of other effects. Various possibilities might be suggested, but they could not
at present be regarded as more than speculations.


PROF. C. G. BARKLA ON X-RAYS AND THE THEORY OF RADIATION. 317

Difficult as the first two results would be to explain on any entity or quantum
theory—that is, any theory assuming radiation itself to exist in definite indivisible
bundles or quanta—perhaps the strongest evidence against this is provided by the
third fact stated above. The distribution calculated and given by the expression
I, = I,» (1+cos’@) where I, is the intensity of radiation scattered in a direction
making an angle @ with that of propagation of the primary beam depends essentially
on a steady variation with direction, not of a number of indivisible entities, but of the
energy density around a single radiating charge—an electron in this éase.

4. Further, measurements of the energy of radiation scattered* have furnished one
of the most searching and critical of tests that could be applied to any theory.

In the early experiments it was found that the intensity of the radiation scattered
from light elements was simply proportional to the mass of scattering substance
traversed.t That is, the intensity of scattering per atom or molecule of scattering
substance was proportional to its atomic or molecular weight—independent of
