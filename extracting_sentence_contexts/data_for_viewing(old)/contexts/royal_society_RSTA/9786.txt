same general shape for all ratios of the maximum and minimum stresses.

The two parts of the loop which were traced out, as the stress varied from either
extreme of the cycle towards the mean stress, were straight lines with a slope equal
to that which would have been given by the specimen if restored to an elastic
condition. Further than this, no appreciable change occurred in the value of Youne’s
modulus.

The increase in width of the hysteresis loop, for a given increase in the range
applied, was greatest for the case of equal and opposite stresses, and gradually
decreased in such a way as to suggest that at the maximum stress there was no
tendency to form such a loop. The ordinary tensile test only differs from this
extreme case in the fact that a short time only is allowed for fracture, whilst an
indefinitely long one would be required as an extension of the case of varying stress.
This difference is unimportant, as careful experiments have shown that the rate of
test has little effect on the maximum stress obtained.

The rate of permanent extension due to excess range, after the adjustment of the
elastic limits, is not so clearly shown. It is zero for the case of equal stresses and
becomes very great in the case of failure under high maximum stresses.

The Determination of the Elastic Ranges for the Materials from the Observations.—
Before the numerical values of these are given one further point of interest must be
noticed. Some specimens of Swedish iron and axle steel showed a large “ permanent
which ultimately ceased. In all cases “cyclical permanent set” was
