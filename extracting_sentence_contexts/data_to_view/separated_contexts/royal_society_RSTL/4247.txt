The cavity of the pedicle is
continuous with that of a canal which runs from the common cavity directly towards
the corpuscle. Its walls are continuous, the inner with the inner wall of the canal,
the outer with the substance of the dise. The pedicle is in fact a mere process of the
system of canals, 80 that the position of the marginal vesicle is relatively to this
system the same as in the Cryptocarpm, . A similar remark holds good with regard
to the Rhizostomide.
