pressed than a log of timber would be if
placed upon the glacier, and permitted to
$hare its motion downwards.

T may sum up by saying that a close
examination of the glacier satisfied me,
not only that it presented no phenomena
which were at variance with the pressure
theory, but also exhibited some which, as
far as I could see, were perfectly fatal to
the theory of stratification. The state of
the ice at the base of the Aggischhorn, as shown in fig. 6, is certainly quite in harmony
with the pressure theory ; another fact observed upon the glacier shall be referred to
at a future page.
