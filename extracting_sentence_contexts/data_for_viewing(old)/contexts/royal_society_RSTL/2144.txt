cold was diluted with water and saturated by carbonate of
s0da, partially dried, of which it required for saturation g98
grains, while 440 grains of sulphuric acid not mixed with
alcohol saturated 555 grains of the same- carbonate of soda,
$0 that Z of the acid had been saturated by the alcohol.

440 grains of sulphuric acid mixed with its own weight
of alcohol, as before, and then poured into a solution of ace-
tate of lead, 542 grains of sulphate were precipitated. The
same quantity of sulphuric acid unchanged by alcohol gave
2313 grains of sulphate of lead; thus 4 of the sulphuric
acid had lost its power of precipitating oxide of lead from its
Solutions ; it had in fact been converted into sulphovinic acid.

M. Voctr, who has particularly described some of these
salts, and I believe also M. Gay Lvussac, have supposed
that this loss of saturating power arises from the formation
of hyposulphuric acid, and that the hyposulphates, and sul-
phovinates, only differ in the latter containing some ethereal
oil, which in some way acts the part of water of crystalliza-
tion. It is evident that the properties of oil of wine cannot
be thus explained ; and it appears to me more probable that
the power of combination which hydrocarbon is shown to be
possessed of in oil of wine, is effective in neutralising half the
acid of the salts formed from it, as before described.
