Even yellow light itself looked white when a narrow ray was caused to fall on the
fovea. This substitution has been shown to be due to the antichromatic responses. In
favour of the presence of this receptor is the fact that this part of the spectrum has a very
high brightness. It is unlikely that this would be the case if there were in fact no receptors
present from 6000 or 6200A on the one side, to 5400A on the other. Stiles & Crawford
found quite a different retinal direction effect with yellow rays than for red, green, and blue
rays.
