Adams’ result as well as extending the work to larger terms (Adams communicated his own value
of these higher terms to Delaunay in a letter and Delaunay announced them in his own paper
[68]), and reached the result of 6.11 arcsec/century. Philippe Gustave Doulcet de Pontécoulant
joined the discussion [69,70] by claiming that Adams introduced terms that were rightly ignored
by Laplace, Damoiseau, Plana and himself. The controversy was deepened by Le Verrier [71-73],
whose point was that Delaunay’s calculation (and Adams’ as well) must be flawed as it does not
correspond with the observations.

It is interesting that Le Verrier did not actually mention Adams, but attacked directly Delaunay,
even though Delaunay was essentially defending Adams’ results. This could be interpreted in
many ways. Le Verrier might have wanted to show indirectly that Adams, the person who
‘spoiled’ his Neptune prediction, was wrong, continuing a sort of scientific vendetta [65]. On
the other hand, the fact that Le Verrier does not mention Adams at all could be considered in an
opposite sense, that Le Verrier did not want to draw Adams into a long-standing fight he had

with Delaunay (for details see [74]). Adams was most directly attacked by Pontécoulant, both in : =
French and British journals [69,70], and a biographer of Adams should not forget his rebuttal of : =
the accusations published in the Monthly Notices in 1860. The Adams of 1860 was a very different 13
person from the Adams of the mid-1840s. Now he was able to write: i=

Again, I had some hopes that M. de Pontécoulant might be led to see and acknowledge : 3
