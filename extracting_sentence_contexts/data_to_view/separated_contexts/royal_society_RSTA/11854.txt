If then the rate of interaction of ions is different from that of the
Bolecules from which they are formed—if, for example, the time needed for the
guange, nH?O? + 2H" + 21" = n(2H?O + I*), were different from that needed for

3 Reactions of Hydrogen Diowide with Potassium Todide and Iodine. E Our previous paper concludes with the record of a number of sets of observations
Avhich showed that in a mixture of hydrogen iodide, with equal or with larger molecular
proportions of potassium iodide, the rate of change is not proportional to the amount
of hydrogen dioxide present at any moment. We have shown that this result must occur whenever the rate observed is dependent
upon more than one gradual change.
