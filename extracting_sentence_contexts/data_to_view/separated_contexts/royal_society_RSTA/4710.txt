This
is evident since more than 50% fuel conversion is achieved by 700K, whereas 50% conversion
was not achieved until 800 K for CoH and 1120K for CHy. Moreover, the enhancement of fuel
consumption for increase in fuel size is also consistent with the work of Wu et al. [26], which relates
this behaviour to the increase in reaction rate of RH + OH = R + H20O for larger hydrocarbons. By
700 K, the rates of fuel consumption begin to slow down, which is also supported by the fact that
an NTC region appears in the CO profile in the same temperature region. This inhibition can most
probably be attributed to the formation of HO, and its presence can also explain the minimal
conversion of CO into CO. The lack of CO formation could also be explained by considering
the preferential role of OH attack on RH over CO.
