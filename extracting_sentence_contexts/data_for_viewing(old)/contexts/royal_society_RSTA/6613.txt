super/hypersonic vehicle, without the need to accommodate the demands of sub-
sonic and transonic acceleration.

In responding to realistic operational demands rather than by pursuing the ulti-
mate technologies, a project and its implied costs become less daunting. SLEEC in
particular would incur a marginal percentage of the tens of billions of dollars already
committed to the Space Station, and yet could save Mission Control from difficult
decisions on who would survive re-entry and who would not. For those selected for
re-entry, even an X-38 could not return injured astronauts to the most appropriate
hospitals if these are thousands of miles apart; two or three SLEECs would offer that
ability with ease. The simplicity of SLEEC may also enhance the prospects that the
scientist will accomplish research in time to influence the design and effectiveness of
a much-needed vehicle; but a part of its simplicity lies in the fact that SLEEC would
draw on much that is already known.
