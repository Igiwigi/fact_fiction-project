]. Introduction

A possibility of ignition and combustion enhancement in
various mixtures by means of the excitation of reactive
molecules was extensively discussed for the past years
(e.g. [1-3]). Interest in this problem is due to the fact that
both vibrationally and electronically excited molecules
