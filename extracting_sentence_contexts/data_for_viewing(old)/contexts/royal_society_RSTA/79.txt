more likely to occur at the same house or nearby houses for some period of time afterwards.
Initial burglaries give criminals information about what valuables remain and the schedule of
inhabitants in the area. Additionally, a successful burglary leaves environmental clues, such as
broken windows, that indicate that an area is more crime-tolerant than others. This effect leads
to repeat and near-repeat burglaries. More generally, criminals tend to move in a bounded region
around a few key nodes and have limited awareness of potential for criminal activity outside of
familiar areas [7-9]. Within neighbourhoods, risk factors are typically homogeneous [10-12]. All
of this explains why observed incidence rates of burglaries are locally smooth.


However, local smoothness is not always appropriate, and in practice there is much room
for improvement. In recent years, several studies on the application of MPLE to crime data
[13-15] emphasize the fact that crime density should have boundaries corresponding to the local
geography. Mohler et al. [13] and Kosti¢ et al. [15] model this by choosing penalty functions that
are edge-preserving, TV and Ginzburg-Landau, respectively. Smith et al. [14] more closely follow
the idea presented here. That work introduces a modified H' MPLE, which based the penalty
term on an additional component of the data. The method assumes that the valid region of the
probability density estimate is known a priori. In their application to residential burglary, the valid
region was the approximate support of the housing density in the region. If we denote the valid
region by D, then the modified penalty term is just a standard H! MPLE with a factor z? in the
integral, where ze is a smooth Ambrosio-Tortorelli approximation of (1 — 6(dD)):
