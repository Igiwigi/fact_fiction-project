having been previously scraped and painted in dry dock in April, 1910. This vessel
was brought again to Plymouth on August 1, 1911, and had her bottom scraped ;
it was then found that there were large numbers of 2. miliaris attached to her.
These were all of the long-spined variety described above, and they varied in
diameter from 3 to 6 em. across the spines. Almost all of these urchins were
mature; and since they could only have attached themselves to the floating hulk
just before metamorphosis, they could not be more than a year old. We raised
a large number of hybrids and pure-bred urchins from this material.

It will thus be seen that in the sea #. miliaris can mature and produce ripe germ
cells within the first year of its existence. In the laboratory we have been
successful also in getting our H. miliaris, raised from the egg, to produce ripe egg
cells when they were barely twelve months old. This has established the fact that
our laboratory conditions, after all, are not so unfavourable for this species, judging
from the fact that the urchins raised in captivity produced germ cells in about the
same time as those growing at large in the sea.

It is remarkable that all three species of Echinus that we have used in this work
can become sexually mature when relatively small and much below their normal full
size. We have obtained ripe eggs from urchins of HE. miliaris when these have
measured less than one centimetre across the spines. In #. esculentus aud EH. acutus
we have likewise frequently found ripe females a mere fraction of their full size.
