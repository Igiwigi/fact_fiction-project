58°C values of both alkyl lipids. This agreement suggests preservation of the
original plant wax isotopic signature in each compound. There are no
clear trends based on lithology or depositional environment. The grey
dashed line is a 1:1 line, the solid line a linear least-squares fit.

pure C; and pure C, landscapes from 2.3 to 1.7 Ma (figure 3).
The median per cent Cy values from C39 acids and C3; alkanes
are in good agreement with each other (63% and 68%, respect-
ively). Although vegetation structure changes throughout this
interval, mixed C3—C4 and C4-dominated landscapes are most
common, particularly after 1.9 Maa. In fact, there are only three
samples that indicate C3-dominated landscapes, all around
2.25 Ma. The data from 2.3 to 1.9 Ma are rather sparse, but
can be characterized as highly variable as they span nearly
the full range of vegetation. After 1.9 Ma, plant wax data
show continued variability, but fall mostly between 39 and
97% C4 vegetation (figure 3).

Plant wax data suggest a secular shift after approximately
2.1 Ma towards more Cy, vegetation in this part of the Turkana
Basin, although the data are temporally restricted to a window
of approximately 0.6 Myr. The mechanism(s) responsible for
the increase in Cy vegetation is (are) not yet clear. Existing
