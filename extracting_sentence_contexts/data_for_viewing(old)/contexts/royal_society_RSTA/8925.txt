Tn this region of the spectrum there are additional strong lines, and it remained to
be seen if these belonged to the above multiplet or not. Attention had already been
given to this region when the lines 1S—1p,.,, were under investigation (p. 137). In the
provisional description given of fig. 1 in Plate 2, it was explained that (a), (b), and (c)
represent three different stages of temperature, (a) corresponding to the highest tem-
perature, (b) a middle stage, and (c) the lowest. In (a) there are many strong lines ;
in (b) some of these lines are absent, and in (c) there remain only two Mn lines. These
have already been shown to be 1S—1p.3; (b) shows these two lines, and in addition
nine other lines (one is not visible in the reproduction on account of its low intensity).
These are precisely the nine lines of the multiplet just described ; the strong arc lines
not belonging to this multiplet are not present at this middle stage of temperature.
Hence the preceding facts may be summarised as follows: At the lowest temperature
two lines appear, namely 1S—1p,,,; at the intermediate temperature the nine lines

of this multiplet appear, while the lines 1S—1p,.., begin to fall off in intensity in
comparison ; at the highest temperature the lines of the multiplet are strong, but many
other strong lines are also present, and the lines 1S —1p,_, have lost much of their intensity.
When the previously mentioned work of K1nc came to hand these results were compared
with those given by the electric furnace. From Krna’s tables it would seem that at
his lowest stage of temperature, which corresponds with the intermediate are (b), there
are only present the nine lines forming the preceding multiplet, with intensities varying
