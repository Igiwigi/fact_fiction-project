For linear constitutive behaviour, the strain energy density assumes the following general
quadratic form in the case of centrosymmetric materials:

1 1
W = 5Cpqmn€pgEmn + zBpgmnkpqkmn, (2.7)

where Epq is the standard infinitesimal strain tensor and Kpq = @qp is the curvature tensor (the
transpose of the gradient of rotation), which by definition is traceless, xp) =0. The elasticity
tensors Cpgmn and Bpgmn are equipped with the following symmetries: Cpgmn = Cmnpgq = Capnm,
Bpqmn = Bmnpq and Bgpmm = 0 (the last equality follows directly from the fact that the curvature
tensor is purely deviatoric [7]). Therefore, in addition to the 21 independent constants defining
the classical elasticity tensor Cpgnm, 36 independent constants are needed for defining Bygmn.
The corresponding constitutive equations are
aw aw
Tq = Dem Cpgmnémn and mpg = Tien = Bpqmnkmn- (2.8)

It is remarked that the Cauchy elastic behaviour is recovered when tensor Bygmn, defining a
‘purely Cosserat behaviour’, is set to zero. The conditions for positive definiteness of the strain
energy density, strong ellipticity of the elasticity tensors and the related van Hove uniqueness
theorem were given recently in [4]. Moreover, assuming that the kinetic energy density is positive
definite implies, in turn, that Sq is also positive definite.
