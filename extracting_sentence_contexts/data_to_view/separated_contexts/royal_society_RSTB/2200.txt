Tetanic convul-
sions and rigidity are, according to Huautincs Jackson and Risten Russet,
symptoms of cerebellar lesions in man. Jn the light of these statements it seems not
improbable that extensor rigidity.is due to the action of the cerebellum when
uncontrolled by the cortex cerebii. Ferrier is, however, inclined to attribute tonic
spasm in cases of cerebellar lesion to the spread of irritation to subjacent parts, such
as the corpora quadrigemina, and in agreement with this view is the fact that tonus,
evoked in decerebrate frogs by weak stimulation of the skin, is abolished by section
of the neural axis below the optic lobes.t In my experiments I have found that the
extensor rigidity established by anemia persists after removal of the cerebral
hemispheres, and disappears before the paralysis of the respiratory centre, so that
its origin is localised to the cerebellum, pons, and mid-brain, DantewsKyt has
recently determined that tonic spasm may be both evoked and inhibited (by skin
stimulations) in the lower limbs of frogs after the spinal cord has been divided for
some months. â€˜Tonus may therefore be of spinal origin.
