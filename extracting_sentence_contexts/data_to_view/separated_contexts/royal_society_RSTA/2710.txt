In his letter, Searle wrote ‘I quite agree with your solution for the motion of an electrified
point, but I do not understand how it will apply when we deal with a sphere’. Searle went

on to show Heaviside that as long as ‘u*/v" is utterly negligible’ then Heaviside’s field line : =
assumption is permissible, but if ‘y2/v? is not neglected’ then the assumption is not valid. 23
Heaviside received this criticism with good spirits, and from that point on, he certainly had a : a
high opinion of his new acquaintance. The fact that Searle, as a youngster, had been given a tour 14
of the Cavendish laboratory by the great Maxwell himself, surely added to Searle’s bona fides _

in Heaviside’s eyes as well. In 1896, Searle published corrections to Heaviside’s point charge
analysis, arriving at expressions including the same famous factor of //1 — (u2/v2) that appeared
in the Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction hypothesis, indicating that they were probing at the very
edges of relativistic electrodynamics [23].

4. Faster-than-light

An immediate, impossible to overlook implication of the predicted mass variation with speed is
the infinity that occurs at the speed of light.
