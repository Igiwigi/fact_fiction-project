There were similarities in the types of pathways within
phyla (figure 1). Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, in particu-
lar, had slightly different sets of pathways compared with
each other and with the other phyla. The fact that the degra-
dation/utilization/assimilation pathways are not distributed
randomly across phyla may have consequences for C cycling. A number of studies have indicated that the co-occurrence of
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from the same phylum
tends to be higher than one would expect from random associ-
ations [49]. Were OTUs from the same phyla also to aggregate at
fine scales (the microbial habitat scale, for example), then the
distribution of degradation/utilization/assimilation pathways
would be uneven across microbial habitats.
