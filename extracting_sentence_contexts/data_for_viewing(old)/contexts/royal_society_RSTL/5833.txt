plete suspension of functional activity; and, from analogy, we may be pretty sure that
this is als true of croton oil and cantharides, although their slow operation renders it
difficult to obtain absolute proof upon the point.

In a physiological point of view, it is an interesting question, what is the cause of the
diffusion of the pigment induced by these three irritants. IT have shown elsewhere®
that concentration is the invariable result of the action of the nerves upon the chroma
tophorous cells, and that diffusion takes place whenever they are liberated from nervous
influence. Als in the tree-frog of the Continent, which is much more liable to changes
in the colour of the integument, in consequence of direct irritation, than our own 5p&
cies, the invariable experience of the German observers was, that concentration followed
the application of a local stimulus, while secondary diffusion sometimes occurred in the
irritated spot, depending apparently upon exhaustionf. From these facts, diffusion
ensuing on irritation cannot well be regarded as an increased action excited by the
Stimulus, but rather as an evidence of diminished vigour. With croton oil and can
tharides, which have not an irritating vapour, the diffusion is exactly limited to the
extent of the irritant, showing that it is due to a direct action on the tissues; and
the most probable explanation of its occurrence appears to be that mustard, croton
oil, and cantharides have the peculiarity among irritants of affecting the nerves of the
pigment-cells in the part they act on, s0mewhat more rapidly than the cells them-
selves, and, paralysing the former while the latter still retain their powers more ge
less intact, permit diffusion to go on unrestrained by nervous influence, till the further
operation of the irritant completely snspends the pigmentary functions, It may be ob-
jected to this view, that diffusion occurs on the application of these substances £0 «
