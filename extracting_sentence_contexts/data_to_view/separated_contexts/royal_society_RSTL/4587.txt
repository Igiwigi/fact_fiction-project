Hence in a mixture of salts
we may have more than one state of equilibrium possible. And when a salt, like
alum, happens to be dissolved in snch a way as to decompose it, the constituents are
not necessarily reunited by subsequent mixing. Many practices in the chemical arts,
which seem empirical, have their foundation possibly in facts of this kind,

8. Diffusion of one Salt into the Solution of another Salt. It was curious and peculiarly important, in reference to the relation of liquid to
gaseous diffusion, to find whether one salt A would diffuse into water already charged
