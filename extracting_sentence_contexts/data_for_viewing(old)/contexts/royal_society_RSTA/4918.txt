Figure 2. Phase diagrams for the signedspikes image class and P; reconstruction. DT phase diagrams (a,b) and ALMT phase
diagrams (c,d). Gaussian sensing matrices (a,c) and fan-beam CT system matrices (b,d). Theoretical phase-transition curves for
Gaussian sensing matrices (red), empirical phase-transition curve at 50% contour line (cyan), and 5% and 95% contour lines
(yellow and magenta).

For LP, we consider the natural non-negative version of the signedspikes class, which we call
spikes, with the single change that values are sampled from the uniform distribution on [0,1]
(see [22] for illustration).

We construct again empirical DT and ALMT phase diagrams and display them in figure 3
together with the theoretical Gaussian-case phase-transition curves for LP. Also in this case, the
CT phase diagrams are almost identical to the Gaussian case, in terms of both the empirical phase-
transition curve and the width as indicated by the 5% and 95% contour lines. In fact, the similarity
is even larger, as the cyan 50% contour in the CT case coincides with the theoretical transition
curve, except at the bottom left corner of the DT phase diagram, as before caused by having
only one or two CT projections. In accordance with the theoretical curves, we see that even fewer
samples suffice for recovery in the non-negative case compared to before.
