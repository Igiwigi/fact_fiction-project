Tangential sections show that the number of archesporial cells is large;

it becomes more irregular with age (fig. 77), the cells of this sterile tissue for
their way upwards into the sporogenous tissue, and occasionally forming multie

been already noted in L. clavatum. :

Beyond the facts now described, the structure of the sporangium of L, alj

L. clavatum, notwithstanding the rather marked difference of external appe
the two species.

Abortive sporangia are commonly found in this species, both at the upper and ;
limits of the strobilus; they show, perhaps better than in any other species,
gradual steps of transition from the fully mature to the completely abortive condi

In the species of Selaginella which have been examined similar abortive spor
