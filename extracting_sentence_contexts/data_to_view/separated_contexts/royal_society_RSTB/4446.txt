What is more, this additional increase is brought ,
about entirely by increasing the rate of the respiration, for the depth of the breathing
is actually somewhat less than in Experiments 8 and 9. The excessive character of
the breathing is well brought out by the extremely low percentage of CO, in the
expired air (3 per cent., as opposed to 4} per cent. or more in the previous experi-
ments), as well as by the fact that the volume of expired air per 1 e.c. of CO, given
off is 39°8 c.c., instead of the 26°9 ¢.c. observed in the experiments with work of
1056 kg.m. per minute; had the latter ratio held good in Experiment 12, the
volume of air breathed per minute would have been only 77°5 litres instead of 114°8. The volume of air breathed per minute remains about as great during the first
minute after the stop of the work as it was during the work.
