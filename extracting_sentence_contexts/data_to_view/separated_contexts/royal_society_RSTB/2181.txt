In the epidermis round the apex are stomata communi-
cating with air spaces. The whole structure resembles a water gland, and suggests
an organ which at least promotes transpiration, if it does not also secrete drops of
water. It also throws light upon the fact that the formation of outgrowths often
begins on the leaf teeth, since, transpiration being checked by a damp atmosphere,
water would tend to collect at the point where it is normally most. abundantly
discharged. In order to determine whether the plant secreted drops of water, a healthy branch
was placed in water in a U-tube, into which mercury was poured, the whole being
covered with a bell-jar standing in water.
