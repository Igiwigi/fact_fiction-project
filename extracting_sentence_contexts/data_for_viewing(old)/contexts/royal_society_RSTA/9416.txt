170 DR. 8. CHAPMAN ON THE LUNAR DIURNAL MAGNETIC VARIATION,

amending paper (‘ Met. Zeitschr.,’ 12, p. 589, 1913) withdrew his earlier suggestion of
a primary internal magnetic field concerned in the lunar variations; it may be
_remarked incidentally that such a field is rendered unlikely by the magnitude of the
components other than semi-diurnal in the magnetic variations.* These appear to be
excited by the semi-diurnal atmospheric tide in conjunction with a variable electrical
conductivity of the atmosphere, depending on the solar hour angle; their phases
change by multiples of 27 in the course of a lunation, according to ascertained laws.
While only secondary phenomena, they are comparable in magnitude with the
main (semi-diurnal) component of the lunar variation, so much so, in fact, that it
is hardly possible for more than a very small fraction of the latter to be due to
internal causes, since this portion would not account for any part of the secondary
components,

Since perigee and apogee occur at all phases of the moon during a sufficiently long
period of time, no explanation of the perigee-apogee phase change in the magnetic
variations can be looked for in any direct solar action.

Thus far, therefore, the attempt to assign a known cause to this remarkable
phenomena has been unsuccessful. It remains to make one more suggestion, which is
at once very tentative and far from definite. We should naturally suppose that the
tidal effect of the moon is to produce a lunar magnetic variation A cos (2¢+a),
