and for which one equivalent of hydrogen is given off at the platinode, is not. more
than a fourth of an equivalent, nor less than a fifth. The majority of the results;
however, indicate the former proportion. Could it be possible that a whole equivalent of acid was, in fact, carried over to
the zincode, but was counteracted by that species of endosmose which I have before
described, by which three fourths of an equivalent might be transported in the oppo-
site direction to the platinode ? As this transfer is, however, more of a mechanical than of an electrolytical nature,
it could not well take place without a visible rise of the liquid in the platinode cell,
and none such was ever observed. It occurred to me that this question might be set
at rest by multiplying the diaphragms between the electrodes.
