It is true the Pteridophyta
Bnt living are smaller than many of the individuals of former ages: but their
do not show evidence of reduction of type, or of coalescence, as compared
sir fossil relatives. If the living strobiloid types have been reduced as regards
ore-bearing parts, their relatives, the Calamarieze and Lepidodendra, must also
en reduced ; that is, some of the earliest fossil plants of which we have any
knowledge would have to be looked upon as reduced types, and in the
hing scale of evolution. This is doubtless possible, but seems to me by no means
b&; in fact, it is very much like a reductio ad absurdum. Accordingly I con-
#1 this, as also on grounds of general comparison, that the more probable view
the strobiloid types, both ancient and modern, are in the ascending scale of
Wn, as they must certainly be if our working hypothesis is sound.
e now examined types of all the genera of living Vascular Cryptogams,
Be of the Filicinee. On the latter, rather extensive observations have also
Bade, but I propose to hold back such results as are already in hand till my
t&ations of the Filicineze have been completed.
