The most laborious part of this proof is the verification of the
associative law ofnormal form multiplication. This difficulty is avoided by van der Waerden
(1948), who introduces the product of the given groups as a permutation group of the set
of normal words; this is our group © of chapter 1 (p. 509). In fact, van der Waerden deals
only with the case of the ordinary free product (with only the trivial group amalgamated) ;
but there appears to be no obstacle to an extension of his proof to the case here considered. We here follow a similar way, which may perhaps not lead to the goal more rapidly than
Schreier’s or especially van der Waerden’s, but which allows us to derive some new supple-
mentary results. We also construct a permutation group—different, in general, from van
der Waerden’s—rather than the required generalized free product itself, and we then derive
the existence of this latter by an application of theorem (8-4) (p. 521).
