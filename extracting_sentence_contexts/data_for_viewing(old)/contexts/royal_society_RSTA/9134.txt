(1) an arbitrary unnatural trajectory C, satisfying the conditions of constraint ;

(2) the constrained natural trajectory O* ;

(3) the free natural trajectory C**.

We have, by (3.54), at the point R

(3.64) © 82*[« (C, O**)? = 27 an, (f" — Q") (f* — Q*) — (L = da")?
(3.641) 81" [« (O*, C**)} = 27 a,,, (f*" — Q") (f*" — Q"),

use being made of the facts that the law of energy (3.23) is satisfied for C* and that,
at R, T* is equal to 7. Now the equations of motion for C* are, as in (3.63)

(3.65) fr= e+ P,
and therefore, using (3.631),
