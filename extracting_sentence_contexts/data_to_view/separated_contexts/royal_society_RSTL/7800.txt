of silica. This remarkable result, together with the numbers of his
Sanalysis, he interpreted as indicating the presence of a magnesian trisilicate, probably
Smeaning thereby a sesquisilicate (magnesium epideutosilicate), 'The specimen which he
<analyzed he described as coming from Grimma, in Saxony. This specimen was, in fact,
Sa portion of a mass preserved in the collection of the Duke of Gotha, and doubtless

Sthe middle of the sixteenth century in a wood near Naunhof in the neighbourhood of
2 Grimma, CnLapxif, however, held this view to be untenable, grounding his opinion
Zon the completeness of the meteorite preserved at Gotha, both as regards its form and its
Qerust, while he adds that the Naunhof mass must have been far too great to allowof its being
transported, and, indeed, that it had never been rediscovered. It is in every way probable
that the material STROMEYER really had to work upon was from a Saxon locality, and in
fact a specimen from a fall, to which the Rittersgriin and Breitenbach siderolites belong.
