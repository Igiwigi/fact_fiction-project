In Table VIII. we have for every fortnight (beginning with January 14th of each year)
the readings of the equalized curve or that exhibited by a dotted line. It is proper to
remark that, in order to obtain these readings, this curve was first laid down on a very
much larger scale than that exhibited in the accompanying Plate. Results of Reduction.

28, From Table VIII. we obtain the following epochs for the minima and maxima of
the longer period of solar disturbances ;—

Minimum Nov. 28, 1833

Magmam” I 7 Dec. 21, 1836
Minimum Sept. 21, 1843
Menu .. > Nov. 14, 1847
Minimum April 21, 1856
Maximum Sept. 7, 1859

Minimum Feb. 14, 1867 |
We deduce from these numbers, in the first instance, the fact of the variability of the
length of the whole period

Thus we have from first to second minimum . . . . . 981 years.
from second to third ,, . . . . . . 12:98 years.
from third. to fourth _ ,, . . .- . . .. 10'S1 years. Mean of the three periods. . . 1107 years. Secondly, we see that in all of the three cases the time from a minimum to the next
maximum is less than that from a maximum to the next minimum,—a fact which has,
we think, been previously noticed by Sir J.
