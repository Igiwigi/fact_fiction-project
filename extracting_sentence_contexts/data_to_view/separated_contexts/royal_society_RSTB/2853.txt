This description holds
good equally for Sphenophyllum fertile, and the course of the bundles supplying the
sporangia seems also to have been identical in the two cases. The pedicel in
B. Rimeri is described as having enlarged epidermal cells limited to its outer side,
just as in our fossil,** while the large-celled external epidermis of the lamina (Schuppe)
is similar to, though more strongly developed than in the lateral enlargements of the
wall which occur near the base of the sporangium,tt a description which might have
been taken from Sphenophyllum fertile. The fact that the bracts of B. RÃ©meri are free
nearly to their base} is also a point of resemblance to the appendages of our strobilus. On the other hand there are important differences between S. fertile and the
Cracow fossil. In the latter, the sporangiophores are described as free from each
