Section 5.—Discussion of Foregoing Results and Test Experiments. Two facts stand out prominently in the foregoing calculations. Firstly, the fact
that the amount of flow calculated from the rate of flow is, except in the case of the
elder, always greater than the actual amount, and, secondly, the fact that the
amount of flow as calculated from PorseurLue’s formula is from 7-300 times the actual
flow, the difference becoming greater as the diameter of the conducting vessels
increases. The explanation of the first point is simple. The method used gives the maximal
rate of flow, and not the average rate, and, further, the calculation is based on
the assumption that all the vessels are equally active in the conveyance of water,
and that all of them are completely filled with water.
