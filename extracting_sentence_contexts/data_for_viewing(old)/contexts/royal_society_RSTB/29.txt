gradually diminishing in diameter, whilst their numbers are multiplied, must be reduced either to the
condition of aérial twigs or of subdividing roots and rootlets. If the former, where are their foliar
appendages? If the latter, why do not their fibro-vascular bundles show the symmetrical arrangement
telling of the centripetal development so characteristic of the proto-xylems of all roots? Of conrse the
idea suggests itself that these curious objects may have had some relationships with the rootless sub-
terranean branches of Psilotum, though many difficulties interfere with our ready acceptance of this
explanation. August 12th, 1887.]

pages? One fact is undeniable, viz.: that certain portions of them, obviously stems
or branches, possessed, when living, a true cambium which developed xylem and
phloem in a normally exogenous manner. The same statement applies to two other
plants described in previous memoirs, and which must be considered along with those
just named. These are Lyginodendron Oldhamium and Heterangium Grrievii ; besides
which close affinities appear to exist between the Lyginodendron and Rachiopteris
aspera, also described in the Memoir, Part VI.

Canals, precisely like those in the bark of Kaloxylon Hookeri, exist equally in the
inner bark of Lyginodendron and of Rachiopteris aspera. The latter is unquestion-
ably a rachis of a Fern; whilst the former displays a wonderfully clear exogenous
development of its xylem zone. I have more than once, in previous memoirs,
suggested that the 2. aspera was the petiole of the leaf of the Lyginodendron ; and
