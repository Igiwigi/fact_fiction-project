a certain potential gradient has been reached. As the potential difference is further
increased the current increases more slowly, but uniformly, with the potential difference
until another critical potential gradient has been reached, beyond which the current
increases much more rapidly than the potential difference, and this rapid increase
goes on until an actual spark discharge takes place between the electrodes. From
fig. 4 we see that in hydrogen at 20 millims. pressure this latter stage begins when
the potential gradient is about 80 cells per 3°5 millims., or nearly 500 volts
per centimetre. This second rise in the curve has been shown by Professor ‘TowNsEND
(Phil. Mag.,’ 6th series, vol. 1, p. 198, 1901) to be due to the ionisation of the
molecules of the gas by the corpuscles themselves, and the potential gradient at
which it begins is inversely proportional to the pressure.

The fact that the current-E.M.F. curves are not horizontal even when we should
expect saturation, and that they become steeper and steeper at their flattest parts as
the pressure is decreased, seems to indicate that there is ionisation by collision to
some extent at gradients much below those at which the second rise in the curve
leading up to the spark discharge commences. We have not as yet, however,
succeeded in obtaining a thoroughly satisfactory explanation of this phenomenon.

According to Pascuen’s tables, quoted in Professor J. J. Tnomson’s ‘ Recent
Researches,’ the potential gradient necessary for a spark to pass between plates
0°35 centim. apart in air is 116 electrostatic units per centimetre, or 34,800 volts per
centimetre at 750 millims, pressure, and in hydrogen 0°55 of this, or 19,200 volts per
centimetre. On the supposition, therefore, that ionisation by collision begins at
potential gradients slightly lower than those necessary for the discharge to occur—
