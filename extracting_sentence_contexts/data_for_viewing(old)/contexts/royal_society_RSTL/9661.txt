For if in the production of artificial rhythm the exhaustion of contractile tissues is
found to play 80 essential a part, ib becomes incredible that it should not likewise
play some part in the production of natural rhythm. TI am therefore led to suppose
thab in all ganglio-mnscular tissnes which present rhythmic movement, the rhythm
is not exclusively due to any resistance mechanism on the part of the ganglionic
tissues, but that ib is ab any rate in large measure due to this alternate rise and
fall of excitability on the part of the nuscular tisswes. And I have submitted that
this view is sustained, @ priori, by the fact that rhythmic action is of the most
frequent occurrence in lowly organized tissues where as yet there has been no segrega-
tion of ganglionic structure, and, @ posteriori, by the fact that in Sarsia the same
ganglia supply at the same time a stimulus to the rhythmic action of the lowly
excitable tissues of the bell, and a stimulus to the tonic action of the more highly
excitable tissues of the polypite. And, as additional facts confirmatory of the same
view, I have also cited the observations of Eoxknarp, HeDpeNmAiN, FosteR, and DEW
Sar on the rhythmic action of the heart-apex under the influence of the constant
current; the observations of Dr. FosTER on the rhythmic action of the same tissue
under the influence of the faradaic current ; his observations on the phenomena of
artificial rhythm as they occur in the Snail's heart; the observations of Dr. BurRDoN
SANDERSON and Mr. PacGs on the rhythmic properties of the excitable tissnes of
Dionaa ; and my own observations on the rhythmical motions of the Frog's tongue.
But in thus suggesting 8ome modification in the current theory of ganglionic action,
T have been careful to state that I Uo not attempt to overturn, but merely to supple-
ment it. I think T have shown that the theory in question is inadequate to account
for all the facts, and that in order to render it a complete theory, we must recognise,
nob only a periodicity of stimulation on the part of the ganglionic tissnes, but also an
