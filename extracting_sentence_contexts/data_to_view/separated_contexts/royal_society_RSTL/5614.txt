FAIRBAIRN ON THE RESISTANCE OF TUBES TO COLLAPSE. 401

one, the loss being much greater in the former than in the latter case, although the
ratio of the diameters is about the same. Allowance must, however, be made for inac-
curacies of construction, though we might reasonably have expected a nearer approxima-
tion in the ratios of the deficiency of strength. From these facts, however, it is obvious
that in every construction, where tubes have to sustain a uniform external Pressure,
the cylindrical is the only form to be relied upon, and any departure from it is attended
| with danger. Resistance of Tubes to Internal Pressure. During the investigation on the comparative resisting powers of tubes to collapse, a
question arose as to the relative powers of cylindrical tubes to resist an internal force
S acting uniformly over their surface.
