In them the medullary
Sheath cut off all such direct communication. These changes bring us very near to
the narrow medullary sheath, composed, as in living Gymnosperms, of spiral vessels,
Seen in the Britigh Dadoxylons and in the St. Etienne Cordaites; and, considering how
many © missing links” have been discovered during the last five years, I have little
doubt but that our continued researches will supply yeb further transitional forms,
and thus establish the unbroken unity of this chain of vegetable structures. Hence, though once holding a different view, I am now convinced that so far as we
are acquainted with the organisation of the plants of the Coal-measures, such facts as I
have briefly referred to are in thorough conformity with the doctrine of Evolution,
and that these most characteristic plants can no longer be quoted in opposition to
that doctrine. Our knowledge of the fourth point, viz. : of the organs of reproduction amongst the
carboniferous plants, is as yeb too imperfect to admit of our employing them as wit-
nesses.
