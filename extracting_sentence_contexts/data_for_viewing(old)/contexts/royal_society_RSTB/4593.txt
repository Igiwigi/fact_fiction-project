et que, par conséquent, elles restent caractérisées par la plus importante des propriétés
du tissu qui constitue les furea. S’il en est bien ainsi, c'est linvagination, non
apparante, qui fournit les corpora allata, qui représente linvagination tentoriale
mandibulaire que Hetper a cherché, en vain, entre la mandibule et la maxille.” This
interpretation is not accepted by BerLese (1909, p. 599), who regards these organs as
being glandular in function with an internal secretion. Napert (1913), who has
& recently made an extensive study of the corpora allata, in representatives of most
orders of insects, holds a similar opinion.

In their method of development, and their histological structure, it appears probable
that the corpora allata are to be regarded as modified ectodermal glands, which have
lost communication with the exterior, and become ductless organs. secreting certain
hormones into the blood. The fact that they are found in all orders of insects
suggests that their presence is essential to the vital economy of those organisms.

(b) The Winged Forms.—In the winged forms the nervous system comprises a
similar number of thoracic and abdominal ganglia as in the soldier. It differs from
that caste in several respects, of which the following are the most important: (1) The
general morphology of the brain and cerebral nerves; (2) the much shorter con-
nectives uniting the infra-cesophageal ganglion with that of the prothorax ; (3) the
presence of nerves to the wing muscles.

The brain (Plate 7, fig. 44, and Plate 10, fig. 61) measures on an average 1°28 mm.
transversely, and 0°72 mm. in the antero-posterior direction. As a rule, it attains
slightly greater dimensions than that of the soldier ; the optic lobes are somewhat
