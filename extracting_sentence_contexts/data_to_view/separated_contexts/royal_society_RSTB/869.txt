In this species the colour of the upper side is not so deep as in
the Plaice, Flounder, or Turbot, and both upper and lower sides are more pigmented
in larger than in smaller specimens. It should be noted that this species belongs to
deeper water than the Plaice, Flounder, Turbot, and other species, Its young have
not been found at less depths than 80 fathoms, and the adult has been taken at all
depths up to 700 fathoms. Perhaps the peculiarity is related to the fact that light
at greater depths is more dispersed than in shallow water, and therefore affects the
MDCCCXCIIT.â€” B, 5 L
