taken apart ; and the pendulum may thus be, at any time, exposed to the free
air: whereby the experiments may be alternately made in the confined cylin-
der, and in the free air. But my apparatus consists of one uniform brass tube,
and is not adapted to such a change of experiments,

Anomalies of the knife edge $uspension.

It has been shown by Captain Sapixg, in his Account of Experiments, &c.
page 195, that, in a pendulum with knife edges, a considerable difference may
arise in the results, if they be used with different planes: but it does not appear
to have occurred to any one, versed in these experiments, that a much greater
difference than that which he has recorded may arise from using the same
knife edge with the same plane. This fact has probably hitherto escaped de-
tection from the peculiar manner in which pendulum experiments are usually
conducted: for, on examining the detail of most of those experiments, it will
be found that after the pendulum at any one station has been placed in its Y's,
it has never been removed therefrom, but merely raised and lowered again as
occasion may require, till it has been ultimately dismounted, and packed up
for another station ; whereby any anomaly that might otherwise have occurred,
is thus avoided, and consequently escapes detection. Experiments, however,
of this kind, ought to be varied in every possi√æle way, in order to guard against
any unsuspected source of error.

When Captain Bas, Har returned from his voyage to the Pacific Ocean,
where he had undertaken to swing the pendulum at various places, it was
