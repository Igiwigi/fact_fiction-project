decompose. I am able, however, to agree with Dr. Eter's statement that, other
things equal, the unmutilated tisswes preserve their irritability longer than those
from which lithocysts have been remoyed; and 1 am able to agree with his state-
ment that the rate of the natural rhythm has a tendeney to bear an inverse pro-
portion to the size of the individual, though I find that size is not the only factor
in determining snch rate. But his further statements with regard to the duration
of the natural pauses bearing a direct proportion to the number and strength of the
previous contractions, require, I think, to be taken with reserve; for both in Aurelia
and in Sarsia, although a general relation of this kind may be observed, T have not
found it to be s0 precise as Nr.
