will be remarked that in the act of rising into vapour it is decomposed, and what is
one volume in the case of oxalic ether vapour is two volumes in the case of nitrous
ether. Several other examples of this kind will be found. I have already referred
to such facts as being favourable to the hypothesis of media which attributes a
mechanical origin to the law of volumes, and have likewise referred to the remarkable
circumstance that compounds which thus disunite in the act of vaporization neverthe-
less obey the general law of vapours (see Note B). As it seems, from the nature of
the function that expresses this law, that a mechanical origin may be found for it
also, the investigation of the subject might, perhaps, be made easier if the chart lines
of vapour were determined for mixtures of pure alcohol and water in all proportions,
and also for mixtures of alcohol and ether. We should then, perhaps, discover the law of variation of the two constants G and
H of the chart line, and this might provide us with a new condition or effect of the
primary cause pointing to its origin from a new ground.
