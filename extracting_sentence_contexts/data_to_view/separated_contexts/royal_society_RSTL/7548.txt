L. CLARKE ON THE INTIMATE STRUCTURE OF THE BRAIN.

(17) It has been shown that the wpper roots of the spinal-accessory nerve arise from
a special nucleus in the medulla oblongata, behind the canal, and that the lower roots
have their origin in the lateral grey substance and anterior cornu of the spinal cord. Tt
is an interesting fact that the hypoglossal nerve has a similar kind of double origin. Its Zower roots arise from the upper remains of the anterior cornu, as T formerly showed
in the Sheep Â®, and as may now be seen in Man (fig. 28 x, Plate X.). Here the central
nucleus Z, which gives origin to the wpper roots, is only jus: marked out and contains
only a few small cells; while the remains of the anterior cornu (F') contain tyyo little
groups of large multipolar cells in connexion with the lower roots @.

(18) In fig. 25, Plate X., J is an exact representation of the central nucleus of the
upper roots of the hypoglossal nerve in Man, a little below the level of the calamus
scriptorius, and on a level with the wpper roots of the spinal-accessory nerye (7).
