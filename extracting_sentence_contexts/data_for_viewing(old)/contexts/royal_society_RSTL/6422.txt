Tulus.—The most detailed account of the generative organs, and formation of

egg, in Julus, is that given by Mr. NEwPoRT, in his celebrated memoir * On the nn
of Reproduction and the Development of the Myriapoda *.” Mr. Nzweorr c \
dexcribes the ovary as consisting of an elongated bag, which © in the pregnant female

smooth and distended with ova that have passed into it from the ovisacs ;” but he figures
and describes these ovisacs as projecting freely from the outer side of the oyary, whereas,
in fact, in Julus as in Glomeris, the egg-follicles project into the free cavity of the 0

and do not project from its outer swrface. Mr. NEwPoRT was perhaps led into this error
partly by what he expected to see, but also partly, no doubt, by a misinterpretation of
what he actually did see. The wall of the ovary is extremely delicate, and at, the game
time 80 firmly united to innumerable trachez, and to parts of the fatty tissue, that it 1g
almost impossible to detach the organ without injury ; but if the wall is pierced, the
egg-follicles immediately make their way out of the orifice, and the organ takes on an
appearance much like that represented in his fig. 5, plate 3. The egg-follicles do not,
however, clothe the whole inner gurface of the ovary, but in this genus, as in Glomerts
and Polydesmus, are confined to two long ribbon-shaped parts which run along almos
the whole length of the organ.
