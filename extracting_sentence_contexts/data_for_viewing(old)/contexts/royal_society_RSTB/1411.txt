Save direct evidence proving that branches became abortive and were enclosed

edt Here the normal pith -of the branch can be traced outwards, up to a

Action. ‘The section is obviously median, so there can be no doubt that the

is shown in some of the transverse sections (see Plate 80, fig. 22), which pass
