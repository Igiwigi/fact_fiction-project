available FE packages that allow the user to introduce custom elements (springs, dampers)
between two DOFs and to define custom force-displacement/velocity relationships for each of
them.

Updating involves adjusting the values of the coefficients which have been identified by
Quantification in order to model the response characteristics. Updating is an iterative procedure:
each updating loop requires the evaluation (simulation) of the modelled system and subsequent
correlation with experimental data. If the residual errors are too high, another updating loop is
performed, using a different set of initial conditions.

The measured data are usually displayed in the form of FRFs, while—at the present time—
the evaluation of the system is generally performed in a time-domain framework. Time-domain
simulations are generally very slow due to the small time steps involved and the fact that they
must evaluate through all the transient information to get to a steady state. This scales poorly
with the dimension of the system and results in a difficult correlation process, requiring extensive
resources and post-processing effort in order to trim the transients and cast numerical data in
the same domain as experimental data. This heavy post-processing adds to the evaluation time,
rendering the updating process unacceptably slow.

Given this issue, there arises the need for a simulation tool that lets the user evaluate the
nonlinear equations directly in the steady-state frequency domain. There are already some
methods under development, mainly using harmonic balance and numerical continuation
techniques [5]. The updating of nonlinear FE models will definitely benefit from these methods,
once perfected.
