able to make out under a high power (,)-inch N.A. 1°4) that the dots consist of two
parallel lines, thus reproducing the appearance commonly seen at the base of the
so-called olfactory sete on the first antenne of the Cladocera. I have very little doubt
that these dots and vague filaments do really represent the remains of structures very
similar to, if not identical with, the sensory organs alluded to.

Second Antenne. (Figs. 11 & 12, also Plate 23, fig. 1.)}—These were a very character-
istic feature, for they were large and biramous with long plumose sete, retaining in fact
almost exactly the general form found in the larval stages of all Branchiopods. The
basal portion, apparently consisting of three short joints, gave rise to an outer branch
of five joints and a shorter inner branch of two joints.

The first joint of the outer ramus was rather short, the second slightly longer, and they
were armed apparently with two and three strong spines respectively. The three suc-
ceeding joints were rather more slender, about equal in length but decreasing somewhat
in diameter. Each gave rise to a series of long plumose sete, the numbers being pro-
bably as follows: first joint, four; second joint, three ; last joint, five, two being from
the tip. The extreme end of the last joint was always sharply reduced in diameter.

The basal joint of the inner ramus was rather shorter than the second joint and was
