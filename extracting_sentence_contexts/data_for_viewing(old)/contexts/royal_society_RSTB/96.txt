such as yielded figs. 12, 15, 16, and 17. These extremely minute bodies are, according
to my view, budded off in large quantities from the hypha.* They then multiply
further by budding in the cells. This explains their shapes, which are Y and V-shaped,
or branched still more, in the younger states, but more uniformly ellipsoidal when
older, and also accounts for their rapid increase in numbers.

The bacterium-like corpuscles are thus to be looked upon as extremely minute,
elongated, yeast-like cells or gemmules, and it is not difficult to suppose that their
sudden and rapid increase in the juices of the cell would give rise to the vacuolation
of the protoplasm. It seems impossible to doubt that the so-catled plasmodium seen
by various observers in these tubercles is really the protoplasm of the cells themselves,
stimulated into increased activity by these parasitic gemmules.t In any case this seems
a fair explanation of the fact that the protoplasm of the cell becomes exceptionally
frothy and vacuolated, and the cell itself enlarges quickly, coincidently with the
appearance and rapid increase of the tiny gemmules. At this time, also, vigorous
specimens have these cells abundantly supplied with starch at the period when the
above increase in size and coincident multiplication of gemmules occur (fig. 12). The
only explanation seems to be that the parasitic gemmules and hyphe are stimulating
the protoplasm to greater activity, and thus making the cell act as a centre of attrac-
tion for the plentiful supplies of carbo-hydrates sent down from the leaves, and other
substances coming up from the root-hairs.

Tracing the hyphz from the cortex into the young tubercle, then, and the changes
which go on in the cells of the latter, the following facts are to be noted. The single
stout hypha (fig. 94) first breaks up into numerous branches (figs. 8-12) which
