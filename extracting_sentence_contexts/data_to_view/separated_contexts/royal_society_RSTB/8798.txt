Figure 4. The sensitivity of actions to outcome devaluation in instrumental conditioning. (a) Animals make an ‘enter the magazine’ (EM) response to consume the
outcome, and then make another lever-press response (LP) to earn the next outcome. (b) By over-training, the EM and LP responses combine to make the action
sequences EM — LP and LP — EM, which presumably can be circular. The outcome falls within the boundaries of the EM — LP action sequence and, as a
consequence, after offline devaluation of outcome, the sequence retains its previous value.
