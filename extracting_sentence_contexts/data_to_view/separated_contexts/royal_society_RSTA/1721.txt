The cause of the difficulty is to be found in the fact
that now the stationary value may be expected to arise from values of n for which « is small. Then n is
nearly equal to z, and in all such cases more complicated analysis is inevitable. In fact the approximations
to S, (2) and E, (2) require to be modified by different formule corresponding to the cases n > 2, <2
and to the cases in which |n —2| is of order 2/s or of lower order. SCATTERING OF PLANE ELECTRIC WAVES BY SPHERES. 199

Let us now consider the problem of waves incident from some source (or sources)
and reflected from the surface 8.
