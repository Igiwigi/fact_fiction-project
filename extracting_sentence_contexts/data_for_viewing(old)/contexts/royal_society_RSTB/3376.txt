optic radiations can be injected from above downwards, not only from the posterior
cerebral, but also from the middle cerebral artery. That the whole of the point of
the lobe (? occipital pole) can be well injected by the two sets of vessels; that
a capillary injection of the calcarine cortex can be made from the middle cerebral
artery through the little arteries which pass into the medullary substance and optic
radiations which are supplied by the middle cerebral artery, and that this area of the
median surface of the occipital lobe has also numerous communications with the
Anterior cerebral artery, so that from this artery it is possible to supply the posterior
cerebral and the middle cerebral arterial area as far as the point of the lobe, also
a part of the calearine cortex, as well as the greater part of the optic radiations, He
concludes that Monakow’s idea—that an exclusively cortical lesion of the cortex
around the calearine fissure is an anatomical impossibility—is against anatomical
researches and evident pathological facts.

He also thinks (p. 83)* that the seat of the representation of the macula of the
retina is probably in the anterior part of the occipital lobe, and especially the part
within the calcarine fissure, 2.¢., the gyrus or pedunculus cunei. This part would be,
he thinks, specially favoured for nutrition, as it could derive its blood supply
from three different arteries (anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral), whereas the
posterior part of the calcarine fissure could get its supply from only two different
arteries, the middle and posterior cerebral arteries ; and this would explain why the
vision for the macular region so often escapes in cases of hemianopia.

I have, therefore, made observations to determine : (1) The distance of the gyrus
or pedunculus cunei—the apex at the anterior end of the cuneus, which is anterior to
