therefore increase biodiversity by preventing any single species from dominating. In experimental
field studies, observing either natural or artificial fires, the frequency of fires can increase the
richness of species that live deep within forests and at forest edges, but species of open landscapes,
open forests and interior forests were not influenced by fire frequency. Fire also had a positive
impact on animal diversity for most subclades of insects and spiders, but reduced biodiversity
of isopods and weevils, some of which prefer damp habitats in dead wood. Flying arthropods
proved to be most resilient to fire, then pollen-feeders and foragers, and ground-litter scavengers.
were least able to recover following major fires.

There are three reasons that wildfires, although they may have been prevalent at the time of
the PTME, were probably minor killers: (i) wildfires had been common throughout the Permian,
and there is limited evidence they were larger or more devastating at the PTB than earlier; (ii)
effects of wildfires can be quickly repaired; and (iii) fire can in fact increase biodiversity, rather
than simply reduce it.

(g) Ozone destruction as a killer on land

The ozone shield around the atmosphere may have been destroyed at the end of the Permian
by one of three atmospheric gases: halogens, hydrogen sulfide or organohalogens. The initial
suggestion was injection of chlorine and fluorine into the atmosphere from the Siberian Traps
eruptions [60,66]. Alternatively, or in addition, hydrogen sulfide and methane generated in the
euxinic oceans might have leaked into the atmosphere and had the same effect, although that
has been questioned [66,67]. Another possible cause of breakdown of the ozone layer was the
postulated release of large quantities of organohalogens from the heating of organic-rich rocks
and hydrothermal fluids, particularly by the passage of molten lavas of the Siberian Traps through
