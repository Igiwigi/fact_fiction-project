which is identical to the microcanonical results, although the latter involved no thermodynamic
large-N limit, but only a small-e limit.

The agreement of the two calculations indicates that the two limits « > 0 and N + oo commute
in this case. The microcanonical result provides an added value, since it is valid for any N, even in
the absence of the thermodynamic limit, under the hypothesis of ergodicity. In the condensate
state examined here, where most of the energy is concentrated in a few modes, there is no
guarantee that the grand canonical result applies. In fact, in the example presented in the next
section, we show that the microcanonical and grand canonical ensembles give different results.

3. Reversals in free-slip flow in the square domain

(a) Microcanonical calculation

In the problem examined below, one can easily show that the grand canonical description fails. We
consider the TEE in a square (x,y) € [0, af =:D with free-slip boundary conditions. This allows
one to write the stream function as a double-sine series with real coefficients Wn,m
