The term ‘pollinator’ implies
that foraging confers a benefit of pollen transfer to the visited
plant, which cannot be assumed without detailed study in the field
[2]. Regardless, our discussion of signal detection pertains to all
flower-foraging animals, regardless of the effects of their behaviours
on plants. Selection, however, can be expected to have acted on signal
production primarily to enhance visitation by the set of visitors that do
in fact confer benefits to plants (i.e. those that consistently pollinate
by their actions). We return to this point in §4. References
