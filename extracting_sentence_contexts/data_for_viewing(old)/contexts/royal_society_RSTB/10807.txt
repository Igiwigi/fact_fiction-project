finally matched against a viral genome database (figure 1a) papillomaviruses (HPV), revealed an average of approximately
[7-9,11-19]. Variability in sequencing depth is typically 200 ppm of viral mRNA reads in relation to the total library size,
accounted for by normalizing to the total number of obtained ranging from 11 to 598 ppm for cervical squamous cell carci-

reads, for example by stating viral expression levels as â€˜reads noma and endocervical adenocarcinoma, and 22 to 848 ppm


for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Similarly, the aver-
age hepatitis B virus (HBV) mRNA content in 11 liver
hepatocellular carcinomas was also nearly 200 ppm, ranging
from 2 to 854 ppm with three tumours containing less than
10 ppm viral mRNA [9]. The low proportion of HBV reads in
some samples likely reflects the fact that some HBV-initiated
liver tumours are able to proliferate in the absence of the viral
genome.

Results from six AIDS-associated lymphomas containing
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV/HHV4) revealed viral expression
ranging from 145 to 8857ppm, with an average of
2750 ppm EBV transcripts [24]. Interestingly, 24 EBV-positive
gastric adenocarcinoma showed on average only 88 ppm
viral mRNA, ranging from 4 to 300 ppm [22]. The signifi-
cantly higher values in the AIDS-associated lymphomas
may conceivably reflect the absence of humoral or
cell-mediated surveillance.
