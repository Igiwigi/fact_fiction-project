Attention should be drawn to the fact that we have replaced errors by differentials,
This is only legitimate so long as product terms in the errors are negligible as.com-

on the theory of errors.* It will not lead us astray, so long as we take care in any
practical applications to verify the smallness of Ar,, Ao,, Ao,, as compared with

Normal Frequency Distribution for Three Organs or more,

It will searcely have escaped the attentive reader that our investigation hitherto,

example, it has dealt only with the direct effect of random selection.
