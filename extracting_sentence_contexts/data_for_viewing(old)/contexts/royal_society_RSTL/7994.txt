the older types of wood sailing-ships there was generally a great excess of buoyancy in
the middle, and deficiencies of buoyancy at the ends only. In later sailing-ships, such
as that referred to by Dr. YouxG, there were portions of the amidship length (in wake
of water, ballast, and other concentrated weights) of which the weight exceeded the
buoyancy ; and this excess, as well as that due to the heavy extremities, was counter-
balanced by the surplus buoyancy of the portions of the ship intermediate between the
middle and the extremities. With the introduction of steam as a propelling agent, and
of very largely increased lengths and proportions for ships, a vastly different state of
things has been brought about in the distribution of weight and buoyancy. At the ends
of ships there still remains an excess of weight, exaggerated in many cases by the adop-
tion of very fine under-water lines in combination with heavy bows and sterns above
water; but the distribution of weights in the fuller parts of the ship becomes much
changed. How great the change has been we may infer from the fact that at present
merchant steam-ships are in actual employment of which the length is 400 feet, and the
proportion of length to breadth exceeds 10 to 1, both length and proportion having been
more than doubled since the introduction of iron into ship-construction and steam into
ship-propulsion. Ships of eyen greater length, both actually and proportionately, to
breadth are being constructed for trading between Europe and the East through the
