ordinate variables, the moon’s parallax is taken as one, whilst the longitude of the
node is retained as the other. Throughout the first part of the analytical development the moon’s true longitude,
measured in the orbit, is taken as one of the principal variables. Transition is then
made to the time of transit of a fictitious satellite whose right ascension is equal to
the moon’s true longitude, and the final transition is to the fransits of the real moon. This transposition of variables has necessitated a complete development of the tide-
generating forces from the beginning, and thus the analysis of the paper is almost
complete in itself, although reference is necessarily made to the harmonic method. Such a piece of work as the present can only be deemed complete when an example
has been worked out to test the accuracy of the tidal prediction, and when rules have
been drawn up for the arithmetical processes, forming a complete code of instructions
to the computer.
