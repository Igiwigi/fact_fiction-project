2 In carrying out an experiment for the determination of /, it is necessary in all
‘Zeases to syphon the liquid out of he solenoid immediately after m has been found,
“Band test the balance again to see whether it is restored by replacing m. When this
ondition is fulfilled, it is evident that the mutual induction of the system of coils
‘Bhas not been altered while the experiment has been going on.
3 It does not always happen that an exact balance can be got by the method of
Schanging the number of turns in the primary of ¢, for if a certain adjustment gives a
‘edeflection of two divisions positive, a reduction of one turn in the primary of ¢, gives
#a deflection of three divisions negative, so that in this case the correct reduction can
Ebe taken as two-fifths of 65, which is sufficiently accurate, since all that is necessary
Sin order to determine & in the 7th decimal place is to be able to detect an induction
of 20 C.G.8. units.
§ In all the following experiments the magnetising force was varied from 1 to 9
Eoas. units, and in no case was there any change in k.
