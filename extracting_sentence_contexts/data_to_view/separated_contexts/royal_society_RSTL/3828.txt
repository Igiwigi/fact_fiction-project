This
identification of parts of an intricate distribution of vessels in one animal, and their
comparison with those well ascertained in another, exemplifies the uniformity of plan of
creation, and the utility of comparative examinations of structure, even in the lowest
forms of animals. The course of the s$upra-spinal artery, formed by union of the
aortic arches around the cesophagus, is followed into the abdomen, to the extremity
of the body in the Myriapoda, and to that of the caudal region in the Scorpion : and
the distribution of its branches in these classes is traced outwards along the conrse
of the neryes from the ganglia. Branches from the systemic arteries are traced to
their ramifications on the coats of the hepatic vessels, in the first of these animals;
and others from those of the visceral systemic arteries to the alimentary canal and
liver in the latter; facts which I regard as new demonstrations of the existence of
circulatory vessels distributed to the internal organs in Articulata. A set of vessels which I formerly described as portal vessels are also further exa-
mined, and are traced to their terminations in extensive anastomoses and web-like
capillary distributions on the branchizee. The sfructure of the branchice, and the
manner in which the blood seems to permeate their delicate laminz, and is after-
wards collected in sinuses at their base, and again returned to vessels that convey it
back to the heart, are also investigated; and the vessels specially given for the nourish-
ment of the branchial structures are noticed.
