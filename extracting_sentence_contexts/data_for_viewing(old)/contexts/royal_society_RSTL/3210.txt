PROF. FARADAY'S CHEMICAL ACCOUNT OF A METEORIC STONE. 87

not collect more than 0-06 from 100 parts of the stone. Of this the largest portion
was in very fine particles, recognisable only by their magnetic properties, and the
evolution of hydrogen by dilute snlphuric acid; but there was one piece of sufficient
size to show the malleability, lustre, and other general properties of the metal. This
metallic iron contained nickel as well as the stone generally. A part of the iron in
the stone was also in the state of sulphuret, as was evident by the sulphuretted hy-
drogen evolved on the action of acids.

The result with regard to the su{phur was obtained in the form of sulphate of ba-
ryta; but though I haye entered it as sulphur only in the analysis, it did not all have
that state in the stone, for a part of it was there as sulphuric acid. In fact, water
only, when boiled with the stone, removed small portions both of snlphate of lime
and sulphate of soda; and this was the case when, on repeating the experiments, I
was very careful to take parts from the middle of the smaller fragment, parts which
had not seen the light until I broke them out. Tt is a question, however, whether
the soda belonged to the stone when it fell, and what proportion of sulphuric acid
was in it at that time; for the stone being porous and hygrometric, the water and
air in it may have converted a part of the sulphur into sulphuric acid ; and as to the
soda, I think it must have been acquired upon the earth ; for the water separated
also a portion of destructi√æble organic substance, and the larger fragment of the stone
still has small particles of insoluble vegetable matter adhering to it, having the ap-
pearance of being derived from manure.
