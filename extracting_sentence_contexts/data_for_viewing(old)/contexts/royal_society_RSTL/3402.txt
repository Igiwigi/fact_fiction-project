zincode, and potassa and hydrogen, all in equivalent proportions, clearly establishing
this salt as a $u{phovinion of potassium.

Permit me, now, before I close this letter, to make a few observations upon a sub-
ject which strikes me as closely connected with the compound electrolytes upon which
I have dwelt at such length ; I mean the origin of the currents in Bzcquersr's bat-
tery. I never could bring myself to believe that the mere combination of the acid
and alkali could give rise to snuch a current, and have always thought that you have
abundantly proved its impossibility. And yet there is now a mode of viewing such a
combination, which I think may explain the phenomena.

Experiment 44.â€”T have carefully repeated and varied the experiments, for the pur-
pose of possessing myself accurately of the facts. I chiefly made use of solutions of
nitric acid and potassa placed on either side of a diaphragm of bladder in a divided
glass cell, which could be firmly bound together with brass clamps. Platinum elec-
trodes were placed on either side of the diaphragm.

I satisfied myself not only of the usual phenomena with the galvanometer, but that
oxygen was evolved on the potassa side, and hydrogen on the nitric acid side. The
former I had no difficulty in collecting in an inverted closed tube; the latter was re-
cognised by its secondary action upon the nitric acid. Nitrate of potassa was of
course formed at the junction of the acid and alkali. Now let us recollect what ni-
trate of potassa is in its electrical relations : it is an oxinitrion of potassium (N + 6 0)
+P. Aqueo-nitric acid is also an ozinitrion of hydrogen (N + 6 O) + H; and
potassa is oxide of potassium (P + O). In their local action upon each other, the
