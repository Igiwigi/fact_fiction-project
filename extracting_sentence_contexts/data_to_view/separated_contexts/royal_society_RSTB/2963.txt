According to the viscosity calculation, however, 35 cub. centims. per hour or
seven and a-half times the actual amount should escape under the conditions given
from the tracheides of the alburnum when completely filled with water. Section 5.—Discussion of Foregoing Results and Test Experiments. Two facts stand out prominently in the foregoing calculations. Firstly, the fact
that the amount of flow calculated from the rate of flow is, except in the case of the
elder, always greater than the actual amount, and, secondly, the fact that the
amount of flow as calculated from PorseurLue’s formula is from 7-300 times the actual
flow, the difference becoming greater as the diameter of the conducting vessels
increases. The explanation of the first point is simple.
