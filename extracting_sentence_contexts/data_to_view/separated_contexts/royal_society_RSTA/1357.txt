Aprrnpix II. Standard Graphs for Plotting Stream-Lines.—Vhe fact that the solution of the problem
of flow past an obstacle (equation (3.22) ) is expressible in such general terms enables
us to construct tables or graphs for the plotting of the equipotentials and stream-lines
in all such cases, provided that the “‘ fundamental net ” has first been obtained. We
give, in figs. 7 and 8, graphs of
