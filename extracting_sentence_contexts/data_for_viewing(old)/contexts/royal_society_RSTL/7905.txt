are the ingredients of the stone. From the former class, we learn that a meteorite has
had a history ; that it has undergone change subsequently to its first consolidation in its
present form. The crystalline character of all the constituent minerals; the fissures at
one time formed, then filled and then, in many cases, broken across and © heayed” and
filled again, like some mineral lode ; the © chondritic ' structure that G. Ros has llus-
trated*; the fracture, in at least one meteorite, of the spherular © chondra,” which have
been split and severed and recemented into a compact mass,—these are among the
many facts imprinted on a meteorite which are 80 many records belonging to its history,
and which by the aid of the microscope we may read and interpret. But to found a
classification on the structural characters of meteorites is not the same thing as to arrange

S them according to their mineralogical composition. The two must be combined for a
Z philosophical arrangement.

= I propose dealing with the mineralogical side of the problem in the present memoir,
S and to recur hereafter to the structural composition of meteorites, when the nature of
E their ingredient minerals shall have been rendered clear.

2 The general features of the microscopic sections of certain meteorites were described
Sh by me in the years 1863-64; and the examination in this way has been extended to
