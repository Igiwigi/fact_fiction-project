Cubic Primals through F,‘.—Applying this formula, now, to the particular case of
cubic primals through F,*, we find that all such primals are transformed to quadrics
through c,, and conversely, Any one of these quadrics Q meets ¢c, in two free points
P, P’; and to these points will correspond two planes of V,* which must lie on the cubic
primal through F,* to which Q corresponds. Now any line through O corresponds to
a line of S meeting c, and « ; and using this fact we see that the cubic primal has a node
at O. It has three additional nodes in each of its two planes, and these correspond, as
we shall show, to the three E-lines through each of P, P’ which meet ¢, and lie on Q.
Consider, in fact, any one of these H-lines, /, say, and let the point of F corresponding to
it be L,. The cubic ®-curve corresponding to any line through L, breaks up into i,
and a conic fy which meets |, once, c, once, and ¢, twice and which therefore meets Q
in only one free point. It follows then in the usual way that L, is a node of the cubic
