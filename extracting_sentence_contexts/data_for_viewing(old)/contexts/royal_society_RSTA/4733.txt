The regularity theory of the free boundary, for both classical and thin obstacles, follows the
same line of reasoning. However, the optimal regularity of the solution u, for the thin obstacle is
substantially harder, and was unsolved until 2005, when a proof was given by Athanasopoulos &
Caffarelli [10]. The simple approach in the obstacle case above can also be mimicked here by
considering a smoothing of the obstacle g, :=(—1 /€)|xn|?. For the smooth case, the solution u‘
will converge to u in some reasonable space, and at least pointwise. Define the corresponding
function uj, as in (2.1), with = (h,...,hy,1,0). Then similar reasoning as in the previous case
along with the fact that gy. is independent of tangential direction t L en implies D2 uf, >—-C. The

5This simple argument has been unnoticed until now. As v © x7/2, for this case, we have to work with second derivatives of v,

so that D.V ~ a; — x3/2 > 0. As convergence for second derivatives does not hold close to free boundary, we need the device
of directional monotonicity lemma as remarked in the previous footnote, along with convexity of v at free boundary points.
