We then turned to numerical and experimental data to validate the existence of turbulent
branches of solutions. The numerical data indeed point to a finite limiting value of the dissipation
coefficient as the flux-based Rayleigh number—and thus the Reynolds number—increases. We
stress the fact that the validation of the fully turbulent assumption (1.2), when combined with
the ‘ultimate’ scaling-law for heat transport Nu ~ /RaPr, leads to Spiegel’s free-fall scaling-
law for the velocity field Re ~~ /Ra/Pr, where the Reynolds number Re is based on the height
of the domain and the root-mean-square velocity. In other words, using CISS we can validate
both Spiegel’s prediction of a diffusivity-free regime for the heat transport, Nu ~ /Ra Pr, and the
free-fall scaling assumption that underpins it [21]. The upper bounds derived in the present study provide a useful point of view to discuss
the proposed scaling theories for CISS.
