It is clear that Rosseinsky’s methodology has much to commend
it. The topic of Karen Wilson’s stimulating presentation [15] was ‘catalysts for the production of
energy from renewable sources’. Among the many interesting facts in her work was the use of
steam-explosion treatment of biomass, which gives rise to a useful new source (both from the
resulting hydrolysate and the condensate). This novel technique is used by scientists in the food-oriented industry. By judicious use of
solid acid catalysts, which have long been known [16] to serve as effective means of transforming
a wide variety of widely available reactants to useful products.
