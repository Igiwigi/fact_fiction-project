For instance, FoA (1901) found that immature ovaries when grafted into a previously
odphorectomized adult underwent a rapid development in the mature somatic
environment. Conversely, it had been shown that adult ovaries when transplanted
into young immature females lost their adult histological characters and had no
perceptible endocrine activity. The mechanism of compensatory hypertrophy of the
ovary was similarly explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary does
not add to the number of mature follicles in the animal, the three ovaries together

* According to ZUCKERMAN (1936, A), the actual menstrual discharge is associated with a fall in
the oestrin content, but there is a lag in the effect of 7 to 14 days represented by the period between

ovulation and the beginning of the discharge. This succession of phases, he claims, can be imitated
experimentally by injection of oestrin into o√©phorectomized monkeys. SEXUAL PERIODICITY 431

producing about the same number of follicles as is ordinarily produced by two (see
Lipscuitz, 1927).
