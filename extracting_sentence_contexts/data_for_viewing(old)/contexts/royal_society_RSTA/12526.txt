has resulted in our finding out that a quadrant electrometer, as made by Messrs.
Waite can, by a special adjustment being given to its quadrants, be made to fulfil the
law given in text books for the quadrant electrometer ; secondly, that this special
adjustment may be dispensed with if the construction of the instrument be altered ;
and thirdly, that when this alteration in the construction is carried out, it is possible
to obtain an instrument having a sensibility many times as great as that obtainable
| with the White form of construction.
As long as an electrometer is only employed to measure a steady P.D. between the
quadrants, it may not be of much interest to know the way in which the sensibility
& varies with the charge in the needle, unless great sensibility be required ; in which case
it is important to know for what charge on the needle maximum sensibility is obtained ;
© in fact, for the measurement of steady P.D’s. the main thing to be sure of, is
® that the deflection is proportional to the P.D. between the quadrants when the charge
® in the needle is constant. But when the electrometer is employed in conjunction
‘© with a non-inductive resistance to measure the power given by an alternate or
§ an intermittent current, which may be any function of the time, to a circuit that
=) may possess capacity, or an E.M.F., or self or mutual induction, or all four (in accord-
e) ance with the method devised by Professor FrrzgeraLp and ourselves during the
‘& meeting of the Electrical Congress in Paris in 1881, and published the same autumn
<S by M. Porrmr), it is absolutely necessary that the electrometer should exactly fulfil
