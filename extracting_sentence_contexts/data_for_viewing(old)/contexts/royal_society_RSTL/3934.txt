side of copper as that on which platinum appears, at ordinary and at high tempera-
tures, generally to lie. When these three platinum wires were tried with one another
thermo-electrically, they gave, as was to be expected, the mutual thermo-electric
indications of different metals lying in the order Bismuth, P,, P., P,, Iron, Antimony.
They retained all the same qualities after being heated to redness; and in a great
many experiments performed upon them, in which I have found them extremely con-
venient as thermo-electric standards, have exhibited perfect constancy in their
thermo-electric bearings.

I have not yet discovered on what their differences depend, but in all probability
it is on the degrees to which they are alloyed with other metals.

85. The fact of copper changing in the thermo-electric series from below the
position of the platinum specimen P, to above that of iron, when the temperature is

raised from —30* or —20? Cent. to 3009, proves that every metal which lies between
P, and iron for any intermediate temperature, must become neutral to either P, or
copper, or iron at some temperature between these limits. Now nearly all the
common metals, for instance, lead, tin, brass, zinc, silver, cadminm, gold, lie between
platinum and iron in the thermo-electric series at ordinary temperatures, and no
doubt many of the rarer metals (I have found aluminium to lie between P, and P,)
are to be ranked within the same limits. Hence at temperatures easily reached and
tested, neutral points may be looked for with the certainty of finding them, between
each of those metals and one or other, if not several, of the metals and metallic
