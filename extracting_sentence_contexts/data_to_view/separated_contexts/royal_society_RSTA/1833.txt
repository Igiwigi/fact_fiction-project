Group 3

Another topic which has attracted a good deal of attention and which concerns possible
improvements to the periodic table in a very direct way is the current debate over the composition
of group 3Â°. Whereas the majority of textbook and other periodic tables in the 18-column format
show the elements of this group as scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and actinium, a significant
number of more recent tables feature the last two elements as lutetium and lawrencium instead. If one considers this question within the context of a 32-column representation, there are in fact
four options. These options are shown in figures 10-13 inclusive. In the tables shown in figures 10
and 11, group 3 is shown as containing either Sc, Y, La and Ac or Sc, Y, Lu and Lr.
