Theorem 1.3 (Bruinier—Ono [9]). If n is a positive integer, then we have

p(n) = — i - Tr(n).

The numbers P(ag), as Q(x, y) varies over the finitely many classes in Qn, form a multiset of algebraic
numbers which is the union of Galois orbits for the discriminant —24n + 1 ring class field. Moreover, for
each Q € Qn we have that (24n — 1)P(aq) is an algebraic integer.

Remark 1.4. Larson & Rolen [10] established the precise integrality properties of the values
P(g).


The proofs of theorems 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 depend critically on the fact that the generating function
in (1.1), where q:= 27" | satisfies q-1/4P(q) =1/n(t). It is now well understood that the circle
method can be applied to modular forms whose poles are supported at cusps. Moreover, for
those modular forms that have non-positive weight, the method typically offers exact formulae
as in theorem 1.2. Here we describe recent developments in topology in which such modular
forms that can be written as infinite products that resemble (1.1) arise as generating functions of
topological invariants. Thus, by applying the circle method of Hardy and Ramanujan as perfected
by Rademacher, we obtain exact formulae that provide insight into the distribution of these
topolological invariants.

To discuss this connection between topology and Ramanujan’s legacy, we recall the
foundational importance of topological invariants. One of the broad goals of topology is to
determine whether two particular spaces have the same topological, differentiable or complex
