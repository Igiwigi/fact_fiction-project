This is greater than 1°8, the value chosen by Kopp, but falls between 2°89 and
2°42, the atomic heats of carbon, in the form of wood charcoal and natural graphite
respectively, deduced from the experiments of Recnautt between 0° and 100° C.

This deduction from data belonging wholly to the gaseous state is of interest
because it is in accordance with the theoretical view that specific heat in a gas is not
dependent on the temperature. :

On the other hand, as the above experiments prove, atomic heats in the solid state,
and probably also in the liquid state, are largely dependent on the temperature, the
variation being abnormally great in solid carbon. It has also been shown that at the
same temperature the atomic heats are widely different for different elements in the
solid state ; but notwithstanding this fact it has been proved that the molecular heat
of a solid compound is approximately the sum of the atomic heats of its constituents
at each temperature.

Tn conclusion, I desire again to express the obligations I am under to Mr. Sipney
Youne and to Mr. Lronarp Bairsrow for their assistance.
