The radial or ambulacral nerve-trunks terminate in the ocular
plates. The latter, however, show no histological evidence of supporting any structure
resembling an ocular apparatus; and FRepERICQ could obtain no physiological evidence
of sensibility either to solar or to artificial light, He does not state clearly what his
experiments in this connexion were, and 80 we infer thab they cannot have been the
8ame as ours. He regards the pigment spot as a * fiction.‚Äù The nerve-ring sends off, in addition to the ambulacral trunks, the nerve-cords to
the intestine. In the ring and trunks there is no differentiation into ganglia and
fibres, but the whole is in structure uniform and in function central.
