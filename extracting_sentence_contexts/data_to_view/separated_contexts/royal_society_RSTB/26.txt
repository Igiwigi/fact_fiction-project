It must be remembered that we are
equally unable to verify the identity of the similar tubes in the phloem of the
Selaginellee with the true sieve-tubes of Ferns and of the Phanerogams.*

Plate 21, fig. 10, represents a tangential section of the phloem of our plant. We
here see that the tubes, /, just described, display a tendency towards an undulating
arrangement, the spaces between the curves of which enclose horizontally disposed
lines of cells. I have already called attention to the fact that transverse sections
