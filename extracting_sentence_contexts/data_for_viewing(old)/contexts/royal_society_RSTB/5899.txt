hot wax. The lump of stone so treated was crushed in a vice with jaws protected
by sterilized tin shields ; small pieces were then picked out aseptically and ground in
a sterile glass mortar. One gram of the ground stone was shaken in 60 c.c. of sterile
water and 1 c.c. of the water after sedimentation was further diluted in 49 c.c. of sterile
water. 1c.c. of each dilution was then plated in standard bouillon agar. The colonies
were counted on the third and again on the seventh day.

Examination of the colonies on the plates of these experiments revealed an almost
total absence of moulds. This does not agree with the findings of BucHanan (1928) ;
it is accounted for by the sterilization of the outer surface of the stones. The lack of
penetration of the stone by fungi has been taken to indicate their inability to cause
decay of the stone, and consequently surface growths have been neglected throughout
the subsequent investigations. Another fact worthy of note was a strong preponderance
of non-sporing organisms. Considering the nature of the habitat, its varying conditions
of moisture, and the probable periods of food shortage which almost certainly occur.
the bacterial population might have been expected to consist mainly of sporing
types.

The reliance to be placed upon the method adopted for enumerating bacteria in
