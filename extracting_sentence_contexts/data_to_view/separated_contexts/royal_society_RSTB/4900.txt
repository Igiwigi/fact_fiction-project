During the night
of the 23rd to the 24th there was a considerable rise in blood volume. This initial
rise was accompanied by a considerable fall in the heemoglobinometric reading,
suggesting that the increased blood volume was caused mainly by dilution. This
suggestion is borne out by the fact that there was no appreciable change in the total
oxygen capacity. Between the morning and evening determinations on the 24th a
considerable amount of exercise was taken in the warm chamber on the bicycle
ergometer. There was a marked rise in the hemoglobinometer reading; this rise
was reflected in the measurement of total oxygen capacity.
