polymers [16-19] and CNTs [20,21]. The standard doping method, namely molecular doping,
has a number of challenges, including controlling the ratio between partial and integer charge
transfer, phase separation of the semiconductor and the dopant (e.g. figure 4b), vitrification
of the polymer which results in loss of the mechanical properties and difficulty to dope thick
films, and temperature-assisted de-doping. A number of interesting approaches have been
proposed to address these issues. For instance, performing the doping step after the film has
been formed ensures good polymer microstructure and thus undisturbed charge carrier mobility
[18]. Substituting the standard alkyl chains by polar sidechains has also been proved to be an
efficient way of increasing compatibility with the dopants and enhancing doping efficiency while
retaining good mechanical properties [17,2224]. Multicomponent systems containing flexible
polymer matrices could also help to retain flexibility [25,26]. To address the technological issue
of doping thick films, a number of methods have been proposed, such as multilayer formation
(which takes advantage of the fact that doped films are insoluble [27,28]), or introducing porosity
[29]. Carbon nanotube matts and composites are naturally very porous and thus dopants can
easily go through the films (figure 4c and reference [30]). The challenge there is to be able to
produce the thick film itself, as CNTs do not readily dissolve in common solvents.
