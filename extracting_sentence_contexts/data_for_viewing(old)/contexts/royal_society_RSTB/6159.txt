The conclusion to which we have been driven, viz., that in the Holocephali the
skeleton of the hyoid arch is primitive, non-suspensorial, and necessitates far-reaching
revision of our conceptions of the phylogeny of fishes.

In the first place, it is necessary to establish the close nature of the affinity between
the Holocephali and the Selachii. A striking similarity between these two groups is
provided by the histological picture presented by sections. The staining reactions
of the tissues, the size of the cells, the nature of the cartilage, the passage of the
efferent pseudobranchial artery dorsal to the trabeculae, the structure of the
membraneous labyrinth, the open ductus endolymphaticus, and numerous other
features, impress the observer with the closeness of the affinity between these two
groups. In fact, one is quite surprised by the magnitude of the differences of detail
which separate them, by means of variations on a common fundamental plan. Not
the least interesting feature of these differences is the extraordinary medley of
primitive and specialized characters which they involve.

Chief among the primitive features of the Holocephali is the presence of a
pharyngohyal element in the hyoid arch, which seems to point to the conclusion
that their ancestors never were amphistylic or hyostylic (see above, p. 294).

A primitive feature shown by the Holocephali is the complete cartilaginous floor
to the auditory capsule ; the glossopharyngeal nerve does not traverse the cavity
of the capsule, and there is no lamina hypotica such as exists in Selachians (pE BEER,
1931). The otic and basal connexions of the pterygo-quadrate must have been
