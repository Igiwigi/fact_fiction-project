Cafar, indeed, informs us; that'no ſort-of fir was
to be ſeen in this country at the-time'of | his in-
vaſion. It is well known that he” made no very far ad-
vanced marches ; and his obſervations are; perhaps,
more to be depended-upon with regard to military
operations, than what might rather engage- the atten-
tion of a botaniſt. There are, however, ſo many well-atteſted facts,
both by Camden and others*, of firs being found vat
a very conſiderable depth under the: ſurface of: the
ground, that one cannot with-hold- one's affent to
them, extraordinary as it 'may appear at preſent,
when throughout England we have-no ſuch trees,
which afford the leaſt grounds: to contend that they
are of indigenous growth. If theſe indiſputable faQts could want the addition
of my poor teſtimony, I happened to ſee near Loch
Rannoch, and in other parts of the Highlands of Scot-
land, ſubterraneous firs, which /had// been lately dug
out,

I procured a labourer to chip off ſome parts of
theſe trees, which ſmelt moſt ſtrongly refinous; there
could be no doubt therefore, from this circumſtance,
but that they were firs, as well as/from the grain-of

ſuch ſubterraneous firs are ſaid to be found in great quantities in
the iſland of Axholm in Lincolnſhire,

pieces of them tor candles.

© There were, however, no fir woods near any of

thoſe places, in the Highlands, where I happened to

dee theſe ſubterrancous trees; and, indeed, the indi-
enous ones are by no means ſo common as is ge-

nerally apprehended,

Though what I have laſt mentioned may, perhaps,
make" many imagine, that the. timber found under
ground muft have been ſome other tree, which {till
continues to grow in the neighbourhood ; yet I think
there maybe two cauſes afſigned, why theſe bog-firs
may be found 'in places where there is no ſuch tree
at preſent.
