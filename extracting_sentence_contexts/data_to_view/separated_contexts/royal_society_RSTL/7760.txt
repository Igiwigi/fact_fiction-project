The appearance before the eyes
is described as zigzag, wavy, quivering, without colour. The first attack, in adult age,
was followed by partial paralysis of one side; and later attacks have almost always had
a sequel of defective speech, and tingling at the tip of the tongue, at the tip of the nose,

characteristics :â€”

1. Dependence on mental anxiety, bodily exhaustion, overwork to the eyes, gastric
derangement, want of exercise. 2. Origin from a small spot near the centre of vision.
