Figure 6 gives the results for the 11 in. ingot. It shows the observed outer temperature of
the mould, the results of integrating the heat flow equations using this time variation of
surface temperature and the observed central temperature. Figure 7 gives similar results
for the 9 in. ingot.

It must be remembered that the observed central temperature is not used in these ae
of the heat flow equations, except for the single value required to provide the initia condi-
tions for the solution, so that the comparison of observed and calculated temperatures isa
real comparison of independently determined quantities. The agreements are gree ve
markably good; in fact, considering the approximations made (constant diffusivity â€˜ jot
ingot and mould, for example), one might be inclined to say that it is almost too goo 7

The results certainly show that it is feasible to evaluate the internal temperature distribu-
tion in an ingot cooling in a mould from knowledge of the temperature on the outside surface
of the mould only. If the accuracy of the available thermal data, for the steel at high tem-
peratures and for the cast iron of the mould, justified the increase in elaboration of the
machine set-up, it would be possible to include the variation of thermal properties both of
the steel and of the cast iron with temperature in this work.

The excellence of the general agreement between the calculated and observed central
temperatures suggests that differences, where they occur, may be significant. The main
difference occurs near the beginning of the calculated solution, which drops sharply away
