We know of no specific sanctions against con-
tinued reproduction at advanced ages among the Mosuo, so
the specific mechanisms of social transmission remain obscure. Nonetheless, the regional scale at which we see village-level
differences in ALB suggests that cultural norms associated
with matri- or patrilineal institutions may play a role in repro-
ductive timing. While the patrilineal area is in more rugged
terrain, the fact that ALB has dropped so dramatically as con-
ditions improved in the later twentieth century suggests that
people are ceasing to reproduce earlier than physiological con-
straints influenced by a difficult working environment would
mandate. It is thus unlikely that genetic differences or simple
ecological differences with physiological knock-on effects can
account for the variation in reproductive timing documented
here. The pattern of declining ALB alongside fertility restriction
is consistent with behavioural ecological models that envi-
sage benefits to earlier reproduction [5].
