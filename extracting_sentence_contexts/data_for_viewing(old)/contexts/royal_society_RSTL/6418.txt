+wo groups, viz. Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 6 from the smaller charges of powder, and Nos. 4 and
5 from the greater ones.
— The mean from the four first is 1088-5597 feet per second, and that from the two
Jast is 1352-1015 feet per second; and taking a mean of means from both of these, we
obtain a final result of 1220-3306 feet per second as the mean transit-velocity of propa-
gation, in the rocks experimented on, of a waye-pulse produced by the impulse of a
charge not exceeding 12,000 Ibs. of powder. We may be justified in concluding that,
the velocity of wavye-propagation (or transit) really does increase with the force of the
original impulse; it would be vain, however, to attempt to deduce the law of swch
Ancrease from the results before us.
Q The experiments of Mr. GoLDISGHAM at Madras, on the retardation of sound in moist
Air, and the theoretical researches of Mr. Earxsnaw, both, by analogy, rendered & priori
Sprobable the fact itself, now for the first time, s0 far as I am aware, experimentally
Shown.
® It follows, then, on reference to my former experiments at Killiney Bay, that the rate
Sf wavye-propagation in highly stratified, contorted and foliated rock is intermediate
:Setween that for dense wet sand and for discontinuous and shattered granite. Adopt-
Sng the firs} mean from the 8maller charges of powder, as better comparable with the
illiney experiments, which were made with charges of only 25 lbs. of powder, and
Svyhich would doubtless have given higher velocities with heavier charges, we obtain the
