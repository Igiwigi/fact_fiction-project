I may state, that in the eggs under observation, as well as in others examined both
before and since, I found, with but very rare exceptions, that both spherical bodies pass
together to the same side of the yelk in a line with the entrance of the canal, and
one at a little distance behind the other ; and that aſter the completion of the cleavage
of the yelk at right angles to the line of sight, the bodies make their appearance
again at the spot where they disappeared, and never at any other part of the yelk.

At the end of the fourth hour the first cleft was finished, and the yelk mass con-
tracting at right angles to the cleſt, and extending in its direction, the two bodies
were again brought into view almost at the very spot at which they disappeared.
The same was observed in each egg. This transit, which may be regarded as an
indisputable fact, will set aside the opinion that the bodies enter the yelk, and become
the foundation of the nuclei of the different parts into which the yelk $plits.

It may here be mentioned, with reference to these bodies, that they occasionally
are more or less completely detached for a time from the yelk mass during the forma-
tion of the chamber. In some instances too, they appeared to be absent, as they
were not in the usnal place, but I found them afterwards adhering temporarily to the
inner surface of the vitelline membrane at the point with which they were in approxi-
mation at the time of fecundation ; in this position they remained till after the first
segmentation of the yelk was completed, and then being detached, apparently by the
movement of the yelk within its envelope, occupied their usual place in the first
furrow. Eggs, with the exceptional condition above described, have always produced
embryos; $0 that whilst we doubt whether the spherical bodies are necessarily con-
