T have observed a third modification of a structure fitted for gorging food,
in asmall Patella from the West Indies (P. manmillaris, Linn.). There is simply
a very muscular mouth and pharynx; and an elastic mass very closely resem-
bling that in Turbo littoreus ; but neither cartilage, tongue, nor hard parts of
any description.

In all the display of instinct there is perhaps nothing more extraordinary
than that an animal, whose senses appear to be of the most imperfect descrip-
tion, should laboriously and patiently drill through a shell to obtain its food ;
and in the whole range of human and comparative anatomy, I am acquainted
with no structure more complicated than the instrument by which this pene-
tration is effected. The fact itself is noticed by Praxy ; and although it has
been questioned by some modern naturalists, while I am not eware that any
have confirmed it by their own observation, it may yet be witnessed on the
Shores almost at any time. One of our most common littoral mollusca, Buc-
cinum lapillus, feeds in this manner ; and whenever it is seen attached to an-
other shell-fish, with the foot slightly projected and expanded, a more or less
advanced perforation will be found. On the shores at Swansea, its common
prey is the muscle; and it sometimes, though rarely, attacks the oyster and
anomia. Around Falmouth, it feeds chiefly on the limpet, but will occasion-
ally be seen upon Turbo, Trochus, Nerita, and even its own species*.

The perforation is effected by a succession of strokes, following each other
at intervals shorter than a second. T have distinctly heard them by applying
