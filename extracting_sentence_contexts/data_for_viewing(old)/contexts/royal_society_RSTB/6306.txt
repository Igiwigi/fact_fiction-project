STUDIES IN TUNICATE DEVELOPMENT 69

and it seems to be merely a septum of mesenchyme induced by vascular exigencies.
Other totipotent cells form the lining of the atrial cavity, as is shown by budding
in the Styelidae.

Thus from the point of view of function, the epicardium seems to be most primitive
again in Ciona. There it allows water drawn into the branchial chamber to circulate
slowly around the heart, intestine and gonads, and yet in the rare occurrence of the
loss of anterior tissues in this genus, the new formative cells arise from the epicardial
lining. There is therefore some suggestion of excretory function of the epicardium
in Ciona and definite evidence of an unspecialized condition of the cells forming it.
In many ways, in fact, the ascidian epicardium as it appears in Ciona resembles the
coelom of the higher chordates. This question will be considered more fully
elsewhere.

XIâ€”SuMMARY

An account is given of the adult morphology of the heart and epicardium in the
following genera: Ciona, Diazona, Rhopalea, Tylobranchion, Euherdmania, Sidnyum,
Eudistoma, Archidistoma, Distaplia, Colella, Diplosoma, Pycnoclavella, Clavelina, Perophora,
Ecteinascidia, Ascidia, and Molgula.

The development of the heart and epicardium is described for Ciona, Diazona,
Ascidia, Polycarpa, and Molgula (i.e., genera all with small eggs).
