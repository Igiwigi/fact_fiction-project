The profile of a fermion is determined by its five-dimensional bulk mass. Because of the AdS5
geometry, modifications of order 1 in the five-dimensional bulk mass have a substantial impact
on the fermionic profile and therefore on the effective four-dimensional Yukawa coupling. In fact,
the four-dimensional Yukawa couplings depend exponentially on the bulk mass parameter. RS
models are holographic duals of four-dimensional strongly coupled theories. In this picture, the
Higgs is part of the composite sector.
