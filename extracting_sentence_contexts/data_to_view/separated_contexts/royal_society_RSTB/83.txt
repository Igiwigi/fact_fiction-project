I shall not attempt to compare all the
membranes that have been described, because it is both certain that many are either
transitory arrangements of the peripheral protoplasm of the egg or the product of
hardening reagents, and also probable that some are optical illusions.

_ That a pro-albumen such as I have described in Monotremata has not been recog-
nised in most Vertebrata is due possibly to the shortness of the period of its formation. Cunnincuam (67), however, has recently shown that such a structure exists in
Myzxine, but he assumed that it gave rise directly to the shell, and consequently could

not be homologous with the albumen or the shell of Elasmobranchii. It seems more
probable that the difference between the shell of Elasmobranchii and that of My«ine
is due to the fact that in Elasmobranchii the pro-albumen absorbs fluid in the course
of its passage down the oviduct. The shell membrane presents another difficulty. I have shown that in Marsupialia
it does not increase at the expense of the albumen.
