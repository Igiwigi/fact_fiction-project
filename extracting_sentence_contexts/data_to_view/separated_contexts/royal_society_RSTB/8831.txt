Such genomic regions
are called CpG islands and have been suggested to be proximal
to important regulatory regions [22]. While histone modifications and their modifying enzymes
are well conserved from yeasts to humans, DNA methylation
exhibits surprising diversity in regulatory mechanisms and
genome-wide profiles over various organisms. In fact, the
distributions, regulatory mechanisms and potential functions
of DNA methylation are extremely diverse in eukaryotic
genomes. Many model organisms, such as Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans, lack DNA methylation
[23]. Drosophila melanogaster has only trace amounts of non-
CpG methylation during embryonic stages, and lose most


methylation by adulthood [24].
