This theory rests upon con-
siderable evidence, whieh is clearly emphasised by many writers, and especially by
Retcuert, Kinestey, and Gaupp. The proofs put forward in support of this
hypothesis are based upon the examination of the morphological relation of the
embryonic stages of Mammals compared with the conditions observed in Reptiles. The continuity of the malleus with the Meckelian cartilage is one of the most
important facts in the chain of reasoning. The malleus is merely the specialised
articular surface of the Meckelian cartilage, just as the articulare is the articulating
surface in the lower jaw of an embryonic reptile, as figured by Gaurp in an embryo
Lacerta agilis (21, fig. 7). The Perameles material examined bears this out to the
full.
