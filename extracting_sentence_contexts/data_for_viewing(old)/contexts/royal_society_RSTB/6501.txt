view that these fossils are portions of large marine Algae it is very difficult to
understand the combination of characters. This is not only unknown in any
recognized order of the Algae, but is not readily intelligible in relation to aquatic
life. On the other hand, it is these features of Nematothallus that are individually

and collectively intelligible in relation to the sub-aerial life of a land-plant. That
this was the habitat of the plant seems to be much the more probable inference to
be made from the facts as known at present. On this view the abundance of
Nematothallus would constitute another considerable component of the Downtonian
plant-remains indicating derivation from a continental vegetation.

The isolated firm-walled cuticularized spores, sometimes united in spore-masses
of various types, form the last constituent of the flora to be considered. Their
abundance and variety is most readily intelligible on the view that the debris, the
decay of which has set free the spores, was derived from a land-flora.

The result of the above survey of the types of plants in the Downtonian flora
has been to show that the continental origin of all of them is possible, and for
most of them is highly probable. Such an origin is certainly consistent with the
structural characters of all the better-known types, and for some it appears certain.
