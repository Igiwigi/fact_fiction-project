dissolved by the hydrocarbons of rubber. The rubber being wetted through by the
liquefied gas, the latter comes to evaporate into the vacuum, and reappears as gas on
He other side of the membrane. Now it is known that snch evaporation is the same
Mto a vacuum and into another gas, being equally gas-diffusion in both circumstances.
E is not indispensable, therefore, to have a vacuum on one side of the rubber membrane
Eg in the experiments detailed above. A foreign gas will answer for the vacuum, as in
the experiments of Dr. MITCHELL.
= BD The numbers for the'velocity of passage of the different gases in the last Table may
* taken also as representing not remotely the relative absorption and liquefaction of
So various gases by the substance of rubber.
Z The passage of gases through rubber is also illustrated by the rapid collapse of the
tle balloon when filled with carbonic acid gas, or even with hydrogen, or with marsh-gas,
compared with atmospheric air. 'The conyerse fact is observed when the inflating
Ss is pure nitrogen : then the balloon is found to become further distended after a few

Urs, in consequence of more oxygen entering from the atmosphere without, than of

Wtrogen escaping from the balloon during the same time ; while the composition is being
Squalized on both sides of the membrane, and the gas within the balloon is finally of the
me compoxsition as the external air, A rubber balloon filled with nitrogen was found.

Shen roughly gauged, to increase in diameter from 132 to 136 millims. in the course of

Byenty-four hours. On the other hand, a balloon filled with pure oxygen fell in the
