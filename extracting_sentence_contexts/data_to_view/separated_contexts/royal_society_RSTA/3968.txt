We cannot assert that the smaller the probable error the more nearly will
the correlation, as given by the present process, agree with its value as found by
the product moment. If we did we should discard 5213, a very accordant result,
in favour of 5529, or even ‘5939. The fact is that the higher the correlation the
lower, ceteris paribus, the probable error, and this fact may obscure the really best
result. Judging by the smallness of and k and of the probable error, we should
be inclined to select C or the value 5529. This only differs from ‘5198 by slightly
more than the probable error of the difference (‘033 as compared with 029); but
since both are found from the same statistics, and not from different samplings ot
the same population, this forms sufficient evidence in itself of want of normality.
