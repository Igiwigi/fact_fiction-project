It gives no real impression whatever
of the manner in which the bulk of the variation is distributed, yet, for most
climatological purposes, this is precisely what we require. Judged by such a test as
this (namely, the range from maximum to minimum height observed) Hillington has
a more variable climate than Scarborough, and Southampton than Babbacombe, but,
as a matter of fact, Hillington is considerably less variable than Scarborough, and Â°
Southampton is slightly less variable than Babbacombe. Another striking illustration of the defects of this method of measuring the
variability has been mentioned to us by Mr. R. H. Scorv, namely, that in 23 years
of barometric observations at Valencia, the maximum was only reached in the last
year. Whatever be the form of the frequency distribution, the problem of determining
how the bulk of the variability is distributed about either mean or mode, is exactly
similar in character to the problem of determining how the inertia of a plate is dis-
tributed about any axis in its plane.
