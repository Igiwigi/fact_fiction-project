The optimized designs
are in accordance with the results in [18], obtained using the incremental harmonic balance
method, where we found the nonlinear strain energy due to mid-plane stretching reaches its
local maximum around x= }L and x= 3L, which is precisely where the optimized structures
are altered most significantly relative to their general thickness. Furthermore, the eigenfrequency
of the first flexural mode decreases during optimization of maximizing the cubic nonlinearity,
and increases during optimization of minimizing the cubic nonlinearity. This follows from the
fact that the structure is made generally thinner when maximizing the nonlinearity, so that the
critical sections can be made relatively thick, and the opposite trend occurs when minimizing the
