ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) using both olfactory and
visual cues to identify conspecifics [135]; domesticated goats
(Capra hircus) using auditory and visual cues [136] and female
Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea) using olfactory, auditory
and visual cues to identify their pups [137]. Therefore, future
work on IVR should also consider other forms of communi-
cation that individuals may be using.

(e) Testing for individual vocal recognition-multiple
Few studies have convincingly shown evidence of IVR-mul-
tiple despite its likely importance for species with complex
social interactions. To better test whether individuals do, in
fact, recognize multiple individuals, including over large
time scales, more robust approaches need to be taken. Below
we outline two such approaches.

(i) Behavioural psychology

The behavioural psychology paradigm is the most robust para-
digm in many circumstances for testing for IVR-multiple and
includes go no-go and discrimination tasks as well as habitu-
ation/dishabituation responses. Owing to the difficulty in
parsing apart behavioural responses of a focal individual to
differences in similar social partners (i.e. multiple individuals
treated very similarly by the focal individual across many con-
