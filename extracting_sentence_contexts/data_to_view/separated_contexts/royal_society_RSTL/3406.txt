The exact nature of the reaction to which this effect
is due, will be examined in detail hereafter. This azolitmine, which is the only constituent of litmus containing azote, appears
by the analytical results just given to be connected in a most simple and remarkable
manner with the principles of archil, alphaorceine and betaorceine. In fact, the pro-
portion of carbon, of hydrogen, and of azote being the same in these bodies, they
differ only in the quantity of oxygen they contain, their formula: being

Alphaorceine . . . C,, Hy, NO,. Betaorceine. . . .
