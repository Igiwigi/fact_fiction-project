trunk pass transversely towards the central part of the bundle of fibres. The arrange-
ment and structure of the ganglion-cells of the heart differ in no essential particulars
from those I have described in other ganglia. I have sncceeded in demonstrating in
several instances the straight fibre passing in one direction in the trunk of the nerve,
and the continuation of the spiral fibre pursuing an opposite course. In s8ome of these
ganglion-cells the spiral is reduced to two or three coils (fig. 42), as is observed elge-
where, but I cannot but conclude that every cell has at least two fibres.

Nor can I agree with Professor KOLLIKER in the statement that the ganglion-cells
have no connexion with the © transcurrent ” fibres of the vagus. Although I have not
been able to demonstrate how many fibres of the vagus are connected with the ganglion-
cells, nevertheless, looking generally at the course of the fibres, and at the number of
the cells, and considering the facts observed in other ganglia, I regard it as very probable
that many of them are connected with the cells.

9. Of the ganglion-cells and nerve:fibres of the arteries.

In the nerve-trunks running near the branches of the arteries of the palate of the
frog are numerous ganglion-cells. These ganglion-cells are often situated at the angle
of division of the nerve-trunks. Some of the fibres from the small ganglia lying near
arteries may be traced to the coats of the arteries, and some fine nerve-fibres resulting
from their subdivision may even be followed amongst the muscular fibre-cells of arteries
not more than the 455th of an inch in diameter.

Ganglia and ganglion-cells are found in considerable number in connexion with the
