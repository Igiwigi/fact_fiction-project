tissue corpuscles', These fibres may be readily followed (especially on the palate,
cornea, and bladder) to undoubted nervye-fibres, and it would not be possible to distin-
guish one of these fibres from the fibre which is the direct continuation of the dark-
bordered nerve-fibre in muscle. I am therefore forced to conclude either that nerves
terminate in * connective-tissue fibres,” or that this form of connective tisswe itself
results from changes occurring in nerve-fibres and the nuclei or cells which take part
in their formation, As this form of connective tissue always exists where nerye-fibres
are distributed—as it increases in quantity, but at the same time becomes more con-
densed as the tissue advances in age—as the meshes formed are smaller and less regular
as we recede from the surface where nerves ramify—as the s0-called fibres of yellow
elastic tissue in connexion with the nerves become altered like the nerves themselves by
the slow action of acetic acid, while other fibres more distant do not undergo this
change, and as these facts have been observed, not in one organ or tissue, but in yery
many (palate, tongue, cornea, mesentery and other parts of the abdominal connective
tissue, muscle, skin, pale muscular fibre), as well as in different animals, T venture to
conc]ude that this s0-called connective tissue lying immediately beneath sensitive surfaces,
and around the elementary fibres of voluntary muscle, and in other situations where
nerves are abundantly distributed, is not a tissue specially formed as a medium for con-

+ Kiuxz has recently stated that the nerye-fibres are connected with the connective-tisxue corpuscles of
the cornea; but T haye some specimens which demonstrate that this view is erroneous. The nerye-tissue
is always distinct from other tissues, and possesses its own masses of germinal matter or nuclei of formation,
