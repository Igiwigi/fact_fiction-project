Ix selecting the above title, I endeavoured to give as clear an enunciation of the
phenomena to be described in the paper as was consistent with the brevity asual in
a title,

An exception has, however, been taken to it, that as the effects of decomposition
are produced by ignited platinum, the phenomena may result from that obscure
mode of action called catalysis. That I did not intend to exclude from consideration
any possible action of the substance employed, will be evident from the paper itself,
in which I have called attention to the general production of catalytic effects by
solid bodies. Whatever value or novelty there may be in the facts I have communicated, is the
same whether they be regarded as resulting from catalytic or from thermic actions. If the action be catalytic, it is one absolutely the reverse of that usually produced by
platinum, and therefore just as much at variance with received experience as decom-
position of water by heat would be; the effect of platinum, like that of heat, on the
elements of water having been hitherto known only as combining them. With regard
to any theoretic views I may have advanced, I by no means attach the same import-
ance to them as I do to the facts themselves, though I consider it necessary for the
collation of facts, and desirable for the progress of science, that an author pretending
to communicate new results should give with them the impressions which led to their
discovery, and the inferences which he regards as immediately deducible from them.
