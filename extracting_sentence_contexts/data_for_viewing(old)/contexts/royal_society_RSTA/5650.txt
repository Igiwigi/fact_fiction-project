These inequalities express the possible rate of approach of the streamwise velocity u and the
velocity product uv to their value 0 at the boundary, so that m,n may be interpreted as Hélder-type
exponents of the boundary continuity. Since (A)i¢,7 S IIAIIL1((2i42\@1)x0,D), We Could substitute
the latter L!-norm in the above hypotheses, but we expect that bounds with the averaging
operation are sharper. As a matter of fact, the relations (4.6)and (4.7) are expected to hold at least
for large T as near equalities with m ~ n ~ 1/7, which we shall verify with numerical channel-flow
data below. The power-law profile for the mean velocity (u(y)) ~ Uy/ H)'/7 has been known since
the study of Nikuradse [31] to hold for pipe flow over nearly the entire radius, in the Reynolds
range 10° < Re < 10° (with a possible slow decrease of m with Re) and, in fact, we require the
bounds (4.6) and (4.7) only for averages in the slab $2y,4;\S2y_; and not over the entire height of
the channel.

Using (4.3), (4.4), (4.6), (4.7), itis relatively straightforward to obtain an estimate on the friction
factor averaged over times 0 < t < T, of the form
