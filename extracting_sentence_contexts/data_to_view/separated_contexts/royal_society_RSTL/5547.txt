In the mean time it is clear that concentration and diffusion are both active vital func
tions, and that both imply peculiar relations of the centre of each cell to the pigmentÂ»
molecules, as distinguished from the fluid in which they are suspended. i

'These conclusions invest the pigmentary changes with deep physiological interest,
In the movements of the granules towards and from the centres of their containing
cells, we now have ocular demonstration that a particular kind of material may haye
impressed upon it by vital action, independently of muscular contraction or ciliary
motion, tendencies to rush energetically to or from certain fixed points in the tissues,
through distances equal to nearly twice the thickness of a villus of the human intestine,
and several times greater than the average breadth of a human capillary interspace. Whether we be able to explain the means by which snch results are accomplished or
not. it is obvious that forces of similar powers and range of operation, if snitably
modified according to the cireumstances of each case, would be more than adequate to
cause the passage of particles of fat from the cavity of the intestine into the central
lacteals of the villi, or the transit of. the material required for a particular secretion Or
act of nutrition out of a capillary into a neighbouring gland cell or other portion of
tissue; and, again, for the discharge of an elaborated product of secretion into a duct, be.
the return of waste matter into the blood-vessels or lymphatics. We thus obtain a bas
of fact for what has hitherto been merely conjectural, in the explanation of the procesS6
of absorption, secretion and nutrition generally. The functions of the pigment-cells are under the control of the neryous 8ystem Y%
as is evident from the effects produced on the colour of the skin by a struggle on the
part of the animal. . Much attention has been devoted by you Wrrricn to the inquiry, by what ganglion'e
centres this control is exercised.
