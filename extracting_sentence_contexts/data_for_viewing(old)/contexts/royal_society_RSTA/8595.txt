by the powerful condensed discharge.* The evidence for a separation of the gases is
therefore not clear in such cases. The Angstrém bands behaved like the Hydrogen
lines, but in this case the spectrum is due to a compound which is certainly broken up
by the condensed discharge, and which would therefore require some time to reform
or accumulate in the capillary when the condenser is cut out.

With this exception all lines due to the heavier elements appear in the centre of the
capillary when the condenser is cut out. If a partial separation of the gases takes place
it is clear that, whatever the mechanism by which this oceurs may be, the degree of
separation is not proportional to the total energy flowing through the tube in a given
time but must increase rapidly with the current density ; for the total energy of the
condensed discharge was no greater than that of the uncondensed discharge, and was
in fact somewhat smaller. It is, however, to be expected that some separation should
be effected by the uncondensed discharge, and in addition to the effect recorded above
in the case of the mercury line, we have often noticed that when heavy, uncondensed
discharges are passed through Hydrogen tubes containing a little water vapour, the
series lines of oxygen appear exclusively in the central portions of the capillary.t

These observations seem to provide an explanation of the greater part of the pheno-
mena described by Woop (loc. cit.), who found that in long Hydrogen tubes which were
not absolutely free from impurities, the Balmer series appeared strongly in the central
portions of the capillary whilst the secondary spectrum was more strongly developed at

* It has been noticed that when very powerful condensed discharges are employed, “ arc ” lines of the
constituents of the glass walls of the tube appear with great brilliance for a short space of time after the
