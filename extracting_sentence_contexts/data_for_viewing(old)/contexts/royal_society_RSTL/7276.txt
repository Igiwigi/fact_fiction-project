cotton in solutions of that substance, of definite strength, expressing the excess of liquid

1t will be seen from the foregoing observations on the Austrian system of manufacture,
which are almost exclusively based upon the results of experience in the manufacture of
considerable quantities of the material during the last three years, that General Von
Lexk has not actually initiated any new principle as applied to the production of gun-
cotton, but that he has, by long experience and persevering investigation of the subject,
80 perfected the process of converting cotton-wool into the most explosive form of gun-
cotton and of purifying the product, as to render a sImple attention to clear and defi-
nite regulations alone necessary to ensure the manufacture of a very uniform material,
which is unquestionably much more perfect in its nature than the products obtained in
the earlier days of the history of gun-cotton. Such being the case, too much stress
cannot be laid upon the fact that deviations from the prescribed process, which at first
sight may appear very trivial (snch as a slight reduction of the strength of the acids,
the neglect of proper cooling arrangements, &c.), are certain to lead to variations in the
products of manufacture affecting their explosive characters, or their permanence, or
both. In diseussing the composition of gun-cotton manufactured by Lexxk's system, T
shall have to refer to several samples of the material, produced at HHirtenberg and
at Stowmarket, which differed widely in their composition and properties from the
normal product of manufacture. I have obtained abundant and most conclusive proof
that these exceptional variations are solely ascribable to the neglect of a uniformly
strict adherence to the prescribed process of converting the cotton; and I am strongly
of opinion that their occurrence has almost always been due to the employment of
nitric acid which exhibited a fictitious specific gravity, from the presence either of
considerable quantities of peroxide of nitrogen, or of 80me other impurity (sï¬†uch as
