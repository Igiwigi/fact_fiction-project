The variation
is not always diphasic; immediately after excision it is more frequently monophasic
and thereafter becomes diphasic. The movement of galvanometer and electrometer
indicates for the monophasic variation negativity predominant either at apex or at
base ; for the diphasic variation (when it is present) negativity of apex, followed by
negativity of base, or the reverse. There is no constant rule, in fact, and we saw no
use in further multiplying observations, seeing that we had to do with the irregulari-

ties due to an excessive susceptibility to local injury ; of such susceptibility we had
abundant evidence ; the delirium, which is so apt to supervene, is its extreme instance. We see no escape from the conclusion that the Mammalian ventricle is an organ
not only controlled by nerves, but also co-ordinated as to the action of its several parts
through intra-muscular nervous channels. A monophasic variation can consist only
with simultaneity of action throughout the organ, or with the successive action of its
several parts so rapid as not to be revealed by either galvanometer or electrometer, or
with action confined to one part of it, or with action predominant at one part; it is
not consistent with the comparatively slow successive action of various parts of the
