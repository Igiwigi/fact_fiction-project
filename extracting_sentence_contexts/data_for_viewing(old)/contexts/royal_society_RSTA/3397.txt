By taking derivatives with respect to u, we can calculate the double occupancy d as a function of
x, and combining this with (3.13) we can study how d changes with e for the different families n.
The results are shown in figure 1.

(c) Double occupancy for thermal versus atypical states

It is interesting to compare the behaviour of the double occupancy in thermal states and the
particular family of atypical states as identified above in ยง3b. We can calculate the energy density
and double occupancy for typical states using the free energy of (3.7) as

(e)p = ale and (d)g= a + e (3.14)
where we have used the fact that we are working at half-filling. This determines d as an implicit
function of e for thermal states. We note that this is of experimental relevance, as recent ultra-
cold atomic experiments are able to directly measure the double occupancy in realizations of
the one-dimensional Hubbard model [41].

In figure 2, we present results for the double occupancy as a function of the energy density
for thermal states at several values of the interaction strength u. These are compared with the
corresponding results for the finite entropy density atypical states with n = 4 constructed in ยง3b.
We see that, as the interaction strength u is increased, the results for thermal and atypical states
track one another for an increasing range of energy densities. On the other hand, for small values
of u the double occupancies of thermal and atypical states are very different at all energy densities.
These results can be used to shed some light on the role played by finite-size effects in the exact
diagonalization results of [34]. There the double occupancy was computed on lattices of up to
