the function of pumping the seminal fluid through the extremely fine capillary duct of the
penis, the pompetta. The cylinder of the pompetta is a small cuticular box with two
lateral alate apodemes..The piston is a rod-like piece with a round head which fits exactly
in a hole in one side of the cylinder. This hole is closed inside by a thin elastic tissue which
allows a certain amount of movement of the head of the piston. The piston rod springs
from a large cuticular structure in the shape of a bird’s sternum without a keel. This serves
as a hood over the pompetta and provides a suitable surface for the attachment of the
muscles responsible for the movements of the piston. I intended first to call this part the
ejaculatory hood, until I realized that this term had been applied to a different part by
other authors, viz. to a structure which overhangs the gonopore. Snodgrass (1904) gave
the name central vesicle to a very similar structure in Tipulidae without discriminating
between the real pompetta and the outer apodemal structure. I propose to call this
apodemal structure the piston hood, since the piston rod is, in fact, a part of it shaped as
such to serve the pumping function. ;

The ejaculatory duct passes underneath the piston hood and between the horns of its
deeply emarginate anterior border and under its arch until it reaches the small box of the
pompetta which it enters through a hole in the roof.

The opening in the pompetta leading to the penis tube lies in front of a deep pit in the
floor of the box and somewhat anterior to the opening of the ejaculatory duct. The pushing
in of the piston head closes the opening of the ejaculatory duct, while the passage to the
penis tube is still free, and so the compressed seminal fluid in the pompetta has no choice
but to pass into the capillary tube of the penis (figure 20 ¢). I failed to find any musculature
