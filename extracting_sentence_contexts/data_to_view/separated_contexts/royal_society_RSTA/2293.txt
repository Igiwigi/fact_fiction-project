The final operation was to estimate the hydrogen residue, when the combining
volumes could be calculated. For measuring the gases at 0° C., and 760 mm. pressure, the method was the same
as that used by Gray and Burr(") for the volumetric analysis of hydrogen chloride. In fact, some parts of the original apparatus were kindly lent to us by Dr. Gray. The measuring pipette (fig. 4) consisted of a thick-walled glass bulb, A, of about
300 ¢.c. capacity, sealed to capillary tubes at either end of its vertical diameter.
