+ | phosphorescence* when a conductor is brought into contact with the tube is not very

— which is in metallic connexion with the negative terminal of the tube, a property
> which is quite as distinetive of the luminous phenomena, of the sensitive discharges of
which we have treated in our former paper as is their sensitiveness to the approach of
a conductor which is nob in connexion with any portion of the cireuit. We can thus
apply the term ©sensitive state” to discharges through tubes of high vacua, even
- though the phosphorescence should constitute the main or even the only visible portion
of the phenomena. Taking, then, this extended conception of sensitiveness, we find that it appears in
Euades of high vacua under precisely the same conditions as in the cases with which we
'=have dealt in our previous paper.
