id down as a general rule. No better illustration of the error of this belief could, I
-2hink, be given than that afforded by the © Bellerophon,” which has an excess of weight
'Syer buoyancy amounting to 250 tons at the middle, and yet no sagging-strains at any
Sortion of her length. The curve MM in Plate XVII. fig. 9 shows that this is 80; and
St the section of minimum hogging-moment, 6, there is a strain of about 100 foot-tons.
he case of the © Audacious' in Plate XVII. fig. 10 furnishes another illustration of the
-Same kind. In her the excess of weight amidships, when fully laden, amounts to 265
ns; but the bending-moment, s0 far from becoming a sagging-strain, neyer falls below
A hogging-strain of 3400 foot-tons.
S Cases do undoubtedly exist, however, in which great excesses of weight amidships
<Sproduce sagging-moments in still water, and of these we have an example in the * Vie-
Storia and Albert.” On reference to Plate XVI. fig. 7 it will be seen that in this ship the
Qcentral part of the curye MM falls below the axis, thus indicating the fact that about
30 feet of the midships length of the ship is subjected to a very small sagging-moment, of
which the maximum value does not exceed 170 foot-tons, although the excess of weight
over buoyancy amounts to 210 tons. A very small deduction from this excess of weight
would suffice also to convert this sagging-moment into a small hogging-moment. For
example, suppose 10 tons only to be taken from the excess, and a weight of 4 tons to be
placed 150 feet before the poxition from which the 10 tons were taken, while the re-
maining 6 tons are placed 100 feet abaft it. The trim of the ship would remain unal-
tered, and the distribution of buoyancy would therefore be unchanged ; but the removal
