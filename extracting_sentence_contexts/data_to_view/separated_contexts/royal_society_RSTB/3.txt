The disease—the epidemic, I will say—commenced on a few
plants in April, and spread southwards for several yards during April and May. I
account for this as follows :—The easily spread spores (conidia) of the fungus causing
the disease were transferred by wind, and especially by water flowing southwards in
the ditch during the rains occurring at various periods in April: the wind, as I had
occasion to notice, was chiefly from the north and east at these times, hence the
immunity of the plants in the northern parts of the ditch and on the other side of
the garden. Even the fact of a south-west or west wind occasionally does not
contradict the conclusion when all the circumstances are known, for a high bank and
hedge lie to the westward of the ditch, and the hazel trees mentioned above would
screen other parts of the garden. An extraordinarily severe outbreak of the white spots occurred over the patch during
the period May 6th to 12th, and it was then I noticed particularly how the epidemic

spread to the south, and not to the north; the period referred to was remarkable for
very warm “steamy” mornings and very bright noons. A storm broke over Engle-
field Green on Saturday, April 24th, and the ditch was flooded and overflowing for
several hours, all the Ranunculus plants being bent downwards towards the south
when the water had passed over and through them: that the flooding in question
distributed the spores which caused the sudden and extensive outbreak on May 6th
to 12th will hardly be questioned after what follows, for I shall show that it requires
from a fortnight to three weeks to develope a white disease-spot in the leaf from a
spore germinated on its epidermis.
