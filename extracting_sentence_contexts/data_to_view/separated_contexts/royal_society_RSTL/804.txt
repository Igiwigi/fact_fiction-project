If then we can Co such a function
F(=), that when z = in we shall have f(#) = o, when
I=in-+1,f(r) =1, when z = in + 2, f(z) = 2, and 80

on, 7 being any integer whatever, it is evident that ==22 = @

will represent in general the integer part of =. Now

0.5 +159), +8.82,+ 5... (1 —a). 8,2

Tv—n +1
is such a function. I thought it right to mention this, because
the observation of this fact (s0 deduced) was among the first
things which led me to the general consideration of circula-
ting equations in the form I have here presented it.

(11). The next case I propose to consider is that of cir-
culating equations, in which the period of circulation is not
the same in all the coefficients. This, however, will not
detain us long.
