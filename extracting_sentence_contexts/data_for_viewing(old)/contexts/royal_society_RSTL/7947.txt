fig. 9, #). In the transverse section, these vessels appear to be nearly square (fig. 6, g),
whilst in the longitudinal one they exist as elongated, unbranched tubes (fig. 5, g), which
are sometimes reticulated (fig. 4), and at others transyersely barred. Very varied names
have been assigned to these tubes by different authors. Mr. BINNEy speaks of them as
* pseudo-vascular,” and Dr. Dawsox and Mr. CarruTaERs as © scalariform ” tissue, neither
of which terms appears to be exactly appropriate. They are unquestionably modified
forms of spiral tissue, though we have every reason to believe that they were incapable of
being unrolled ; but they are not scalariform, in the sense in which the term is applied
to the vessels of ferns and some other living Cryptogams, since they do not exhibit angles
thickened by continuous ligneous deposits as is seen in those examples. Still less should
they be designated psendo-yascular, since they are true yessels. The term © barred 2

$eems an appropriate one to apply to them. In some parts of his Monograph Mr. B1xxgy
describes them as having © their walls perforated with oval openings.” This is certainly
not the case, the supposed openings being merely thin places in the tubes where the
original cellulose wall has remained unthickened by secondary internal deposits of lignine.
These vessels approach very closely to the true annular yessel ; but I have never yet seen
an example in which individual rings could be traced apart from their neighbours, as is 80
