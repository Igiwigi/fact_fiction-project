The simulated surface elevations under the LSW and higher order dispersive
assumptions are depicted in figure 3 at t= 2200s, after the landslide has come to rest. In the
present case, dispersion mainly smooths the irregular wave that appear due to the multi-staged
release. In fact, the leading wave from the single block appears as more dispersive than the wave
originating from the retrogressive landslide. Figure 3 hence demonstrates that retrogression may
have the effect of stretching the tsunami compared to the single block, and in the case of large time
