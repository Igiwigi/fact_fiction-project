On the contrary, the fixation points for blue-green, blue, and violet also
& fall roughly along a straight line, but this slopes down to the right. Thus the positions of the
% fixation points for red, green, and blue lights, as previously obtained, are confirmed, and
the two different methods are found to give almost identically the same results. Another
8 fact of interest is that the fixation points for the colours from red to blue-green are in the
= same order as the colours of the spectrum, and, therefore, in the same order as the colours
Z produced by chromatic difference of magnification. Moreover, the spectrum produced by
the latter slopes downwards to the left, because the fixation axis lies in the visual field
below and to the left of the optic axis, so that the slope of the spectrum corresponds
8 roughly with the slope of the fixation points.
