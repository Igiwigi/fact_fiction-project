main run, and the rise in temperature of the gas was measured. The connections
were then altered so that the current flowed through the leads Qq, and the tempe-
rature was again measured. A large number of experiments were performed, details
of which are preserved in the archives. The following table gives the mean values of
(8¢/t) 100 for the large and small flows at steam and air temperatures ; 6¢ represents

the rise in temperature due to the leads under consideration, corresponding to the
rise in temperature ¢ for the same current in the main experiment. The difference

between the values for the arrangement Qq and Pp is due to the fact that the
platinum loops (see p. 203) associated with Qq and Pp were not exactly equal in
resistance,
