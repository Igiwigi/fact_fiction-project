is exactly equivalent to the probabilistic cellular automaton of §2.

e) Coarse graining and conjugate Grassmann variables

We could consider the product (3.31) as a new local factor K(t) which depends on the Grassmann
variables yy, (t+ 2é,x) and y,(x). The associated step evolution operators are Sint Stree- Restricting
the observables to even t this defines a ‘coarse-grained’ fermionic model. The relationship
between K(f) and S(t) is given by K(t)=gr(t+ 2S rp (OZ, (1). The unit of the time-distance
between two neighbouring points on the time lattice is arbitrary. For our particular construction
a non-interacting particle advances one space unit ¢ during two time units é. We can keep the
normalization of the velocity to one by choosing the time difference @ between neighbouring
lattice points as €=e/2. The disadvantage of integrating out the intermediate Grassmann
variables w(t + (€/2),x) consists in the fact that both the Grassmann basis functions g; and the
conjugate Grassmann basis functions %, are needed for an extraction of Sit) from K(t), and the
simplicity of the exponential factors may not be maintained.

It is often advantageous to keep the simple exponential form of the local factors also for the
coarse grained view. This can be done by doubling the number of Grassmann variables at every f.
At every f one has then two sets of variables (t,x) and Vy (t,x), and the functional integration
is over y and y. In our case, we can simply associate y(t) with y(t + ©) by defining

Troll +62) =Veall+ 52) and Gralt-+6,x)= Via (I+ 5,%). (3.32)
The Grassmann variables y(t + (¢/2)) then play a role very similar to the conjugate spinors used,
for example, in [16].
