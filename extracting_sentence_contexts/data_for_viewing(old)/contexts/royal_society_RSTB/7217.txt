107. The correlation function also opens out the possibility of studying questions of
optimum size and shape of blocks in agricultural field trials from a new point of view. The
saving in computational work in any case would be considerable. But this is not all, the

correlation function is likely to throw some light on the theory of design of experiments in
the case of non-random fields.

108. It will be noticed that the treatment adopted here is a kind of generalization for
two dimensions of the method of serial correlation in the case of time series on which a large
volume of work is already in existence. In fact, in many instances results for serial correlation
are capable of being extended in two dimensions without difficulty. But, as can be easily
seen from the above discussion, many new problems arise in the case of the two-dimensional
correlation function which have no analogue in the case of serial correlation.

109. For simplicity the concept of correlation function has been developed with reference
to the unitary configuration type of sampling. A corresponding development (involving,
however, nothing fundamentally new in principle) may be easily given with reference to
other types of sampling.

110. Itis clear that in the same manner as the variance function the correlation function
may be used as a tool for differentiation between random and non-random space distribu-
tions. The general principles have been explained earlier. It may be useful to recapitulate
