of CNCs while other areas were clearly enriched with loose CNC aggregates [6]. We believe that
this heterogeneity in CNC distribution is directly linked to the variability in the PSA tack and
peel strength measurements. Conversely, this was not seen in latex formulations consisting of
more hydrophilic monomers (i.e. BA/MMA blends without the more hydrophobic EHA); we

have shown earlier that in the more hydrophilic formulations, all three adhesive metrics increased : =

evidence, in our most recent work, we demonstrated that the best distribution of CNCs in PSA 13

Because the AFM nano-adhesion measurements rely on small nominal contact areas (i.e. the DR
surface area of the colloidal probe), we believe that the effects of surface roughness on adhesion : 4
are less pronounced. In fact, regardless of CNC loading, the average surface roughness of nine 1
separate 2.5 x 2.5m? areas (i.e. the diameter of the colloidal probe) on each film was under : Ss
15nm. In such a case, we see a continuous improvement in latex film adhesion with increasing : Ss
CNC content, despite the significant variability in the measurements potentially resulting from Ss

inconsistent indentation depth (as seen by the slight curvature in the repulsive region of the F-d
curves) or probe contamination. However, over larger surface areas one can no longer disregard
the macroscopic topography of the latex film and this, on the other hand, is reflected in the PSA
performance.

While the Greenwood-Williamson model can be used to estimate the true contact area between
nominally flat surfaces, it requires the use of numerous assumptions which cannot be applied
here. The two main assumptions of this model are (i) the summits of all surface asperities have
