FORCES ON A SOLID BODY IN A STREAM 63

Gotpste1n* has given in his first paper a proof that the last integral in (9.32)
tends to zero. The proof only applies, however, to the incomplete solution of the
equations given in that paper. In order to obtain a general proof, we make use

of the discussion of the integral \| (lu + m'v + n'w) dd given in §8. It was found

that most of the terms in this integral vanished in the limit on account of their
order of magnitude. In all these cases, multiplication of the integrand by wu will
cause the integral to tend to zero still more rapidly. Further, in those cases which
formerly depended on the fact that the integral with respect to vanished, and
those which actually led to a finite result, it is easily seen, with the help of equations
(8.21) to (8.27), that multiplication by u will cause the integral to vanish on account
of its order of magnitude. Thus we have

lim i u (lu + m'v + n'w) d= = 0,
