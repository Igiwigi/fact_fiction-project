formations by the long-continued action of those superficial agencies with which the
geologist deals.

11. The hypothesis of the existence of a liquid nucleus intensely hot rests mainly upon
two grounds :—lIst,the nebular origin of our globe in common with all others, as suggested
by LaPLack, by which the interior of a cooling globe must be hotter than the exterior;
2nd, the observation of temperature, which proves to increase with the depth, though in
a very discordant sort of way.

12. That our globe js hotter within than on or near its surface is « Fact, but that it
possesses a liquid nucleus in a tate of fusion is only an hypothesis, though a very
probable one. The rate of increment of temperature with depth, far too hastily asxumed
to follow everywhere one simple arithmeticlaw, and the facts of terrestrial conductivity,

£0 far as these are known, induced the belief that the lid crust is comparatively thin.

An unlimited supply of liquid lava was thus provided; the question was, what brought
it up through this thin crust, and ejected it and other matters at the surface. By some,
amongst whom Signor BELLI may be distinguished for the ability of his writings, the
erust was as8umed 80 thin as to merely float upon the liquid globe beneath; and a
mechanism being conceived for fracturing the crust into separate fragments, and their
density being rather greater than that of the supporting fluid, these sunk more or less
