proportional to its density, when compared with oxygen. It is to be remembered,
however, that carbonic acid is a compound gas, containing an equal volume of oxygen.
'The second constituent carbon which increases the weight of the gas, appears to give
additional velocity to the oxygen in the same manner and to the same extent as
increased density from pressure, or from cold (as I believe I shall be able to show),
increases the transpiration velocity of pure oxygen itself. A result of this kind shows
at once the important chemical bearing of gaseous transpirability, and that it emulates
a place in science with the doctrines of gaseous densities and combining yolumes.

The cireumstance that the transpiration time of hydrogen is one-half of that of nitro-
gen, indicates that the relations of transpirability are even more simple in their ex-
pression than the relations of density among gases. In support of the same assertion
may be adduced the additional fact, that binoxide of nitrogen, although differing in
density, appears to have the same transpiration time as nitrogen, Protoxide of
nitrogen and carbonic acid have one transpiration time, $0 haye nitrogen and.
carbonic oxide, as each pair has a common density.

It is necessary to mention how this gas was prepared, as it is one, like olefiant gas,
