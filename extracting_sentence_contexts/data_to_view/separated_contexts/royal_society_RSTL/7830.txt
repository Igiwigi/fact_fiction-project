Hence
& follows that, to construct a curve of shearing-forces, we have only to integrate the
Hrve of loads (or to obtain the algebraical sums of the areas of the loops of that curve)
"Hp to certain stations, and to use the results of these integrations as measures, on a
Sertain scale, of the lengths of ordinates to be set upwards or downwards at the stations
Eecording as the areas above or those below the axis are in excess. In performing the
-Hitegrations we may start from either end. As an example I will take the case of the
SBellerophon' in fig. 9 for that purpose, remarking the fact that in Plate XVI. fig. 7 and
Klate XVIL. figs. 8 and 9 the curves V V represent the result of these operations for the
EVictoria and Albert,” © Minotaur,” and © Bellerophon ' respectively, and that the similarly
Harked curves in figs. 10 and 11 represent the shearing-forces experienced by the
=Audacious' when fully laden and when she has only her engines and boilers on board
Feopectively. V Turning to fig. 9, it is necessary to state that A has been chosen as the starting-point
Jor the integration of the curve of loads L IL, and that the stations up to which the in-
> nn have been carried, in order to determine the ordinates of the curve of shearing-
orces V V, are those (drawn midway between the dotted ordinates of the curve of loads)
Rorresponding to the imaginary planes of division, 20 feet apart, with which we started. The ordinate at any section, 8ay, R*, R?, is determined as follows.
