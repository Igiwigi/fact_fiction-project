The mean body and percentage arm length measurements are
iven in the table at the end of the paper, the values there given being in eye-piece
scale units. If desired to reduce them to millimetres, they must be divided by 152°3. Tt will be seen that the chief distinctions between the two parent larval forms, as
as mere measurement is concerned, lie in the fact that the Strongylocentrotus larva

as a fairly long body (on an average about: 33 scale units), and an arm length of
bout the same value, whilst the Spherechinus larva has a short bod y (on an average
=bout 17 units), and an arm length as a rule about double as great. Measurement

upproaches more closely to one type or the other. Tn the accompanying table are given the results of all the experiments made on
ssing Spherechinus ¢ and Strongylocentrotus 3.
