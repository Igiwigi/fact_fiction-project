I proceed therefore to determine the analytical expressions for the latitude of the
limiting parallel of rupture on the side of the zone nearest to the equator. Let 0, re-
present this latitude, 0, the latitude of a parallel in the supposed undisturbed part of
the shell. It will appear that the general equation between the rupturing and cohesive forces
upon which the, position of the parallel of mean pressure depends, can, when the
influence of temperature is abstracted, be made to contain but two independent
variables 0, and a, or that it will be of the form F(9,, a,)=0. 'The value required of
0, must evidently be a maximum, and hence we must determine it in general by eli-
mination between the equations

F(0,, ai), iT @,=0 or =;

the fact of the resulting value being a maximum or minimum can be determined as
usual by the sign of I

19. Let two infinite planes be conceived to pass through the axis of rotation of the
hell, making s0 small an angle with each other that the curvature of the arc of the
equator intercepted between them could be considered as insensible. The ratio of
the rupturing to the cohesive forces in either of the opposite portions of the shell thus
intercepted, will be the same as for the whole shell under our assumed conditions.
