and the load/extension curve of human hair stretched slowly in 1% aqueous caustic
soda solution (see fig. 10). The Hooxn’s law region in both curves has been omitted.) The fact that we have to leave out the Hooxn’s law region of the load/extension curves
in order to bring out the closeness of the parallel is evidence of the strongest kind that
both super-contraction and permanent set are associated, not with the «-keratin of the normal
unstretched hair fibre, but with the transformation of «-keratin into B-keratin by the act of
stretching beyond the Hooxx’s law region ; while the correspondence between the super-

contraction curves, the permanent set curves, and the restricted load/extension curves
affords still another powerful argument in favour of the three-phase theory put forward
above. Horizontal lines have been drawn in the figure to mark the effective boundaries
between the three phases (at roughly 20%, and 45%, extension, ¢f.
