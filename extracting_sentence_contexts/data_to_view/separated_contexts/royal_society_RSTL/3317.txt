In 1821 I had made s0 much progress in these investigations, that I was encouraged
to present my first paper to the Society, as no longer the expression of mere opinions
founded on experiments too delicate to be generally appreciated, but demonstrations
of substantial facts, easily proved to be correct, and such as the Society has always
sought to encourage. After the principle had been once established by anatomy
and experiment, that the nerves possess distinct functions in correspondence with
their origins from the brain and spinal marrow, time and opportunity were alone
wanting for collecting the pathological facts which were to give importance to the
observations in these early papers. Those facts I am now desirous of placing before
the Society, to complete the subject as far as regards my own labours. First in regard to

The Spinal Nerves. In the earliest part of my investigations I performed experiments on the roots of
these nerves.
