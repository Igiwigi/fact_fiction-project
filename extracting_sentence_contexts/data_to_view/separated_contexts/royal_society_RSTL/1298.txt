The small axle is then turned till the further surface re-
flects the light of a candle, or other definite object to the eye;
and, lastly, (the eye being kept steadily in the same place)
the circle is turned by its larger axle, till the second surface
reflects the same light. This second surface is thus ascer-
tained to be in the same position as the former surface had
been. The angle through which the circle has moved, is in
fact the supplement to the inclination of the surfaces; but as


reflective Gontometer, 255

the graduations on its margin are numbered accordingly in an
inverted order, the angle is correctly shewn by the index,
without need of any computation. It may here be observed, that it is by no means necessary
to have a clean uniform fracture for this application of the in-
strument to the structure of laminated substances ; for since

= all those small portions of a shattered surface, that are paralle! a to one another (though not in the same plane), glisten at once
5 with the same light, the angle of an irregular fracture may
S be determined nearly as well, as when the reflecting frag-
S ments are actually in the same plane.
