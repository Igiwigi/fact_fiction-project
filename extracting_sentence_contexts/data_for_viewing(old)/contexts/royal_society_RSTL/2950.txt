280 MR. NEWPORT ON THE TEMPERATURE OF INSECTS.

From this Table it is seen that in the autumn, while the larya of the Anthophora
continues active in its cell, its temperature is higher than that of either nymph or
perfect insect, while the nymph, which has in reality a lower temperature than either
the larva or perfect insect, being at that time in a state of activity, or degree of ex-
citement inferior to that of the larva, and superior to that of the perfect insect, has a
temperature in its cell intermediate between that of these two conditions. It was
evident to me while making these observations that these apparently contradictory
facts arose only from the circumstance of the perfect insect being then in a state of
far more complete hybernation than the nymph, which, as well as the larya, was less
able to maintain its temperature when raised to a certain amount than the perfect
insect. But when the season of hybernation is over, and the swarthy female bee is
roving abroad in the sunshine of the months of May and June, she has a temperature,
as shown at Nos. 18, 24, 35, 37, and 38, very far above her temperature in the states
of larva and nymph, or than what is possessed by her only a short time before she
quits her cell in the months of March and April, when her temperature is scarcely
higher than that of the larva, as shown in Nos. 15, 16, and 17. But if the perfect
bee be taken from her cell either at the end of March or at the commencement of
her hybernation in September, her temperature of body after a few inspirations will
be raised to two or three degrees above that of the atmosphere, but if undisturbed
the insect always endeavours to sink again into a state of repose, and the temperature
