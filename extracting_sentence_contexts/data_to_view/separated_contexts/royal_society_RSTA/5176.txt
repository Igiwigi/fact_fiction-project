Other studies have used Raman
spectroscopy to detect carotenoids in native samples from surface or subsurface colonizations of
rocks or sediments. These studies have high relevance for geobiology and exobiology [15-23]. In
fact, Raman spectrometer in a miniaturized version was proposed to be included onboard a rover
to be part of the forthcoming projects of astrobiological priority on Mars [1,17]. Biosignatures of
preexisting life, as well as mineral associations confirming the presence of water on Mars in the
past, are the main objects of interest to be detected by Raman spectroscopic instrumentation. As
biomarkers, pigments and especially carotenoids are of highest relevance.
