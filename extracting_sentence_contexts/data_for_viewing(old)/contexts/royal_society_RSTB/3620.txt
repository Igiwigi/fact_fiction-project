very noticeably differentiated as regards number and size of vessels.

Age.—Lower Greensand (Aptian) : locality, probably Luecomb Chine.

Type.—Brit. Mus. Nat. Hist., No. V 11,517, block and series of sections.

Discussion of Affinities.—Before a paleeobotanist can discuss the affinities of a fossil,
he must either himself have considerable knowledge of allied modern groups, or must
have such knowledge on the part of another, available for his use. Now, it is
essential to point out here that there is perhaps no branch of modern botany in a
more chaotic condition than that dealing with the anatomy of Angiosperms. The
Gymnosperms are few in number, and the facts have been sufficiently marshalled to
be of use. Angiosperms are enormously numerous, and the facts, incompletely
collected, are not marshalled at all. It is, therefore, entirely premature to attempt
any such discussion of the possible affinities of this fossil, as one could give, let us say,
to a new Poroxylon or Arvaucaria. In evidence of this I may mention that for more
than a year I have been showing this fossil wood to many of the leading botanists of
this country, Europe, and America, and that among the numerous opinions kindly
offered, I have been told it resembled closely nearly every family ranging from the
Gnetales on one hand to the Malvales on the other. This is not to be interpreted
to mean that the woods of all these families are alike, and that consequently classifi-
cation of them is impossible, but it is due to the comparatively few samples that
any one individual studies and to the great range of variations between the woods of
so-called species of so-called genera. By far the best account of wood structures with
