Although we are
not going to discuss them here, for completeness, we just cite a few other
identification possibilities: special features of wave-packet dynamics, the structure
of avoided crossing (as we change parameters of the Hamiltonian), ergodicity in
he wave-function state space; dynamical localization, etc. As a last discussion in this section, we briefly comment on the very fundamental
question of why a system that is nonlinear classically, when quantized should
resent particular features distinguishing it from the integrable case. In fact,
his query does not have a definite answer, partially because we still do not
know the precise border between the classical and quantum realms. A partial
and rather speculative explanation has its foundations in an important point
raised by Einstein [62] in 1917. Yet in the pre-QM era, the so-called Einstein
Brillouin-Keller (EBK) rules [51] already would lead to the (semiclassical)
quantization of a problem in terms of invariant tori of the classical phase space.
