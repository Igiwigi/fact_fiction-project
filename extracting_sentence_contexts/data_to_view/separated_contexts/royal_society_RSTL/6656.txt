On this plan I sneceeded
Zn making eclipse-pictures artificially, which showed the brightening very distinctly. From these experiments I am inclined to believe that Mr. Arry's explanation is the true
ne, although it is a curious subjective fact that the parts possessing superior illumina-
he exhibit to our perception an extremely bright line, bordering immediately on the
Ylark limb of the moon, while the less bright parts towards the circumference present

2 In order to study other points connected with the photographs, I had made, on glass,
Home enlarged copies, in which the moon's disk was increased in 8ome cases to 9 inches,
An others to 13 inches in diameter. It was found that measurements could be made on
Zhese with considerable accuracy, by means of a graduated beam compass reading to
Hhousandths of an inch, and I had proceeded to some extent in this way, when it
2 pt to me to have an instrument constructed expressly for measuring the original
Degatives. The study of the enlarged copies led, however, to a method of producing
Zharts of the prominences with complete fidelity; and the plan will, I think, hereafter

representations derived from photographs.
