As Bohr emphasized, quantum mechanics does
not describe quantum systems and processes as ‘they are’, but correctly predicts the outputs
of measurements performed on quantum systems, with measurement apparatuses are treated
classically. Niels Bohr writes [9,10]

This crucial point, which was to become a main theme of the discussions reported in
the following, implies the impossibility of any sharp separation between the behaviour
of atomic objects and the interaction with the measuring instruments which serve to
define the conditions under which the phenomena appear. In fact, the individuality of the

typical quantum effects finds its proper expression in the circumstance that any attempt 3

of subdividing the phenomena will demand a change in the experimental arrangement : 5
introducing new possibilities of interaction between objects and measuring instruments : 5
which in principle cannot be controlled. Consequently, evidence obtained under different LS
experimental conditions cannot be comprehended within a single picture, but must be : <
regarded as complementary in the sense that only the totality of the phenomena exhausts Do

the possible information about the objects. : 8

The new information-theoretical paradigm that emerged from the quantum information :B
experience is perfectly in line with the Copenhagen point of view. : =

The present special issue is entirely devoted to such approach to quantum foundations. The
issue is composed of contributions of world’s leading researchers in quantum information and
presents viewpoints—both theoretical and experimental—on a number of foundational problems
connected to quantum information.
