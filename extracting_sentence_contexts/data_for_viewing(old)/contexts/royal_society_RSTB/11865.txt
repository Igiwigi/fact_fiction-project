debate by developmental psychologists. Erikson [6] theorized
that infants not older than 2 years pass through a stage
known as ‘trust versus mistrust’, where their propensity to
trust is shaped by the quality of care received. This happens
because infants highly depend upon the caregivers for suste-
nance and learn whether or not the latter regularly satisfy their
basic needs, either learning that the world is a secure, trustable
environment or an undependable, insecure place.

A psychological trait that relates to the mastery of one’s self
trustfulness is ToM: the ability to attribute mental states to
others (for instance beliefs, intentions and desires) that may
differ from one’s own. In fact, the ability to correctly judge
the trustworthiness of others is strongly correlated to the
matureness of this trait [7] because a mature ToM allows one
to perform behaviour prediction and provides clues on trust-
worthiness [8]. Despite ToM being universal in adults, the
same cannot be said about preschoolers: while the latter are
not completely lacking some form of ToM, this slowly develops
with age [9,10]. An experiment conducted by Vanderbilt et al.
[1] demonstrated that ToM matures around the fourth year of
age and is completely developed by the fifth year.

Whereas trust is such an important factor in human inter-
actions, it is also an essential component of HRI, in the sense
