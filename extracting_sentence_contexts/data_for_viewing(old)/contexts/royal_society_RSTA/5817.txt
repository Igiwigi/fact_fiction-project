conjectures about the properties of the solutions have been formulated. In this paper, we follow [3
a simpler approach that focuses instead on the behaviour of the interaction of two neighbouring Dm
spatial points on approach to the singularity. Da

(a) Hubble-normalized state 8

Our ensuing analysis applies to the Go cosmologies that admit no isometries and have a state that [8
is described in vacuum by the Hubble-normalized state vector [23], [3

Explicitly,! we introduce a fundamental 4-velocity timelike vector field u on the cosmological
space-time (M,g), and use the simple fact that the coordinate basis (0;, dy) is not orthogonal on
a local chart (U,@) of the manifold M, because the ;’s are inverse images of the canonical basis
vector fields of R* under a ¢-induced map on each tangent space.

Then in a cosmological setting one prefers instead to use an orthonormal frame (eo, ea), which
singles out a future-directed, unit, timelike vector field eg, usually equal to u, supplemented by
an orthonormal spatial frame (e,), in the remaining three spaces of eg, making the frame metric
the Minkowski metric ny = diag(—1,1,1,1). It is simply related to the coordinate frame by the
equations

eo =N71( —N%ay) and ey =e8dz, (2.2)

with N, N* being the lapse and shift functions.
