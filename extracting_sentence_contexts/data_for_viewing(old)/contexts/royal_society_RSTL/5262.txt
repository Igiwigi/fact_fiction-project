ward with a slight curve, is lost just as it reaches a quantity of blastema situated
close behind the heart. This blastema is the rudiment of the parenchyma of the
liver; it does not consist of oily matter like that of the intestine, but of a less opake
and more granular substance. As development advances the anterior tract continues
to extend ; it passes forwards and upwards above and behind the liver, and was traced
on one occasion, though becoming more faint, as far as the last branchial fissure; a
Slight dilatation at one part of its course marks the future stomach, and from near
the same part two offsets are given off, one of which runs upon the liver, the other
towards the vertebral column. Both oily tracts and the offsets just mentioned are
Solid ; they are to be regarded, I think, as a peculiar deposit of formative matter in-
tended for the formation of particular structures ; their appearance and mode of
development seem to me by no means consonant with the view that the intestinal
cavity is simply a part shut off from the general yolk cavity. In fact, the intestine,
as has been said, is not at first a cavity but a solid tract of formative matter, and in
this respect is analogous to the embryonic condition of other organs (s0 far as I can
determine), which always seem to arise from a sbapeless blastema deposited in one
spot. The offset to the liver is more distinct sometimes than at others ; it is most
marked about the sixth day, but always may be distinguished as a small eminence of
opake oily matter in the side of the intestine, until the cystic and hepatic ducts are
fully formed and have united with the intestine at that spot. The existence of this
eminence is certainly very remarkable; it may be well to give it a name and call it
the colliculus; I do not see that its import at present can be at all explained ; nor
could we indeed expect this, unless we could obtain some clue to the comprehension
of the mysterious principle by which the process of development is governed. I can-
not see any ground for the statement that the liver is developed by the protrusion of
