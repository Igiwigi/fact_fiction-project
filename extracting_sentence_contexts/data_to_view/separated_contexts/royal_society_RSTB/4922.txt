The mito-
chondrial cloud is at its maximum stage of development in oocytes of 100 to 140p in
diameter. At this time a more definite and homogeneous structure differentiates, in
the middle of the mitochondrial cloud, which I propose to call the mitochondrial yolk-
body (Plate 17, fig. 13; Plate 19, fig. 32). On account of its exact similarity in staining
reactions, its place of origin in the centre of the mitochondrial cloud, and the fact that
there are much fewer individual mitochondria apparent in the cell immediately after its

formation, I conclude that it is formed directly from the mitochondria by a process of
fusion, more or less complete, of a large number. It is spherical in shape and varies
in size from 50-70Â» in diameter.
