Let (Z) represent the result of substituting in Z these values of y,, ..., y,, $0 that

Looking now at the assemblage of equations (b.), (c.), we see that they express the
following proposition :—
The values of Ys Yaz +5603 Yuz —(D),
are the partial differential coefficients with respect to ,, 7, ... r,, t, of one and the
same function. Let this function be called X; we have then

and since y;, ..., Y,, (Z) are given functions of #,, &c., 4,, &c., t, the function X can
be found by simple integration. Let us then suppose X to be known, and let us take the total differential coefficient

the elimination of a,, ... @,, b,, ... b,, from the system of equations (II.), (III.), leads
to the differential equations (I.) (se art. 6.). The n equations (IIT.) give therefore
the remaining » integrals of the system (I.), of which (II.) and (IIL.) together are the
complete solution. The system of equations (IT.), (III.) being the same as that discussed in the pre-
ceding articles, all the conclusions there obtained will continue to subsist.
