B) = (Ai!- Ai) (3+¢4 cos?y). 2 . 2. 1. It follows therefore that an infinitesimal satellite revolving about an oblate planet, whose rotation is the
same as the revolution of the satellite, is very nearly identical in form with a small but finite satellite
whose mass is a fraction of a spherical planet expressed by ¢. This curious conclusion follows from the fact
that if we take equation (35) and put ¢ and » zero (which corresponds to a spherical planet and small
satellite), we get exactly the equation ()) just found, only with A in place of ¢

involve integrals of one of two types.
