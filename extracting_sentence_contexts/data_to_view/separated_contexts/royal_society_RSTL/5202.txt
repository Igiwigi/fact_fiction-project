Surely if a term is to have any value in either zoological or
anatomical nomenclature it must be applied to only a defined thing. The © mantles” |
of a Sepia, a Cleodora, or a Buccinum may be homologous with one another, but
they certainly are not 80 with what is called the © mantle” in Doris or any other
Nudibranch-f. The simple fact that the cephalic tentacles arise in the midst of the

is never permanently developed, and the poxition of the alz would lead to the belief that they correspond to its
lateral portions!. So far as I can judge from the Latin table affixed to his Swedish essay on the development of the Acephala,
Lovty considers the arms of the Cephalopoda, the three pairs of cephalic tentacles of Clio, and the cephalic
lobes of Tethys, to be homologous with the velum of the Gasteropod embryo, while the funnel of Cephalopoda
and the alz of Pteropoda are homologous with the foot of Gasteropoda. The considerations above cited appear to me to furnish a sufficient refutation of these views, which seem
to be the offspring of an idea first propounded by their learned author in his © Contributions to the Embryology
of the Mollusks” (Oxzx's Isis, 1842), that the hood of Tethys and the cephalic processes of Tergipes are modi-
fications of the cephalic vela of the embryo.
