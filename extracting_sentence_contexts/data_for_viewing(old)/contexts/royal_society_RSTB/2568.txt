palate-bones, if the lower jaw could be separated from the rest of the skull.” They
are now clearly shown to have been elongate-oval and situated between the palatine
and the vomer at some distance behind the preemaxillaries.

Tn the specimen described and figured by Huxtey in 1887, vertical compression by
crushing has caused the maxillary and palatine bones to approximate towards the
median line and thus cover nearly the whole palatal surface, only a small portion of
the vomers appearing in the open space left behind the base of the preemaxillary beak.
Evidence of such a displacement is to be found in the fact that, were the mandible of
the same specimen shifted forwards to its natural position, with the bifid extremity
embracing the curved-down extremity of the beak, as correctly restored by Huxtey, the
series of teeth with which its edge is beset would fall outside the series of maxillo-
palatine teeth instead of fitting, as they should, in the groove between them. This
crushing has also caused a fracture in the maxillary bone, a fracture which has been
regarded by BurckHaRpDT as a suture between maxillary and palatine ; but I have
been unable to convince myself of the existence of such a suture in the position
assigned to it by that observer. One proof of the distinctness of a toothed maxillary
bone from the palatine in Huxtery’s specimen lies in the fact that the dentigerous
edge of the right maxillary bone, as determined by Huxtey, has, through displace-
ment, become more widely separated, in the vertical direction, from the corresponding
palatine than the left on the same specimen ; a correct idea of the state of things is
