well to investigate the question further. It was accordingly investigated what the
distribution of character figures actually is on days n-+ 9 and n + 18, where n is
representative of the 1,200 selected D days of the 20 years. It will be noticed that
9 and 18 are the only whole numbers arising from 7 x 27/6, where 7 is integral. The
results appear in Table XXIII, with, for comparison, the results already given in Table
XII for 1,200 chance days of the 20 years.

If Dr. DesLanpREs’ views were correct, so far ds large disturbances at least are concerned,
whatever else the figures in Table XXIII might show, they ought, presumably, to show
an excess in the entries in the last three columns as compared with average days. The
exact reverse is the case.

As a matter of fact, the days » + 9 included only 169 selected D days as against
227 selected Q days, a deficiency of 58, while the days n +- 18 included only 143 D days,
as against 209 Q days, a deficiency of 66.

§21. The absence of marked undulations in the curves of fig. 5, between days n + 3
and n +- 23, could not have been foretold, but the substantial difference actually seen
between the intermediate portions of the two curves in fig. 5 was a necessity of the case.
Taking the D and associated days, let us suppose the representative day n to be at the
centre of a 31-day month, and let us assume—what is not quite true—that symmetry
of characterisation exists with respect to day n. Then we have 31 days, of which the
central five give a total excess above the normal of 1,477 units.

Tt follows that, on the average, each of the remaining 26 days—which would extend
