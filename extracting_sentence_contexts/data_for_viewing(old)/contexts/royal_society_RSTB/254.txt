quiescence. A reference to the chapter on the development of the organ in R. radiate
will, however, show that neither of these conditions holdsâ€”the development is only
completed when maturity is reached, and, once developed, the organ slowly increase
in size as the Skate grows larger.

Again, in a degenerating electric organ, we should expect the electric plate to be
incomplete, and the nerves passing to it few in number or undergoing retrogressiv
changes ; and one would further expect to find some indication of degeneration of
less essential layers. But in R. radiata there is a relatively large bunch of well

* But, although the cups and discs are perfectly independent and distinct, there is no reason fo
supposing that the Skates with cup-shaped organs have sprung from one ancestor, while the Skates witl
discs have descended from another. The fact that the disc of R. batis passes through an indistinet cuj
stage points to a common ancestor, in which the electric organ was in all probability made up of slightl;
altered muscular fibres resembling the clubs of Zt. radiata represented in Plate 79, figs. 4 and 5.

developed nerves proceeding to an electric plate, which is not only complete, but,
being apparently in advance of the development of the supporting cup, extends some
distance over its margin.

In support of the view that the electric organ of FR. radiata is a progressive
structure, or, if not still advancing, that it has been comparatively recently arrested
