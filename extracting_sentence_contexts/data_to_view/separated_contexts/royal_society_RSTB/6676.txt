The purified product like
that obtained from tobacco mosaic juice is far less readily filtered, and it is suggested
that in the process of purification an aggregation of small particles into chains has
taken place. Characteristic of the X virus product is its extreme isotropy, a feature
present in a lesser degree in the corresponding preparation from tobacco mosaic. The workers in this new field of plant virus disease investigation have emphasized
the fact that the peculiar protein body they isolate from infected juices (a) represents
almost all the soluble protein present in the juice; (b) that it contains 95% and
over of the total virus present; (c) that both in the case of tobacco plants infected with
mosaic virus and of those infected with the X virus, a given quantity of raw infective
juice in each series always yields an equivalent weight of the protein; (d) that there is
every reason to regard the protein and the virus agent as one and the same. ITS STRAINS AND REACTIONS 175

These conclusions constitute a great advance in our knowledge of viruses and their
importance cannot as yet be fully gauged. One deduction made by the writer several
years back from other and different reasons and referred to on p. 170 would seem to
receive confirmation, namely, that a plant infected with one or more than one strain
of any one virus contains at any given moment in a given environment the maximum
number of virus particles, irrespective of the number of strains â€˜involved.
