lower limb. This conclusion is completely confirmed by observation of the so-called
voluntary movements of the toes; primary simultaneous action of the small toes being
extremely rare, and, perhaps, scarcely ever performed by Man, or by this species of
Monkey.

(iii.) Character of Movement.

(a.) Absolute.—Again we find that, as in the case of “all toes,” the mcvement of
extension is much more largely represented than that of flexion. Thus, out of a
total of 92 movements, 78 were extension and 14 flexion.

A further point of material interest in connection with this remarkable preponderance
of the movement of extension is to be seen in the fact that the movement of flexion,
when it happened, was observed only at centres

68 =
67, teny? 69, 64, 54, 6’;

these, with one exception, form a group immediately in front of the fissure of
Ro.anpo, and in the same region which we have already seen in the case of “all
toes” to be connected especially with the flexion movements of those digits as well
as the general representation of the hallux.

As we shall now leave the consideration of the movements of the toes for that of the
movements of the ankle, it seems to us very desirable to make further reference to
