They endeavoured to explain the value of the vacuum energy in terms
of a dynamical mechanism, e.g. an effective potential of a cosmic scalar field which settles down
automatically (hence without fine-tuning) to the present small value, p?,.. As an example, see
the ‘cosmon’ attempt in [28] and its ulterior discussion by Weinberg in [16]. Unfortunately, no
model of this kind ever succeeded as yet in achieving such an unattainable dream, as in fact
an unsurmountable stumbling block was placed in their way in the form of a ‘no-go theorem’
formulated by Weinberg [16]. In the meantime, a new generation of scalar field models gave rise to the notion of
quintessence. They appeared in the market in two different waves separated by almost a decade
[33-36].
