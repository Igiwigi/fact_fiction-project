The combustion of potassium and sodium in oxygene gas,
is much less vivid than in oxymuriatic gas. From this pheno-
menon, and from some others, I was inclined to believe that
the attraction of these metals for oxygene is feebler, than
their attraction for oxymuriatic gas. I made several experi-
ments, which proved that this is the fact ; but before I enter
upon a detail of them, it will be necessary to discuss more
fully than I have yet attempted, the nature of the combina-
tions of potassium and sodium with oxygene, and of potash
and soda with water. I have stated-in the last Bakerian Lecture, that potassium
and sodium, when burnt in oxygene gas, produce potash and
Soda in a state of.extreme dryness, and very difficult of fusion. In the experiments from which these conclusions are drawn,
as I mentioned, I used trays of platina, and finding that this
metal was oxidated in the operation, I heated the retort
strongly, to expel any oxygene the platina might have ab-
sorbed, and except in cases when this precaution was taken,
I found the absorption of oxygene much greater than could
be accounted for by the production of the alkalies.
