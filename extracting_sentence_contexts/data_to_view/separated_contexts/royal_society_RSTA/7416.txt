Schonland (1928), in observations of South African
storms, found an excess of positive pre-discharge gradient when the storms were
distant and an enormous excess of negative gradient when they were overhead, the
occurrence of positive gradient being then extremely rare. While these storms illustrate
the same general tendency as the English storms here studied, there is clearly a big
difference in the distribution of potential gradient in the two cases. The results which have been considered in this section may be presented in another
way which brings out more clearly some of the salient facts. The figures given in
Table IV may be used to compute approximately the average values of the pre-
discharge potential gradient at various distances from the active centre of a thunder-
storm. (For this purpose the average magnitudes of the potential gradient in the three
rows of Table IV were assumed to be 500, 3000 and 7000 V/m. respectively.) It is
then found, for example, that while discharges were occurring within 5 km., the
pre-discharge gradient was positive for 224 min., with an average value of + 2800 V/m.
and negative for 444 min. with an average value of —3200 V/m. The average value
of the gradient with respect to time, while discharges were within 5 km.,was therefore
—1200 V/m.
