Extensions are highly non-unique. As an obvious example, observe that the metric (4.4) is
actually an extension of the exterior region r > rg of the Schwarzschild vacuum solution, but this
is different from the standard analytical one found in the textbooks [14,16]. In fact, physically
meaningful extensions are far from obvious and, furthermore, not even analytical extensions
are unique, nor feasible, in general, let alone smooth extensions. For explicit examples with a
discussion, see [43]. This problem is especially relevant at Cauchy horizons, see [14â€”16,26] for
definitions and figure 3 for several illustrative examples.
