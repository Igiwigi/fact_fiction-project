poda and Heteropoda; and I trust I am not overstepping the bounds of legitimate
analogy, in assuming that the anatomical fact of a neural flexure indicates the em-
bryological development of an abdomen ; that of a hzmal flexure, the development
of a post-abdomen ; and that therefore the Pteropoda fall into the same category with
the Cephalopoda and Pulmonata ; the Heteropoda into that of the Pectinibranchiata,
Tectibranchiata and Nudibranchiata.

It is remarkable, that, as regards the flexure of the intestine, similar contrasted
modifications of the archetype take place in those animals which are the nearest allies
of the Mollusca; I mean the Ascidians and Polyzoa, the Molluscoides of MiNe-
Evwarps. In each of these groups the intestine is always bent upon itself; but while
in the Ascidian the bend is always ha&mal, in the Polyzoon it is neural. The latter
fact is evident to any one who will examine a Polyzoon; the former may seem at first,
sight to be contradicted by the circumstance, that the ganglion in the Ascidians is
placed between the cloacal and branchial apertures. However, as I have endeavoured
to show elsewhere$, whatever be the position of the anus in the Ascidians, the first
bend of the intestine is always hazmal. I have already referred to their probable
analogy with Spirialis in this respect.

Having now determined the changes which take place in the axis of symmetry of
the Mollusca, let us examine into those undergone by their principal external organs.

Whether we have to do with a Cephalopod or with an ordinary Mollusk, the first
step in development is the separation of the blastoderm into a central elevation, the
