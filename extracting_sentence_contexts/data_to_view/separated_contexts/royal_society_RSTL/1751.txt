The first
five blows, in experiment No. II, by the simple process, pro-
duced a lifting power of 73 grains, nearly one-half the weight
of the wire ;â€”the first two blows, in experiment No. VII, also
by the simple process, produced, in a long wire whose mag-
netisgm had been totally destroyed by heating to redness, a
lifting power of 186 grains; and the first 5 blows, in ex-


developement of magnetical properties in Steel and iron, &c. 21g

periment No. XIII, on'a- new wire by the compound process,
occasioned in-this wire, of only 145 grains weight, a lifting
power of 265 grains. 3. The increased magnetic energy developed by the use
of larger bars of iron (a fact indeed which it was reasonable
to expect). is quite satisfactory in all-the comparative experi-
ments. The long wire St ii, by the small apparatus was made
to lift between 326 and 389 grains, being the highest effect
produced on: it
