These were close
together, but six or sevyen miles from the first, while only one was in the open air at
Dx Torr's, seventeen miles further on, according to the map. The intervening ground
is covered with brushwood and heath, similar to that on the floats about Tiger
Berg, excepting a few cultivated patches of small extent. The people, surprised by the presence of an imposing spectacle, the nature of which
they could not well comprehend, would naturally follow up alone and without further
consideration whatever first caught, the eye, and this is supported by the fact of
several portions being discovered at comparatively short distances from the witnesses,
but unseen at the time of explosion. I may also remark, that beyond Dx Torr's
house for a considerable distance in the direction of the line of flight, there is nothing
but rugged mountain, without, I believe, inhabitants. It appears that the portion which sunk in the moist ground near Vay Heerex's
is the one which gave rise to the exaggerated statement made 'to me, * of "a piece
having made a hole in the ground large enough to admit a table.‚Äù

Kizvier declares in his affidavit, that the piece he picked up was originally seven
or eight pounds weight.
