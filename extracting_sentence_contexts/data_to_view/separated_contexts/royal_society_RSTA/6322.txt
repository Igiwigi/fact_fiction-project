Overall, we find a similar trend for all depicted
wavenumbers: the RPA (dotted green) underestimates the static limit of F(q,0) = S(q) but exhibits
the correct qualitative decay with respect to t. The combination of our new single-particle
model for the imaginary-time diffusion and the exact static limit via equation (2.22) overall
fits even better to the PIMC reference data and captures the correct trends for all depicted
temperatures and wavenumbers. In fact, it becomes more accurate with increasing temperature,
which can be understood intuitively in the following way. As we have previously shown in
this work, equation (2.22) becomes exact in the limit of t > 0 with respect to both F(q,0) and
the slope at the origin. For higher temperatures, the imaginary-time propagation described in
ยง2d is carried out over a shorter distance in the t-domain.
