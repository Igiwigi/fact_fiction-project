the ammoniacal distillates as ‘urine’ (because of how it comes out of the alembic) or ‘lemon juice’
(because of its sharpness). Considering these processes, the Arab / Persian alchemist Jabir refers to
alchemy as a mesocosm or middle-world, which links understanding of the macrocosm (universe)
with the microcosm (humans) (cf. [23], p. 74). In experiments like this, ammonia and ammonium
were key to early experimental philosophy. As to the gold, even more caution is needed. In the


margin of one manuscript, one of al-Razi’s readers commented: ‘Truly I have looked into this
book ... Do not occupy yourself with them [the essences of Arsenic and Sulphur] unless you
already know the secret of the process ... Only if you know the secret, God willing, will you
accomplish the work’ (translated by Heym [24], p. 191).

In fact, it looks likely that earlier Greek alchemists were already familiar with ammonia and
ammonium salts. For example, characteristic steps from the al-Razi process given above can be
found in writings of the Greek alchemist Zosimus (e.g. [25], pp. 30-33; [26], pp. 486-492) and in
those attributed to Democritus (e.g. [27], p. $91; electronic supplementary material, §3). There is
also a question about the oldest name for sal ammoniac. The term niishadir appears earliest in its
Chinese rendering as nao sha, but has a well-established Iranian etymology, meaning ‘immortal
fire’ [12]. It is a name that matches just as well to the macrocosmic fire caves as to the processing

of ‘elements’ in the mesocosmic analysis of earlier Greek alchemy, leaving open the question of :3
