Tt was pointed out above that for a complete solution of any problem in plasticity it is
necessary to know the resistance to further distortion after any given total strain. Many
observations have been made of the load-extention curve over a large range of strains
and some have been made of the torque-angle curve for round rods. The connection
between the torque-angle curve for a rod and that for a tube is known,” in fact one may be
deduced from the other by purely mathematical processes. From the torque-angle
curve for a tube, the shear stress—shear curve can be obtained, but for a complete
analysis of plasticity the whole effect of the past strain history of an element of metal
would have to be known. This leads to such complexity that further progress is
impossible unless some simple generalisation can be made to give results of sufficient
accuracy for practical purposes.
