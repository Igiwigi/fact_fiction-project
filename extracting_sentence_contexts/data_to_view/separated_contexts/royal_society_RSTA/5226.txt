We define the ‘success rate’ as the ratio between the number of these
large responses and the number of perturbations applied to the system. In figure 8b, we show
the success rate obtained with 20ns long pulses whose average power is 300 \.W. The fact that
the number of responses increases abruptly from 20% to 100% demonstrates the presence of a
threshold separating different kinds of responses. The existence of a threshold separating linear from excitable responses is a necessary condition
for the system to be qualified as ‘excitable’. The second condition is that the excitable orbit should
be strongly attractive, such that any above-threshold perturbation leads to the same response.
