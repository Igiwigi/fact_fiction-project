But additional
morphological differences separate these families even from the Perophoridae. The epicardium has become the renal vesicle and the mesenchyme septum of the
test blood vessels has been lost. The large ventral stolonic vessel, in fact, no longer
exists. So that any process of budding among these families that there may be is by
the nature of the individual precluded from involving a post-abdomen, epicardial
epithelium or vascular septum. Budding, in fact, in the only family with that faculty
in the Stolidobranchiata is without doubt a re-acquirement and is markedly different
from any of those methods so far described.
