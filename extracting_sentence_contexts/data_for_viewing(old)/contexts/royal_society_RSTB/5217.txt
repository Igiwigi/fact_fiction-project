presumably, digested intracellularly. In the ciliary feeding Lamellibranchs this localisa-
tion of the absorptive surface is compensated for by the presence of the phagocytes in the
lumen and epithelium of all regions of the gut, but this is not the case in the Septibranchs.

The reason why such comparatively large particles as blood corpuscles pass into the
digestive diverticula of the Septibranchs but not into those of the other Lamellibranchs
(with the exception of Teredo) is clearly due to the absence of phagocytes in the gut and
in the ducts of the diverticula, which could ingest them prior to their entrance into the
tubules, and to the exceptionally short and wide ducts which lead from the stomach
into the digestive diverticula.

As is well known, the tissues of the Lamellibranchs are normally exceptionally rich in
glycogen, a fact which has been recorded by many investigators (see especially RussELL
(1923) ), and there is no doubt as to the primary importance of this reserve food sub-
stance in the metabolism of these animals. In previous work on Ostrea (19268) attention
was drawn to this fact and to the striking degree to which the digestive processes are
specialised for dealing with carbohydrate food. In the Septibranchs, however, the food
is not predominantly carbohydrate ; on the contrary, it must be largely protein, and the
special digestive mechanism for dealing with carbohydrates provided in the style is much
reduced. It would, therefore, appear probable that glycogen is not stored to any great
extent in the Septibranchs. In order to obtain some evidence on this point, one freshly
caught specimen of C. obesa was fixed in Carnoy’s fluid and sections prepared which were
treated with the Langhan’s iodine method. No indication of the presence of glycogen
was found in any of the sections. Thus we have evidence of an alteration in the
metabolism of the Septibranchs consequent on their assumption of a carnivorous diet.
