Thus we have
(12)=[12] [6] [4] [3], the numbers in | |] being all the factors, the number itself
included, and as well composite as prime, of the number in ( ), the factors 2 and 1
being however excluded. 'To make this clearer, it may be remarked that the last-men-
tioned equation has the geometrical signification that the relation for a dodecagon is
the aggregate of the relations for a proper dodecagon, a proper hexagon, a quadrangle,
and a triangle; that is, the relation for a dodecagon implies one or other of the last-
mentioned relations. 'The relations for the several polygons up to the enneagon are in
the memoir obtained in a form which puts in evidence the property in question, that is,
the series of equations :

(8)=[8] [4]

(9)=[9] [3]. To do this, the discriminant is represented, not as above in terms of the constants
B, y, 3, but in a somewhat different form, by means of the constants 6, c, d, the last two

whereof are 8uch that e=0 is the relation for the triangle, d=0 the relation for the
quadrangle ; thus [3]=e, [4]=d, and for the particular cases considered, the analytical
theorem consists herein, that c is a factor of (6), and of (9), and that d is a factor of (8). T have, for the sake of homogeneity, introduced into the formulz the quantity @ (=1),
but this is a matter of form only,

The functions [3], [4], &c. have been spoken of as prime; they are 0, in fact, as far
as they are calculated ; and that they are 80 in general rests on the assumption that for
a polygon of a given number of sides, there is but one form of relation: if, for instance,
in the equation [12]=0, which is the condition for a proper dodecagon, the function
[12] could be decomposed into rational factors; then equating each of these factors to
Zero, we should have 80 many distinct forms of relation for a proper dodecagon. T

elieve that the assumption and reasoning are valid; but without entering further into

is, I take it for granted that in the general case the functions [3], [4], &e. are in fact

rime. But the coefficients Ã¾, y, 3, or 6, c, d, instead of being 80 many independent
Sibitrary quantities, may be given as rational functions of other quantities (if, for
Instance, the two conics are circles, radii R, r, and distance between the centres a, then
8, y, 3 will be functions of R, r, @): and it is in a case of this kind quite conceivable that
He functions [3], [4], &c., considered as functions of these new elements, should cease
EN be prime functions.
