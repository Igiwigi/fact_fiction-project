These data are further analysed in
Table XI, in which the average head-and-body length, and the range of variation,
within each group are shown. On comparing these values with those given above for the
male, it is seen that, in the female, puberty and physical maturity both occur at a head-
and-body length about 5-0.cm. greater than in that sex. This is due to the fact that the
adult female is a larger animal than the male, as is shown by fig. 25, in which the size
frequencies for each sex are plotted separately. If the sexes grow at the same rate the
female must be older than the male on reaching puberty, whereas, if puberty is reached
at the same age in both sexes, the female must grow more rapidly.
