upon experimental collapse of the lung. In relation to the silver nitrate method, the
difficulty of this school is to explain away the appearance of non-nucleated plates. Having
done so (Miller, 1937, pp. 59, 66) they are faced with a far more serious difficulty. The
number of nuclei in the normal alveolar septum is not sufficient to provide the highly
cellular epithelium which Miller illustrates (1937). Josselyn (1935) had already called
attention to the fact that nuclei, other than those of endothelial cells, ‘are so few in number
in most cases that they appear quite incidental’. This aspect is considered in detail in the
next section.

Nuclear counts of the alveolar septum of the adult rabbit

In thick sections of the lung where it is possible to study the whole extent of an alveolar
septum, it is a striking fact that the distribution of nuclei is not regular. In material of
which the capillary bed has been injected by weakly coloured carmine-gelatin, and subse-
quently counterstained by haematoxylin, surprisingly large areas are devoid of any nuclei
whatever (see figure 33).

Assuming that the capillary bed of the alveolus is invested by endothelial cells, it should
be possible to discover the size of these cells by counting endothelial nuclei in measured
areas of the septum in which the capillary bed has been defined. It should also be possible
to discover whether the total number of nuclei is sufficient to provide a complete investment
for the capillary bed and also to provide epithelium for both surfaces of the alveolar septum.
By excluding leucocytes and by identifying nuclei of endothelial cells and alveolar phago-
cytes, the remaining nuclei could be regarded as belonging to epithelium. No such nuclei
were found.
