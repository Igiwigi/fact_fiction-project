effect than just the boundaries between the oxide, published recently. ,
When you oxidize the stainless steel, we found out that even if you start
with a single crystal of stainless steel, then the oxidation process itself is
causing lateral heterogeneity in the amount of oxide. So the process,
we believe, is first you oxidize the step edges, because of the low
coordination of atoms at the step edge, so you nucleate the chromium
at the step edge, and then the chromium from the terrace will diffuse
to the step edge to conglomerate and grow the oxide. So there will be
a depletion of chromium at the terraces, and that’s done even in air.
So you end up with a surface that has, not only oxide grains, but has
regions that have more chromium than others, and then this becomes
the main feature triggering the localized corrosion. So, it’s not so much
just the boundary between the oxides, but it’s the fact that you have
areas with lower chromium content, and this is an inherent process to
the oxidation. To summarize, there will be two specific locations for
initiation of localized corrosion—one will be the grain boundaries if you
have grains of oxides of the same composition, but if you have lateral
heterogeneities in composition of the oxide, this will become the most
important parameter.

Question7

Mary Ryan I just have one historical comment. I think you mentioned Faraday.
The very first papers on passivity were written by Faraday. There’s a
beautiful paper from 1836 in Phil. Mag. where they talk about the skin
