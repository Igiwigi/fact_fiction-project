Martial pyrites is, therefore, the only substance deposited on
bodies immersed in the water of Diss Mere; and the copper of
the crust, formed on the wire and cuttings, was furnished by
those bodies.

It is proved by the analysis, that the water of Diss Mere does
not hold in solution any sulphur, and scarcely any iron ; it has
not, therefore, been concerned in forming the pyrites; but it
appears to me, that the pyritical matter is formed in the mud
and filth of the Mere; for Mr. Wistman says in his letter, that
« the Mere has received the silt of the streets for ages.” Now
it is a well known fact, that sulphur is continually formed, or
rather liberated, from putrefying animal and vegetable matter,
in common sewers, public ditches, houses of office, &c. &c.;
and this most probably has been the case at-Diss. Moreover,
If sulphur, thus formed, should meet with silver, copper, or
iron, it will combine with them, unless the latter should be pre-
viously oxidated.

The sulphur has therefore, in the present case, met with
iron, in, or approaching, the metallic state; and has formed Py-
rites; which (whilst in a minutely divided state, or progres-
