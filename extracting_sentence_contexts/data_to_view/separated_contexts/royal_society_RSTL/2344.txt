Place a rod of iron heated white hot opposite either end of the needle, apply
either pole of a horseshoe magnet to the other end of the iron, and the devia-
tion of the needle both by attraction and repulsion will be found to be greatest
when the rod reaches a red heat, and will continue to diminish as the rod
cools. From this experiment it is obvious that iron at a red heat conducts
the magnetic influence better than when cold. Though this experiment bears
some resemblance to those of Mr. BarLow, yet, as far as I know, the fact has
not been previously obseryed; and it affords us another striking analogy
between the electric and magnetic influences.
