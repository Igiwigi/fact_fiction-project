oil and free oil-globules.

In injecting the livers of fish it is necessary to dilate the injecting fluid with weak
$pirit, or jt will not penetrate to the finest branches. Often the particles of the
injection accumulate in 80me of the finer ducts, forming what appears to be a rounded
and slightly dilated extremity, for the further continuity of the tube cannot in all
cases be 8een. Indeed $0 perfect is the resemblance, that it is only by examining
numerous different specimens that one becomes convinced of the fallacy.

In all four classes of vertebrata, I have seen both in injected, and also in aninjected
specimens, the communications between the finest ducts and the cell-containing net-
work. Of the nature of this continuity there can, I think, be no doubt. I cannot
conceive any other explanation of the facts I have observed, or of the appearances I
have copied from my preparations. The observations upon uninjected specimens,
Shown in Plate XV. figs. 18, 20 & 21, were made in 1854, many months before I had
sncceeded in injecting the ducts,

In all vertebrate animals which I have examined, the duct becomes nmuch narrowed
Jjust before it becomes continuous with the tubes of the network in which the secret-
ing cells lie. The arrangement of the most minute ducts varies s0mewhat in different
animals, as has been described. In some they form a network of very narrow tubes,
continuous with those in which the liver-cells are contained; in others these com-
munications are excessively few in number; while in some, I do not think they exist
at all. But I would not express myself positively upon this point, for I feel persnaded
that in the most perfect injection which I have yet made, the minute ducts have not
