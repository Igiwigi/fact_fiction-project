Introductory Remarks.

Is my former paper, which treated of the structure and development, of the skull in the
Ostrich-tribe#, I proposed to write a series of 8wch papers on the skull of the Verte-
brata, and that the first of these should be confined to that of the Common Fowl.

This Bird is selected for several reasons, the first, of which is the readiness with which
it may be obtained ; but, as far as science is concerned, a till more important reason
les in the fact that it not only forms a good halfway subject between the Ostrich and
the Singing-bird, but, in a wider survey, it serves as an excellent stand-point from which
to look backward to the Fish, and forward to the higher Mammalian forms.

The present paper is much more special than the last, which treated of the skull of
several kinds of Struthious Birds, in just as many stages as I was able to obtain: this
time an essay has been made to describe, step by step, the whole process of growth of
the skull, face, and sense-capsules from the fourth day of incubation to extreme old age.

My reason for not deseribing the earliest stages is, that I find it done to hand
already ; and although I have repeatedly verified the observations of other authors on
the primary condition of these parts, yet I have nothing more to add to what is already
known. The latest and best description that I have seen of the primordial condition of
