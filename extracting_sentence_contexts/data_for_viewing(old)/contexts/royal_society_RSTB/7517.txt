of intersection. At 135° the ratio of their dimensions becomes approximately 3 to 1, and at
160° about 8 to 1. However, an improved method of presenting the information supplied
by plastochrone ratios is suggested in the following section and for nearly all purposes it is
much preferable to take advantage of this, giving the contact parastichies where desired as
additional data relating to primordial shape. Should more accurate information on this
matter be required, other methods of conveying it will naturally be used.

3. A SIMPLIFIED DESCRIPTIVE METHOD FOR FIBONACCI SYSTEMS

The primary requisites in defining a uniform phyllotaxis system, as seen at the apex by
means of transverse sections, are then the two parameters divergence angle and plasto-
chrone ratio. The first presents no difficulty; it has long been associated with phyllotaxis
classification, and the fact that the genetic spiral and with it the divergence angle are
recognized as abstractions from phyllotaxis theory (and therefore secondary phenomena)
in no way detracts from its value as a constant for defining the various systems. Experi-
mental evidence has accumulated (Snow & Snow 1931, 1933; Wardlaw 1949, etc.) in-
dicating that the characteristic divergence angle must derive from the fact that a new
primordium is in the main positioned tangentially by those primordia near to it in pre-
ceding cycles or whorls, in such a manner that the angle between the two main determining
primordia tends to be divided in a particular and characteristic ratio. This is the primary
phenomenon and parameters for purposes of definition might be derived directly from it.
But in most phyllotaxis systems a single genetic spiral, with divergence angles scattered
round a definite mean value, is a consequence of this method of positioning; the mean
angle is thus a readily visualized, unequivocal and easily determined parameter providing
