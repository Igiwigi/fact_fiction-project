The influence which the will of the animal has over this lu-

traction and relaxation of the iris. When the animal is
alarmed or first disturbed, it naturally dilates the pupil, and
the eye glares; when it is appeased or composed, the pupil con-
tracts, and the light in the eye is no longer seen.

The most material information that has been gained in this
investigation, is the transparent state of the retina in the eye
during life; the opaque membranous appearance which it puts
on in the dead body not being natural to it, but a change which
takes place in consequence of death. This fact is almost all
that is necessary, to explain the luminous appearance in the
eyes of cats.

That neither Baron HALLER nor FoxTana had an adequate
idea of the transparency of the retina, will appear from the
following expressions respecting it, taken from their works :

HALLER describes it in the following words,

« Membranam crassam quidem, sed mollisimam, pellucidam
« utique, quando recens oculus inspicitur, ut per eam $ub aquis
