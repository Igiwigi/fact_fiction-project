that the dispersion is insufficient unless formed by a decomposition of the vapour
‘© along with the fuel, the oxidation of which is inhibited.

Tf the “ anti-knock ” acts in an oxidized state, as seems to have been proved by (1)
the above experiments on thallium and potassium, (2) those of Pipcron and
& Ecerront on the effect of lead tetraethyl on the induction period, and (3) the
fact that many oxidizable metals are ineffective, it must break reaction chains either
14 (1) by being peroxidized so that it removes oxygen from or adds on to the oxygen
of the active chain carrier ; or (2) by mutual destruction of two peroxides to form
5 oxygen and two lower oxygenated products ; or (3) by removing energy from the
8 active molecules which take part in the chain. Until more is known about the
actual chain carriers, the exact nature of the process will remain doubtfulf ; but
taking all facts into consideration, the first process is the most plausible. Besides
: stopping chains, these inhibitors also prevent the start of chains, and this is mainly
a surface effect.

PART V—DISCUSSION
By A. Ecerron, F.R.S.

The phenomenon of “ knock” is definitely a chemical one. Whether or not a
combustible mixture will give rise to a knocking type of explosion, depends on the
character of the chemical reactions which are taking place, not on the physical
