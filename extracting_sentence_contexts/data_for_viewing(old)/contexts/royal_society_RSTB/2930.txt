described and compared the gills of Pecten, Lima, Area, Modiolaria, Cardium and
Astarte. The study received a fresh impetus in 1888, and during the six years
1888 to 1893 many important contributions were made by PELSENEER, DAL, MENE-
GAuUX, Keiioac and JAanssens.* The first-named of these authors produced in 1892
that classification of the Lamellibranchia, based largely on their gill structure, which
has remained more or less in favour ever since, although in several of its details it
has ceased to command confidence.

In 1894 Daun (14, pp. 692-697) made the startling announcement that the gills of
Callocardia (a genus of the Eulamellibranchiate family Cyprinidee) and Huciroa
(a genus of the Verticordiidee) were of the Foliobranchiate type exemplified by Nucula,
or at least were intermediate between this and the Eulamellibranchiate type. This
fact, if true, threatened the very foundations of PeLsenrerâ€™s scheme of classifica-
tion, and pointed to the futility of any attempt to utilise the minute structure of the
gill as a taxonomic character.

The interest in the subject being now more keen than ever, Professor LANKESTER
