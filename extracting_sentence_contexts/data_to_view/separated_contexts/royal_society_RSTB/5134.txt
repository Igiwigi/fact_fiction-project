Tn Poromya, as shown in text-fig. 7, conditions are essentially the same. Owing to
the fact that the inhalant siphon (see text-fig. 4) has a wider opening, larger particles are
drawn in than in Cuspidaria. When the animal is sunk in the mud and the siphons are
functioning, the inhalant siphon does not project above the surface and its dorso-ventrally
compressed aperture is normally shut, owing to the coming together of the rounded lips. The exhalant siphon is much smaller, is round and protrudes slightly as a roundish papilla,
about 1 mm. in diameter.
