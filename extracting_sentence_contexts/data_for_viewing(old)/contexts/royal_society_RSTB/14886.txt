Py = ee if sy #0 (2.2)
and Py =H if sj = 0.

We use this formula similarly as above to define the Wright-
Fisher walk, which is also an irreducible, aperiodic, positive
recurrent and reversible discrete Markov chain converging
to a unique stationary distribution. Note that we use it for
all N and fitness values, but that it rigorously holds only
under the diffusion approximation, ie. under assumptions
of large population and weak selection. In fact, the complete
Wright-Fisher model is irreversible for large selection,
although this does not impact the steady-state distribution
of populations on fitness landscapes [36]. By contrast, the
Moran fixation probability is exact within the Moran process.

(b) Quantifying early adaptatio

To investigate early adaptation, and its dependence on popu-
lation size, we mainly focus on the height / of the walk, which
is the fitness of the first encountered peak [18]. It depends on
the initial node i, and also on what happens at each step of the
walk. We consider the average h of h over many walks and
