while the facts of output of spores per sporangium, and of structure of the sporangia
above stated, appear to me to add considerable weight to the evidence. I look upon
the Hymenophyllaceee as a blind line of descent characterised by specialisation of
both generations, which has taken the form of simplification ; and in both generations
Trichomanes shows the greater simplicity. Comparison of their sporangia, however,
and especially their spore-output, suggest that they were derived from some ancestry
with simultaneous sporangia.
