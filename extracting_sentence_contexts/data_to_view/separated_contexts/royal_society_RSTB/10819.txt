Such giant oil bodies have also been observed in drastically. Time course monitoring of the cells during oil
avocado and olive, which do not possess oleosin on their sur- body growth was studied in P. tricornutum [4] and F. solaris
faces [71]. These facts suggest that the oil bodies of F. solaris [81] by confocal laser scanning microscopy (figure 5).

StLDP was discovered through a sequence similarity search change (most were 0.1-0.3 wm in diameter, although a few
