is far more nearly constant than low or high water, under whateyer as8umed condi-
tions. A level surface drawn from any point (that is a surface of sfagnant water)
would probably be nearly parallel to the points of mean water at different places.
'This becomes more manifest when we consider that at places near each other the tide
often differs greatly in amount. At St. David's Head in Pembrokeshire the range of
the tides is near thirty feet ; on the opposite coast of Ireland it is only two or three :
if the sea were level at low water the difference of the mean heights on the two sides
of. the Channel (which is only about fifty miles) would be fourteen feet. Such an
average elevation of one side of a narrow sea above the other is quite inconsistent
with the laws of fluids.

I cannot conclude this paper without again pointing out that a great number of
curious facts in fluid motion are established by these Tide Researches, of which it
may be hoped the theory of hydrodynamics will one day be able to render a reason.
Why is it that at places near each other the range of the oscillations of the sea from
low to high water is 80 different ? Why is it that the sun affects the low water at Ply-
mouth more than the high water, and that the moon's declination at Singapore affects
the low water four times as much as the high water, while at Plymouth it affects it
less? Above all, why is it that while the effect of the sun, and of the moon's declina-
tion and parallax, in the monthly course of the tides, produces the effect due to the
equilibrium of the forces in one or two days, the moon's declination does not produce
its effect upon the diurnal oscillation till after three, four, five, and six days; and in
some cases probably not till the moon is exerting forces which tend absolJutely to re-
verse the effect ?
