The assumption concerning the tip sampling procedure has a
major influence on the divergence time estimates obtained
under BD models (figure 3). When fossils are not included in
the analysis, the root date is not affected much for the studied
dataset, but the estimates of the most recent divergence times
differ substantially. The effect is most clearly seen in the esti-
mated age of the split between the whale (Caperea) and the
dolphin (Tursiops), the most recent of all speciation events
(arrows in figure 3). If tips are assumed to represent a complete
sample of lineages, then the split is estimated to (all posterior

Adding fossils to the morphology tree did not change the

line with expectations based on the fossil record [8].
