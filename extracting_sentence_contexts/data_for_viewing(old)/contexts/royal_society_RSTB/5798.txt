fact that, in the Lupin at least, the centres of primordia do not arise in positions which
would not allow room for their stipules on each side. Moreover, ScHouTr’s assumptions,
apart from being inconsistent with the facts, are in any case unnecessary.

With regard to the above working hypothesis, it must be pointed out that the
necessary minimum width and minimum distance from the growing-point must both be
relative to the size of the stem apex. For in Lupin buds in which the stem apex is
small, the primordia are proportionately small, and also less far below the growing-point.
Furthermore, in the experiments the isolated pieces of tissue sometimes gave rise to
primordia that were considerably smaller than those that arose on the apex. These
facts indicate that there is in the plant a considerable regulation of the ratio of the size
of a new primordium to the size of the apex on which it arises—a ratio which plays an
important part in the writings of ScawENDENER, CuuRcH, and especially Van ITERsoN.

The conclusion reached in Section (5) of Part 2, that the primordia arise in the larger
gaps, was based on the behaviour of the third primordium after the isolated primordium
and on that of all the subsequent primordia. Their behaviour is explained in just the
same way on the working hypothesis (since the larger gaps here, as usually, were also
the farther from the growing-point), and the next task was therefore to consider how
the behaviour of the first and second primordia after the isolated primordium can be
explained. Although the explanation is not so simple and obvious as that of the
behaviour of the later-formed primordia, yet it is shown in Sections (7) to (13) of Part 2
that very probable explanations can be offered on the basis of the working hypothesis,
