the modification of the density of states can be qualitatively understood by the very intuitive
picture of Andreev bound states, as initially discovered by de Gennes & Saint-James [2,3] (despite
the fact that the terms Andreev reflection and Andreev bound state had not yet been coined at
the time). While the initial prediction of a sawtooth-like density of states for a highly idealized
ballistic system with specularly reflecting interfaces [2,3] was not confirmed by experiment [4,5],
the concept of Andreev bound states has proved to be extremely useful. Subgap Andreev bound
states result from the interplay of the intrinsic phase shift of Andreev reflection and additional
phase shifts, which can have different origin, and, consequently, Andreev bound states can occur
in many different physical systems.
