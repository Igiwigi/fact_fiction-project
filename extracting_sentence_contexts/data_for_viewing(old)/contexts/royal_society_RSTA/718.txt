trajectories converge rapidly to this region. (Online version in colour.)

is turned off). Once the dynamics converges, it is sufficient to use the asymptotic safe set to
control the trajectories. In figure 15, a partially controlled trajectory is displayed. The controls,
represented as yellow segments distributed along the trajectory, are applied every At = 1.2. We
show this fact with a zoom in figure 16. As a result, the trajectories never fall into the attractors
Ct or C~, keeping the dynamics in the chaotic region forever.

As we have mentioned, the safe set appears for values of At > 1.2, so it is possible to adapt
the control frequency to our specific requirements, taking other At values. Figure 17 shows the
asymptotic safe set for At = 1.8, and with & and up unchanged. With this set, we could control
