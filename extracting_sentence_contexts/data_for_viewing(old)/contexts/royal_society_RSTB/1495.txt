in the growth of some organism, with a view to ascertaining how far the variati
in size and relation of parts which occur in all animals may be caused by
external conditions, apart from such variations which arise from intrinsic differe:
in the germ. The animal chosen for this purpose was the larva or pluteus of th
sea-urchin, Strongylocentrotus lividus. These larvee have the merit of being ve
hardy, and they develop readily from artificial fertilisations without any speci
precautions being taken. Moreover, it was found that these artificial fertilisation
could be effected at all times of the year, irrespective of season. The chief objectio
to the choice of this animal lies in the fact that the growth of the larvee cannot
carried to the adult stage, so that it is only possible to measure the effect of enyiro
ment at a particular period in their development.
The plan of operations was very simple. About six or eight sea-urchins, whieh
as a rule, had been freshly obtained the same morning, were cut open, and pieces of
ovaries of each of the three or four female specimens shaken with forceps in a sm
jar of sea-water. Pieces of the testes were shaken in another jar, and the content
of the two jars mixed and stirred, the temperature being meanwhile noted, Aft
standing an hour portions of this water containing the artificially fertilised oy
were poured into glass jars containing 2 to 34 litres of sea-water. These jars wer
then transferred to a large glass tank, through which a stream of sea-water circulated
and were allowed to remain there throughout the whole period of developmen!
Evaporation was prevented by covering the jars with glass lids. As a rule, th
