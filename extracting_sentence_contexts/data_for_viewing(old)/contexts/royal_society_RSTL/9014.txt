hand, initiate putrefaction of what is dead, and, on the other hand, initiate febrile and

inflammatory processes in what is living.”

ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO PUTREFACTION AND INFECTION. 53

The latest investigation of Dr. KLz1x has reference to the intimate anatomy of enteric
fever. Tts distinctive feature is set forth in the following extract from the report upon
it by Mr. S1tox:—* The paper has its distinctive and very great interest in the fact
that it purports to describe for the firs time the contagium of enteric fever as some-
thing cognizable to the eye; in respect of certain multiplying microscopical forms,
apparently of the lowest vegetable life, which are found in innumerable 8warms in the
bowel-textures and bowel-discharges of the sick; penetrating from the former to diffuse
thronghout the patient's general system *, and teeming in the latter to represent, as this
view supposes, the possible germs of epidemic infection.”

As regards the medical profession, results like the foregoing and the interpretations
affixed to them, are simply revolutionary. They are, therefore, not likely to be
accepted without opposition. At a Meeting of the Pathological Society, held on the
6th of last April, the germ-theory of disease was formally introduced as a subject for
discussion, the debate being continued with great ability and earnestness at snbsequent
