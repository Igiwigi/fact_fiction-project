accelerate proportionately but rather to maintain a relatively unchanged ground speed in
winds up to 4 m./sec. (9 m.p.h.) or more. If they did maintain roughly the same ground
speed against such a range of wind speeds, the locusts must have adjusted their air speed
(speed of movement relative to the air) to the wind speed. Judging by the speed of wind
gusts which, suddenly meeting the locusts, carried them momentarily backwards, the
cruising air speeds of locusts flying against light winds varied between 2-5 and 4 m./sec.

The impression that low fliers were regulating their ground speed by adjusting their air
speed according to the wind speed, was strengthened by a further impression: that higher
fliers were not so adjusting their air speed, so that their ground speed was more closely
dependent on the wind speed. The fact that higher fliers appeared to be more easily slowed
down and even carried backwards than low fliers in the same gust, might, of course, be
attributed merely to the fact that the wind is stronger away from the frictional drag of the
ground. But higher fliers appeared also to surge forward more freely when the wind dropped,
which could not be explained in the same way, and suggested that they were actually

Amount of flying and height of flight. Low-flying migrants showed a clear tendency to
regulate the amount of flying they did and the height at which they flew, according to the
wind speed. Increase of wind speed to the point where down-wind orientation supervened
