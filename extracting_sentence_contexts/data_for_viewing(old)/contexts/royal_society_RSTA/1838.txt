with the fibre output gives peaks C and D. Peak C is from a red component generated in the non-
optimal pulse collapse. Peak D is the main result of this measurement—the cross correlation of
the visible resonant radiation peak with an unchirped reference pulse of known duration.

Using this method, the duration of the visible resonant radiation can be retrieved using
the known duration of the reference pulse and properties of the convolution of approximately
Gaussian pulses. We infer the visible peak to be as short as 39 fs, significantly shorter than the
80 fs input pulses used for this measurement.

The tilt of peaks C and D indicates that the fibre output has a small amount of chirp on
it. Interestingly, the curve through C and D traces the shape of the dispersion relation of the
fibre in which the resonant radiation is generated, reaffirming that the chirp on this fibre output
was mainly caused by propagation through excess fibre medium. Using the fact that resonant
radiation is created in an extremely small time window in an extreme pulse collapse, we can
predict that resonant radiation generated very close to the end of the fibre would be shorter
than 39 fs, closer to the bandwidth limited value. This potential for extremely short pulses makes
resonant radiation particularly appealing as a method of generating visible laser sources [33].
