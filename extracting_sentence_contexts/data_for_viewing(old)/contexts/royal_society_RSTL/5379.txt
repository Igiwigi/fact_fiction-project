But in particular cases the coefficients will be represented all of them by unaccen-
tuated letters, thus (@, b, c, dz, y)* will be used to denote aa*+3ba% +3cry*+dy*,
and (a, b, c, ®'{z, y)* will be used to denote az*+ba*y+cay*+dy*, and 80 in all
similar cases.

Applying the general methods to the quantic

(a, 20, ax, 9)",
we see that {1/0,}=ad,+2bd....+mbd,

{xd,} =mbd,+(m—1cd,.. +a'd,;
in fact, with these meanings of the symbols the quantic is reduced to zero by each of
the operations {y/0,}—y®., {xd,}—29, ; hence according to the definition any function
which is reduced to zero by each of the last-mentioned operations is a covariant of
the quantic. But in accordance with a preceding remark, the covariant may be con-
sidered as a rational and integral function, separately homogeneous in regard to the
facients (a, y) and the coefficients (a, b..#, a'). If instead of the single set (x, y)
the covariant contains the sets (1, 4), (x, ys), &Cc., then it must be reduced to zero
by each of the operations {y/0,} —Sy®,, {xd,} —Sad, (where Syd,=y,9, +y.0,+--),
but I shall principally attend to the case in which the covariant contains only the
Set (x, y).

Suppoxse, for shortness, that the quantic is represented by U, and let U,, U,.. be
what U becomes when the set (&, y) is successively replaced by the sets (a, y1),
