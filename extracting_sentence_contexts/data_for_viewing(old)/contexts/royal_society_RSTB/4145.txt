centres about the coefficient of oxidation of resting muscles.

In order to estimate the effect of functional activity upon oxidation, two obvious
courses present themselves—

(1) To measure the total oxidation actually taking place in the muscle.

(2) To measure excess of oxidation during the stimulation and post-stimulation
periods, over that which occurs in the resting muscle.

Whichever of these methods we tried we found that we had no certain base line
from which to work. It may here be well to anticipate what we are going to say
later’so far as to state two facts—

(1) That in common with all other observers we have found that the coefficient of
oxidation in resting muscle is very different in different muscles ; and

(2) That the increased oxidation caused by fifteen minutes’ stimulation such as we
have given may last for several hours, perhaps four or five.

Taking these facts together it seems quite probable that the oxidation which
observers have been accustomed to regard as that of resting muscle is largely the
after-effect of previous contractions, and in order to make any just estimate of
