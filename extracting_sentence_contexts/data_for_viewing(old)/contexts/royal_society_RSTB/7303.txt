(54) Results with grating test objects

Three grating test objects were prepared, one with red and white parallel lines, one with
blue-green and white parallel lines, and one with red and blue-green parallel lines. The
dimensions of the gratings, and of the lines which comprised them, were the same in each
case. All the lines were 4 mm. wide. The colours of the lines were such that when red and
blue-green ones were superimposed, e.g. by means of a double-image calcite glass prism, the
appearance to the eye was neutral grey. The distances were now determined at which each
of the gratings became colourless, with the results shown in table 49. The close proximity
of red lines with blue-green ones, which, owing to the strong contrast between these colours,
might be expected to increase the distance required for them to become colourless, has in
fact the opposite effect. In the case of the red and white, and blue-green and white gratings,
the reproduction of the distances of 300 and 350 m., respectively, was effected by means of
the micro-stimulating apparatus described in Part X. It should be pointed out that neither
the red and white lines, nor the blue-green and white lines, could be resolved into lines
by the eye at the distances stated; all that could be seen in either ease was a coloured
rectangle, which became colourless at the distances mentioned.
