become evident from a consideration of the volume of air breathed during the work
and the prevailing alveolar CO, pressure. We suggest, therefore, that this alteration
is, in the main at least, due to the fact that the energy output during the work
involves the metabolism of a greater proportion of carbohydrate to fat than is the case
during rest.

This idea is strengthened by the earlier experiments on Douenas during walking
exercise,* in which it was shown that rise of respiratory quotient could be detected at
rates of exercise so low as to demand only double the resting metabolism, though the
rise became greater as the rate of walking and the total metabolism increased, and
that moderate prolongation of the exercise did not lead to any striking alteration of
the respiratory quotient. It was tentatively suggested on these grounds, as well as
on the fact that examination of the alveolar air gave no indication of a persistent
lowered threshold value of CO, unless the pace of walking was very fast, that the
most probable explanation lay in the inereased proportion of carbohydrate to fat
consumed during the work. AmaAR,} using a bicycle ergometer, had previously
obtained very similar results and had reached the same conclusion. A number of
Benepicr and CatHoarrâ€™s experiments show a fairly considerable rise of respiratory
quotient during the work, with in some cases a tendency to diminution with prolonga-
tion of the exercise, though in a good many instances the respiratory quotient remains
just about the same during the work as it was during the preliminary resting period,
as was the case with Hopson in our experiments. The average of their experiments
shows that there is a distinct, though slight, rise of respiratory quotient during the
work, and in a full discussion of the significance of this change they incline strongly
to the view that it indicates an increase in the proportion of carbohydrate consumed,
