Frauxgoper's dark line F, and in the C line, when the prominence, as T have imagined,
has extended from the limb over the earth's side of the &mn.

The position of the bright band observed on the 8th of November isnear C, but slightly
less refrangible, not far from the place in the scale occupied by the last discovered red
line, the position of which as yet has not been micrometrically determined.

Other regions to which my attention has been particularly drawn from the first,
although up to the present time I have obtained no results, lie, one between the þ lines,
another between þ and F, another less refrangible than B, one near D, and another near G.

It is quite possible that these bright regions, the light of which is variable, may be
due to faculze; this conclusion is strengthened by the fact that diligent sweeping within
the limb has not revealed the bright lines of the chromosphere spectrum. If this be $0,
the faculz are not the prominences, although they may be possibly connected with them.

On the nature of the Chromosphere and Prominences.

It has already been concluded by M. JAnS8EN, from the coincidence of two of the
bright lines with C and F, that the prominences are composed of hydrogen.

So far as our present knowledge goes, however, this does not dispose of the other two
bright lines, the positions of which have been determined by myself: I allude to the
lines near D and near C.
