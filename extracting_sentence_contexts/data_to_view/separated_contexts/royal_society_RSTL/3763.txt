That water which is rendered ineffective by a little saline or acid matter
should till be able to show the effect of the film of oil (2121.) attached to it, is perfectly
consistent with this view. So als is the still more striking fact that alkalized water
(2092.) having no power of itself should deeply injure the power of olive oil or resin;
and hardly touch that of oil of turpentine (2121.), for the olive oil or resin would no
longer form a film over it but dissolve in it, on the contrary the oil of turpentine
would form its film.

2127. That resin should produce a strong effect and sulphur not is also satisfactory,
for I find resin in boiling hot water melts, and has the same effect on the balance
(2124.) as oil, though more slowly ; but sulphur has not this power, its point of fusion
being too high.

2128, It is very probable that when wood, glass, or even metal is rubbed by these
oily currents, the oil may be considered as rubbing not merely against wood, &c., but
water also, the water being now on the side of the thing rubbed.
