Since both classical and quantum models are able to generate deterministic functions, it
is clear that some restriction are necessary in order to understand the difference between classical
and quantum correlations. A natural candidate is the restriction on the amount of memory that
can be stored in the system. In fact, if the system is not able to ‘remember’, at a certain step s,
all previous inputs and outputs in the sequence, it will not be able to generate the corresponding
deterministic function associated with the sth step. We may, thus, identify ‘memory’ as a resource
needed to generate temporal correlations, and speak of the ‘memory cost’ of simulating temporal
quantum correlations with classical models. Of course, one can extend this idea and speak more
generally of the ‘memory cost’ of generating certain correlation with a given theory, e.g. in the
framework of GPTs, as discussed in [17].
