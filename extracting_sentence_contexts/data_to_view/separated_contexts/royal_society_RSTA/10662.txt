In some of the
Aphotographs a few bands of continuous spectrum are seen apparently without
corresponding brightenings of the green ring, but an examination of the other
photographs generally reveals the brightening in a lower reach of the corona. One
or two of the bands appear in places which correspond to the points on the sun’s
limb about 90° degrees from the points of second and third contact, and in these cases
the corresponding brightenings of the green ring are probably hidden by the moon
throughout the eclipse. These facts indicate that the action which produces a brightening of the green ring
also produces a brightening of the continuous spectrum, not only in the region where
the gaseous mass is rendered more luminous, but in the region immediately overlying
it. The continuous spectrum of the outer corona exhibits no definite structures in
