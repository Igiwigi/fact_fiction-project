The same holds when the level sets are
cylinders (due to the fact that in the complement of the set C the level sets of B intersecting the
boundary have a transverse intersection). Since the vector field X commutes with curlX it follows
that it is conjugated to a linear flow on each level set diffeomorphic to a torus. For the cylinder, all
orbits are periodic as an easy consequence of the Poincaré—Bendixon theorem and the fact that X
preserves the area form i* 12. | |

Remark 4.2. This proof also works to obtain the topology of the regular level sets in the four-
dimensional Euler equations studied in [15]. The way to obtain the closed and independent one-
forms is done as in [1].
