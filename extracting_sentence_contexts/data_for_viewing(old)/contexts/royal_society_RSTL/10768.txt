he bubble will increase, and the liquid in the manometer will become more depressed
Sintil the film is a hemisphere. Thereafter the pressure will diminish, and though V
Svill increase v will become less, If the radins of the manometer tube is such
Sthat the decrement dv is greater than the increment dV, an increase in the size of
Sthe bubble would necexsarily be attended with a decrease in the total volume of
enclosed air. Under these conditions the equilibrium would be unstable, and the
system would transform itself into a form in which the volume of the bubble was
8uch that dV+dv was positive. If the bubble were originally on the borders of
instability a 8mall change in 'T would produce a finite change in the position of the
liquid in the manometer, and thus the sensitiveness would be infinite. In the case of
the apparatus used by PLATEAU the whole phenomenon must have occurred within
narrow limits and would easily escape attention.
'The following table explains itself, and illustrates the fact that as the sagitta
increases V+v has 8uccessively a maximum and a minimum value.
