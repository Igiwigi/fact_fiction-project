Owing to the simplified nature of the Uranus simulations, and owing to the sparse
thermospheric constraints at present, a detailed model-data comparison is not warranted here. Instead, we emphasize the temperature variations shown in figure 6d. Despite the fact that the
thermospheric temperature profile is identical at all latitudes, retrieved H} temperatures vary by
greater than 35K, or roughly 5% of the mean temperature. This is simply understood as primarily
a SZA effect: at low SZAs the H} layer is lower in the ionosphere, probing the lower temperatures
there, whereas the reverse is true for high SZAs. This result is, again, not surprising; however, it
highlights two important points: (1) observed H} temperature variations do not necessarily imply
anything about the energetics of the thermosphere, and (2) these SZA effects should be accounted
for when interpreting measured temperature variabilities.
