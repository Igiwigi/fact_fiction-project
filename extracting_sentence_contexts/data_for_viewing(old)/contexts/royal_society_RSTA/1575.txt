(c) Small-world
In actual neural systems, there are anatomically complex and energetically expensive metabolic z
processes but functionally economic communication tendencies between neurons and neuronal :8
communities. In this context, small-world network (SWN) structure has been nominated to : s
represent this connectivity as a mixture of regular and random network topologies. This network : S
structure has a high clustering rate and low average path length, so it is regarded as a very {=
realistic model in terms of similarity to the anatomical and functional organization of the brain. : a
In addition, this structure supports the efficacy of signal transmission and synchronization : =
capability of the network elements. : =
Owing to the fact that SWN has a complex but economic structure, it is natural to ask if there [3
is a favourable complexity level or what is its impact on signal processing in neuron populations. :2
Following this motivation, Ozer et al. examined the SR phenomenon in the Newmanâ€”Watts SWN : 8
and showed that at a certain degree of small-worldness provided by an optimal amount of new if
link addition, an adequate noise level can induce emergence of SR across the whole network. : S
This implies that local periodic driving, i.e. subthreshold signal applied to a single neuron in the : Ss
network, can be transmitted through the whole network in a maximal correlation with overall : Ss
electrical activity [60]. Furthermore, they determined the randomness parameter of SWN, the 1a

coupling strength and the driving frequency of the pacemaker as the main actors of signal
transmission, and found by measuring Q values of entire network activity that there is also an
optimal level for each parameter to obtain the best SR performance.
