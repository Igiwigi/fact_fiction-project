A related worry is the potential for unilateral or even clandestine deployment
of stratospheric SRM [50-52]. Regarding the international political dynamics surrounding SRM
deployment, some have argued that SRM cannot be aligned with democratic governance and
cannot become a ‘governable object’ [53,54]. Others have pointed out that SRM might in fact fit
well with the current international political order, in which authority is increasingly centralized
for technocratic problem solving in institutions of global governance, and that critiques of SRM
often seem to be more concerned with the changes it might prevent than with the changes it might
introduce [55-57]. In the absence of strong governmental positions, the strongest positions on governance come
from within the research community itself. It should not be inferred that the research community
is united.
