of redundant interactions in the brain-heart network associated with SAHS and their recovery
with CPAP. This was documented by the interactions between each of the 6, a and B waves
and the other brain waves when predicting the cardiac activity (figure 3), and between the
cardiac dynamics and the brain dynamics when predicting the 5 wave activity (figure 5), that
were significantly positive for the controls (indicating redundant cooperation), non-significant
for the SAHS group (indicating statistical independence), and again significantly positive for
the CPAP group. These results suggest that redundancy is a prevailing feature of correctly
working brain-heart networks, and its loss during SAs generates a kind of segregation of the
network nodes which are still transferring information to each other but perform this task
in isolation.

Limitations of this work regarding the study design include the small size of the considered
group of patients, the fact that patients and controls, though being matched in almost all
demographic parameters, differed in the body mass index [38], and the highly variable duration : =

of the CPAP treatment. Combined with the small population size, the different time at which Sy
follow-up measurements were taken may have an impact on the interpretation of our results. 2
Nevertheless, because the CPAP therapy was prolonged up to the achievement of beneficial aed
effects in terms of sleep efficiency, duration and quality, its different duration was unavoidable 22
and in some sense purposeful to the formation of a group of treated patients for which therapy : 8
was really effective [38]. Given the size and characteristics of our group of patients, our results DNS
should be confirmed by larger population studies in which they can be tested also across the : z
duration of long-term treatments. ig

Methodologically, the linear parametric approach adopted in this work guarantees the full
