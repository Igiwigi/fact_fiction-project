of the same size throughout, while those contained in the same ovale correspond
exactly, which would not be the case if each granule were dividing into two or more.
That the granules are not produced by the germinal vyesicle is evident from its re-
maining very much of the same size and perfectly entire.

On the other hand, the reasons for supposing them to be formed from the walls of
the ovary are, that the granules become more and more numerous as the oyule
passes down the tube. Secondly, that the granules (Plate XXVIII. figs. 48, 51 c)
exactly resemble in size, colour and form, those produced by the internal surface of
the ovary (Plate XXVII. fig. 41 k). Lastly, because the striz (fig. 41 7) of the ovary
cease just where the ovule ceases to become larger (fig. 42 kh).

The fact that the ovula were packed edgewise in this part of the tube (Plate XXVIII.
fig. 49 c) was pointed out to me by Dr. ALLEN TaomsoN ; also that three or four occu-
pied the same plane (fig. 50d). Hence the necessity of the oyula assuming the tri-
angular form (Plate XXVII. fig. 47); the only form met with as long as the ovyula
present the appearance of a dense opake mass (Plate XXVIII. fig. 49).

The ovary is about +45th of an inch broad at its widest part ; and here it is that we
find the ovula packed generally four on a plane (fig. 50 d), with their edges present-
ing externally (fig. 49d), appearing long and narrow when viewed in profile (fig. 49c),
but broad and triangular when seen in front (fig. 49 6), entirely filling the transverse
section of the tube (fig. 50).

As the granules increase in number s0 the clear snbstance becomes more and more
