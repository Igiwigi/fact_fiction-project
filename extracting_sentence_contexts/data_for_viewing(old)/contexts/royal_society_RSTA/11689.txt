on this head is equally applicable to the étalons. The covering by cemented cover
glasses, at first looked at by the author somewhat suspiciously, proves on closer
acquaintance with high-power microscope work to present no difficulty whatever, or
to introduce any error in actual practice, as “ critical” illumination is always achieved
with great perfection in the instrument described in the last communication.

The second difficulty is only one of degree, and of the perfection of attainment of
the constant temperature of 62° F, with the electric thermostat; that is, the fact that
the rulings now being employed are on speculum metal. When further experience of
these rulings has been gained, however, the author feels convinced that we shall be
able to obtain them almost equally satisfactorily on highly polished platinum-iridium,
and, therefore, assuming the first difficulty overcome, directly on the bar itself.
Gold and invar are not so promising, the former being apparently too soft and the
latter too hard.

In conclusion, it may be stated that the author’s location signal, of five Grayson
rulings on the 40,000-to-the-inch scale, as above described, and as shown in fig. 13
under the ;;-inch power, makes a splendid defining line under the 3-inch power
employed in observing the Benoit or other coarser ordinary defining marks on standard
line-bars. This power is insufficient to resolve the five lines, so that they appear as a
