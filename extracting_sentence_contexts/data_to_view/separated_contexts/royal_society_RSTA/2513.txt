However, Hilbert’s original problem, as formulated in his notebook, is still a mystery. We have
no criteria for ‘simplicity’ of a proof. We have no methods to compare proofs, in fact, we do not
even know when two proofs are the same.? In that respect, proof theory is very different from most
other mathematical fields which usually can identify the objects of their interest. For example, in
group theory, two groups are the same if they are isomorphic, and in topology, two spaces are the
same if they are homeomorphic.
