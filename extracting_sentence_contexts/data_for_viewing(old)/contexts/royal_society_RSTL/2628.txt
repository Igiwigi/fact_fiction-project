But beſides removing; all doubts upon the congelation of quick-
filver, theſe obſervations tended to ſhew, within. certain limits,
the degree of cold neceflary for that effe&. It was evident that
the freezing point muſt be ſomewhere above 70”, becauſe the
thermometers graduation reached only ſo. low, and yet ſome
part of the mercury always congealed in the tube ; and as the
