likelihood that they could still be shocked following devalua-
tion and having intact knowledge of the contingency

structure of the task. Like obsessions in OCD, these irrational
threat beliefs were discordant with subjectsâ€™ knowledge of
the task structure. Although these data were collected in an
exploratory manner, they provide good early evidence in sup-
port of the suggestion that irrational thinking may sometimes
be a consequence of habit formation.

It may be surprising to some how irrational threat beliefs
such as these could survive without being promptly disconfir-
med through experience. However, the fact that compulsions
in OCD are avoidant, rather than appetitive, can readily
account for this. It is a feature of avoidance that performance
of this response naturally precludes the extinction of irrational
beliefs about contingency (e.g. fear), because when avoidance
responses are continually, but unnecessarily, performed, the
only demonstrable contingency the individual is exposed to
is one where a state of safety follows the performance of an
avoidance response. This prevents exposure to the crucial dis-
confirming case or extinction, i.e. when a state of safety is also
followed by no response [75]. In this way, the maladaptive
cycle of compulsions, obsessions and anxiety may be cyclically
maintained and reinforced, allowing for irrational fears to pro-
