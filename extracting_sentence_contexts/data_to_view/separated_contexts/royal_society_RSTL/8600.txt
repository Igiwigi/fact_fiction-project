RAY LANKESTER. ON THE

This and certain relations of bulk in the early-deyeloped organs of the various embryos
considered, determine the deyelopment either by inyagination or by delamination. The
relation of bulk to the process of inyagination I may illustrate from a fact established
in the preceding contributions. In Loligo * the large otocysts each deyelop by a well-
marked inyagination of the epiblast forming a deep pit, which becomes the cavity of
the cyst. In Aplysia the gmaller otocysts each deyelop by a simple yacuolation of the
epiblast without invagination.
