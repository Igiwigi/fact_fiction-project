Alternate yellow and black strips, and alternate blue and white strips, both retain their
colours at smaller visual angles than do alternate yellow and blue strips of the same width
and length. The hypothesis is unable to offer any explanation of this fact.

In several other ways this hypothesis fails to account for observed facts, and must there-
fore be abandoned.

(78) The rod vision hypothesis

It is well known that rod vision replaces cone vision at low intensities of illumination;
according to this hypothesis this replacement is responsible for the losses of colour which
are observed with reduction of visual angle. Four facts are at variance with this view:

(1) The fovea, which was exclusively used in these experiments, is usually accepted to
be devoid of rods.

(2) Except for the experiments performed at low intensities of illumination, the observerâ€™s
eye was fully light-adapted, which would automatically exclude the use of rod vision.

(3) This hypothesis offers no explanation of the changes of colour that are observed in
the following cases: yellow-green to pale blue-green; green to blue-green; purple to brown;
mauve to red-brown; crimson to orange.

(4) Wright found that the luminosity curve at a visual angle of 20 min. of arc was of
