sublimate, and gas was disengaged, On tin foil and zinc it
exerted no action ; it had no action on sulphur, nor on resin.
In their alcoholic s0lutions it disappeared as in pure alcohol.
It detonated most violently when thrown into a solution of
phosphorus in ether, or in alcohol. Phosphorus introduced
into ether, into which a globule of the substance had been put
immediately before, produced no effect. In muriatic acid it
gave off gas rapidly, and disappeared without explosion. On
dilute sulphuric acid it exerted no violent action, It immedi- |
ately Cisappeared without explosion in LiBavivs's liquor, to
which it imparted a yellow tinge.

It seems probable, from the general tenor of these facts,
that the new substance is a compound of azote and chlorine;
the same as, or analogous to, that mentioned in the letter
from Paris. It is easy to explain its production in our experi-
ments: the hydrogen of the ammonia may be conceived
to combine with one portion of the chlorine to form muriatic
acid, and the azote to unite with another portion of chlorine
to form the new compound. The heat and light produced
during its expansion into gaseous matter, supposing it to be
composed of azote and chlorine, is without any parallelinstance,
in our present collection of chemical facts ; the decomposition
of euchlorine, which has been compared to it, is merely an
expansion of matter already gaseous. The heat and light pro-
