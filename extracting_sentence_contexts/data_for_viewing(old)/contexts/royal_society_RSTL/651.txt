rian, the expression for the relative quantity of light becomes

E2 to 1223 or as 332 to 224, being nearly as g to 2.

In the first experiment, the advantages of polish were, per-
haps, on the side of the Cassegrainian telescope ; in the last,
Q they were much in favour of the Gregorian; a mean therefore
v of both results may probably be considered as approaching
= the truth, and the light of a telescope of the Cassegrainian
S construction, may be taken, to that of a Gregorian of the same

J aperture and power, as about 60 to 33.
S A fact so new, naturally leads the mind to hazard a conjec-
= ture as to the cause. In the Gregorian telescope a column
= of light from a point of the object, is received on the large
E. mirror, and reflected in a cone of rays, the vertex of which is
bo its focus, where an image is formed. Here all these rays
Z meet in a single poznt, and crossing each other, fall on the
> small concave. mirror whence they are again reflected, and
E> form another image near the eye. Now, if light be supposed
S to consist of particles of matter, is it not possible that these
= : particles, crossing in the same point, may interfere with each
= other? or, when thus forced within a certain distance of each
= other, may not a power of repulsion exist, which would occa-
bf= sion many of them to be dissipated? In the Cassegrainian
