Some-
times they occurred during exposure of the aneroids to atmospheric pressure. Unless
a discontinuous change were of a size considerably larger than â€˜01 of an inch it
would be difficult to demonstrate its existence. It is quite possible, in fact, that all
the changes in the experimental aneroids were discontinuous. There is certainly
no clear indication of a general tendency in the zeros of these aneroids to alter in a
definite direction with age. The fact that discontinuous changes may not unlikely
arise from time to time in the zero of an aneroid, shows the absolute necessity of
periodic comparisons with a mercury barometer.
