is the difficulty of determining an asymptotic formula for the solving function K, (s, ¢),
when J is negative and numerically large. At the commencement of the third section
a formula of this kind is obtained which makes it possible to apply the theorem to
what I have called canonical Sturm-Liouville series (III, § 20). The latter portion
of the section is devoted to this application. The results obtained are extended so as
to apply to the most general form of Sturm-Liouville series. The fourth, and
remaining, section is given up to a discussion of questions of convergence. It is here
that the properties of orthogonal functions, proved in the latter half of the second
section, find their application.

In conclusion, I may say that in later memoirs I hope to further develop the ideas
which have here been made use of. With such modifications as are necessary from
the fact that the characteristic function is no longer limited, I hope especially to apply
them to expansions in LEGENDRe’s and in BessEt’s functions.

I.—Tue THEOREMS OF CONVERGENCE.

§ 1. In the following pages we shall find it necessary to make frequent use of two
theorems of convergence. These properly belong to the general theory of series (or
