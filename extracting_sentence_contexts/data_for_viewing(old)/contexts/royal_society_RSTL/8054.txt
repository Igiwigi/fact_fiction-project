ment of the gills we can hardly doubt that, when the fish is in water of normal compo-
sition, and sufficiently pure to yield the necessary supply of oxygen, these organs are suffi-
cient for the purpose of breathing, that the respiratory function rests with them alone,
and that the Jung receives arterial blood, returning venous blood, like all the other organs
of the body. But when the fish is compelled to sojourn in thick muddy water charged
with gases which are the product of decomposing organic matter (and this must be the
case very frequently during the droughts which annually exhaust the creeks of tropical
Australia), it commences to breathe air with its lung in the way indicated above. Under
this condition the pulmonary vein carries purely arterial blood to the heart, where it is
mixed with venous blood and distributed to the various organs of the body. If the
medium in which the fish happens to be is perfectly unfit for breathing, the gills cease
to have any function ; if only in a less degree, the gills may still continue to assist in
respiration. Ceratodus, in fact, can breathe by either gills or lungs alone, or by both
sImultaneously.

It is not, probable that this fish lives freely out of the water, the limbs being much
too flexible for supporting the heavy and unwieldy body, and too feeble generally to be
of much use in locomotion on land. However, it is quite possible that it is occasionally
compelled to leave the water, although I do not believe that it can exist without it in a
lively condition for any length of time.
