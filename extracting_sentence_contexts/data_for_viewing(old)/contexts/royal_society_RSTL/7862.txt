1868, considerable stress is laid upon the fact that the same rays are absorbed by the
nitrite of amyl in the liquid and in the yaporous state. A layer of the liquid not more
than one-eighth of an inch in thickness was found competent to withdraw from a powerful
beam all the constituents which could effect the decomposition of its vapour. The action.
of the nitrite resembles in this respect that of the sulphate of quinine on the rays which

cause it to fluoresce. Both substances quench the effectual rays close to the surface at
which they enter.

I endeavoured at the time to apply this fact to the solution of the question whether
the absorption of chemical energy was the act of the molecule as a whole, or of its
constituent, atoms. T tried to show that on the first of these assumptions it is impossible
for the self-same rays to be absorbed by a liquid and its vapour. For absorption depends
upon the rate of molecular vibration, and reaches its maximum when this rate synchro-
nizes perfectly with the rate of snccession of the ethereal wayes. Now as the rate of
molecular yibration depends upon the elastic forces exerted between the molecules, and
as it could hardly be imagined that these forces would remain undisturbed during the
passage of a vapour to the liquid condition, the fact of the liquid nitrite of amyl and
its vapour absorbing the same rays indicated that the absorption was not molecular.
We were thus driven to conclude that it was atomic* ; and this conclusion was fortified
by the consideration already adverted to,â€”that were the absorption the act of the mole-
cule as a whole, no mechanical ground could be assigned for the falling asunder of its
