pigments, but of coloured light rays: ‘It is certain that the perfect sensations of yellow and
of blue are produced by mixtures of red and green and of green and violet light respectively,
and there is reason to suspect that those sensations are always compounded of the separate
sensations combined; at least, this supposition simplifies the theory of colours: it may,

therefore, be adopted with advantage, until it may be found inconsistent with any of the
phenomena; and we may consider white light as composed of a mixture of red, green and
violet only....’ This theory remained unassailed for nearly eighty years, when Hering
(1876) advanced his famous rival hypothesis, of ‘the six opponent colours’: white-black,
red-green and yellow-blue. Omitting details and disregarding the fact that white and black
were regarded as separate sensations, this hypothesis was the first to advance a claim for
four primary colours: red, yellow, green and blue, as opposed to the triad suggested by
Thomas Young.

From that moment physiologists took sides: some were in favour of Young’s theory,
while others preferred Hering’s theory. It was not long before a fierce contest began, which
was destined to continue for many years; a contest which did much good, for it stimulated
research in the field of vision. Asa result, alternative theories began to make an appearance,
coupled with such famous names as Donders (1881), Ladd-Franklin (1893) and McDougall
(1901).

But, meanwhile, in 1893, a theory of a very different character made its first appearance,
