perhaps the commonest Conifer in the sub-tropics.

But the commonness of a species in a given place at any previous period will mainly
depend upon its age. There is no evidence that local species are specially adapted
to local conditions.

Having reached the maximum height that it is going to reach, a species will
ultimately descend, and will sooner or later be extinguished, though there is no
evidence that as yet many, or any, species are on the downward road. These
disappearances of species will tend to widen the gaps between the survivors, which
may also be widened by the superposition of mutations upon one another.

The bearing of the facts here brought up upon the hypothesis of geographical
distribution under mutation and without natural selection that I proposed some years
ago is then considered. They support very strongly the hypothesis that the whole

tree of descent of a family may exist on the earth at the present moment, and that
the area occupied is in general an indication of the age of the species or genus, if it
has not already attained its maximum.

The Menispermacee are taken as an example, as were the Dilleniacem, Tristichaceze,
and Podostemacez in previous papers, and it is suggested that the family is descended
