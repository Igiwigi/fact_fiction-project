Mary Lyon’. this idea would point out the fact that Tsix has not yet been expressed from

the maternal X when Xist becomes upregulated on the paternal but not the
maternal X at the onset of imprinted X-inactivation in preimplantation
embryos. Recent studies have demonstrated, however, that there is a promi-
genetics nent difference in the chromatin structure at the Xist locus depending on the
parental origin, which I suggest might account for the repression of maternal
Xist in the absence of maternal Tsix at the preimplantation stages.
