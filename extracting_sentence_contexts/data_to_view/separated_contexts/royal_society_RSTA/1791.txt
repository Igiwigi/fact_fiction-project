There is no, in principle, epistemic barrier to experiments with unmanipulable or inaccessible
target systems being externally valid. Experiments in contemporary science can and do allow
us to gain knowledge of unmanipulable and inaccessible target systems. We will argue that the
limits of experimental knowledge are in fact set by the mitigation of reasonable doubtâ€”that is, the
application of inductive strategies for internally and externally valid source-target inferences. When reasonable doubt has been partially mitigated, a theory can be said to be well supported,
and a scientist is justified to treat the empirical consequences of the theory as likely to be true, in
the relevant domain. When reasonable doubt has been almost entirely mitigated a theory can be
said to be established, and a scientist is justified to treat the empirical consequences of the theory as
true, in the relevant domain.
