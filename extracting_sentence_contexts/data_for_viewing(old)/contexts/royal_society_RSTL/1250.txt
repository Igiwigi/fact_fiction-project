It remains for me in concluding this paper, to, communicate
to the Society an interesting fact on the composition. of sea
water just discovered by Dr. WoLLasTon, and which it is no
small gratification to me to think that the present inquiry has
been the accidental means of bringing to light. As I was
beginning the chemical part of this investigation, Dr. Wor-

LASTON put the question to me, whether it was.not probable
that traces of potash might be found in sea water ? I answered
in the affirmative, and thought the fact well worthy of inves-

Doctor himself to put his own suggestion to the test of ex-
periment, I supplied him with sea water, and begged of him
to favour me with his results, which he has just communi-
cated to me in a note to the following effect :

Â« The expectation which I expressed to you that potash
would be found in sea water as an ingredient brought down
by rivers from the decay of land-plants, is now fully con-
firmed by experiments on waters obtained from situations 80
remote from each other as to establish its universality.
