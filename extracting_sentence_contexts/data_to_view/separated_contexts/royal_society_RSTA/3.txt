For example, in this regard, it is perfectly valid and reasonable to consider
uncertainty in estimates arising from the Bayes linear model (e.g. Lindley & Smith [5]) obtained
in the limit of large data, without assuming that the true data generating process is a linear
model. The conventional Bayesian approach conflates these two issues, that the estimate refers
to parameters in the predictive model assumed to be true (see ยง3).

(a) Martingales

In fact, martingales are important for this view of the Bayesian methodology. Consider the

posterior mean conditional on x}.741, Le. J Of Cn41 | 0) 10 | X10) dO

Ova = | O10 |xinsa) a0
where x,,41 has been taken from the predictive p(x,41 | X1:n).
