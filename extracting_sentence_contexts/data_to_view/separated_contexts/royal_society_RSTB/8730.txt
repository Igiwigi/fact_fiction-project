Admittedly,
if you are a theoretical physicist, you can make the notion of time difficult; but
in the experience of ordinary mortals life is based around clocks of various
kinds—whether in the natural world, such as the diurnal cycle, or man-made—
which tick away the span between birth and death in larger or smaller units. Humans are now masters of time, in the sense that we can measure the duration
of things to a delicacy unimaginable historically; but we remain slaves of time, in
that we can neither travel through it nor stop it. As far as speech is concerned, there can be no controversy over the fact that
time is of the essence. Any attempt to synthesize speech without taking the
subtle timing relations that permeate speech into account will result in an
output which is unnatural and potentially unintelligible. From the duration of
acoustic events such as plosive aspiration which contribute to the phonetic expo-
nence of phonological segments, to the lengthening often cuing the boundaries of
prosodic phrases, time is crucial.
