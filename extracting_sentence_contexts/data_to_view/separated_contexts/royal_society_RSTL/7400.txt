Equation (147), as now
corrected, shows that the flow of heat depends on the variation of temperature only, and
not on the direction of the variation of pressure. A vertical column would therefore,
when in thermal equilibrium, have the same temperature throughout. When I first attempted this investigation I overlooked the fact that = is not the same
as #.2, and 80 obtained as a result that the temperature diminishes as the height increases
at a greater rate than it does by expansion when air is carried up in mass. This leads
at once to a condition of instability, which is inconsistent with the second law of thermo-
dynamics. I wrote to Professor Sir W., Tnoxs0x about this result, and the difficulty I
had met with, but presently discovered one of my mistakes, and arrived at the.conclu-
sion that the temperature would increase with the height.
