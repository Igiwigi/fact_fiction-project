The 32 inch Cooke telescope was mounted on a small equatorial head without
clamps or adjustments. In this case the tripod stand was dispensed with, and the
head was screwed to the top of a loaded packing-case. A diagonal eyepiece, which
could be rapidly changed, by a simple operation, from total deflection at a silvered
surface to reflection from plane glass, was provided. ‘

With this instrument it was my intention to observe the times of commencement
and ending of totality, and the structure of the inner corona. Observations of the
corona were also to ke made by Lieutenant Hopcrs during the time I was engaged
with other instruments, H. Lewis, 3rd Writer, was to act as recorder. It was calcu-
lated by Dr. Lockyer, that 7 minutes 50 seconds before totality the visible crescent
would extend over 180°, and I hoped to utilise this fact as a check on the accuracy
of the chronometers.

Sketches of Corona.

As no photographic telescope was available for the work at Kid Island, I had to
rely upon sketches to indicate the general appearance of the corona. Experience
has shown that although drawings usually represent the feebler extensions more
