18 DR. PETTIGREW ON THE MUSCULAR ARRANGEMENTS

the bladder may be divided into s8everal layers, the fibres of the firs or moat external
layer having a longitudinal direction, those which come next being indined on either
8ide of the longitudinal one, the succeeding or deepest fibres, which. are the mozt
oblique, gradually becoming transverse. This author pointed out the important fact
that the fibres mutually cross each other,

A. Saparien® in a recent memoir divides the fibres into a superficial layer of longitu-
dinal fibres—a deeper layer of oval fibres, a still deeper one of circular or elliptical
fibres, and a layer of internal or deep longitudinal fibres. 'The external longitudinal
fibres, in his opinion, surround the summit of the bladder, and form with those of the
opposite s8ide a sort of cravat (cravate) behind the base of the urachus, other and
smilar fibres passing beneath the neck of the bladder to form an inferior crayat. The
superficial fibres, as will be observed from this description, are continuous towards the
apex and base. The oval fibres, he remarks, form loops (anses), which, being trans-
verse on the anterior surface and oblique on the sides, converge and diverge posteriorly
to form the italic letter y. The circular or elliptical fibres, according to SABATIER,
