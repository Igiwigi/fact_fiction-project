262 DR. C. CHREE; DISCUSSION OF KEW MAGNETIC DATA

The difference between the positions occupied by June in the R and BR’ lists is
remarkable. In the R list it comes first, slightly in advance of the other three mid-
summer months, whereas in the R’ list no element places it higher than fifth.

Another striking phenomenon is the difference between the positions assigned to
March and July in the R’ list according as the element considered is D or H. In the
case of H, it is true, the mean values of R’ for the six months March to September
differ comparatively little. Still the fact that (July Range/March Range) = 0°88 for
D, but = 1'06 for H, appears a little remarkable.
