from the centre of the calyx. The homologue of such uniting bars is found in the
theca (= Eutheca of Harper and Ortmann) of Turbinolidw, and not in the occasional
irregular rings of synapticule and pseudosynapticule in the calyces of Siderastrea,

Lophoseris, etc, (of figs. 428, 46). Hence I would apply to the wall in Madrepora,
Turbinaria, and Porites exclusively the name of a porous theca, thereby indicating
(1) the fact that a tangential thecal ring of calcification is present, even if it is not
continuously developed during upward growth of the polyp; (2) its structural homo-
logy with the usually compact theca of Turbinolide, Pocilloporidae, and Oculinide.
The same relations obtain in all these cases between the theca and the septa, whether
the theea be porous or compact.

The interrupted development of a skeletal structure is nothing unusual. An
analogy may be, for instance, made with the septa of Madrepora. Some are con-
tinuously developed, and appear as a compact septal plate; others, in the same
calyx, are interruptedly developed, and appear as a vertical uncompacted series of
septal spines. Yet the structure of the septal spine is precisely the same as that of
successive growth-parts in the flat septal plate. Thus, we must seek for the struc-
tural homologue of the “ porous wall” of Madrepora, without paying any respect to
