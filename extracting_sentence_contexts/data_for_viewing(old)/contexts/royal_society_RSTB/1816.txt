Imagining the whole body of the bigenous natality as a hypsometrical map, there

* That is m +p +n (see p. 847). Example: for the probability of 45 per cent. (p), the ages of
father (p) and mother (m) make 45:4 years (sce p. 854), and thus the total of the 3 figures = 90°4.

+ Mr. Gatroy is quite right to select only those most general cases, where the father is older than the
mother, otherwise we ought to suppose that a father of 20 and a mother of 50 have the same natality as a
mother of 20 and a father of 50. For such wide age-disiances our table does not furnish sufficient
material, the greatest available age-distance being 174 years, and in general, out of the 612 positions
of Table IV., there are only 134 where the mother is older. But even amongst these there is only one
combination where the mother is 7 years older, only 6 where she is 6, and 15 where she is 5 years older.
In consequence of the scarcity of these cases, we could extend our calculation over all age combinations,
including even those where the mother is older. Referring to the quoted facts, we may thus venture to
say that the Galton formula holds good not only for the eases of older husbands, but also for those
families where the husband is about 5 years younger than his wife.

858 MR. J. KOROSI ON AN ESTIMATE OF THE DEGREES OF LEGITIMATE

must be found on both slopes different points which are at the same level. Amongst
these points those merit a special interest which correspond to a considerably different
age of the other partner. Thus, for instance, it seems worthy of attention, when we
learn that mothers of 24 years show the same natality (that is of about 35 per cent.)
