While leaving these applications to be made in all their
fullness by meteorologists, I would refer, by way of illustration, to one or two points
on which I think the experiments bear. And first it is to be remarked that the vapour which absorbs heat thus greedily
radiates it very copiously. This fact must, T think, come powerfully into play in the
tropical region of calms, where enormous quantities of yapour are raised by the sun, and
discharged in deluges upon the earth. This has been assigned to the chilling conse-
quent on the rarefaction of the ascending air. But if we consider the amount of heat
liberated in the formation of those falling torrents, the chilling due to rarefaction will
hardly account for the entire precipitation. 'The substance quits the earth as vapour,
it returns to it as water ; how has the latent heat of the vapour been disposed of?
