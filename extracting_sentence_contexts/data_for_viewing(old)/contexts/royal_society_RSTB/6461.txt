dices epididymis). Certain authors, for example Kosett, regard them as isolated,
blind, mesonephric tubules. Roru suggests that they represent the peritoneal funnels
of pronephric tubules. Watson (1902), again, states that they are derivatives of either
the mesonephros or the anterior end of the Wolffian duct. None of these suggestions,
however, is supported by adequate embryological evidence.

Totpr has advanced an alternative view that the pedunculated hydatids are
derived, like those that are sessile, from the cranial end of the Miillerian duct. Ac-
cording to him, they develop, in the manner first described by Minatkovics (1885),
as small excrescences of the funnel-like opening of the duct. Their development is
intimately linked with that of the sessile hydatid, which in turn is derived from the
funnel-like opening itself. Totpr’s view, which is accepted by Esertu (1904), is well
supported by the following facts. There are numerous “intermediate” forms between
typical sessile and typical pedunculated hydatids. Indeed on the basis of their in-
vestigation of fifty-three testes, WRIGHT and Brown (1912) declare that the histological
structure of even typical specimens of the two classes of hydatid is identical. Further-
more, it is known that the degree to which a hydatid is sessile or pedunculated varies
and that sometimes only pedunculated appendages can be found. The distinction
between the testicular and epididymal appendages appears, in short, to be only a
topographical one.

In earlier embryonic life the Miillerian duct always ends on the upper pole of the
epididymis, where it develops as the “‘sessile appendage”’, and where it may bud off
