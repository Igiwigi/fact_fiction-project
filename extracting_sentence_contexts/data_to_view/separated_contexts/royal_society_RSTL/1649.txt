Mox6aN's Obſervations and Experiments on F1
ſtanced fimilarly to the acids in the preceding experiment, |
were attended with fimilar, but not equal effe&s, becauſe, uy |
conſequence of the inferiority of their condufting power, it wag,
neceflary to make the Jine through which the charge paſled.

conſiderably ſhorter. ;
4. The britliancy or ſplendor of the eleQric fluid i its
paſlage through any body is always increaſed by leflening the;
dimenſions of that body. I would explam my meaning by ſay"
ing, that a ſpark, orthe diſcharge of a battery which we might,
ſuppoſe equal to a fphere one quarter of an inch in diameter,
would appear much more brilliant if the ſame quantity of fluid”
is compreſſed into, a ſphere one-cighth of an inch in diameter.y
This obſervation is the obvious conſequenceof many known facts. If the machine be large cnough to afford a ſpark whoſe lengths!
is nine or ten inches, this ſpark may be ſeen ſometimes formin }
itſelf into a bruſh, in which ſtate it occupies more room, but ap=#
pears very faintly luminous. Ar other tunes the ſame ſpark.may?
be ſeen dividing itſelf into a variety of ramifications which ſhoot?
into. the ſurrounding air.
