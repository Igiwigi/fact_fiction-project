is interesting, because of the midnight maximum of magnetic activity which is also
experienced there. It appears, in fact, that we can say definitely that nocturnal
abnormal Region E reflexion is associated in some way with weak magnetic activity. Further evidence for such a conclusion can actually be noted during the course of
many magnetic storms which ultimately become intense, for the “ no-echo ” con-
dition is often preceded for a short time by abnormal Region E reflexions. Also it
may be noted that during magnetic activity the “no-echo” condition is often
interrupted (for example, during the day-time) by the sudden occurrence of abnormal
Region E reflexions, even though the frequency used is such as would normally be
penetrating to Region F at that time ofthe day.
