This direction is the second median line, and corresponds to the refractive index «,
the other extinction direction at right angles in the symmetry plane being the first
median line and corresponding to the index y. As the morphological axial angle
ac = 73° 43’, and therefore the angle between the normal to ¢ {001} and the vertical
axis c = 16° 17’, the second median line lies 2° 0’ in front of the vertical axis c, in the
obtuse angle ac of the morphological axes @ and c. The first median line also lies in

the obtuse axial angle ac, 14° 17’ above the inclined axis a, and 2° 0’ below the normal

to a {100}. These facts will be rendered clear by fig. 8.
Topsor and CHRISTIANSEN give the position of the first median line as 16° 54’ from

the axis a and 89° 25’ from the axis ¢.

Optic Axial Angle.—Three section-plates perpendicular to the first median line,
numbered 1, 2, 3, and three others labelled la, 2a, and 3a, perpendicular to the
second median line, were ground. The apparent optic axial angle in air, 2E, is too
large for measurement, the brushes being not quite capable of being brought to the
cross-wires; but excellent measurements were obtained for 2H, and 2H,, the
apparent acute and obtuse angles in bromonaphthalene. The results, together with
the values of the true optic axial angle 2V, calculated therefrom, are given in the
accompanying table.
