ions from a streak when deposited on the negative electrode form luminous vapour.
This fact was also previously observed by the writer.t
Tt was therefore decided to attempt to measure the relative motion of the
luminous salt vapour and flame gases due to an electric field by a new method
which seemed to be capable of giving more reliable results than those previously used.
The flame used was a Bunsen flame formed by burning a mixture of gasolene vapour
and air from a special burner.
Fig. 1 shows a vertical section of the burner, and fig. 2 the top of it as seen from
