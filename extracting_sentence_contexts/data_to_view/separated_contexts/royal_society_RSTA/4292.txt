Later experiments make it very improbable that the growth of these
nuclei is due to each one becoming charged with electricity under the action of the
ultra-violet light. The most obvious way of accounting for the growth of the nuclei

into visible particles, and their persistence even in unsaturated air, is to suppose that
by the action of the ultra-violet light some compound is formed in solution in each
drop. Were it not for the fact that the fogs are produced in pure oxygen as well as
in air, one would naturally consider the combination of oxygen and nitrogen with the
water of the incipient drop to form nitric acid as the most likely reaction which could
account for the phenomena. Possibly when the clouds are produced in moist air this
may be, in fact, the reaction which takes place. When the clouds are produced in
oxygen, however, the only possible combination which can account for the phenomena
is that of oxygen and water to form hydrogen peroxide.
