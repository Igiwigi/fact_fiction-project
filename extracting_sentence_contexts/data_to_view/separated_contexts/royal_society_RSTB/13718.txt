Rather it is driven by the MGEs that encode
and carry them. Genetic elements with the ability to transmit
to new hosts have—to varying degrees—their own evolution-
ary interests on which selection can act, sometimes to the
detriment of the bacterial host they inhabit [1]. Thus the rhi-
zobium-legume symbiosis should in fact be seen as a
tripartite interaction between the plant, the bacteria and the
MGEs that carry the functional trait [2]. In this review, we
will examine the world of the sym element, asking two cen-
tral questions: how mobile is the symbiosis, and what forces
shape mobility among sym elements?

2. How mobile is symbiosis?
