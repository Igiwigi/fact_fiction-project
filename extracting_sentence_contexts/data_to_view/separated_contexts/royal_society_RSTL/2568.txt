He obseryed that several rocks which not
long ago were sunken reefs and dangerous to navigators, had become in his time
above water; that the sea was constantly leaving dry new tracts of land along its
borders ; that ancient ports had become inland towns ; and that old fishermen and
seafaring people could testify that at a variety of places, both on the shores of the
Baltic and the ocean, considerable changes had taken place within the time of their
memory, in the form of the coast and depth of the sea. Lastly he appealed to marks
which had been cut in the rocks before his time expressly to indicate the former level,
and the waters were observed to have fallen below these marks. This notion of a change continually in progress in the relative level of land and
sea was at first warmly controverted, and many facts were adduced to prove that
there had not been a general fall of the waters even in the Baltic. It was supposed
by many that there might have been some error in the observations, as the Baltic,
though free from tides, is often raised for several days continuously two or three feet
above its standard level by the melting of the snow, or by the prevalence of par-
ticular winds ; and it was remarked that the altered form of the coast and the shal-
lowing of the sea might be ascribed partly to new accessions of land at points where
rivers entered, depositing sand and mud, and partly to the drifting of large blocks
by ice, which are 8ometimes stranded and driven up on rocks and low islands 80 as
to raise their height. PLayrais, in the year 1802, in his © Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory,” de-
