C. Robert Cloninger (a) What are the natural building blocks of temperament?

e-mail: c.robert.cloninger@wustl.edu Despite the long history of studying individual differences in temperament
traits, there remains fundamental uncertainty about the definition of tem-
perament, including what to measure and how to measure it. Generally,
temperament refers to those aspects of personality that are biologically based
rather than learned. However, even this basic definition is problematic because
human beings have three major systems of learning and memory that each has
a distinct genetic and biological basis: associative conditioning of habits and
skills, declarative learning of facts, and autonoetic learning of a personal lifetime
narrative [1-3]. Early temperament research emphasized the assessment of fea-
tures of activity and affectivity that were developmentally stable, but more
recent work has suggested that temperament may include attention and self-
regulatory processes [4], which emerged later in evolution [5] and develop into
adulthood in response to individual experience and social norms [6].

There is also fundamental doubt about whether the natural biological unit
of measurement for temperament and other personality traits corresponds to
individual traits or multi-trait configurations. Researchers of temperament
and its biology usually focus on individual traits that differ between individ-
uals [4]. By contrast, developmental and social-cognitive psychologists
usually focus on multi-trait configurations within each individual because
