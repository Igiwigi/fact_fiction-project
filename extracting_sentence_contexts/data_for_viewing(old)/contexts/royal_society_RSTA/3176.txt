are isomorphic.
Proof. The proof is obtained by Stone’s representation theorem for Boolean algebras. a

Note that Stone’s representation theorem does not involve probability. This is natural because a
classical theory need not be a priori a statistical one: probability is not intrinsic to classical theories,
itis input from the outside. We shall see that the situation with a quantum theory is quite different.

(b) Quantum probability and local commutativity

The crucial difference between a classical and a quantum context is made by the Heisenberg
indeterminacy principle which is a genuine physical principle that cannot be read off only from
the knowledge of the transition probabilities. In fact it can be proved that transition probabilities
among incompatible observables may, in some cases, admit a Kolmogorov model (see [21]). We
will take this principle as the basic axiom which distinguishes classical from quantum probability.
According to the general formulation proposed in §1d, the information-theoretical essence of this
principle consists in the existence of incompatible observables. In the language of measurement
algebras this leads to the following definition.

Definition 2.7. An algebra of measurements M is called quantum if it includes incompatible
measurements. This means that the multiplication in M is non-commutative.

Any *-algebra M includes self-adjoint elements, i.e. elements satisfying X* = X. The +-sub-
algebra of M generated by such an element is commutative.
