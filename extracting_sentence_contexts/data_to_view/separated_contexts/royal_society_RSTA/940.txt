The results of all the
comparisons made between October, 1933, and June, 1934, are given in Table III. If the length of the base pendulums had remained constant throughout, the
figures in col. 11 would only differ by the errors of measurement and would show
no systematic change. It is clear that the pendulums have, in fact, systematically
shortened. This is illustrated in fig. 3 where the reduced periods from col. 11
of Table III are plotted against the date.
