Natural history museums and the specimen collections they curate are vital

scientific infrastructure, a fact as true today as it was when biologists began

One contribution of 16 to a theme issue collecting and preserving specimens over 200 years ago. The importance
‘Biological collections for understanding of museum specimens in studies of taxonomy, systematics, ecology and
biodiversity in the Anthropocene’. evolutionary biology is evidenced by a rich and abundant literature, yet

creative and novel uses of specimens are constantly broadening the impact
of natural history collections on biodiversity science and global sustainabil-
ity. Excellent examples of the critical importance of specimens come from
environmental science, evolution, health and their use in documenting the consequences of environmental change,
disease and epidemiology, genomics which is particularly relevant considering the alarming rate at which we
now modify our planet in the Anthropocene. In this review, we highlight
the important role of bird, mammal and amphibian specimens in document-
