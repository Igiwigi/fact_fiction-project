The fact that the volume energy (PV), or the reduced volume of the gas, except for
the first increment of pressure, may be taken as constant, satisfactorily establishes the
conclusion that increase of pressure, at least up to 4°6 atmospheres, practically has no
effect on the occlusion of hydrogen by palladium black which has already absorbed
the maximum quantity of hydrogen at the ordinary temperature. Platinum and
palladium black thus behave in precisely the same way as regards the effect of
pressure on the occlusion of hydrogen. The first increase of pressure caused the
disappearance of several volumes (about ten volumes) of hydrogen, but as this does
not continue, it may possibly be due to the presence of moisture, derived from the
palladium black, in the gas.

The influence of pressure on the odin of hydrogen by palladium at high
temperatures has recently been described by Dewar (‘Proc. Chem. Soc.,’ 1897,
