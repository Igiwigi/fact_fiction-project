The point which I shall seek to establish is this,—that at the moment of chemical
change a chemical difference exists between the particles of which certain elemental
bodies consist, perfectly the same in kind to that which exists between the particles
of compound substances under similar circumstances, and on which the phenomena
of combination and decomposition depend. That a peculiar chemical relation exists
between two particles which combine, is generally admitted and expressed by the
term affinity. 'The electro-chemical theory has defined more exactly in what this
affinity consists, and states that the two particles are to one another in a positive and
negative electric relation. But I do not know that it has ever been pointed out that this
chemical relation—this affinity between the particles of a substance—is an essential
condition of the decomposition as well as of the composition of the body. As I am
about to infer a chemical difference between the particles of the element from the
fact of their chemical separation, I must say a few words upon this point, and I shall
Simplify the whole question by stating briefly the mode in which I consider chemical
change to be effected. I may do this sufficiently for my present purpose in the fol-
lowing propositions :—

1. That when two particles chemically combine, a certain chemical relation exists
between them which is expressed by the terms positive and negative. The che-
mical difference of the particles I term the difference between their conditions in
this respect.

2, That when chemical combination takes place between the particles of which any
two or more substances consist, a chemical difference exists between the particles of
each substance, 80 that the particles of the same substance are to one another in a
