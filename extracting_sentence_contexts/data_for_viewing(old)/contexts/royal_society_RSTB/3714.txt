exhibit a distinctly reticulate character (fig. 73). The cell boundaries are remarkably
well-defined.

The most noteworthy histological feature, however, is the presence just outside and
attached to the epithelial layer, in the interspaces between the folds of the choroid
plexus (and therefore in the cavity of the dorsal sac), of a delicate, apparently
cytoplasmic network containing numerous nuclei and closely resembling the
endogastric network met with in some calcareous sponges (fig. 72, C. P. N.). I do
not profess to understand the significance of this structure. One is tempted at first
to suppose that it consists of moribund cells which have been shed from the
epithelium, but this view is rendered untenable by the fact that the shape of the
nuclei is different, being elongated and much more like that of the nuclei of the
connective tissue which underlies the epithelium. In fact the network looks as if it
were composed of extrusive connective tissue rather than of epithelial cells. As we
shall see presently, a somewhat similar network occurs in the tubules of the
paraphysis. Very similar networks also occur in the choroid plexuses of the fourth
and lateral ventricles, which, indeed, are practically identical in structure with that
of the dorsal sac.

The middle of each fold of the choroid plexus is occupied by a gelatinous- and
only slightly fibrous-looking connective tissue, containing elongated nuclei, and
concentrated beneath the epithelium to form a thin basement membrane. In this
tissue run the slender, thin-walled, branching capillaries, lined by a very thin
epithelial layer, as shown in fig. 72.
