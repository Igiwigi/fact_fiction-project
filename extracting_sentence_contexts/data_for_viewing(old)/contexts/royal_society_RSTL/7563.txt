same with that I have assigned in the former paper. Second, That, if the velocity be |
greater than that of 1100 or 1200 feet in a second, then the absolute quantity of tha
resistance in these greater velocities will be near three times as great as it should be b
a comparison with the smaller velocities”*. HuTrox remarks in a note on these con»
clusions:—* These suppositions are not nearly correct. In fact, by more accurate expe-
riments with cannon-balls, it appears that the law of the resistance begins to increase
above the ratio of the square of the velocity, from the very slowest motions, and thene
goes on increasing gradually more and more above what is assigned by that ratio, ti
we arrive at the velocity of 1600 or 1700 feet per second, where it is at the greatest,”
amounting in that maximum state to only 245 times the quantity resulting from the
ratio of the square of the velocity. And at the velocity of 1100 feet, instead of answer-
ing to that law, it amounts to 1-86 times the same.” EvLtr, in the remarks which
accompany his translation of Ropixs' © Gunnery,” states that, the greater the velocity of
the shot, 80 much the more does theory deviate from the truth. Hurrox's formula of
resistance consisted of two terms, one varying as the velocity, and the other as the square

of the velocity.
