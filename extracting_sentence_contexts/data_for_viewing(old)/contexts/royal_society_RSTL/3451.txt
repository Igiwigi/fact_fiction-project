423. Biscnore. © All the ova [of the Dog] which I found in the oviduct, till re-
sembled in a remarkable manner the ovarian ova, viz. they always had a granular
dise, just as those in the ovary, and the yelk is always still dark and untransparent.
Those of the earliest age presented also scarcely any change in size or in the appear-
ance of the yelk. With all imaginable care and pains I sought in all for the germinal
vesicle, but in vain. The disappearance of this structure therefore in mammals also
(where hitherto it has been admitted only hypothetically), I believe myself enabled
to pronounce as a decided fact. In an impregnated bitch, which I examined 19
hours after the first coitus, and where I found the ova still in the ovary, the germinal
vesicle was present. It thus probably disappears just on the exit of the oyur from
the ovary. What becomes of it, I cannot tell. I decidedly believe that it bursts, and
that its contents, mixed with the semen, form the spot, from which the development
of the embryo proceeds}.”

Ervisting views regarding © Cells,”

424. The nucleus of the vegetable cell received but little notice until its import-
ance was conceived by our celebrated fellow-countryman Ropgrr Brown, who was
the first to denominate this structure the nucleus of the cell. ©* This areola,” says
Dr. Brown, © which is more or less distinctly granular, is slightly convex, and although
