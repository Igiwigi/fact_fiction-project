to a coronoid process of the dentaries as in mammals. The teeth already were
specialized as incisors, canines, and molars.

On the other hand, there are many striking points of difference. The palate is
very unlike that of any mammal. Even if the mammal had no secondary palate the
difference between the mammalian and Therocephalian type would be striking.
The mammal has a large median vomer situated, in most, well forward and generally
extending to near the front of the snout. The Therocephalian has a pair of bones in
front of the palate, which I consider are homologous with the dumb-bell-shaped bone
of Ornithorhynchus, and at the back of the palate is a median bone-—the para-sphenoid
of most authors—a bone which does not occur in mammals. For many years I
have maintained that the reptilian “‘ para-sphenoid ” evolved into the mammalian
vomer, and the facts now known about the structure in the Therocephalians, the
Gorgonopsians, the Anomodonts, and the Ictidosaurians seem to me to confirm this
conclusion.

Then we have the lower jaw in the Therocephalians with the posterior third
formed mainly by the sur-angular, angular, pre-articular, and articular bones, and the
articular hinging on a well-developed quadrate. Further, in the Therocephalian
skull we have many bones which are completely lost in the mammal. And yet
I think it can be shown how in nearly every feature we have pro-mammalian
characters whose evolution into the mammalian condition can be readily understood.

Some of the more important problems raised by the study of the Therocephalian
skull may be considered in some little detail.
