Wiggins & Ottino (2004) review elements of the necessary theory and definition of
terminology in a mathematically rigorous way. They present a basic representation
of mixing applicable to two-dimensional blinking flows, and with proper caveats, to
duct flows. This does not mean that all necessary theory has already been developed,
and it is clear that further mathematical developments are needed; in fact we outline
a few steps that should be taken to complete the description. It is fair to say, however,
that the field would benefit by closer convergence of applications and theory. Ordering papers is always somewhat artificial.
