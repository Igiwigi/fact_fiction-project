which is in fact identical with the expression (41).

The locus of the points for which one of the principal tangents meets a given line,
$ay, the line (a,, b,, G6 fs Jn hy), will be found by eliminating A, B, C, D from the
equations (42), (43), (44), combined with the following condition :

af, +bf, +>, +a, f+bg+0h=0. «4 (4)

But since the principal tangent is the intersection of the plane (A, B, C, D) with the
tangent plane, we have
