of coils at that stage (fig. 70, Plate 19). Chromosomes lost at the first division are
readily distinguished by their large coils which are visible even in aceto-carmine
(fig. 60, Plate 18). In neither case has straightening occurred.

Finally, the evidence already given on the constancy of the coiling at all stages of
mitosis may be amplified by observation of interkinesis. This is shown in fig. 20,
Plate 16, figs. 55, 56, Plate 18, and fig. 77, Plate 19. In fig. 55 the V-shaped chromo-
somes can be seen at the beginning of the optically diffuse stage, while figs. 77 and 56
are successive prophases of the second division. Fig. 77 is particularly striking. It is
from an ordinary section (the same which was used for Plates 16 and 17), but the coils
displayed agree exactly with those brought out by the ammonia treatment at the
preceding anaphase. The exceptional clarity of the spirals at the prophase of the
second meiotic division is a well-known fact, and they were several times observed at
this stage by writers (e.g. Newton 1925) before spiral structure was recognized as a
general phenomenon. The resting stage of interkinesis is therefore an episode which
has extraordinarily little effect on the real configuration of the chromosome thread,
in spite of great changes in its optical properties.

All this evidence confirms completely the previous conclusion. Spiralization, in
meiosis as in mitosis, cannot be regarded as an innovation at any stage since it is
characteristic of all, with the possible exception of early meiotic prophase, details of
which will be given later. The chromosome, like the spiral staircase, must therefore
be a constructionally coiled object, and the immediate question which arises is not
so much why this should be so, an inscrutable problem at present, but why the mitotic
prophase chromosome untwists the old spiral in forming the new. It is the untwisting
