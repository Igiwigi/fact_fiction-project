One excellent study on
great reed warblers that did sample both parents and offspring
at the same age (8-10 days) found moderate heritability [31]. All the other non-human studies had shortcomings as they
did not control for offspring and parental age at sampling,
used an age-adjusted telomere length and/or only included
offspring age, and sometimes parental age, as a covariate in
the model (table 1). Thirdly, despite the fact that environ-
mental effects can vary spatially and temporally (see section
three), few studies have accounted for this in their analyses
(table 1). The one study undertaken under controlled labora-
tory conditions (thus reducing environmental variation) also
reduced shared environmental effects through cross-fostering
and reported a heritability value of 1 [72]. The very high herit-
ability estimate in this case is perhaps not surprising, because
once environmental variation is minimized the rest of the vari-
ation must be due to genetic effects.
