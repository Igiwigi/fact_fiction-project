With this in mind, equation (3.3)
shows that e, and ¢, have the same sign. Finally, we can use (3.2) to express of and o! in terms
of ¢,

ot= eaRy Vig Pa — ey OY) (4)

and
Nn.
of = BVM + yd - 4) OM bg. @.5)

The last equation, incidentally, shows that, if n; is constant, of and ¢, must have the same sign. In order now to derive the evolution equations in terms of 6, we can either start from equations
(2.1) and (2.2), assume that ot = o'(6), e = e(0) and ¢ = (6), and follow a completely analogous
reasoning to the one used to derive equations (2.4) and (2.5), or alternatively we can start
directly from equations (2.4) and (2.5) and use the fact that do = d(a'(a)@) = o'(1 + 6(Ino*),) do
to transform all the derivatives with respect to o into derivatives with respect to 0. In either case,
we arrive at the following evolution laws for c and 6:

dc
an —B(C,O)(vads(c, 8) — vdes(9)) + (1 — ¢) (3.6)
and
do Vads(C, 0) — Udes(9) 3.7
dt o@)(1 + 0(a Ina(6)/00))’ 6.7)
with
Bl 8) e(0) 1— 4) (8/CoN(1 — $())/9(0))(Be(0)/98) + (c/o'(@) — €/Cy)(8 In. 9(0)/00)_

Co (0) 1+ (8 Inot(@)/90)

(3.8)


Comparison between equations (2.4), (2.5) and equations (3.6), (3.7) shows that they have a similar
form, but the multiplying factors in the latter are more complicated than in the former. This is
a consequence of explicitly expressing o as the product of @ and ot: as a result, the structural
changes due to the swelling of the solid matrix are not only reflected in the change of porosity
@ and surface to volume ratio ¢, but also in the change of the total site density ot.
