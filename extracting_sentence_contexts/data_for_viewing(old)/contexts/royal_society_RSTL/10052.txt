S one, was continued by HARDER (12), SCHEUCHZER (13), PALLAs (14), MecKkEL (15),
S PruUNELLE (16), and TizpeEMANN (17). It was in consequence of this error that
Z Parras (14) in 1778 compared hibernation to fetal life. Cuvier (18) noticed that
Z the thymus and other glands diminish the capacity of the chest in hibernating
E animals. In 1817, however, JACoB80N (19) showed that the glands in the thorax,
= which enlarge in the winter sleep, are not thymus ; and that the thymus behaves in
YL animals which hibernate, as in other animals ; and maintained that the thymus has
S nothing in common with the peculiar glands lying in its neighbourhood, either in its
E development, appearance, or secretion. He was followed by RuporLent (20) and
A HavasreD (1), the latter giving drawings of the two organs at various periods of li≈øe ;
and the facts were further confirmed by Barxow (21) and others. S1MoN (2),
however, accepted the older doctrine, holding that the thymus is very large in hibernat-
ing animals, and he partially founded upon this supposed fact his view of the function
of the organ.

The second error arose, as has been stated, about the game time. In 1673,
BarTnoLaNUs (22) as8erted that the thymus contains a cavity ; and a great parb of
many 8nbsequent anatomical researches were taken up with the various accounts of
this cavity, the openings into it, and other 8upposed facts about it. The existence of
a cavity was accepted by Hugo (23), who worked with Harrer, by Lucas (24), by
