In §3, it was shown that the sensitivity function Z(¢) of
the phase is equal to the transpose of the left eigenvector uj(¢) of A(@) associated with the zero
eigenvalue. Similarly, I}(¢) can be chosen as the /th left eigenvector of A(@) as Ii(¢) =uf(¢)" as
shown below. Let us now derive the above facts, namely, the decay rate 4 of r in equation (A 1) is equal
to one of the Floquet exponents A1,_,-1 and Ii(¢) =ur(¢)t ([=1,...,n—1). Suppose that an
initial oscillator state at f= 0 is chosen as X(0) = x(0) + €p(0) with @ =0, where (0) = uj(0) G =
0,...,n — 1) and € is an arbitrary tiny parameter; namely, we add a tiny amplitude disturbance
to the oscillator state in the direction of jth eigenvector of A(0) with eigenvalue 4). Evolving
the oscillator without perturbation from this initial state under the linear approximation, the
oscillator state at t= ¢/w can be expressed as X(t) = x(#) + eo($) = x(¢) + 5) e(@/) AM 4 ,(0) =
x(b) + €S() e/a (0) as in §3.
