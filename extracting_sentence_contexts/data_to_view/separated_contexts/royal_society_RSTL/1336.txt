It would seem. therefore, that
the more similar the metals are, which are thus used, the less is
the power arising from their combination. Two pieces of the
same metal, but with different portions of alloy, are still more
feeble than gold and silver ; and the power of such pieces be-
comes less and less, in proportion as they approach each other.
in point of purity. From these facts'it has been inferred, that,
if any two pieces of the same metal were to: posSess precisely

tions ; in confirmation of which, many persons have asserted,
that they have never observed muscles to move from the em-
ployment of two such pieces of metal, or of one piece of metal
having the same fineness through its whole extent. Others,
however, upon the authority of their observations, have main-
tained the contrary; and to the testimony of these I must add
my own, as I have frequently seen muscular motions produced
not only by a single metal, but likewise by charcoal alone. Nor will credit be denied me on this head, after I have pointed
out certain practices, by which any one of those substances
may at pleasure be made to produce contractions.
