We shall not comment here in
detail upon the value of each experiment, but simply call attention to the columns of
Nitrogen, in the Tables, and to the notes in the Appendix indicating the

gain or loss of
cireumstances of growth of the plants. With regard to the Leguminose experimented upon, it is to be observed that the
development was by no means 80 satisfactory as in the case of the Graminacee. Hence
the evidence which the results relating to them afford against the fact of assimilation
of free Nitrogen must be admitted to apply to a more limited range of conditions of
growth, and, therefore, to be less conclusive against the possibility of such assimilaÂ»
tion. Still, so far as they go, the results with these plants, and also those with bucks
wheat, tend to confirm those obtained under the more favourable cireumstances of
growth with the cereals. It will be remembered, however, that M.
