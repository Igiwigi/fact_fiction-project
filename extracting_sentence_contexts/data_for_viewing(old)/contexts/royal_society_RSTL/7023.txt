The ridge leading to the island of Re1L is prominent and exposed in the female brain,
but not 80 much $0 in the other. Both brains exhibit in special details a decided want
of symmetry.

It is interesting to find that the variable conditions of the anterior ascending parietal
convolution establish the correctness of the explanation given above of the ultimate
conversion of the intrusive convolution into that gyrus. It must not escape notice that,
in the smaller or male brain, this intrusive convolution is again present on the left ide,
as in our idiot woman and idiot boy. The two brains, moreoyer, differ, not only in
the parietal convolutions, but also in the orbital region, in the shape of the temporal
lobes, and in other respects to be presently mentioned. There is evidence of a defective
and therefore disproportional size of the frontal lobe in both brains, in the fact that,
taking the total length of the cerebrum as 100, the part in front of the fissures of
RoL.anDo, the part between them and the perpendicular fissures, and the part behind
the latter, as seen from above, measure in the smaller or male brain 29, 42, and 29,
and in the larger or female brain 40, 35, and 25. The frontal region, in front of the
fissure of ROLANDO, as compared with the parts lying behind that fissure, is therefore in

the former as 29 to T1, and in the latter as 40 to 60. In both idiots the frontal region

is therefore defective, but unequally 8 in the two. It is scarcely possible to doubt that
