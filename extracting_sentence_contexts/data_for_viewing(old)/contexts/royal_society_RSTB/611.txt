the lesion is shown in Plate 1. The degenerations above and below the lesion are in all respects the
same as those of the last case.

three transverse hemisections at a distance of two or three millims. apart were made on the left side.

1st day.—The animal paralyzed in both limbs. The left foot and leg are swollen, and the plantar
surface of the former is redder and drier than that of the opposite side. There is much less hair cover-
ing the popliteal spaces of this animal than in the other animals experimented upon; perhaps this will
account for the fact that there is only a slight difference in the temperature of the popliteal spaces of the
two sides.

Sensation. (1). To heat.—The toes dipped in hot water were withdrawn almost immediately on the
right side, on the left there was a longer delay.

(2.) Pricking with aw needle—The animal seemed to feel on both sides although it requived a much

Knee-jerks present on both sides.

3rd day.—There is considerable swelling of the wound, due to collection of fluid. A quantity of
