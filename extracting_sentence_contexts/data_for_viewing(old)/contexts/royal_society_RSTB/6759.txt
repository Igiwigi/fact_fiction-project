existed, at least in its present form, until post-Middle Pleistocene times. It therefore
appears that the faulting occurred at the end of the Middle Pleistocene.

On the southern shore of the lake are two prominent ash cones, Nabuyatom and
Abili Agituk. The former is the younger for there is no sign of any lake levels higher
than 45 ft., having been cut upon its flanks. Abili Agituk, on the other hand, has a
well marked level cut at just over 200 ft. above the present lake. This fact together
with its generally denuded condition shows it to be of considerably greater age than
Nabuyatom. I conclude that it was formed at the time of the faulting at the end of the
Middle Pleistocene, but that Nabuyatom was not erupted till much more recently,
perhaps at the time of the last Pullo-Sirima eruptions.
