Suppose that there exists an R-admissible lattice Y’ of determinant A different from #7,
and #,. It is first shown with the help of certain parallelograms of area 4A that 2’ has
a point P in one at least of [4,, £\, B,J, [4>, 2, B,] and [A,, £3, B,], where [A,, £,, B,] denotes
the closed region bounded by the lines 4;/; and £;B,; and the part of @ lying between A; and
B,; the points A; and B;, however, are supposed to be excluded from [4,, E,, B;]. Without loss
of generality it may be assumed that P lies in [4,, /,, B,]. Then it is shown that neither
[Ay, E,, By] nor [A,, £;, B,] contains a point of Y. For R of type II this is shown to lead to
a contradiction which proves the theorem in this case. For & of type III or IV, it is proved
that P must lie in [A,, F;, B,| (see figure 6 for example).

It is next shown that, ifa line parallel to OP and at a distance A/OP from it has an intercept
less than OP cut off by @, or @, then #’ cannot exist. This condition is seen to be satisfied
if P lies in [A), F\, 1] or [B,, F\, 4]. From this fact theorem 2 follows for R of type III also
(see figure 5).

For R of type IV there is still the possibility that P lies in [4 F,, 4]. A sufficient condition
to exclude this is seen to be provided by theorem 3. However, in this case there may be an
£' with points on @, the boundary of R. But this does not contradict theorem 3.

In Lemma 17 a result is proved which may be useful in deciding, in the case of bounded
R, whether #, and #, are admissible or not.
