Unbalanced load perturbation. (a) Current sharing of inverters in phase ‘a, (6) current sharing of inverters in
phase ‘b; (c) average current estimation and (d) average voltage estimation. (Online version in colour.)

The DCA-based controller acts according to the differences in the voltages and compensates
the voltage unbalance. It is observed that any increase in the heavy load in one phase led to a drop in the power
supply in the other two phases. This is due to the fact that no controller is acting to maintain
the voltages, rather the controllers act to nullify the difference in the voltage magnitude. Thus,
heavy load change in one phase will lead to reduction in the voltage in the other phases, leading
to a balance operating point. This type of condition will be favourable if any three-phase P — V
droop-based controllers are present in the system.
