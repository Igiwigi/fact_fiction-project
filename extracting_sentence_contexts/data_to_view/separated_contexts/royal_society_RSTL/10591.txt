We have also
8upposed that the relation between the difference of snrface tension and the other
properties of the film is snch that the only considerable movement to which it gives
rise is a change of curvature. Having by experiments, conducted on these favourable

{ assumptions, decided whether or no evidence of a difference of 8urface tensio! | exceeding a given amount is forthcoming, we are then at, liberty to reconsider the
probable constitution of the film in view of the facts which experiment has elicited. ]
| In studying the properties of the black portion of a s0ap film, it is also important
to remember that it has a well-defined boundary which indicates an apparent discon-
tinuity in the thickness. It may be urged that if the thickness is less than that of
two 8urface layers there must also be an apparent discontinuity in the 8urface tension_
| at the edge of the black.
