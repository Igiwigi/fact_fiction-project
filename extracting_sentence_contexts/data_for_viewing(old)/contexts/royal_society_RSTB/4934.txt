one of their ordinary machines with a second egg chamber above it, both chambers
being heated by the same lamp. In the lower incubator there is the usual temperature
difference of several degrees between the top and bottom of the eggs, but in the upper
the egg temperature is almost uniform. The company had kindly lent me one of these
double incubators, and I was glad to use it for the present test.

Four sets of 35 eggs each were taken, which very nearly all “ corresponded.” Two
of them were arranged in alternate rows in the lower and the other two in the upper
half of the incubator; but though there was practically no temperature gradient in
the upper eggs, as the last column of Table X. shows, the extra turning was effective
in both parts of the machine, and, allowing for the smallness of the number of eggs
dealt with, to about the same extent in both. The hatches in the lower incubator will
be seen to have been much earlier than in the upper, therein agreeing with the fact that
the percentage hatched in the lower was a good deal larger than the upper. This is,
no doubt, because the eggs in the upper had to be kept there longer than the makers
advise for the purpose of the test. No certain difference appears between the times
of hatching of the differently turned eggs.

Though the numbers of eggs dealt with were not large enough for the conclusion
to be quite beyond doubt, when these six tests are considered together they furnish
a strong case for the germ-sticking theory (a) and against that of temperature redis-
tribution (b).
