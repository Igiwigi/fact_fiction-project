The interpretation of these numbers is not without difficulty. From the care taken
Z by the observers, it was supposed that the material state of the pendulums would be
sensibly the same during the whole continuance of the observations, and it was
expected therefore that the results of the Fifth and the Seventh Series would be in
= close accordance, and that the results of the Sixth and the Eighth Series would be
- in close accordance. Now the fact is, that the results of the Fifth and Seventh Series
agree pretty well, when regard is had to the circumstances of forced temperature
Z (the discordance 000000149 corresponds to 0*3 per day nearly, or to 0*72 of tempe-
rature); but the discordance between the Sixth and Eighth is 000000842 (which

corresponds to 168 per day, or to 4*09 of temperature). It would therefore seem,
2 at first 8ight, that there is strong reason to suppose that some change took place in

& one of the pendulums after the Seventh Series.

74. As there is no reason whatever for supposing a change before the end of the
FB Seventh Series, let us take the mean of the Fifth and Seventh Series, and compare it
(A.) with the Sixth Series alone, (B.) with the mean of the Sixth and Eighth Series ;
