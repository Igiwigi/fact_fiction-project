The model suggests that the force of infection for
birth cohorts in the late 1980s and early 1990s may be increas-
ing beyond levels seen in previous decades. However, we
have comparatively little data on these cohorts, so this predic-
tion should be revised as additional data becomes available. It is unclear what might be driving such an increase: there is
no indication of substantial declines in condom use in the
USA, and Ryser ef al. reported that later cohorts may in fact
have lower partner acquisition rates than the preceding
cohorts [8]. It may also be the case that HPV genotypes
have waxed and waned as fractions of the overall HPV preva-
lence and that, by considering only the 6, 11, 16 and 18
subset, the trends we estimate here may differ from the
trends for infection of any HPV type. HPV vaccines, which are targeted at pre-adolescents, have
been approved for use in certain populations in the USA
since 2006 (for only women initially and men later) [26].
