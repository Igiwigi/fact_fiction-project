I must now pass on to notice briefly the longitudinal strains of ships in exceptional
positionsâ€”such as those produced by launching, grounding, and other causes. Although
exceptional, these strains undoubtedly occur; and their effect may be, as I shall show,
more severe than that of any of the statical strains to which approximations have been
made. Preceding writers have recognized this fact to some extent, but no author has
done 80 much as Mr. FairBairyN towards giving quantitative expressions to these excep-
tional strains. BouGvER, RoMME, and other early writers had a very clear conception of the principal
causes of launching-strains. They call attention to the fact that in all, or nearly all,
launches the ship's bow or stern is water-borne before the other end has left the launch-
ing-ways, and that this cannot be prevented altogether even when the ways are extended
further out into the water than is customary.
