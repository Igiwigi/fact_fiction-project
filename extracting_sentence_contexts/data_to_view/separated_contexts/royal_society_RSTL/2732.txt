The periodical part of the heights, as appears by the remainder of Table VII. (b.),
whatever be the parallax, follows nearly the law of the mean, which has already
been explained ; and the magnitude of the maximum differences does not appear to
be steadily different for different H. P. In fact, theory would lead us to expect it to
be the s8ame in all these cases, because the amount of this inequality is 2 ah double the
mean 8$0lar tide.

20. But it appears from the Table VII. (b.) that the time of moon's transit, when the
periodical inequality vanishes, is later for the larger parailaxes, and the maxima indi-
cate the 8ame change: the amount of the change is about 4® (p — 57), at the mean
between the greatest and least values of the height.
