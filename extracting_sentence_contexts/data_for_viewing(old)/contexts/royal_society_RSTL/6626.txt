And comparing this with Mr. Carey's I in arts. 14 and 15 of his memoir
«On the Conic of Five-pointic Contact,” in the Philosophical Transactions for 1859,
pp. 376, 377; and bearing in mind that in his formulz we must make A=1, p=0, y=0,
in order to institute a comparison ; and lastly, dividing throughout by (n—1)-*%#*9H?,
and multiplying by 2, the expression above written becomes

The identity of the expressions for f, as deduced by the present method, with that
deduced by Mr. CArLEyY having been thus demonstrated, it is unnecessary to pursue the
calculations ſurther.

'The following are the principal subsidiary POTTY used in the foregoing calculations.
