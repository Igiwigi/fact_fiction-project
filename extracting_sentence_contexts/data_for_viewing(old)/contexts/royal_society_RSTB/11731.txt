ined in order to investigate the evidence behind the claim
that A-consciousness (in one or another sense) overflows
P-consciousness. As argued above, access consciousness is
currently defined in different ways and, as will be shown,
the definition may determine how plausible the overflow
hypothesis is in the light of the empirical cases. The article
will present various arguments for overflow based on empiri-
cal evidence and show that none of them work very well for
any definition of A-consciousness. It will, however, be
argued that overflow is conceptually possible under some
definitions of A-consciousness.

2. Becoming aware: a fictional case inspired by
everyday life

Intuitively, it may be easy to come up with empirical cases
that could represent an actual distinction between A- and
P-consciousness. Imagine standing in a crowded room,
trying to have a conversation with another person, when
you suddenly become aware of what someone else at the
other end of the room is saying.

One could argue that we here witness how we constantly
have phenomenal consciousness of the entire scene, experien-
cing the contents of all the conversations at the same time,
