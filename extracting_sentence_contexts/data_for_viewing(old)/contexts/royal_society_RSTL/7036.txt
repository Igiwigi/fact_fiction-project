60 times that magnitude would be required merely to fill the valley to the leyel of the
high-level gravels, without taking into consideration the more rapid discharge. But
neither in this nor in the other cases of modern times, are we aware of an increase
in the volume of water, during floods in these regions, to many times the ordinary
mean average, whereas we see that in a case 8uch as is presented at Amiens a flood
having a volume five hundred times that mean would be required to reach the beds of
St. Acheul.

This I conceive is sufficient to prove that the high-level valley grayels cannot be
ascribed to floods of the present rivers, as has been, even of late, suggested. The only
means adequate to fill, under existing conditions, the river-valleys of the Waveney, the
Ouse, the Somme, and still more of the Seine, would be the ingress of the sea; but such a
supposition is at once refuted by the fact of the prevalence of land and freshwater
Shells in both the high- and low-level gravels, and the absence of marine remains unless
immediately adjacent to the present coast. If therefore neither the supposition of river-
floods, nor of a different relative level of land and sea allowing the latter to penetrate
up the valleys, be admissible, how far are the facts in accordance with the hypothesis
of these depoxits being the alluvia of old rivers, and the yalleys their excayated channels?

Let us in the first instance trace the direction whence the materials have come.

The valley of the Waveney traverses a district formed of Boulder Clay, with under-
lying sands and shingle, reposing on Chalk, which latter comes to the surface in
the upper part of the river's course, and is just visible at Scole. There is little in
the valley-gravels to indicate a distant origin, as most of the debris composing them
