These difficulties in the way of accurate
determinations were, however, by no means the most formidable ; for it was s80on found
that any considerable increase of atmospheric pressure caused both candle- and oil-flames
to throw off large quantities of fuliginous matter, the formation of which could not be
prevented by any amount of draught that could be established in the chimney of the
apparatus. Tence, although the luminosity of the flames was greatly increased, yet it
was obvioudly much less 80 than would have been the case under conditions of more
perfect combustion. In fact it 800n became evident that the determinations of increase
of luminosity by compression must be made in a manner precisely the reyerse of that
employed for the corresponding determinations in rarefied air ; for whilst in the latter
case the experiments were made with flames, which at ordinary atmospheric pressure
were saturated with carbon particles, in the former it was found necessary to commence
with flames which were very feebly, or not at all luminous at common Ppressures. Such
is the effect of compressed air in determining the precipitation of carbon particles
within the flame, that a small alcohol lamp, which at the ordinary pressure burnt with
a pure blue flame, became highly luminous when placed under a pressure of four atmoÂ»
spheres ; and it can scarcely be doubted that at a pressure of five or six atmospheres, its
luminosity would be equal to that of sperm oil burning at atmospheric pressure. The apparatus employed, and which is shown in-Plate XVIL.
