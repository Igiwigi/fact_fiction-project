ATM is also required for het-
erochromatin expansion in Drosophila [13], but it is still unclear
whether Kap1/Bonus and its phosphorylation also contribute
to this response. Finally, while heterochromatin expansion might facilitate
the movement of repair sites, such as by releasing constraints
due to compaction and by facilitating the ‘looping’ of DNA
sequences to outside the domain for repair, this global response
is not sufficient for relocalization of DSBs [55]. In fact, relocali-
zation defects have been observed even in conditions when
expansion is normal (e.g. after Nse2/Qjt RNAi in Drosophila
cells) [55], genetically separating heterochromatin expansion
from relocalization (table 1). Furthermore, blocking chromatin
relaxation in mouse cells (e.g. by Kap1pS824 mutation) does
not impair relocalization of DSBs but it affects heterochromatin
repair [34], suggesting a later function of relaxation in DSB pro-
cessing (see also next section). This is consistent with studies
showing that artificial induction of silencing and compaction
of a chromatin locus does not affect early damage signalling
but it impairs repair progression [148].
