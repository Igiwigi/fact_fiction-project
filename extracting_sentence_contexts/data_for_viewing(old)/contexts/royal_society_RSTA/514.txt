[16-18]. This mechanism is summarized in the schematic in figure 2 from Cohen et al. [16]. When
ice coverage is low in BK, large heat fluxes from the insolation-warmed ocean transfer energy
into the overlying atmosphere, which creates a geopotential height anomaly in atmospheric
layers above. This contributes to anomalous upper-level ridging (northward extension of the
jet stream) in the region, which tends to strengthen surface high-pressure downstream. The
clockwise circulation around the high transports cold air from the Arctic into central Asia,
which leads to cold spells as well as distending the trough (southward dip) of the jet stream
over the area. The result of the enhanced ridge/trough couplet is an increase in wave energy,
which is then transferred into the stratosphere, where it can disrupt the polar vortex and lead to
further meandering in the jet stream later in winter. The fact that these three independent studies
identified the same mechanism using different approaches, data sources and model experiments
suggests that the linkage is robust.

A primarily summer mechanism proposed and demonstrated by Petoukhov ef al. [19] and
Coumou ef al. [6] suggests that the weakened poleward gradient owing to AA is conducive to
the formation of a split-jet structure during summer months that acts as a waveguide, trapping
and amplifying large jet-stream waves. These waves then become nearly stationary, creating
persistent weather conditions that have contributed to an increasing number of temperature and
precipitation extremes over Northern Hemisphere continents.

In this paper, new research is discussed that provides further evidence that rapid Arctic
warming is causing a more meandering jet stream. Most Arctic/jet-stream linkages are distinct
