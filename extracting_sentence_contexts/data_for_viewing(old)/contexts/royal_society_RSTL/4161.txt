536 MR. SIBSON ON THE MECHANISM OF RESPIRATION,

expiratory *; the two or three lower fasciculi, from their direction, probably act in
deep inspiration ; but I have not obseryed them to do 80.

88. Serratus posticus inferior, expiratory. See Ny 53. 64. 65,

In the Ass (Ã¾ 53) the four lower fasciculi of the serratus posticus inferior are in-
spiratory, the two upper expiratory, and the two intermediate neutral. In the Dog
($ 64) all the fasciculi are expiratory, while in the Rabbit (F 65) they are all inspi-
ratory. From the direction of the fibres, and from the fact that the fibres are shorter
when the lungs are flaccid than when they are distended, I infer that in Man the
serratus posticus inferior is expiratory.

89. Inspiratory muscles, ordinary respiration.

I have observed the following muscles to be inspiratory. In ordinary inspiration,
the levator anguli scapulze draws the scapula upwards away from the ribs 80 as to
allow them unembarrassed play. The serratus posticus superior (I have een it act
in the Dog and the Ass) draws upwards and outwards the snperior ribs into which it
is inserted.

90. Deep or difficult inspiration.
