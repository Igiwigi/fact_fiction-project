The advantages of this method are obvious. In the first place, it is possible to
follow the behaviour of the cell under the microscope, and to make drawings of the
same object in successive stages, because the gelatine holds it in position all the time.
Secondly, a culture of guaranteed character and purity can be prepared from the
colony which results sooner or later from the budding of the yeast, by merely
touching it with a capillary pipette and infecting a flask or tube. And, thirdly, the
culture so obtained is known to be derived none a single progenitor, the behaviour of
which is definitely known.

This method is less readily applicable in detail to the study of the Schizomycetes ;
although I have succeeded once or twice in isolating a single bacterium in a very
small drop, it was necessary in most cases to work with drops containing several
specimens relying on the fact that, in some cases at least, the gelatine keeps
the specimens fixed. But although it is not easy to obtain a colony of bacteria
derived from one thoroughly isolated progenitor, it is comparatively very = to
obtain pure cultures by means of the above method.

The pure culture once obtained, all else is a mere matter of time, and of
discovering the proper environment for the organism.

For the study of the fermentations on a large scale, I found the following method
very convenient. A common soda-water bottle is sterilised by heating, and its cork
(a new one) soaked for several days in an alcoholic solution of corrosive sublimate,
and then for a day in absolute alcohol, and then boiled for at least one hour on
each of two successive days; this cork is perforated previously, and kept below the
