one essentially makes a finite model of the underlying geometry. We have here
the unsatisfactory situation where the physicist proposes a functional integral
an average over all fields—which, if well defined, clearly describes a topological
invariant. On the other hand, to establish that it defines a topological quantum
field theory satisfying the axioms, we have to follow the implications of taking a
knot, projecting it on a plane and stating what happens to the Jones polynomial
under some basic moves. The nitty-gritty of combinatorics is the only rigorous
hold we have on a general theory.

8. The future?

One of the issues that divides mathematicians and physicists is the degree of
evidence needed to support a claim. The fact that 10'° zeros of the Riemann
zeta function lie on the critical line has little impact on a mathematician,
while that many experimental verifications might seem substantial evidence to
a physicist. So a number of calculations (with quite surprising results for the

mathematician) were carried out by physicists on specific varieties to test mirror
symmetry, but the degree of generality is still not clear. There are nevertheless
some rigorous theorems exhibiting the presence of mirror symmetry for large
