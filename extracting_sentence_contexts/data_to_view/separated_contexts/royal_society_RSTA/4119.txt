(e.) Direct Heredity. Second Degree.—It we take the mean value of the eight
grandparental correlations, we find it equals °3164, while the mean value of the
regression of offspring on their grandparents is ‘3136. These results are absolutely
incompatible with the *15 required by Mr. Gauron’s unmodified theory, and they in
fact put the theory of blended inheritance entirely out of court. At the same time,
unlike the cases of parental, avuncular, and fraternal inheritance, they cannot be said
to be in good agreement with the value ‘25 required by the theory of exclusive

inheritance. We have to admit that our grandparental data are shorter series than
in the other cases, and that guesses as to grandparents’ eye-colour, based on memory,
miniatures, &c., were more likely to be made.
