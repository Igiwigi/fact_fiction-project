be on the meridian when the resultant was there also. There would be more effect
produced at i than at i, but the contrary character of the dip, in respect of the sun's
place, would not alter the direction of the declination variation.

2931. A cold region of air acting, as at the coming on of night, upon the lines of
magnetic force of the earth, would, by virtue of its paramagnetic character (2865.),
produce corresponding effects both of inclination and declination, but in the contrary
direction.

2932. Thus the lines of force which issne from the earth at all places upon its sur-
face where there is any dip, will, by the hypothesis, under the daily influence of the
sun, describe by their ascending parts a closed curve or irregular cone, the apex of
which is below. As a fact this result is perfectly well known, but its accordance with
the hypothesis is important for the latter. The mean position of the free needle will

to the mean is an important indication of the amount and position of the variable
