59 N. lat. and 5? 8. lat. with those between 5* and 20? to the North and of 5* to 30® to
the South, we find the interesting fact that the water flowing in the vicinity of the
Equator contains less salt than that which flows both to the north and to the south of
it. For the equatorial region (5* S. to 5* N.) the mean. of six obseryations is 35-575,
per 1000; or if we leave out a sample from Sir Janes Ross, from 150 fathoms' depth
(that from the swrface is wanting), it is 35:520. From 5* to 20® N. the mean of eight
analyses is 36-279, and from 5? to 30* S. the mean of six analyses is 36-631 per 1000.
This difference is still more striking on comparing the salinity of the equatorial region
with that of the northern Atlantic region (second region), whose mean is 35'932 per
1000 salt. Tt deserves further attention, that the maximum of the equatorial region is
below the mean of its neighbours both to the south and to the north. Tt appears to me
that this curious fact can be explained only by the vast quantity of fresh water which
the Niger, the Ogaway, and a number of other West African rivers carry in this region
into the sea, which all gets into the equatorial current, and moves to the westward. It
is evident that this warm water must increase its relative quantity of salt by eyaporation
during its motion across the Atlantic, and a comparison of the analyses of the single
samples of the water from the equatorial current shows that this effect really takes
place. The easternmost sample contains the minimum, with 34'238 per 1000, and the
two westernmost- samples contain the greatest quantity of salt, with 36-084. Thus the
equatorial current appears as a continuation of the large West African rivers of the
equatorial zone, which dilute the sea-water of the equatorial region with about 8 per
cent. of fresh water, and thus counteract the great evaporation. While the equatorial
current, continues its course along the north-east coast of South America, it receives and
carries with it the waters of the Paranahyba, the Araguai, the Amazon river, the Ese-
