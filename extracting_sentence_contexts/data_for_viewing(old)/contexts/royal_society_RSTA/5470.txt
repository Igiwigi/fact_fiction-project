quantum mechanics that few doubted this intriguing model of the fundamental
differences between metals and non-metals. Moreover, a basic approximation
in the model for both metals and non-metals was that each electron moved
independently of all other electrons; that is, no account was taken of the electron
electron (Coulomb) repulsive interactions. Bloch (1980) himself admitted to an
uneasy feeling that this model of independent electrons, i.e. a model in which
electron—electron interactions are not considered, might represent a rather poor
approximation, even in the case of highly conducting free electrons in metals.

Although widely accepted at the time, this criterion has since been proved to
be incomplete. In particular, it was recognized that there are classes of materials
which, if described according to Wilson’s (1931a,b) scheme, should be metallic
conductors but are in fact non-metals.

Thus, de Boer & Verwey (1937), in one of the earliest studies of the electrical
properties of transition metal oxides, pointed out that nickel oxide, for example, is
a green semiconductor, which according to the Wilson model should be a metallic
conductor owing to the fact that the eight d electrons of the Ni?*+ ion would
only partly fill any 3d electronic band. In the discussions following de Boer &
Verwey’s (1937) paper, Mott & Peierls (1937)? built upon some of those authors’
