(unforced po = 0). Figures 4 and 5 summarize the computations using a continuation method with
a Newton iteration at every step. These figures show the bifurcation branches for both depression
and elevation waves with and without a forcing. Dashed lines show the forced waves, which were
used as a starting point for the computations of free solitary waves and computed for U < cin,
and solid lines are the solitary waves without a forcing.

Figure 6 shows the comparison of the branches of solutions of solitary waves, normalized by
Fmin in each case. The dashed line is for infinite depth and the solid line is for h = 1. For infinite
depth, it can be shown that in non-dimensional units Fin © 0.4725 and for h=1, Fmin © 1.0272.
These are the values used to normalize the horizontal axis. If these solitary branches bifurcated
from Fin, then they would be shown to originate from F=1lin figure 6. However, this is not the
case and the authors believe this is due to numerical errors introduced by truncation or a grid that
is too coarse. These numerical difficulties are related to the fact that the solitary waves become
more and more oscillatory and less localized as the bifurcation points are approached. Similar
difficulties have been encountered previously for gravity—capillary waves (e.g. [42]).

Figure 6 (taken together with figures 7-10) shows that solitary waves in finite depth have
a smaller free surface slope than those for infinite depth for a similar distance (in F) from the
