This purpose (proving eddy diffusion starting from turbulent transport) has not been
investigated for models based on white noise, to our knowledge. That the average of the solution
of such a stochastic transport-diffusion equation satisfies a deterministic diffusion equation with
enhanced diffusion operator is an obvious fact well recognized in the literature; see for instance
[7, p. 419]. But the behaviour of a random field and its average can be completely different;
a precise investigation of conditions under which they are close, and thus also the random
field itself behaves (in the weak sense) as being subject to a modified diffusion operator (eddy
dissipation), seems to be new. We have initiated this research in [10,11] and, in the present
work, we approach the more difficult case of a bounded domain with zero boundary conditions
(opposite to the periodic boundary conditions of previous works), with no-slip boundary
condition for the velocity field, which leads to the fact that the enhanced diffusion part emerging
from the transport term is degenerate at the boundary; this leads to difficulties treated here for
the first time.

The results just discussed are strictly scalar: when a vector field (like a magnetic field) is
passively advected by a white noise velocity field, the average of the solution still satisfies a
deterministic equation with enhanced diffusion but the question whether the random solution
is close to its average is very difficult and still open.

We consider the scalar temperature field T = T(t, x) subject to the equation
