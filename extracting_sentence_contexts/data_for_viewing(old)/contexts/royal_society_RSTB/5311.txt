capillary plexus, but the total capacity of the system is actually so small and, relative

to that of the lymphatics, so nearly negligible, that it is hard to imagine what useful
purpose it can serve. There is little doubt, however, that morphologically these vessels

are closely related to the arterial system, and it is possible, as Favaro suggests, that b
they may be (at least as regards their caudal part) homologous with the arterial '
connectives of the longitudinal vasa vasorum described by Mayer in the tail of
Elasmobranchs. But without more knowledge, particularly of their condition in
primitive Fishes, it is impossible as yet to make any very definite statements as to
their phylogenetic origin and morphological status.

The facts so far ascertained show clearly, however, that these vessels (as they occur
in the adult fish) are more intimately associated with the lymphatics than with any
other part of the vascular system, and it is therefore to be assumed that their past
history is in some way bound up with the evolution of this system of vessels.

What part they actually played in this evolution cannot be stated with any certainty
until more is known both of their comparative anatomy and embryology, but the facts :
regarding them set forth in this paper, and in the previous publication on Lophius (4),
suggest a picture of what the early history of the rise of the lymphatic system in lower
Vertebrates may have been, and of the part in it taken by the “ fine ”’ vessels.

This picture, although largely a matter of assumption, and therefore purely tentative, |
is not, I think, at variance with the facts revealed by comparative anatomy and by
