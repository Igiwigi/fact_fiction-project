This being so there is no reason why the same thing should not occur in
wild plants. Unfortunately, this is a question to which I have paid little attention. In the summer of 1896 I did, however, notice a number of instances in which the
hygroscope gave either zero or a very low reading, and I connected the fact with the
prolonged drought of the season. Until further observations of the sort can be
made we must rely on experimental evidence and on horticultural experience. Some
interesting questions arise as to the mode of action of the guard cells in dry air.
