McNatty and Tarr (1933) have shown that frogs with a simple lesion of vertical
canals may frequently exhibit a temporary, or non-obligatory, decanaliculate
asymmetry. Because the inequality of the operation in the present case concerns
only the utricles, and because we shall later find the same kind of asymmetry in the
uni-de-utriculate animal, we shall name it de-utriculate. It differs from any
decanaliculate residual pose in the following respects. The asymmetry is greater,
15° to 20° of head-lean representing a maximum for decanaliculate posture. It is
less easily undone and has strong marks of permanency. It includes, too, a greater
range of gradation than the decanaliculate, being in its most exaggerated phase
as pronounced as the extreme stage of asymmetry of an Ewatp frog.

Two questions in relation to the de-utriculate asymmetry deserve comment.
Firstly, the fact that the unisoliutricular frog exhibits different degrees of the
asymmetry is to be correlated with the difficulty of obtaining regular or consistent
figures, when a merely blinded animal or one with two utricular macule
remaining is subjected to slow lateral tilt. Evidently the otolith of the unisoli-
* utricular frog may attain stability at different degrees of inclination of its underlying
macula. Secondly, the fact that the usual degree of spinal torque of the present is
less than that of an Ewatp frog is to be correlated with the presence of vertical
canals in the intact labyrinth of the latter animal. This inference may be experi-
mentally verified. After severance of the nerves to the cristae of its two untouched
vertical canals, an Ewan frog forthwith becomes, as far as posture goes, like the
unisoliutricular animal, its average degree of torque being no greater and no less.

If the unisoliutricular animal has once adopted a position of strong spinal torque
