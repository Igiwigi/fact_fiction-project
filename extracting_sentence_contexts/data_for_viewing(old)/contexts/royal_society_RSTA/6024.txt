where At is the transaction time, and y is the transaction rate. The variable n, on the other hand, is

so that its expectation value vanishes. Numerical simulations in [4] indicated that the time-
asymptotic state of this model was one of complete wealth condensation [4,6,7], also referred
to as total oligarchy, in which all the wealth falls into the hands of a single agent.

It is worth taking a moment to understand why wealth concentrates in this model, in spite of
the fact that both agents are subject to the same rules, and the winner is determined by a fair coin
flip. To see why this is the case, consider the wealth wy of the poorest (wealth rank R = N) agent in
the population. Since the poorest agent in the population is also the poorest in any transaction, we
have Aw = ./y At wy. This means that the final wealth of this agent is either wy = (1 + /yAf)wn
or wh, = (1 — Vy Aw, each with probability 5. This is a multiplicative stochastic process for wn,
but it is additive for log wy, since

log(1 + /y Af) with probability ;
A log wn = log wy — log wn = 1 (2.5)
log(1 — /y Af) with probability pu

whence
1 — 1
