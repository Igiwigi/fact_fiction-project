It will thus be seen that when 7, is small the absolute and partial probable errors
are both large and nearly equal; that when 7, is large the absolute and partial
probable errors differ more widely, but, as both are small in this case, their difference
is not of much importance. Bearing these facts in mind, it will be found that the
reasoning based on the partial error in previous memoirs remains valid, even if the
partial error be replaced, as it generally should be, by the somewhat larger absolute
error.*

(y) If we know definitely the variability of any organ, and we take a definite
group of the general population to find the variability of a second correlated organ,

=, then there will be correlation between the deviation of the variation of this group
& with regard to the first organ from the variation of the first organ in the general
8 population and the deviation of the variation of the group with regard to its second
§ organ from that of the general population’s variation for the second organ. This
S‘correlation is measured by 7}, and thus, if the organs be slightly correlated, it is
