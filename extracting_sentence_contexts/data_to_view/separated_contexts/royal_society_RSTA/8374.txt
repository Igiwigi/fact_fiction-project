After this has been effected, the observations are taken in the following manner. The magnet is set in one of the positions of maximum couple, the current through the
coils is switched on and adjusted to a definite value. Before any readings are taken,
however, the current is reversed several times to ensure a well-defined field, for, as a
couple proportional to the square of the field has to be measured, any inaccuracies in
the value of the field strength, which might be obtained notwithstanding the fact that the
iron of the electromagnet core was extremely soft, would have considerable influence
on the results. Having adjusted the current finally to a definite amount, the value of
the couple was estimated as given below ; the current was then reversed and the couple
determined again. â€˜The same observations were then repeated with the magnet in one
of the other positions of maximum couple. The whole process was carried out every
time for a whole series of different values of the field strength.
