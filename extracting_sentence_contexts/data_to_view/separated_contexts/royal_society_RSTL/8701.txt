J. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSMX.

normal interyal, and when they occur are of the feeblest character. Soon after this
stage has been reached the systoles altogether cease; and in a few seconds after they have
done 80 the animal fails to respond even to the strongest stimuli ; and this, be it remem-
bered, is quite as remarkable a fact in the case of Medus as it is in the case of the
higher animals. 'The time occupied by the whole of this process varies with different
species ; but it is always very brief, namely (speaking from memory) about fifteen seconds
to a minute in the case of Sarsia and eighty seconds to two minutes in that of Aurelia
aurita. But brief as is the time required for chloroform to assert its influence upon
Meduse, it is long as compared with the time required for its effects to pass off when
the animal is again restored to normal sea-water. A specimen of Sarsia which has been
completely anzsthesiated, and s0 to all appearance perfectly dead, resumes its pulsations
a few seconds after being again immersed in unpoisoned water.
