spherical as it does so, until it may equal more than one-third the total bulk of the
nucleolus (fig. 58). Its staining affinity generally resembles that of the de-stained
area of the nucleolus, being usually weakly basophile, but showing considerable affinity
for the acid stain. The substance of the “accumulation” is always homogeneous in
its staining reactions; it never shows a de-stained area, and it is never vacuolated.
The absence of any connection between nucleolar activity and the formation of the
“accumulation” is indicated by the complete absence of any spatial relation between
this structure and either the discharged spherules in the nucleus or the de-stained
area within the nucleolus. Moreover, the simultaneous appearance of the accumu-
lation and completion of yolk formation is also accompanied by a complete cessation
of the growth of the nucleolus, a growth which, as already noted, shows at earlier
stages a remarkably constant relation to that of the egg. The inactivity of the
nucleolus during the formation of the accumulation is further shown by the fact
that nucleoli with a large amount of this accumulated material on their surface

and, therefore, presumably fixed some considerable time after the completion of yolk
formation, do not appear to possess less of the basophile cortical substance than
do those in which the accumulation is absent.
