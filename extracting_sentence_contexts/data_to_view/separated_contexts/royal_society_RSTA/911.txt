This is manifested by the heavy tail characteristics of the corresponding
probability distribution.

2. Extreme events are usually associated with complex tails in the PDF. This complexity
reflects the fact that there is an underlying dynamical mechanism having the form of
nonlinear energy transfer, which may not act uniformly for all intensities of the extreme
event. For example, in an energy conserving system, such as nonlinear waves, although
instabilities can lead to extreme events, these cannot obtain arbitrarily large magnitudes
due to finite energy. Therefore, although nonlinearity can induce spatially localized
extremes, which are reflected as heavy-tailed regimes in the PDE, the latter have bounded
extent because of bounded energy.
