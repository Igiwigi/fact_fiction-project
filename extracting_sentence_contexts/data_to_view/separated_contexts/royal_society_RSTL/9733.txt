per acre of nitrate of soda alone, containing 82 lbs. of nitrogen, or
S approximately the same amount as the 400 Ibs. of ammonia-salts employed on plots
= $5 and 6, attention was called to the fact that the nitrate alone gave considerably more
& produce, containing more nitrogen, much more mineral matter, and falling off much
S less in the later years, than where the ammonia-salts were applied. The herbage, too,

ammonia-salts.
