obviously shows that the same radical Allyl, C; H,, may be as8umed to exist in all
these compounds.
This relation did not escape REYNOLDS, who, in his memoir published about six years

agoÂ®, distinctly sets forth the probability of the transformation of the chloride
bromide of propylene into the oils of garlic and mustard by the action respectively
the sulphide and sulphocyanide of potassium.

The experimental proof of the correctness of this idea was however reserved for
MM. BrerTHELOT and De Luca, and for M. Z1nin. In fact these chemists demonstrated.
that the action of iodide of propylene upon the sulphocyanide of potassium or silver,
gives rise to an oil which is absolutely identical with that furnished by distilling the
seeds of the common mustard (Sinapts nigra) with water.

The admission of a radical allyl (C; H,) analogous to ethyl (C, H,), establishes a
perfect analogy between the compounds derived from propylene and glycerin, and the
several terms of the ethyl-scries.
