The variation of the decay rates C4 with the
Reynolds number may or may not be the same. Among many possibilities, it is interesting to
consider the following possible scenarios: (1) Ce and Cg increase in such a way that the ratio
C.(R,)/Ca(R,) is constant as (5/2)/(3/2) =5/3 or (2) Ce and Cg increase differently, but their
ratio approaches unity for large amplitudes at large Reynolds numbers. Scenario (1) reflects the fact that the dissipation and enstrophy comprise five and three
components, respectively, which is a firm constraint. When all terms e or oF behave similarly
near the singularity [22,24], they contribute equally to the dissipation and enstrophy, implying
that the larger numbers of terms the weaker the fluctuations become via the cancelling of
fluctuations that leads to P(e) < P(2), with a ratio of about C./Cg =5/3. The number of terms
(degrees of freedom in the dissipation and enstrophy) determines the statistics, which is readily
understood in the context of the central limit theorem for very large number of terms in the large
spatial dimensions, as discussed below.
