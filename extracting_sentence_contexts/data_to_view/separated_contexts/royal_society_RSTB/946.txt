As we desired to employ a comparatively simple tissue in further contr
experiments upon the nitrites, and as Frog’s muscle seemed to fulfil this conditio
we instituted the following inquiry into the direct action of the vapours of nitri

| peo the muscles of Rana temporaria. The paralysant action of nitrite is seldom
well developed in instances in which the drug has been administered by injection, no
doubt from the fact that the heart’s activity is apt to be much depressed before there
has been sufficient access of nitrite blood to the muscular system to produce a marked
| effect upon its irritability. All the experiments in this series were made with the
triceps (extensor of the leg) and gastrocnemius of Rana temporaria. One of the
selected pair of muscles was introduced into a muscle chamber which, whilst being
absolutely air-tight, admitted of a connection between the muscle and lever for
gecording purposes.
