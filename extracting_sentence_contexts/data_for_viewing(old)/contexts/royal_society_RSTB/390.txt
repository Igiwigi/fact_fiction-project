diseased, and doubtless the process of pupation was hurried on by their abnormal
condition.

But, while it seems thus probable that the biological value of the gilded appearance
was primarily due to its resemblance to glittering mineral surroundings, it is almost
certain that in the course of time it has come to be used for other purposes. The
most obvious of these is that it may act as a “
possession of unpleasant qualities (taste or smell). But that this cannot be the
original use is, I think, shown by the following considerations :—(1) The extreme

warning” colour, indicating the

specialisation of the means by which the colour is produced, and the fact that it is
probably less effective than the crude combinations and startling contrasts of pigment
colours upon which other warning colours depend; furthermore, belonging to such a
very different type of colour, it does not follow the principle of a general resemblance
between the various warning colours, which offers to insect-eating vertebrates as short
and easy an educational career as possible. (2) The fact of the colour-relation itself,
in which these gilded appearances have been shown to play a very important part.
Now an adjustable colour-relation is the very highest and most complete means
by which protective resemblance to surroundings can be produced, taking cognisance,
as it does, of the inevitable differences between the surroundings of different
individuals. But the object of a warning colour is to render its possessor as unlike its
surroundings as possible, and hence it is something very essentially distinct from a
colour which causes it to resemble its surroundings in the most perfect of all ways.*
