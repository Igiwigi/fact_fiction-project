For strictly positive (or analogously strictly negative)
initial conditions, the solution to (6.1) and (6.2) does not resemble a delay-induced switched state. As a result, for such initial conditions, we do not expect delay-induced states in (1.1) and (1.2). The next section discusses this fact in more detail.

7. Coexistence with fold-induced slow—fast oscillations

Section 3 revealed that, for a given function f and carefully chosen initial conditions close to the
balance point, (1.1) and (1.2) displays delay-induced switched states. Here, we show that this
