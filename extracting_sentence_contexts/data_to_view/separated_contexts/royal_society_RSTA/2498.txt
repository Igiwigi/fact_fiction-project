If we want to get from £ to higher-dimensional ordered geometry, we need to add, beside a
lower-dimension axiom Z8, stating that there are three non-collinear points (here L stands for the
collinearity predicate, defined by L(xyz) :< Z(xyz) v Z(yzx) v Z(zxy) Vx=yVy=ZzVZ=X),

Z8. (Aabc)-L(abc),

the Pasch axiom in the following form, which will be referred to as the outer form (figure 4):

OP. (Vabcde)(3f)—L(abc) A Z(abd)  Z(bec) > Z(afc) A Z(def).

Figure 4. The inner and the outer form of the Pasch axiom. In fact, it was shown in [32, Th. 7, p. 355] that it is enough to require that L(def) holds in the
conclusion instead of Z(def), to obtain the same theory. There is, however, another form of the
Pasch axiom, called the inner form, which states that:

IP. (Vabcde)(3f)—-L(abc) A Z(abd) A Z(aec) > Z(bfc) \ Z(dfe). The outer and inner forms of the Pasch axiom were introduced by Peano [33] as axiom XIII
and axiom XIV.
