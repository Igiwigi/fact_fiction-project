At 40° C.—The spectrum is transmitted, except where the bands occur, as far as
dX 2334°9,

At 10° C.—A similar spectrum, with the bands more conspicuous. On comparing the spectra of the three xylenes (dimethylbenzenes) with that of
benzene by inspection of the original photographs, the greatest similarity is seen
between the meta-xylene and benzene in so far as the grouping of the bands is
concerned, and the positions in which they are situated. There is also the fact that
the bands in meta-xylene are well defined, like those of benzene. Some of the bands
which are apparently common to the two substances are much reduced in width in
meta-xylene, as, for instance, those at AX 2609 and 2606, and those bands in the
spectrum of meta-xylene which lie between dA 2748°7 and 2575 fuse, or merge into one

another rapidly as the temperature rises, and are rendered indistinct by an increasing
general absorption. The correspondence of the one spectrum with the other is best
seen by superposing one on the other ; the groups are then easily identified.
