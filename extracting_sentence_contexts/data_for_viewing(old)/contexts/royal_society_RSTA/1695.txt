the unique solution subject to u(0)=x). We refer to the Epilogue by Nickel [23] for some
thoughts about the underlying philosophy. Such examples are provided for instance by the
two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation and some reaction-diffusion equations (cf. Example 2.3
concerning the latter), see, e.g. [12, Sections III.1, III.2] or [13, ch. 8 and 9].

We now define Koopman linearizations for such systems. A suitable ‘space of observables’ is
the vector space C),(X) of all bounded complex-valued continuous functions on X.

Definition 2.5. For a semiflow g=(y;)1+0 on X, we define the corresponding Koopman
semigroup Ty = (Ty(#))1>0 on Cp(X) by Ty(t)f =f © yt for f ¢ Cp(X) and t > 0.

It is evident that each T,(f) is a linear operator on C,(X), Ty(s + t) = Ty(s)T y(t) holds for all
s,t>0, and Ty(0) = Ide, x). Thus, Jy is in fact a semigroup of linear operators. We now study its
continuity properties and therefore have to consider a suitable topology on Cp(X).

Clearly, C,(X) is a Banach space with respect to the supremum norm || - ||oo. However, besides
the norm topology Tt}... there is a second natural topology on this space, namely the compact-
open topology t, defined by the seminorms px(f) := sup,cx |f(x)| for f € Cp(X) and every compact
subset K C X. Both topologies have their disadvantages: On one hand, the norm topology is too
strong to reflect the properties of X. On the other hand, equipping C,(X) with the compact-open
topology generally does not yield a complete topological vector space. In fact, C},(X) is dense in
the space C(X) of all continuous complex-valued functions on X with respect to the compact-open
