Tensile stress is, of course, only one factor among many
which may be causally related to the parenchymatous development of incipient vascular
tissue. ;
In so far as it is not yet possible to give any adequate account of the development of
a solenostele, the elucidation of the several examples of polycycly which have been recorded
must be regarded as still more remote. Indeed, their chief interest at the moment lies
(i) in the evidence they afford of the potentiality for structural development of the growing
region, and (ii) in the fact that polycycly is not exclusively controlled by genetical factors. In Todea barbara the writer (Wardlaw 1946) has recorded the presence of a vascular strand
in the pith ofa shoot which had received experimental treatment. Examples of polycycly are
normally seen in the Matoniaceae, Cyatheaceae, Marattiaceae, Dicksoniaceae and Pterideae
but not in Dryopteris.
