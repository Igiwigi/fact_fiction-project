But though this is
a consideration which must be given due weight, to regard it as satisfactorily
accounting for the distribution in fig. 1 would be to disregard the significance of the
tendency for the displacement to increase with wave-length which has been
demonstrated in Diagrams 4 and 5. It is further important to note that lines as 208 (A = 4762°87), 213 (X = 4829°18),
217 (A = 4856'57), 228 (A = 4936°02) and 238 (A = 5017°75) do not clearly fall within
either group, also that the line 247 (A = 5477°18) is assigned to the group with large
displacement in spite of the fact that it is reversed unsymmetrically, and would not
be expected, in accordance with previous experience of similarly reversed lines in the
iron spectrum, to belong to a group with the highest rate of displacement. Plotting d/X against wave-length, fig. 2 is obtained, and again the lines 208, 213,
217, 228 and 247 occupy anomalous positions.
