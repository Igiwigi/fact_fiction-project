circumstances, completely screen, in a certain number of cases, both the potential
fertility and the real fecundity of man. Precisely similar circumstances, which will be
considered more at length later, hinder our obtaining in horses a true measure of
fecundity for all cases. We are thus really dealing with a mixture of correlated and
apparently uncorrelated material. In what manner does the influence of this
mixture effect our results ? F
Let a group N consist of n, + n, + 7; -+ ” pairs of individuals. Of these, in the
ease of m, pairs, both individuals have the true value of the character under investi-
ation recorded ; in the case of n. pairs, neither have the true value recorded ; in the
Ease of n; pairs, it is the first individual of the pair which has a true recorded value,
Sand the second an apparent or fictitious value; lastly, in , cases, let the fictitious
value be in the first and the real value in the second individual of the pair. Then
gihere will be no correlation between individuals in the groups 7, 23, 7%. Let r be
vthe correlation in the group m and R that observed in the whole group of
<N = =n+n+n, +7, Let « be the measure of a character in the first, 2’ in the
Second individual. Let M and M’ be the means of the total groups of the two
Bindividuals and &, &’ their standard deviations. In group n, let the corresponding
Sylanitiizes be m,, m’;, 01, o, and a similar notation hold for the other sub- reaps.
“Then Mm, = mM, and o; = 03; Mm, = m, and o, = o%; while m’, =m’, and o,=0;;
Sm, = =M,, 02 = 0»
