The original coloured
sphene is seen passing through a white opaque compound into titanoferrite ; and on
the other hand a colourless sphene occurs which is probably of secondary origin and
results from an alteration of the titanoferrite which originally formed a constituent
of the rock. The other accessory constituents of these interesting pyroxene gneisses are apatite,
which is found enclosed in all the other minerals of the rock, zircon, which is abundant,
and occasionally corundum. The existence of this mineral in these peculiar basic

a S gneisses is a very interesting and, as we shall hereafter show, a very significant fact. <i Some of the chief types of these pyroxene gneisses are illustrated in figs.
