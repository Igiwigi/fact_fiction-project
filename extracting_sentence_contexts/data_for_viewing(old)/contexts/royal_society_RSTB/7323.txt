only a little light on the cones which surround it. Thus if with green light of 5600A the
central cone receives light equal in intensity to 100, then the ring of cones immediately
surrounding it receives light having an intensity of less than 10. The ring of cones which
surround this inner ring receives light equal in intensity to less than 2 and so on. It is
possible that the use of a Zernike (Linfoot 1945) quarter-wave disk would materially improve
the concentration of light on the central cone. The idea of using such a disk at some future
date is being kept in mind.

(129) The effect of intensity of illumination

As soon as stimulation of the retina began, with the apparatus described above, it was
found that not only did the precision of focusing play an important part in determining the
apparent size of the image, but also the intensity of illumination. In fact the sharpest image
was obtained if both focus and intensity were adjusted at the same time. The following
observations were made with the fixation lamp at its brightest, its image being examined
critically with the reducing apparatus. With a lens of 1D before the observerâ€™s eye, the
image of the fixation source as seen in the apparatus appeared to consist of a disk of finite
size with a bright sharp edge. With a lens of 1:25D the image was smaller, but several
narrow bright streaks were seen to proceed from it for a short distance. With a lens of
1-5D the image was still smaller but the streaks longer and more obvious. If with this lens

in use the source was diminished in brightness, then it was found that the streaks became
78-2
