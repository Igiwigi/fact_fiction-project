<In circumstances of conduction, though the electrie displacement (7.e., rotational

Weld) which is related to the current in precisely the same way as the flow in a
ee fluid is related to the vortex filaments which suffice to specify it ; the energy of

current system is thus the kinetic energy of this irrotational flow, the rotational flow

e true current was a fiction, so far as elastic stress in the medium is concerned ; but
has now acquired an objective meaning as the mathematical quantity that serves to
pletely specify the energy of the flow of the medium which is associated with
vement of electrons in bulk, that is, the energy of the magnetic field. The
@dinary electrodynamics of conduction currents is a dynamical problem of the zther
bi which the kinetic energy is a function of the true current, and the potential energy,
hen there is such in the field, is a function of the rotational strain of the medium,
- is, of the zethereal displacement current only.
10. We proceed to apply these ideas to the comparatively simple circumstances of
Bh mode of transmission of regular vibrations by a medium thus constituted. Using
the ordinary vector notation for brevity, let J) denote the actual rotational strain in
the wether, so that d¥/dt is the displacement current ; let d39’/dt denote the true
current due to movement of electrons, and let 33 denote the velocity of the flow of the
