In cardiac striated muscle, RLC phos-
phorylation is constitutive and seems to be needed for the
optimal contractility function [92]. Even though the degree of order in the organization of
smooth muscle actin and myosin filaments is apparently less
than in striated muscle, the degree of actomyosin order in the
smooth muscles could be underestimated. In fact, some struc-
tures in smooth muscle could exhibit rather regular
organization. For example, vinculin-containing dense plaques
are quite regularly arranged in cultured smooth muscle cells
[80]. Further regularity in the organization of the actomyosin
cytoskeleton in smooth muscle cells will hopefully be revealed
in future studies using super-resolution light microscopy.
