N. pa ©. ANDRADE ON THE GROUPINGS AND GENERAL BEHAVIOUR OF

subsidiary hypotheses have to be made, of which the most significant is the neglect
of the viscosity of the fluid. This assumption, which has been generally accepted,
might well have thrown doubt on the validity of Komnte’s theory, since, as a matter
of fact, no striations are formed unless the amplitude of vibration exceeds a certain
threshold value (see Section 2), and it is known that such a threshold value, reached
as we proceed to large velocities, generally signifies that the medium has ceased to
behave even approximately as a perfect fluid. KogEniG supposed that the ridges were formed by the action of the repulsive forces
between the spheres along the axis of the tube. The difficulty arises that, if only
repulsive forces exist in this direction, there seems no reason why the particles should
arrange themselves in regular striations, although if the striations already existed
the variation of the forces with the square of the velocity might be invoked to explain
the fact that the ridges are most widely spaced at the antinode.
