I. TAYLOR ON EDDY MOTION IN THE ATMOSPHERE. 15

If we assume the motion to be horizontal equations (9) become

Eliminating w the equation for v becomes

Taking into consideration the fact that v does not become infinite for infinite values
of z, the solution of this is

Differentiating this twice with respect to z we find

Substituting this value in (11) we find

= 2B*(—A,e-™ cos Be+Ae™ sin Bz).

u = A,e™ cos Bz—Aye~™ sin Be + 5S. <of wi esqesa: «it (18)

The quantity so 5 is the gradient velocity, so that at great heights,

p sin X
v = 0 and ~ is equal to fi gradient velocity. The values of A, and A, will be found by imposing suitable boundary conditions. If
there is slipping at the earth’s surface it seems natural to assume that it is in the
direction of the stress in the fluid.
