* IN the Seventh Series of these Researches I have pointed out the laws which the
diurnal inequality of the height of high water follows, and which I believe had never
before been collected from the facts of observation, or indeed stated at all. I have
also shown that these laws are modified s0 as to exhibit very remarkable differences
at different places, and to give rise to some difficulty in conceiving the mechanical
propagation of the tide-wave. I suggested what appeared to me a possible solution
of the difficulty ; but as this suggestion was founded upon the facts of a few places,
and as other modes of propagation might perhaps also be conceived and adapted to
the same facts, the subject remained incomplete. I resolved therefore to attempt to trace the progress of the wave which brings the
diurnal inequality, on some of the coasts on which simultaneous observations were
made at my request in June 1835, and the present memoir will give some account of
the conclusions to which I have been led by this investigation. The diurnal inequality of the height of high and low water may be conceived to
arise from an oscillating wave, of which the maximum height comes to each place
once in twenty-four (lunar) hours; the minimum height arriving, of course, at the
intermediate twelve hours.
