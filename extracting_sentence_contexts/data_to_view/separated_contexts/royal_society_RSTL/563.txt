which therefore become fickly and ſtinted, and conſequently
do not afford juices fit for making ſugar in either tolerable

quantity or quality,

That theſe ants do not feed on any part of the canes or trees:
affe ed ſeems very clear, for no loſs of ſubſtance im either the
one or the other has ever been obſerved ; nor, have they ever
been ſeen carrying off vegetable ſubſtances of any fort. The!
truth of this will farther appear by the following fact. '

A very fine lime-tree, in the paſture of Mount William
eſtate; at a conſiderable diſtance from any canes, but near the
dwelling houſe, had ſickened and died foon after the ants made
their appearance on that eſtate. After it had remained in that
ſtate, without a ſingle leaf, or the leaft verdure, for ſeveral
months, on examination, a very few ants appeared about 1t ; but
when with the manager's permiſſion it was grubbed out, a moſt
aſtoniſhing quantity of ants and ants neſts, full of eggs, were
found about its roots, all of which were quite dead, and many
of them rotten. ;

That this tree conſtituted no part of their food is quite
certain ; but, while it continued to afford them proper lecurity
for their neſts, they {till continued their abode. On the contrary, there is the greateſt preſumption that theſe
ants are carnivorous, and feed entirely on animal ſubſtances ;
for if a dead infe&; or animal food of any fort, was laid in
their way, it was immediately carried off.
