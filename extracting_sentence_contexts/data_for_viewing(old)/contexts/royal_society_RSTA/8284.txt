acid, precipitating with sodium thiosulphate in the boiling solution, filtering, igniting,
removing traces of iron and proceeding as from the corresponding stage in the method
just described.

Sulphur and Phosphorus.—In order to obtain evidence as to the kind of material
used by Farapay as the base of his alloys it was important to ascertain the proportions
of sulphur and phosphorus in a few typical cases,

Other reasons led to the examination of specimen No. 68/F.2 for sulphur. The
metallographic examination of this specimen showed the presence of sulphides in very
large amounts, which suggested the reason for the considerable deficiency in the sum of
the carbon and iron percentages, not in this case accounted for by the presence of other
metals. Specimen No. 68/F.2 was, in fact, found to contain 1-76 per cent. of sulphur,
and specimens Nos. 67/F.1 and 69/F.3 similar proportions.

Sulphur.—The analytical methods to be described were proved to be unaffected by
the presence of the noble metals. The methods employed for sulphur differed according
to the circumstances. In the more usual case where the sulphur content was normal
in amount, a quantity of 2-5 grams was dissolved in aqua-regia, nitric acid removed
by evaporation with hydrochloric acid, the silica rendered insoluble and filtered off

and the filtrate evaporated until a skin of crystals was formed on the surface. This
