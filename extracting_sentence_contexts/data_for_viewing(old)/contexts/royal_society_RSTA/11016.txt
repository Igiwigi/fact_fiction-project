There is one deduction from this solution theory of re-crystallisation that lends
itself to experimental investigation. If eutectics play an essential part in re-crystal-
lisation, these phenomena should disappear in the total absence of impurities capable
of forming eutectics. In a perfectly pure metal, re-crystallisation by annealing after
severe strain should not occur; but it is almost hopeless to obtain a specimen of such
purity as to justify the conclusion experimentally in this form. The degree of purity
required can be roughly gauged from the fact that 0°1 per cent. of carbon in iron is
easily visible as “pearlite” under the microscope ; so that, probably, an impurity of
one part in one million would vitiate the experiment.

But our conclusion can be narrowed down to more practicable limits by putting it
in this way :—That if the presence of a eutectic is essential to crystalline growth,
then a crystalline boundary free from eutectic should be a barrier to all such growth.
This condition can be approximately realised by means of a weld between two clean-
cut surfaces of a metal. Lead lends itself particularly well to such experiments, as it
welds readily under pressure without the aid of heat. In this way we have obtained
a striking experimental verification of the conclusion deduced from the above theory.

The welds were made in various ways; generally two lead discs about 14 inch in
