An opaque screen placed before the eye, so that only
marginal rays in one meridian reach the retina, causes white light to be spread into a
spectrum. This would not be the case if the eye were achromatic. Lastly there is the
evidence of chromatic stereoscopy (Tscherning 1904), namely, the fact that to most subjects
red objects in the field of vision appear to advance in front of blue ones (see Part VII, p. 586) In consequence of these and other experiments, the statement that the eye is largely,
if not entirely, uncorrected for colour error is well founded. (3) Previous hypotheses

Many hypotheses have been proposed to account for the absence of the effects of
chromatic aberration.
