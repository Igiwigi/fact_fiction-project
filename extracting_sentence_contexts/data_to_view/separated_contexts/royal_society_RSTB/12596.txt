Given a spatial domain QC RÂ® and the stripe HC 2,
where the stromal-derived factor is produced, it requires a
careful reassessment of several aspects, e.g. the cell range of
influence and perception, the non-local cell-cell and cell-
chemicals interaction terms. From a biological point of
view, in a 3D context, we could further enrich the model by
including the fact that, during migration, leading cells are
relatively flat with respect to trailing cells. The latter, in fact,
become taller because they constrict at their apical ends
to acquire apical-basal polarity and reorganize into
epithelial rosettes (a process that from a 2D point of view is
obviously neglected). Data accessibility. This article has no additional data.
