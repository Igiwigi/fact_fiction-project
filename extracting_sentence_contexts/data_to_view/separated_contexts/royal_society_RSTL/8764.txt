In these sections it appears as ordinary paren-
chyma, whilst in radial sections of the same tissue its cells exhibit a tendency to
arrange themselves in semimural fashion, as seen at fig. 27, Ã¾/'. External to the cortical structures just described is another and yet more extensive
one, which appears to have been the primitive tissue of these stems. I infer this from
the fact that in the young twigs (figs. 24 & 25) it is the only cortical tissue observable,
except the epidermal layer (&), and occupies the entire area between that layer and
the central vascular bundle (c). Its thickness relative to the size of the stem is also
well seen in fig. 23, It consists of a coarse but thin-walled parenchyma, the cells of
which are of unequal sizes, but generally about 005. The mean thickness of this
layer in fig. 23 is about 025.
