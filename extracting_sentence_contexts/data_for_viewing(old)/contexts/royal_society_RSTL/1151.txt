viviparous, and a generally received comparison points out the
seeds as the eggs in plants, and the gems as correspondent to
living born foetuses. We cannot conceive, says GARTNER, an
egg where theanimal,when coming forth, does not leave the shell
behind ; and, in the sxame manner, we cannot conceive a seed
where the coats are not left behind in the germination. The
grains of the Ulve, Ceramiums, &c. according to him, do not
leave any coat when they germinate, and are consequently
gemme carpomorphe. Every candid naturalist will easjly
acknowledge, that we are not possessed of observations suffi-
ciently decisive to enable us to speak dogmatically, on pheno-
mena 80 little obvious as the germination of these grains. But
I will not contest the fact, I will only examine the principle.

This general rule, of judging whether these grains be seeds
or gems, by their leaving their coats in the germination, or
not, is contradicted by nature, both in the instance of gems,
and in that of eggs. All gems, properly so called, throw off
their scaly hybernacula in the act of germinating. On the
contrary, the eggs of frogs and toads leave no coat at all in their
hatching, because they are possessed of none. Their very
viscous albumen answers, in such an element as water, all the
purposes the testa accomplishes in other eggs. Allowing
GARTNER the exactness of his observation concerning our
plants, the analogy between these submersed algae and the
