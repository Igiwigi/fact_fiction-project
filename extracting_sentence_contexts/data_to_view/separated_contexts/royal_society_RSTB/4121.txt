H. M. WOODCOCK: OBSERVATIONS ON COPROZOIC FLAGELLATES,

an important pair of facts, which may well be correlated. I suggest, therefore,
that there is a close connection between these two developments, namely, the
presence of the binucleate condition and the absence of syngamy. In any endeavour to explain this connection, however, we are at once presented
with the difficult problem whether the binucleate flagellates lost the process of
syngamy first and developed the binucleate condition subsequently, or whether the
latter arose first, and, as a result, all necessity for syngamy became lost.
