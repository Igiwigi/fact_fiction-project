equally applicable when the energy of the extremities only is supposed to be exerted: and it may
be further observed, that although on either of the sides of a magnetic bar, the point of greatest at-

traction of that particular side seems to fall (a little) within the extremity, yet the maximum of force
of every common bar will be found invariably on the surface, terminating the extreme ends,

altogether too feeble to admit of such differences becoming appreciable by the
means employed. In metallic bodies, however, the fact appears to be very de-
cided ; thus, in three specimens of copper, whose dimensions were very nearly
the same, but whose specific gravities varied, the resulting energies were ob-
served to be the greatest in those which had the greatest specific gravity ; as
for example, when the specific gravities were to each other as 8.30 to 8.40, the
resulting number of vibrations amounted in the one instance to twelye, in the
other to fifteen. 'To obtain more than rough approximations to the precise
law by this method, would be extremely difficult, since the metals, as it is
evident, should be procured in a state of great purity, and the dimensions,
previously to taking the specific gravities, adjusted with an accuracy which
only the most refined workmanship can effect ; there is however little doubt,
if the experiment could be accurately tried, that the energy of the same
metallic substance would, as a general result, be in the direct ratio of its
