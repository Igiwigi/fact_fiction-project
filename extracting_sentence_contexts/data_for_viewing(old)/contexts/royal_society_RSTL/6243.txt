She relation is best seen by means of the positive pentagons; thus, guoad 5, in the
Hentagons 12345 and 21435, the points adjacent to 5 in the one of them are the points
Z, 3, and in the other of them the complementary points 1, 4; and s0 in the other cases.
he fivefold correspondence is shown by the symbolical equations

E 1=16, 24, 35,
S 2=12, 34, 56,
5 3=15, 23, 46,
E 4=13, 26, 36,

5=14, 25, 36,

which, in fact, indicate the combinations of the 9's which correspond to the several roots
of the quintic.

11. It is proper to notice that the right-hand sides of the last-mentioned equations
contain all the duads formed with the six numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, each duad once, and
once only. There are in all six 8uch synthemes of duads, viz.
