atmosphere as a mechanistic probe and showed that fullerene growth could still occur, thus ruling

out any mechanism that did not proceed through closed cages. In addition, it showed that adatom 3

Also, in recent times, there have been several works confirming, theoretically, that the SW 1S

transformation in fullerenes is catalysed by hydrogen [18] and by adatoms [19].

Now, we return to graphene. Almost all early defect calculations claiming to represent graphite
were, in fact, based on graphene, and this goes for nearly all calculations of the vacancy
[20-23] and the analogue of the SW transformation in graphite [9,13,24]. In the case of finite
graphene segments, these generally had hydrogenated edges and were thus polycyclic aromatic

hydrocarbons (PAHs). Do

pentagon and heptagon) as what has become known as the SW defect in graphene. Since the : S
