times, for instance, of the hatching of the various clutches of eggs was little more than a
week, and no differences in time were found between birds nesting at the tops of the Dales
and those nesting on the plain of York. Individual pairs which were markedly out of
synchronization with the rest of the population appeared to have had their nests or first
clutches destroyed. Owing probably to the extraordinarily hard winter the synchronization
of nesting in the spring of 1940 was not nearly so precise, and many birds, although they
paired and built nests, failed to produce any eggs at all.

As will be described in detail, it was found that the male starlings do not breed until
their second year of life, whereas the female starlings breed in their first year. In Holland,
Kluijver (1935) has noted that the majority of males breed for the first time in their second
year and the majority of females in their first year, and in Latvia, Vilks & Transehe (1933)
have also recorded a female breeding in its first year. These facts are interesting in view of
the great preponderance of males over females in the starling population, a preponderance
which not infrequently leads to polyandry (Grabham 1895 ; Newstead 1908). Of the 786 birds
shot in the course of this enquiry, 559, or 71-1 %, were males. This proportion agrees closely
with that given for the starling in the United States of America by Hicks (1934), who found
that out of a total of 3161 birds, 2148, or 67-9Â°%, were males. In Holland, Kluijver (1935)
has stated that there are more males than females, but although such large numbers of

birds have not been examined, the preponderance of males over females in that country
does not appear to be so extreme. Brouwer (1929) found a proportion of 159 males to
