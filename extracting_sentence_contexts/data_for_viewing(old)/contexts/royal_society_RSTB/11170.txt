guppies have proved to be able to discriminate between 3 and 4
items in motion [33]. As the general configuration of items in
motion is continuously dynamic and no stable pattern can be
recognized, canonical pattern recognition does not seem to
be a primary cue in their relative numerosity judgements.

(c) Fish exhibit inter-individual differences in numerical
tasks

Inter-individual differences in numerical abilities are a promi-
nent research field in human studies (e.g. [62]), but very little
about this topic is known for most species. Part of the problem
is due to the fact that sample size in most studies is generally
too small to permit any conclusion on inter-individual variabil-
ity in the population. In addition, until recently, researchers
primarily addressed whether a given species had the cognitive
ability to process numerical information and have only recently
begun to pay attention to differences within the same species.

No study has directly investigated this issue in fish, but
mounting indirect evidence supports the existence of inter-
individual variability in quantitative tasks. A recent study
used a semi-naturalistic procedure that allowed long training
to be performed on fish [23]. The fish underwent a series of
discrimination tasks of increasing difficulty. They started
