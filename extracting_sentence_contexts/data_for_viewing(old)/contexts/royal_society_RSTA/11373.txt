practically zero. The reduced readings of the barometer and manometer were
757째5 millims. and 757째7 millims. respectively. It was estimated that the quantity
of palladium black in the calorimeter was now in a position to occlude over 110 cub.
centims. of hydrogen, which was admitted in four separate fractions.

In estimating the amount of hydrogen actually occluded in each case, account was
taken of the unabsorbed hydrogen existing in the experimental tube before and after
the admission of the gas from the burette. The quantity of unabsorbed hydrogen
was ascertained from the known capacity of the apparatus (6째30 cub. centims.), its
temperature, viz., 0째 C., and the pressure indicated by the manometer.

The deflection of the mercury meniscus in the capillary tube of the calorimeter was
corrected, when necessary, for the slight errors due to the fact that the bore of the
tube was not quite uniform. The results are given below in tabular form.
