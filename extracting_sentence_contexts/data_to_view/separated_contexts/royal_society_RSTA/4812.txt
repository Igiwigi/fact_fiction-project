Anthracenes are representative examples of molecules showing TSLIFs [17]. Early researches
on meso-substituted anthracenes found that their fluorescence yields increase with decreasing
temperature and no triplet formation can be detected at 77 K [18,19]. These facts are explained by
thermally activated ISC from S, to T2. Out of interest in this ISC from S, to Tz, Kobayashi et al. [20]
found that the RISC from Tz to S; also occurred when the metastable T; was further excited into
higher triplet states. Through systematical study, they established the quantum yields of T2 >
S; ISC (Â®s) of anthracene, 9-methylanthracene, 9-phenylanthracene, 9,10-dichloroanthracene
and 9,10-dibromoanthracene to be 2.6 x 1075, 3.6 x 1074, 4.7 x 1074, 1.5 x 10-2 and 2.7 x 107,
respectively.
