IV. 4 Memoir on Abstract Geometry. By Professor CxyLey, F.R.S.

Received October 14,—Read December 16, 1869,

1 xrpa1r to the Society the present exposition of some of the elementary principles of an
Abstract m-dimensional Geometry. 'The science presents itself in two ways,—as a legi-
timate extension of the ordinary two- and three-dimensional geometries; and as a need
in these geometries and in analysis generally. In fact whenever we are concerned with
quantities connected together in any manner, and which are, or are considered as variable
or determinable, then the nature of the relation between the quantities is frequently
rendered more intelligible by regarding them (if only two or three in number) as the
coordinates of a point in a plane or in space : for more than three quantities there is,
from the greater complexity of the case, the greater need of such a representation ; but
this can only be obtained by means of the notion of a space of the proper dimensionality ;
and to use such representation, we require the geometry of such space. An important
instance in plane geometry has actually presented itself in the question of the determi-
nation of the number of the curves which satisfy given conditions: the conditions imply
relations between the coefficients in the equation of the curve; and for the better under-
standing of these relations it was expedient to consider the coefficients as the coordinates
of a point in a space of the proper dimensionality.
