ficant difference in the extension of their fibres.

The figures given in Table II were compared with those for fibre elongation
generally (CHATTAWAyY 1936); it was found that the values in the Sterculiaceae are
consistently higher than those for a random selection of woods covering several
families, though not higher than values met with in some other advanced families.
Furthermore, they agree well with values calculated for this family from the data
given by Batey (1920).

Unfortunately very little appears to be known about the causes of fibre extension,
and consequently it is impossible to offer any explanation of the above phenomenon.
But it is interesting to notice that in a recent discussion on libriform fibres and fibre
tracheids (BAILEY 1936; REINDERS 1935), BAILEY comments on the fact that tracheids
elongate less during differentiation than either fibre tracheids or libriform fibres.
Many of the lowest values for elongation given by the present author (CHaTrAwAy
1936) occur in woods with fibre tracheids, while high values predominate in families
such as this, in which the fibres are libriform. This confirms the idea that there may be
some phylogenetic significance to be attached to the type of pitting of the fibre walls,
in spite of the overlapping of types that occurs in many families.

The fibres in some genera (Cola, Sterculia B, Heritiera, Eribroma and Octolobus) may
show little sign of being storeyed, even where the parenchyma is regularly storeyed,
the individual fibres being thin and thread-like, with little or no indication of a
““bauchig”’ middle portion. These fibres show a greater amount of extension than the
fibres of other genera that are “‘bauchig” and retain their storeyed arrangement. This
