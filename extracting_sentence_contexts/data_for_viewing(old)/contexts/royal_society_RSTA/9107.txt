It is to be noted, on the assumption that there is no hysteresis in the glass of the
piezometer,t that the same readings (corrected for small displacements of the upper
meniscus and for any change in the temperature of the bath) should be obtained
whether going up or going down the scale of pressures. When these readings are
noticeably divergent we have generally found that a pellet of solution has formed
across the mercury thread and therefore such experiments should be viewed with
suspicion. On the other hand even if the readings are the same it is no proof of a

* In later work this difficulty is overcome by fastening a small capsule containing mercury to the
bottom of the stem.

+ We would draw attention to a source of error which has been observed in one of the Jena-glass
piezometers. This error lies in the fact that some of the air bubbles usually present in capillary tubing
(as long hair-like lines) communicate with the bore of the tube; when under pressure minute threads
of mercury can be seen to be moving in these capillaries.

good experiment; there may have been liquid left behind on the capillary walls
which is picked up again when the meniscus reaches it on its downward journey,
but we have reason to think that this seldom occurs when changing the pressure
slowly as already described.
