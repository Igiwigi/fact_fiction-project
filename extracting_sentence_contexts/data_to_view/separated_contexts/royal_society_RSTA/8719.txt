For a greater number of wires, if the system is divided into four equal
sections the distribution of loss is still such that approximately 93 per cent. of the loss
occurs in the two outer sections. This may be of importance in measurements of
effective resistance based on the determination of the increase in temperature of the
system, and account should be taken of the possibility of a temperature distribution for
alternating currents different from that for direct currents.

(13) Distribution of Resistance in Single Layer System.—The distribution of eddy-current
losses throughout the system does not represent the distribution of effective resistance. In fact the energy required to produce the losses in any wire is supplied by the currents
flowing in the other wires, and therefore the other wires behave as if certain resistances
were added to them. ‘

In order to determine these equivalent resistances, consider two coils (I) and (II)
carrying currents I,, I, which produce fields acting on a cylinder carrying no current. Ultimately these currents will be assumed equal, so that for simplicity they will be
considered in phase. Let the fields in the neighbourhood of the cylinder due to these
currents have intensities
