222 DR. W. H. YOUNG ON THE GENERAL THEORY OF INTEGRATION.

can be generalised. This theory has in fact taught us on the one hand that many of
the theorems hitherto stated for finite numbers are true with or without modification
for a countably infinite number, and on the other hand that closed sets of points
possess many of the properties of intervals. We may, in accordance with these facts,
divide the segment (1) into an infinite number of non-overlapping intervals, in which
case, however, seeing that such a set of intervals always has points which are
external or semi-external to them, we must in general add a set of points to the
set of intervals, if the division of the segment is to be properly performed, that is,
if all the points of the segment are to be accounted for in our division ; or, more
generally, (2) into a finite or countably infinite number of sets of points. What would be the effect on the Riemann and Darboux definitions, if in those
definitions the word “finite” were replaced by “ countably infinite,” and the word
“interval” by “set of points”?
