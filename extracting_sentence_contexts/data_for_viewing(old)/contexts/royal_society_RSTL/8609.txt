Planarian the water-vascular system very imperfectly, but two long and stout © Seiten-
Nerven ” very plainly. Every line of evidence seems to point to the fact that in all
Planarians, and indeed all worms in which a special blood-system is not differentiated
off from the primitive vascular system or body-cavity, the nervous system lies within
the vascular canals and spaces ; and in Bipalivm, as will be een in the 8equel, what,
was believed to be the neryous system was found to occupy such a position.

It is an interesting fact, and I believe new to science, that there exist Planarians
which contain in their body-fluids hemoglobin, I detected this substance by means of
the spectroscope in a small Planarian, apparently a species of Derostomum (Scuanpa,
Neue wirb. Thiere, Band i. Hiilfte i. Taf. i. fig. 8), which I found infesting in considerable
abundance the surface of the integument of an echinoderm, one of the Clypeastride, Ag.,
which abounds at Suez. It is possible that the red colour of many other Planarians is
due to the presence of hemoglobin. A red tinge may be seen at the base of the eye of
Dendrocelum lacteum, but I found it too faint to give any absorption-spectrum. The
reddish colour of the ganglia of Nemertines would be well worth testing.

Generative System.—The generative organs of Land-Planarians have hitherto been
very imperfectly described, these animals having apparently never before been studied
by means of sections, which is the only way of arriving at a satisfactory result in the
