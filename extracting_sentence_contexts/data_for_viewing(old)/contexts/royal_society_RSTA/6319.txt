The comparatively recent Marginal Ice Zone Program [5] and the Arctic Sea State and Boundary
Layer Physics Program [6] in which I participated [7,8] have further added immeasurably
and somewhat serendipitously to our knowledge of the MIZ as a result of changes in the
Arctic sea ice cover brought about by global climate warming. Both were ONR Departmental
Research Initiatives. Like MIZEX, the current theme issue of Philosophical Transactions of the
Royal Society A is multifaceted, yet it also targets specific features of MIZs that continue
to receive enduring attention. Notwithstanding the immense progress made throughout and
immediately following MIZEX, especially in understanding MIZ oceanography and meteorology,
this emphasis arises because of the staggering complexity of the processes occurring in the MIZ
in regard to how it influences and is influenced by the neighbouring open ocean and contiguous
interior pack ice. Global climate warming has intensified and increased the frequency of storms
since MIZEX as well, recalling that ocean waves and swell are a prime determinant of MIZ
morphologyâ€”in fact, of whether an MIZ forms at all and of how it matures. Accordingly,
three dominant themes emerge in the documented research that follows this preface: wave
propagation across the MIZ; floe size distributions; and sea ice dynamics and breakup. A
mini review that considers the wider implications of each topic to other areas of science
precedes more technically orientated papers, but it is also important to recognize that the
substance of the three threads is intertwined with ocean wave impacts having preponderant
leverage.

My personal interest in wave-ice interactions was originally stimulated by Gordon Robin and
nurtured by Peter Wadhams, although my background initially engendered a greater proclivity
towards mathematical modelling as opposed to experiment. This mindset changed rapidly as I
discovered the delights of fieldwork in the polar and subpolar seas of both hemispheres and came
to believe passionately that the development of theory and the gathering of validating data must
