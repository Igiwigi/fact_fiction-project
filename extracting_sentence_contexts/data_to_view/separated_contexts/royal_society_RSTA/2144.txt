On the other hand, if Vyq itself reduces below threshold, no
matter what value the VAC produces the voltage to PWM part will produce relatively large errors
as the perceptronâ€™s glue logic would kick in anyway. Also of concern is the accumulation of nonlinearity after both parts of the perceptron have
been put together, and this nonlinearity continues to increase once the perceptron is connected in
series across multiple stages of an NN of non-trivial depth. Another issue is the fact that there may be difficulties for the perceptron to implement AFs
other than flavours of ReLU. Of particular concern is that the perceptron, because of the use of


the voltage across a grounded capacitor to represent a crucial value, only works in the positive
value domain. Future research topics include the better matching between the constituent parts of the
perceptron to overcome the threshold and nonlinearity problems and the extension of the
perceptron to cover a larger set of AFs.

In the single perceptron, two-perceptron and three-perceptron experiments, both the resultant
model and the Cadence simulations indicate that the voltage to PWM converter, without
modifications, may serve as an approximate capped ReLU AF, qualitatively.
