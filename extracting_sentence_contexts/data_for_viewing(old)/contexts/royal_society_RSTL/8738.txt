the lymphatics leading from infiltrated parts dilated and plugged up by dense myce-

lium and lymph-corpuscles. I have also obseryed veins densely packed with lymph-

corpuscles and mycelium.

It can therefore be easily understood that inasmuch as the lymphatics and yeins of
the deeper parts of the pocks become prevented from carrying away the morbid products,
and inasmuch as there is a constant addition of them, as shown by the increase of the
infiltration, it must naturally lead to a stagnation in the passages leading to the efferent
vessels, which stagnation may be the cause of the morbid material of these passages
being gradually carried in another direction, 7.6. towards the surface. This view,
as we shall see presently, is further snpported by the fact that the lymph-corpuscles
of the papillary tisswe not only find their way in great numbers into the rete Malpighii,
but also into the epithelium of the sebaceous glands, the hair-follicles, and the 8weat-
glands, which structures become surrounded by more and more numerous layers of these
bodies. That the spontaneous moyement, of the Iymph-corpuscles is to a certain extent
of importance in determining their migration, cannot of course be denied; but it is
improbable that this is the only factor, for it is very difficult to see how that could be
the case, considering how densely they are packed in some places.

The formation of the vesicular cavities invariably depends on the transformation of
individual epithelial cells of the middle layer of the rete (Sometimes nearer, sometimes
further from the surface) into spherical or elliptical vesicular structures, which possess
a thick membrane and clear contents. The process of transformation is usually as
