A true wall (ef pp. 158, 159) was primitively present in all these families, and has been
retained in the great majority of genera, But especially among the Stylinids, more
rarely among the other three families, the true wall became obsolete, and the inner
limit between tabulee and dissepiments became fixed as the wall of the corallite,
This only helped to enlarge the area occupied by ccenenchyme in these types, although
the original limit is, in many cases, perhaps still indicated in living polyps by the fact
that a fairly wide lip or “edge-zone” with mesenteries extends beyond the wall of
the corallite, and continues the mesenterial canals beyond the visceral cavity of the
polyp over the costie and ccsnenchyme, This edge-zone passes then imperceptibly
into true ccenosareal flesh, clothing these parts of the ccenenchyme which are more
remote from the corallites, and as a rule less regularly built.

Septocorallia.

I have already described under Murocorallia the one type of trabecular structure
and direction in the septum, which characterised a very large number of the earliest
known corals. The other type which stood in strong contradistinction to it was
shown by the ancient Cyathophyllids. The septa of the Cyathophyllids were as a
