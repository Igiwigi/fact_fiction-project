Figure 6. Perception of the different images through the SR-detector. Parameters: Vth = 1.2 and o = 0.1. (a) Cross-
covariance C,; of each image against the noise intensity 7”. Dashed lines are guides to the eye. The best perceived images are
displayed for the optimal noise intensity y* in subfigures (b—d). (b) image 1 requires y* = 0.39 to achieve C,r(y*) = 0.274.
(c) Image 2 requires y * = 0.5 to achieve C,7(y*) = 0.322. (d) Image 3 requires y * = 0.59 to achieve C,7(y*) = 0.199. (e)
Image 4 requires y* = 0.465 to achieve C)7(y*) = 0.208.

figure 6b-d the best image perceived when the noise intensity is tuned to the noise level y* which
maximizes the cross-covariance. Except for the first image of the Coloseum, SR reveals quite fairly
the information contained in each subthreshold initial image. In fact, the effect is less pronounced
for the image of the Coloseum owing to its very low resolution of N? = 64? pixels, which is not
the most appropriate resolution to observe image details. Note that we have reported in table 1 all
the necessary features of our SR-detector, that is for each initial image the image size, the optimal
noise intensity y* and the best value of the cross-covariance C;7 achieved for y = y*. These values
will be of crucial interest to develop the VR-detectors presented in the next section.

5. Vibrational resonance-based detector

By setting the switch control c of the detector to c=1, the perturbation P of figure 3 defined by
equation (3.4) takes the form of the following sine function:
