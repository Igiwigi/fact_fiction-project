from a mesoderm, as appears certain in the latest accounts of the matter from M.
Lacazre-Durnrens'sF researches on Astroides calyeularis, and from those of KowaLewsky{
on Astraa and on Aleyonium digitatum. In Alcyonium two elements are recognized by
KowALEWSKY as composing in the embryo the © intermediate layer ” (mesoderm), viz.
a homogeneous membrana propria, which lies internally and penetrates the mesenterial
folds, and a peculiar thin layer of cells, which lies externally to this membrana propria.
1t is from this thin layer of cells that the gelatinous connective tissue, the spicules, and
canal networks are formed. This special layer does not exist in other corals nor in
Cerianthus.

The close resemblance in the histological structure of the coralla formed by animals
80 different as Alcyonaria (Zeliopora cerulea), Zoantharia, and Hydroida is a remarkable
fact. The corallum of 1illepors is distinguished from all other coralla by the presence
within it of systems of canals branching in an arborescent manner. The presence of
8uch structures in fossil corals will be sufficient evidence of the affinities of such corals
with Millepora and the Hydroida. Now that Zeliopora has been shown to be an
Alcyonarian, there remains only one living genus, Pliobothrus (POuRTALES), to form with
Millepora the family Milleporide, Of Pliobothrus the soft structures have not been
examined,

No representative of the genus Millepora appears to be known as existing in the fossil
condition, at least none such is mentioned in QueNsTEDT's © Petrefactenkunde * or by
M. Muxz-Epwarps. A careful study of the internal structure of the various extinct
corals which have been associated with eliopora and Millepora amongst the Tabulata
would show which of them have real affinities with 2/illepora. It would be well if the
