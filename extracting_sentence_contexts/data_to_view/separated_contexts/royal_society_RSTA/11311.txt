In the iron spectrum the phenomenon made its appearance in the neighbourhood of
25 atmospheres, where, because the displacements are not very large, and because of
the unexpected nature of the occurrence, some doubt was felt about it. But the
remarkable fact that the displacements of the copper lines measured by HumpHREYS
at 69 atmospheres are half the values of the displacements at 70 atmospheres in the
present investigation lends some support to the writer’s original view that at certain
pressures some lines may have two values of the, displacement : within the limits of
error of measurement one is twice that of the other. It is true that HumpHreys
has only measured each line twice and that only six lines have been measured in
common, but the magnitude of the discrepancy should be quite beyond the limits of
error of measurement. It must also be remarked that Humpureys and the writer
