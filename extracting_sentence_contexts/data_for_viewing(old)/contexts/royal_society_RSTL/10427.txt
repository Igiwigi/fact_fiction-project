* The crystalline axes uniformly run parallel to the long and short diagonals, as in
the sketch, 80 that the core is a crystal probably of the rhombic system, and the
outer layer is controlled in its position by this core and has parallel axes with it.

* The larger spicules I can best explain by saying that for a moment, on examining
the slides, I supposed the small ones to be cross sections of the former (larger) ones.
They are like bones filled with marrow under the microscope, the bone and the
marrow representing the core and the outer layer of the small ones, and these being
separated by an amorphous (in one case there were two amorphous layers) layer. In
this case, the long axis of the spicule is a crystallographic axis, And bone and
marrow are orentirt alike.‚Äù

From this, the very interesting fact appears that the spicules are formed by a true
process of crystallisation, though the form and structure of the crystals are modified,
probably by reason of their deposition in an organic viscous medium. This point, as
noted below, is one of much theoretical interest.

In Leptogorgia the characteristic spicules appear in the ectoderm s00n after the
attachment of the larva, They are quite irregularly distributed, and extend up into
the bases of the tentacles. No entodermic spicules were observed.

Review,

My observations on the development of the spicules are in accord with those of
KowaALEvs8KY on the spicules of Sympodium (Zool. Anzeiger, No. 38, 1879), and
