Rivers showed that under these
circumstances the derivation of the KZ causality bounds requires some
modification, and argued that the origin of the bounds lies in the Gaussian
nature of the order parameter, and that using this approach the results can be
well understood. Another long series of experiments, this time on thin superconducting films,
has been conducted by Polturakâ€™s group at Technion in Israel. They have verified
the predictions of the KZ mechanism qualitatively, but interpretation of these
experiments has been hampered by the fact that only the difference between the
numbers of defects and antidefects (the net magnetic flux) was measurable,
whereas one would really like to know the total number of defects and
antidefects, and also their spatial correlations. This is particularly important in
distinguishing the two defect formation mechanisms, which predict very different
correlation patterns. But at this meeting, Polturak (Golubchik et al. 2008)
described a novel magneto-optical detection system, based on the Kerr effect in
EuSe, that should allow this problem to be resolved.
