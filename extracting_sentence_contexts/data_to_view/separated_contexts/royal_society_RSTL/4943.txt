The
principal trunks of the trachez are distinctly visible in the body of the larva long
before the stigmata (by which a communication is established between these tubes and
the external medium) are formed. The air-tubes, however, while yet closed at both
extremities, become filled with a gaseous substance. How is this curious fact to be
explained? In the atmospheric larve they cannot derive their gaseous contents directly
from the external air, for fluids and solids intervene ; nor in the water-larvz can they
absorb the air of the surrounding medium, for they are situated too deeply in the
interior of the body, those few species excepted in which appropriate appendages
are provided for the exposure of the tracheal system. The inference is thus rendered
probable that the trachee of the laryze of Insects, whether their habitat be atmo-
spheric or aquatic, become first filled with gas From the fluid occupying the visceral
cavityâ€”not because they already perform the office of atrating that fluid, but because
their parietes are endowed with the peculiar faculty of absorbing gaseons elements
from fluids by which they may be surrounded.
