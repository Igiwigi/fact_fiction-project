He also has sometimes remarked
that the section of one of the posterior columns causes hypereesthesia on the same side,
and that a section of these two columns produces hypersthesia on the two sides, but
he declares, also, that he has seen the reverse. (See his paper in Mayenpin’s ‘Journal
de Physiologie,’ vol. 8, pp. 191-217.)

‘Two explanations for some of the results of a section of a lateral half of the spinal
cord may be proposed as regards sensibility. Either it may be imagined, as it has
been byseveral German physiologists, that the grey matter has the power of transmitting
sensitive impressions in such a manner, that one lateral half of this substance is suffi-
cient for the two sides of the body, or that the conductors of sensitive impressions
decussate in the spinal cord, so that those which come from the left side of the body

pass into the right side of the spinal cord, and vice versd. The hypothesis of the
Germans may explain the fact: that sensibility persists on the side of the section, but
it is proved to be absolutely inadmissible, by the fact that there is anesthesia on the
opposite side. We will see that the other experiments we have to mention are also
in opposition to the views of the Germans (Stiiuina, Scurrr, and others). On the
contrary, all the facts concur to prove the existence of a decussation.

_ (2) Tf, after having made a first section of a lateral half of the spinal cord in the
dorsal region, on the right side, for instance (see fig. 9, s), and after having ascertained
that the right posterior limb is hyperesthetic, or at least extremely sensitive, we
divide the left lateral half of the spinal cord in the cervical region, we find then that
the right posterior limb loses entirely, or almost entirely, its sensibility.
