functions take their origin apart and run a different course : two
nerves must unite in'the muscles, in/ order to perfect the relations
betwirt the brain and these muscles.

It may be inthe recollection of the Society, that'my first
Paper showed the difference of the nerves of the face; by
dividing one nerve, sensation was destroyed, whilst motion
remained ; and by dividing the other, motion was stopped,
whilst-sensibility remained entire.

Other parts of the nervous 'system since that time have
engaged my attention; and 'it is only now that I am able to
make full use of the facts announced in my first Paper, which
were indeed expected to lead to further improvement of our
knowledge of the animal ceconomy. When I distinguished the
two classes of nerves going to the muscles of the face, and
divided the motor” nerve; and when the muscles were de-
prived of motion by this experiment, the natural question
suggested itself — of what use are the nerves that remain
entire ?

For a time I believed that the fifth nerve, which is the
sensitive nerve. of the head and face, did not terminate in the
substanee of the-muscles, but only passed through them to
the-:skin ; and I was the more: inclined to this belief on ob-
