Sthe second part of this memoir.
"= 1st. The dip of the ancient beds of crystalline and fragmentary matter seen in the
Zprecipices suwrrounding the Val del Bove, are not such as to support the theory of a
=Slinear axis, nor of a single centre of upheayal for Mount Etna.
S 2ndly. The quiquaversal dip of the beds firs observed by S. vox WALTERSHAUSEN
Eaway from an ancient centre, sitnated three miles to the east of the present summit of
SEtna, together with the horizontal or discordant dips of other superimposed layas in the
precipices at the head of the Val del Bove, imply the former existence of at least two
permanent centres of eruption, and the final predominance of that which is 8till in
activity, and which has overwhelmed the smaller or more eastern cone.

3rdly. The convergence of a large number of dikes towards the two supposed perma-
nent centres of eruption is a fact corroborative of the theory above alluded to.

4thly. If 8uch be the structure of Etna, and such the conclusions legitimately dedu-
cible from it, we must abandon the elevation-crater hypothesis; for although one cone
of eruption may envelope and bury another cone of eruption, it is impossible for a cone
of upheayal to mantle round and overwhelm another cone of upheaval 80 as to reduce

the whole mass to one conical mountain,
