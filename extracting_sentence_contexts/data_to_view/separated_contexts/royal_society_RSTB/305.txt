Though it
and the Arran plant possess several features in common, I cannot identify them with
sufficient definiteness to assign the same name to both. This, however, is of no
consequence for the present, since I have not yet given any name to the Arran plant. Rather more important is the fact that M. Renauur speaks of a stem having a solid
vascular axis, like that of Lepidodendron Spenceri, to which stem he has given the
name of L. Rhodumnense.
