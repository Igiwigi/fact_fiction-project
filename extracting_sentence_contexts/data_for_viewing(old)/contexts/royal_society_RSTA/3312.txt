guesses have been freely varied, the origin points (Ro) and range-decaying parameters (yj) of
every Gaussian have been optimized by trial and error. Table 9 displays the stratified RMSD
values of the final PES with respect to all fitted datasets. Thus, chemical accuracy is ensured up
to approximately 334 kJ mol~ above the absolute linear minima with larger deviations occurring
for more repulsive energy strata. The optimum numerical coefficients of equation (3.8) are given
as electronic supplementary material.

Figures 16b, 17b and 18-20 depict the most salient attributes of the full DMBE PES for
triplet Cy. As figure 18 shows, the approximate four-body interaction energy (equation (3.8))
mimics well the expensive set of calculated ab initio points at the ve-CASDC/CBS level of
theory. Note that such a plot corresponds in figure 16b to orthogonal cuts taken along the
Rz and R directions. As clearly seen from figure 18, the four-body term is as repulsive as
300.0 kJmol"! (at ve-CASDC/CBS level) for such geometries. In fact, such a trend is further
exacerbated as long as other regions of the nuclear configuration space are accessed. Yet, the
simple addition of the VER) term makes the triplet linear structure, LCaC de ), to be a true
minimum on the full PES with characteristic bond lengths Rj = R3 = 2.524a9 and Ry = 2.435a9;
such a feature can best be seen from figure 17. Moreover, the four-body term ensures that the
DMBE form reproduces the correct endothermicities for dissociation into Co(a>/Tu) + Co(a> Tu)
