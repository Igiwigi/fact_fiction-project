Across two experiments, the authors gave participants
intertemporal choices and then asked them to rate their confi-
dence in having made the right decisions. Contradicting the
self-control account, confidence did not vary as a function of
whether a participant opted to wait for the delayed reward. Rather, confidence was associated with the difference in sub-
jective valuation between the two possibilities, such that a
participant might in fact be highly confident in selecting $15
now if they independently valued that reward-time combi-
nation much more highly than $20 in a month. These
findings align with recent research [85] questioning self-control
accounts of the classic ‘marshmallow test’ for children [86],
further showing that comparisons of mutually exclusive possi-
bilities are integral to human intertemporal decision-making. Thinking about possibilities may also be essential to causal
reasoning.
