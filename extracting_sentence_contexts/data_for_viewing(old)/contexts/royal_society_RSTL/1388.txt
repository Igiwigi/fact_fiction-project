therefore, even on our earth the heat of any situation depends
upon the aptness of the medium to yield to the impression of
the solar rays, we have only to admit, that on the sun itself,
the elastic fluids composing its atmosphere, and the matter on

its surface, are of such a nature as not to be capable of any ex-
cessive affection from its own rays; and, indeed, this seems to
be proved by the copious emission of them ; for if the elastic
fluids of the atmosphere, or the matter contained on the sur-
face of the sun, were of such a nature as to admit of an easy,
chemical combination with its rays, their emission would be
much impeded.
Another well known fact is, that the' solar focus of the
largest lens, thrown into the air, will occasion no sensible
heat in the place where it "has been kept for a considerable
