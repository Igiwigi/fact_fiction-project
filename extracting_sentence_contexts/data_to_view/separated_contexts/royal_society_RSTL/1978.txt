FrankLiN#, who never lost sight of practical utility in his scientific investi-
gations, from the result of his experiments with coloured cloths on the absorp-
tion of heat, drew the conclusion, © that black clothes are not s0 fit to wear in
a hot sunny climate or season as white ones, because in s8uch clothes the body
is more heated by the sun when we walk abroad and are at the same time
heated by the exercise ; which double heat is apt to bring on putrid, dangerous
feyers;” that soldiers and seamen in tropical climates should have a white
uniform ; that white hats should be generally worn in summer ; and that gar-
den walls for fruit trees would absorb more heat from being blackened. Count RumrorD and Sir Everarp Home, on the contrary, come to a con-
clusion entirely the reverse of this. The Count asserts, that if he were called
upon to live in a very warm climate, he would blacken his skin or wear a black
$hirt ; and Sir EvErasD, from direct experiments on himself and on a negro's
skin, lays it down as evident, © that the power of the sun's rays to scorch the
skins of animals is destroyed when applied to a dark snrface, although the
absolute heat, in consequence of the absorption of the rays, is greater.” Sir
Humenry Davy explains this fact by saying, © that the radiant heat in the
sun's rays is conyerted into sensible heat.” With all deference to the opinion
of this great man, it by no means explains why the surface of the skin was
kept comparatively cool. From the result of the experiments detailed, it is
evident, that if a black surface absorbs caloric in greatest quantity, it also gives
it out in the same proportion ; and thus a circulation of heat is as it were
established, calculated to promote the insensible perspiration, and to keep the
body cool. This view is confirmed by the observed fact of the stronger odour
exhaled by the bodies of black people.
