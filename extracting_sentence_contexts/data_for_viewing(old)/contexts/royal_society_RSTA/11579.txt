oxygen and nitrogen act quite independently of each other in producing the positive

ionisation-—reasons will be adduced later for showing that this is improbable —the
proportion of oxygen to nitrogen required to account for the whole of the leak in
nitrogen at atmospheric pressure would be about 1 to 10,000, Against this it is
necessary to set the following facts :—

(1) The ions in nitrogen appear to be considerably bigger than those in oxygen, as

g
shown by the current E.M.F. curves.

(2) The experiments on air indicate that nitrogen does not simply act as a diluent
to oxygen, but exerts a marked retarding effect on its power of producing positive
ionisation, so that a trace of oxygen present would exert a much smaller effect than
that obtained on the basis of the above calculation.

(3) The positive ionisation in nitrogen varies more rapidly with temperature than
