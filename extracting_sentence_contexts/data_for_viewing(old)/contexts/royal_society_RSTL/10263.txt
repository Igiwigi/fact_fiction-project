Z funnel introduced, and about 20 centims. of the s0ap solution poured in. This

S quantity was sufficient to cover the bottom of the box to a height of about 3 or 4
-2 millims. The tube was withdrawn and the plug replaced. The screw-head V was then

Z rotated 80 as to bring every part of the endless band into the liquid. This operation

= wet. The apparatus was then left to itself for 30 or 40 minutes, which interval
= was as a rule sufficiently long to allow the hygrometric state to become constant.
- The hygrometer index rose at first rapidly and afterwards more lowly to a limiting
2£ position which it steadily maintained. On one occasion the indication was observed
bt at intervals during 36 hours, and did not vary more than a tenth of a scale division.
S The new apparatus has, in fact, enabled us to overcome the chief difficulties encountered
E with the old. We can now maintain the temperature and hygrometric state of the
E space round the film constant as long as we wish. To proceed :—The electrical

connexions having been completed, the lower ring F was turned to one side by the
button H, and the pinion C rotated until the mouth of the upper cup jusb touched
the liquid. When it was raised, a plane film was formed over its mouth, and this,
aſter the ring F was restored to its position, was blown out, into a cylinder in the
usual way. The needles were inserted in the film and adjusted 80 that their position
| could be easily observed by the cathetometer. The length of the cylindrical film was
usually about 34 or 35 millims., and the upper needle was placed about 5 millims,
below the cup B. The distance between the points where the needles pierced the film
varied in different experiments between 4-6 and 5'3 millims. There were, indeed, as
