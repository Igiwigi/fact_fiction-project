In another
instance they were reduced, on decapitation, from sixty-six to twenty-nine. The foregoing experiments show that the effect of decapitation is always to dimi-
nish the frequency of the respiratory movements of the insect. They are confirmed
by those which follow ; but these prove other facts also ; and first, that the irregula-
rities in the mode and rate of breathing, which are noted in the natural respiration
of the insect, are equally observed after decapitation, and are therefore not to be
assigned to the will, or any mental state. Exp. v.â€”On a day when the temperature was 59? Faur., I counted the respirations
of a cricket, in seyeral minutes, with intervals of a quarter of a minute between each
two.
