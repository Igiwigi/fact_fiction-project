Shrinking people down to the micrometre is a classical science-fiction premise in which the agents
could manipulate tiny objects as in a microscopic factory. Ultimately, they may be injected in the : a
body and repair dysfunctional organs or carry drugs to the appropriate cells. Beyond the limitless 1
imagination of writers, this points towards a challenging question for the scientific community: [fg
how can we design populations of artificial microagents capable of moving autonomously in a oe
controlled fashion while performing complex tasks? Recently, this question has fuelled a great :s
effort towards the fabrication and the development of the first generation of synthetic micro- and :
nano-robots [1-3].

In living matter, the energy is extracted from the hydrolysis of ATP into ADP, which [3S
constitutes the ‘quantum’ of intracellular energy transfer. Similarly, artificial systems need
to harvest the free energy from the environment and convert it into mechanical work. [=
Numerous experimental realizations of such systems have been performed in recent years, 3
