Moreover, we noticed that all
round the larva there was a narrow hyaline border, in which were imbedded the
pytiform “ yellow-cells,” and in which more careful observation shows us, especially at
a later stage and in the stalk, thin strands of granular protoplasm belonging to other
cells, and set perpendicularly, or nearly so, to the surface of the body. We might
naturally suppose that this hyaline border was the ectoderm; but sections show us
that, so far from this being the case, this border only marks the average limit of the
nuclei ; and, though in many places there is a more or less marked row of cells
sending processes through the hyaline border to the exterior, yet these cells are not
everywhere present, and are never marked off distinctly from the subjacent mesoderm
(fig. 29). In fact there is no distinct superficial layer which we can speak of as the
ectoderm ; and the term seems only applicable to the cells bounding the water-pore,
and to the mass surrounding the vestibule; and even the latter in places usually
passes insensibly into the mesoderm (fig. 29), and at a later stage (fig. 35) is largely
replaced by mesoderm, so that no part of the vestibule except its floor has a distinct

5 epithelial lining. A detailed description of the histology of the stalk has been given by PERRIER
(19, p. 133). The Chambered Organ and Axial Organ.—While the mesoderm was undergoing
histolysis the cavities of the chambered organ were no longer distinguishable, but
now, with the recovery of the tissues from the histolysed condition, they reappear as
before in open communication with the aboral body-cavity.
