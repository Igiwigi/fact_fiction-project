Sample preparation necessarily induces the addition of experimental errors that must be
minimized as much as possible. The suitability of all instrumentation used to prepare a sample
has to be established (balance, volumetric flasks, volume dispensers, etc.). In some cases, the
direct analysis of F&F samples is achievable without any sample treatment, except dilution
or filtration (e.g. alcoholic perfumery, compounded fragrances and flavours if the amount of
non-volatile constituents is low when submitted to GC). However, if the analytes occur in
more complex media, such as emulsions, cosmetics and foods, they need to be extracted from
their matrix. Isolating the volatile fraction for GC-MS can notably be achieved by solid-phase
microextraction [21,22], simultaneous distillation-extraction [23] or headspace extraction [24].
For complex samples, one of the most popular techniques is solid-phase extraction [25], which
is often used prior to LC-MS measurement [26-28].

We emphasize the fact that several sample preparation techniques lead to non-quantitative
recoveries [29]. It is therefore important to evaluate these recoveries and to validate this step,
either independently or together with the final validation of the quantification method.

(iv) Blanks

Because carry-over issues are frequent in trace analysis, particularly when using an LC injector,
the recommendation is to optimize the rinsing steps of the autosampler and to run blanks between
all calibration and sample injections during the development stage. Afterward, the number of
blanks can be reduced at the application stage, after the absence of carry-over has been observed.
