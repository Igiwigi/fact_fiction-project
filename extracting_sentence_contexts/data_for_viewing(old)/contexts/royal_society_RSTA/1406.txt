Figure 3 shows the per cent error in simulated average DJF maximum 3h precipitation
accumulation using the native grid observations. Consistent with the expectation shown in the
top row of figure 1, the high-resolution models produce larger maximum values than their lower
resolution counterparts. Although there is little commonality between errors across the modelling
groups, the patterns of native grid errors are remarkably similar across resolution within an
individual modelling group. Electronic supplementary material, figure S2 shows the per cent
error in simulated average DJF maximum 3h precipitation accumulation using the non-native
grid observations and highlights the importance of the order of operations in constructing the
reference maxima. The native grid errors reveal that even the coarse models do not systematically
underestimate extreme precipitation, contradicting a commonly held view. In fact, three of the
models are generally too wet in the winter while the others are too dry in the wetter southeast
and Pacific coast regions. Non-native grid model errors are very different to native grid errors
since the non-native reference values, shown in the bottom row of figure 1, are so much larger
than the native reference values of the top row of figure 1. The patterns of non-native grid model
errors in the electronic supplementary material, figure S2 are much less similar across resolutions
than the native grid model errors in figure 3 and can even be of opposite sign as summarized in
the electronic supplementary material, table S1. This difference in error pattern can lead to very
different and potentially incorrect conclusions about the sign of model bias as well as the effect of
horizontal resolution on simulated extreme winter precipitation quality.

Figure 4 shows the per cent error in simulated average JJA maximum 3h precipitation
accumulation using the native grid observations. Summer errors are generally considerably larger
