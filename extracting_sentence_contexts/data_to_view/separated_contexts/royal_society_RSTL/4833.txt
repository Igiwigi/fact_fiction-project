In the
following set I was desirous of knowing what difference would result from the fluid
being applied more sparingly, or but for a very short space of time. SPALLANZANI
had made experiments with a similar view, but his appeared to be open to some ob-
Jections, as he had not noted some important circumstances which greatly affect
the result, as the temperature of the medium, the length of time the fluid employed

had been obtained, &c, In the experiments now made, these circumstances were

but for short spaces of time, as in some of the following experiments. These ova,
