We note that the selected plasma temperature is slightly higher than that predicted by
hydrodynamic simulations (see for instance fig. 2 in [12]). However, this choice does not have any
impact on the results. In fact, as will be clear later, the intense laser pulse heats up the electrons
to temperatures which are a couple of orders of magnitude higher than our initial choice. It is
thus this temperature that influences the shock formation and propagation. In order to explore
the interaction and the subsequent plasma dynamics, a simulation box 925 1m long and 18 1m
wide was adopted.
