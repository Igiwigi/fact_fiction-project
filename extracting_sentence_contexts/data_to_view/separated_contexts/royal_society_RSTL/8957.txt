The want of water is now a great difficulty in the way of manipulating the
Sugar-cane, which is therefore not much grown. Formerly Indigo plantations
covered some of the central portions of the island, but now its cultivation has
ceased. That the soil of the island is good, and that water was formerly abundant, the
fact of s0 many plants being cultivated clearly proves; but at the same time their
cultivation must have acted very prejudicially on the indigenous vegetation. Is. BAYLEY BALFOUR.
