Later on, nerve XXI. belongs to vertebra X., 7.¢., lies behind its vertebra. It is easily seen that the results arrived at by Remax, GrGenBAuR, and Corninc
are all different, and cannot be reconciled with each other. In fact, it had long been felt that there was something unsatisfactory in this
generally-accepted expression “neugliederung,” or new segmentation. O. HErtwic
(‘Lehrbuch der Entwicklungsgeschichte der Menschen und der Wirbelthiere,’ Jena,
1888, p. 473) pointed out that the expression is not correct, because, as long as the
axial column is still in the membranous stage, there is no segmentation in it, and
it is only when cartilage makes its appearance that “ gliederung” makes its ‘appear-
ance. This argumentation does not quite meet the point.
