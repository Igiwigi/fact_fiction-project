is further proportional to the remaining number of offspring
that an individual is expected to produce if it survives to the
next age, 0;,, (ie. the current reproductive value, equation
(3.6)). This quantity may in fact increase with age, for instance
when maturity occurs later in life. Selection on a mutant that
reduces mortality may therefore become stronger as its effects
get closer to age at maturity. These well-known results lay the
basis of the evolution of life-history traits, especially of senes-
cence [49,89,91], and are relevant to age-specific social
behaviour (e.g. [92]).

Less well-trodden is disruptive selection in an age-
structured population, which in fact we have not seen any-
