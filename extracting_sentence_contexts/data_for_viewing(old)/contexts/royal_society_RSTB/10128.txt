size. For example, at one point in his paper, he discussed
one of the obvious potential implications of Bassett’s [30]
‘seal butchery by-product’ hypothesis, namely that the
Tasmanians did not ever fish. Henrich suggested that this
would not undermine his argument about the importance
of reduced population size, because a failure to develop
fishing would be as much of a puzzle as a loss of fishing.

However, this ignores two issues. One is that there are econ-
omic reasons why the Tasmanians may have reduced their
reliance on fishing. For example, Andersson & Read [31] have
pointed out that the Tasmanians’ non-consumption of fish
could have been due to the fact that fish were not needed for
protein because of the ready availability of shellfish and seals,
and are not a source of carbohydrates. Under these conditions,
they aver, the investment required to obtain fish may actually
have been maladaptive. An alternative economic explanation
for the Tasmanians’ decision to fish less often has been outlined
by Hiscock [32]. The implication of these arguments is that, even
if it were the case that the Tasmanians did not ever eat fish, we
could not infer anything about the impact of population size
on cultural complexity from that fact. The other issue is that it
is not uncommon for stable or expanding populations to avoid
fish despite having ready access to them. For instance, stable
