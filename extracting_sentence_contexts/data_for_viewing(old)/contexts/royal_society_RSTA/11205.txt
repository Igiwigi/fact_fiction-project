The calculated values in this table are derived from the parabolic formula
Kk, = 222 (1 +0°01059t+-0:004459#*).

Tn neither case did the observations come within the range within which a point of
inflexion may oceur. DsG@ursne (‘ Dissertation, Strassburg,’ 1895), working between
2° C. and 34° C., was also able to represent his measurements of the alkalies by
means of a flat parabola, and the existence of a point of inflexion in these curves
appears hitherto to have been entirely overlooked. This result is largely to be
attributed to the fact that the point of inflexion for solutions of caustic soda never
falls much below 50° C. and recedes above 100° C. both in dilute and in concentrated
solutions, and also to the fact that a parabolic curve has been assumed to express
universally the temperature-conductivity relation.
