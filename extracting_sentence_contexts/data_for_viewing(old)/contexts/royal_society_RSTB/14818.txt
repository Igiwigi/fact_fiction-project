proportional to the probability of surviving till that age under

the effect of a mutant at age a is expressed and thus exposed
to selection (J? is in fact proportional to q°, the probability

nection). Since I} always decreases with a, selection tends to
be weaker on later acting than on early acting mutants [91].
This is always true for mutants affecting fecundity (b,(Zm, Z)).
For mutants affecting mortality (u,(Zm, Z)), selection strength
is further proportional to the remaining number of offspring
that an individual is expected to produce if it survives to the
next age, 0;,, (ie. the current reproductive value, equation
(3.6)). This quantity may in fact increase with age, for instance
when maturity occurs later in life. Selection on a mutant that
reduces mortality may therefore become stronger as its effects
