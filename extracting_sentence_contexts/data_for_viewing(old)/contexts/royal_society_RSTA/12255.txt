larly over the latter, for in it the water absorptions play such an important réle that the
law of scattering could hardly be taken into accountalso. It will be noticed that obser-
vations have been made at all times of the year, and that the winter observations, when
the surface of the ground at Grindelwald has been covered with snow and the air has
been intensely cold (the thermometer sometimes showing as much as 40° F. of frost),
give the coefficients of least absorption. The writer has held that most of the
scattering particles are water in an extremely fine state of division, and that there is
a probability that such is the case is shown by the fact that the most transparent
atmosphere is that in which there is most warm aqueous vapour present. A change
in the summer to what artists call an “atmospheric landscape” invariably shows a
higher coefficient of absorption. Whatever these particles may be, there is no doubt
that they are in the same volume fewer in number at high altitudes than they are
at lower ones ; as the coefficient of absorption is so much less in the former case than
in the latter. Any one who has observed the sky at these higher altitudes will have
observed that when the sun is brightest and highest, the sky is blackest, that is,
that there are fewer scattering particles.

XXXIII.— Standard of Light.

It is somewhat difficult to know as to what standard of light to refer the light of
