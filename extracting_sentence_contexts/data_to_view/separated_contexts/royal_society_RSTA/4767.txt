Photograph No. 15 shows a very thick joint crossing a paste of primary crystallization. Photograph No. 16 shows the general aspect of joints, which would be traced by sulphuric acid on
most of the specimens. Neither these photographs (11 to 17) nor photographs ] to 6, 9, 10, and 21 are characteristic only of the
alloys from which they were taken; they have been chosen as typical illustrations of the organization
of primary crystallization, of the variable development of joints, and, in fact, of the general phenomena
which have been described in the text. Photographs 7, 8, 19, 20, and 22 are of a more special nature; they show the effects of annealing at a
given temperature on a given alloy.
