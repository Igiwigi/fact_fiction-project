* is less powerful as a sound producer than valeral with a boiling point of 100*, or
Sen than valerianic ether with a boiling point of 144% Cyanide of methyl boils

H the experimental tube, these vapours follow, as absorbers, the order of their sounds,
"When tested in liquid layers they follow the same order. I have examined about a
Sore of liquids with boiling points varying from 163* to 308% At ordinary tempera-

Bunds, The measured absorptions of a sufficient number of substances, in relation to
Heir sounding power, shall be tabulated immediately.

E The fact is worth a passing reference that the chlorides of the elements appear one

d all to be feeble sound producers, because they are one and all feeble absorbers of
Adiant heat. Many years ago I had found them highly diathermanous, and accepted
Ehloride of sodium as representative of the class. Silicium chloride, for example, though
Sery volatile is weak as a sound producer, Tetrachloride of carbon, and terchloride of
Ehosphorus are also volatile, but not strong. Bichloride of tin, chloride of arsenic,
__ of titanium, and chloride of sulphur, are all feeble sound producers. In these

e cases the boiling points are high, but non-volatility is not the cause of the weak-
ness, for when the yapours are raised, by heating their liquids, almost to the pressure
of the atmosphere, they are still but feebly sonorous. Whatever then the condition
