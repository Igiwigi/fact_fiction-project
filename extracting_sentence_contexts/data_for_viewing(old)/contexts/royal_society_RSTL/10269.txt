Into the causes of the variations in the thickness of different black films we do not
now propose to enquire. The above observations prove that they are comparatively
gmall. The fact that the boundary between the black and coloured portions of a film
is always well defined, and that there must therefore be a very sudden change of
thickness in passing from the one to the other seems to point to a region of instability
in the neighbourhood of the beginning of the black, such that films, the thicknesses of
which are included within it, thin very rapidly to below its lower limit. Very short-
lived films made of ordinary 80ap and water 8ometimes exhibit a grey tint, inter-
mediate to the white and black of the first order, but persistent films, as far as our

experience goes, never do. The foregoing observations seem to fix the limit of this
