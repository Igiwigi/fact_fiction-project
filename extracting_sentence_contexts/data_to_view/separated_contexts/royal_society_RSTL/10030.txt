23, 26, 35). With reference to the later stages in the development of the eye, |
the ouly subject with which we propose to deal is the growth of the mesoblastie |
processes which enter the cavity of the vitreous humour through the choroid slit. Lepidosteus is very remarkable Å¿or the great number of mesoblas cells which thus
enter the cavity of the vitreous humour, and for the fact that these cells are at first
unaccompanied by any vascular structures (Plate 24, fig. 43, v.h.). The mesoblast
cells are scattered through the vitreous humour, and there can be no doubt that
during early larval life, at a period however when the larya is certainly able to 8e,
every histologist would consider the vitreons humour to be a tissue formed of scattered
cells, with a large amount of intercellular substance ; and the fact that it is 80 appears
to us to demonstrate that KessLER's view of the vitreous humour being a mers
transudation is nob tenable.
