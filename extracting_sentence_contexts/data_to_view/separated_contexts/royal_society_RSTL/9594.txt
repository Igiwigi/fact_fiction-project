The general course of reasoning given above, led me to make some direct experi-
| ments on the subject. The result completely confirmed the justice of the deductions
& drawn from microscopical examination. Since I propose to discuss in a later paper
a the whole question of the formation of pre-products by gland-cells, I will here only
S briefly mention the main facts which show that zymogen and not ferment is stored up
& by the glands we are considering. = Tf the cesophagus or stomach of a Frog be placed in glycerine as rapidly as possible
Â© after removal from the body, the glycerine extract has only a weak peptic power.

S If the eesophagus or stomach of a Frog be kept moist for twenty-four hours before
S it is placed in glycerine, the glycerine extract has a very much greater peptic power.
