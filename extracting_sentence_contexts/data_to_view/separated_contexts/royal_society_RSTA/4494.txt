In §2b, we consider the impact of an MPS on the distribution of future temperatures. We
demonstrate that the description of climate sensitivity in Assessment Report 5 [9] could be
seen as an MPS of the description in Assessment Report 4 [8]. Thus, despite the fact that the
IPCC’s 2013 position on climate sensitivity might superficially be viewed as ‘good’ news, our
analysis shows that a reasonable interpretation of the results would conclude otherwise: WTP
goes up. In §2c, we turn to increases in the standard deviation of the distribution of climate sensitivity. Every MPS falls into this category when the increase in variance is mean-preserving, but the
converse is not true.
