negative valency effect,” is probably the cause of the rapid diminution of the solubility
limit in the copper-silicon alloys at low temperatures, since silicon is the most electro-
negative of the tetravalent elements.

At present there do not appear to be any accurate determinations of ternary diagrams
at the lower temperatures by means of which a critical test can be made, but the
general application of the preceding electron concentration methods of calculations with
appropriate correction terms is obvious.

We may further suggest that it is this electron concentration principle which forms
the real justification for the original views of Gumtier* concerning the “ zinc equivalents”
of different elements in complex brasses. As shown by Bauer and Hansen,f this
theory in its original form is not in agreement with the facts at true equilibrium, and
the “ zine equivalent coefficients” which Gummer determined from cast alloys have
little real significance. But when translated from weight percentages into electron
concentrations, the idea of GuILLET is essentially true for elements of favourable size
factor.

The above methods of calculation are, of course, semi-empirical so far as they
depend upon correction factors deduced from the binary curves, but, even so, it is
hoped that they may be of value in determining some of the solubility limits of complex
alloys of copper and silver, For if it can be shown that the solubility limits of a few
suitably chosen alloys in a particular ternary or quaternary system agree with the
above kind of calculation, the method may reasonably be used for intermediate alloys
