return to the workshop. Also, information about the successful adoption of response actions at
the edge level should be propagated through the cloud in order to be used in similar devices
in analogous situations. In such a view, DT hierarchy is associated with model abstraction and
modularity rather than pure redundancy and enables federated multi-simulation among DT for
predictive analytics [25].

Another aspect worth mentioning is that although the main scope of the concept is to support
self-healing, which could be interpreted as an extremization of fault-tolerance in complex CPS, the
approach also allows for fault-avoidance [16], due to the autonomic controller implementing the
MAPE-K look in the DT possibly being able to predict the future evolution of CPS behaviour and


react accordingly in order to prevent threats. In fact, in this application the autonomic controller
can be thought of as a resilience controller over the managed system also ensuring safe autonomy
whenever appropriate and feasible.

4. Challenges in anomaly detection with digital twins

The framework presented in the previous section is based on the capability of DT to detect
anomalies by analysing CPS events and diagnostic data generated at the edge level. Anomaly
detection is a broad topic which can be defined in several ways. According to the definition given
in one pioneering work on the subject [26]:

(a) Anomaly detection refers to the problems of finding patterns in data that
do not conform to expected behaviour
