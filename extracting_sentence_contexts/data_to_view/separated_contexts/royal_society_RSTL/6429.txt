I will conclude by showing how the formula may be applied to the reduction of the
general quintic equation to Mr, JERRARD's form z*+ax+b=0. It was long ago remarked
by Professor SYLVESTER that TSCHIRNHAUSEN'S Transformation, in its original form, gave
the means of effecting this reduction. In fact, if the transforming equation be

y=&+Po+yo* +a +a?
then the equation in y is of the form
(A, B, C, D, E, FXy, 1*'=0,

where B, C, D, GE, F are, in regard to «, ſ, y, 3, s, of the degrees 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respect-
ively. And by assuming, say « a linear function of PB, y, 3, z, we may make B=0, and
we have then C, D, EG, F functions of the degrees 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively of the quan-
tities 3, y, 3, s: and these can be determined by means of a quadric equation and a cubic
equation in such Manner that C=0, D=0, in which case the equation in y will be of
the required form. For considering |, y, 3, s as the coordinates of a point in space, the
equations C=0, D=0 will be the equations of a quadric surface and a cubic surface
respectively, and if Þ, y, 3, s be the coordinates of a point on the curve of intersection,
the required conditions will be satisfied.
