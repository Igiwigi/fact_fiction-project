The proportion of carbonic oxide is
2 often rather higher in the gas obtained from the pebble powder than in that furnished
= by the R. L. G. powder; and this is in accordance with the fact that the proportion of
= carbon is somewhat higher, while that of the saltpetre is a little lower, in the former
= than in the latter. Excluding the results furnished by the experiments in which the
EY powder was exploded in the largest space (in which, therefore, the gases were deve-
i= loped at the lowest pressures) it will be observed that with the slowest-burning
EZ powder (the pebble) the proportion of carbonic oxide decreases steadily, while that of
5 the anhydride increases, in proportion to the pressure developed at the time of explosion. L The proportion of carbonic anhydride is about the same in the gas from the two
S gunpowders specified ; but that of the potassium carbonate is s0meyhat different, and
5 appears regulated by circumstances other than the composition of the powder, being
= highest in the residues furnished by the R.
