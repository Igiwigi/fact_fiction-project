while [19] add mathematical complexity of indeterminate oceanographical usefulness by making
the underlying ocean viscous. The primary focus of the model in [16] was to explain some
laboratory observations on wave propagation in grease ice written up subsequently in [20],
whereas a broader range of ice types including the MIZ are included in [19]. Using a Lagrangian
formulation, Weber [21] employs a viscous model also to represent a MIZ—in this case for an
unlayered, rotating ocean. A viscous boundary layer model based upon the eddy viscosity in the
turbulent boundary layer beneath the ice cover has also been suggested [22-24], recognizing that
eddy viscosity is a phenomenological parameter to be determined as a function of flow conditions

rather than a physical measurable viscosity. These few papers collectively illustrate a reasonably : =

In fact, sea ice itself is viscoelastic, with different degrees of nonlinearity dependent on its 2
physical properties and environmental circumstances. At ocean wave forcing frequencies, first- aed
year sea ice itself is approximately anelastic [25], ie. any viscous deformation is recoverable, 22
which is a specific form of viscoelasticity where the hysteresis loop is closed. However, current [4

accommodate other kinds of sea ice deformation and/or alternative dissipative mechanisms that is

cause energy loss as the waves propagate into and through the material. In doing this, they
are including both the modest dissipation due to sea ice flexure plus the typically substantial
energy loss arising from the several known but neglected pervasive mechanisms discussed in
§1—many of which are nonlinear but are being rendered in a linear way in the model. In all cases,
a dispersion relation w = w(k) results that, as usual, is constructed by first assuming the Airy
