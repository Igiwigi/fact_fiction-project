of the leaf-trace bundles—a number of the principal traces passing out into each leaf,
and at the same time increasing their number by repeated sub-division—is quite
peculiar, differing essentially both from the system in existing Cycadaceze, and from
that in the extinct Bennettitez.{ A better analogy may be sought in those poly-
stelic Ferns which have numerous leaf-trace bundles, markedly smaller than the steles
of the stem.§

On the whole, however, it is evident that Medullosa anglica, like other Medullosez,
combined Cycadean with Filicinean characters, though in this comparatively simple
species the resemblance to Ferns is more prominent than in other members of the
group. :

The fact, now, as it seems to me, established, that the leaf-traces of Medullosa were
concentric in structure on first leaving the steles, throws a welcome light on
Sewarn’s Lachiopteris Williamsoni, a fossil petiole which that author separated*
from Myeloxylon on the ground, among others, that its vascular bundles are con-
centric and not collateral.|| The general resemblance to Myeloxylon is manifest, and
there is no reason to doubt that it indicates near relationship, for it is perfectly con-
ceivable that in some of the Medullosee the foliar bundles may have retained
concentric structure in the petiole, instead of losing it in their passage through the
cortex. Similar variations among recent Ferns will at once occur to any botanist.
The wood of the bundles in Rachiopteris Williamson is quite comparable in structure
to the primary part of the undivided leaf-traces in Medullosa anglica, and, as sections
in my possession show, the pitting on the trachez is of the same kind. We may
