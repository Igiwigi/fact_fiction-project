Next in order are four strong lines with wave-lengths
4171°5, 4201°9, 4216°0, and 4226-4. These lines are not present in the Bessemer spectra from the “acid” process which
we had hitherto examined, and their identification was not readily accomplished. The first fact noticed was that the first and last lines varied in strength independently
of all other lines in the spectra, and that of the two intermediate lines, 4201°9 was
always stronger than 4216°0. These two were, therefore, identified with rubidium, as
they were the strongest lines in the oxyhydrogen flame spectrum of that element. The line 42264 was identified with calcium, this being decidedly the strongest line in
