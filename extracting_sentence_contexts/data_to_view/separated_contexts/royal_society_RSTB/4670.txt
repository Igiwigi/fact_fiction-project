Further evidence is forthcoming in the occurrence,
in the hinder caudal vertebree of Heptanchus, of calcified double cones with
radiating secondary lamelle, usually six in number (fig. 5, A, p. 348). These calcified
parts disappear as one passes forwards, and the observations should be taken in
conjunction with the general conclusion, arrived at from other sources, that caudal
vertebree in sharks exhibit a more primitive or more typical condition of structure
than the trunk vertebree (p. 317). The only other forms that exhibit radiating calcified lamelle that belong
exclusively to the sheath-cartilage are the various species of Cestracion (fig. 21,
p- 370).* This is not, however, to be taken as necessarily implying close aflinity
with Heptanchus; indeed, the fact that the characteristic number of rays in
Heptanchus is six, while in Cestracion it is eight, tells rather against it. The
fossil genera, such as Pal@ospinax, that are commonly regarded as allied to
Cestracion, although their centra have no radiating calcified laminz, may possibly
be degenerate, but the more probable explanation is that they branched off from
the parental stock prior to the evolution in the Cestracionts proper of the calcified
lamellee external to the double cone.

The members of the family Carchariide agree with one another in the possession of
large, well calcified intermedialia, of perichondrial origin, not derived from the arch-
cartilage nor from the sheath-cartilage ; they also agree in the fact that the sheath-
cartilage bulges out towards and into the arch-bases, and includes a diagonally
placed calcified lamella in each outgrowth.
