The LI derivation of these equations
has a generic structure. The first step is to list the features of the experiment that are deemed to
be relevant and to introduce the i-probs of the individual events. The second step is to impose the
condition that the experiment yields robust, reproducible results, not on the level of individual
events, but on the level of the frequencies of observing many events and, depending on the
problem, to impose other constraints about, for example, the fact that the particle moves, etc. As an example of such a constraint, we will use a natural requirement that the equations of
