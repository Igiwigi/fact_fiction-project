We have confined our observations to the peripheral parts of the nerves.*

We can now pass on to the histological side of the subject ; after which we shall
be better able to correlate our facts and draw general conclusions.

* Nott (loc. cit.) in some of his experiments examined the central stump of the divided nerve. He was
able to perform some of his work on large animals (horses) and so could obtain sufficient material from
the central end for analysis. Corresponding to what is termed “ disuse atrophy ” he found some diminu-
tion in the amount of protagon in this region, hut the lessening was not so marked as in the peripheral
end of the nerve. In the majority of his experiments he estimated protagon, not phosphorus as we have
done. He puts the date of disappearance of the phosphorised fat at 28 days. This date and many other
of his facts fit in very well with our work.

C. Histological Examination of the Cats’ Nerves.

Portions of motor and sensory branches of the peripheral portion of the cut nerves
were in each case taken for microscopic investigation. In the cases where union had
occurred, the junction was also reserved for the same purpose.

Each piece of nerve was pinned out across a cork frame so that the tissue was
entirely surrounded by fluid.
