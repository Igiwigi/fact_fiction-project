‘Bhere is never any evidence of

oxhloroform vapour for about fifteen minutes, and is to be contrasted with fig. 36 of

i same plate, where the animal with intact spinal cord was stimulated by the
pour. There is, then, physiological evidence of nervous connections for the club
As, though I have not as yet been able to convince myself of the fact anatomically.
4t should here be noted that in former experiments upon the electromotive pro-
wAties of the skin of the Eel (34) I found that exposure of exsected skin to the action
#Echloroform vapour caused a fall of potential, and I believe that the direct action
nm the protoplasm of the secretory elements is narcotic, though in early stages one
y have a reflex excitatory effect in the animal with intact cord.
In this reflex stimulation of the club cells it is apparently only the formed ceils
t react to the excitation; at any rate T have seen no evidence of chloroform
= leading to a rapid production of new individuals from the palisade cells.
et it is difficult to imagine how any nerve connection with the club cells can be
retained after they have been set free from the palisade layer. Possibly some con-
ducting protoplasmic connection, that has escaped me, is retained between the
palisade cells and the club cells, the nerve connection being solely with the former.*
