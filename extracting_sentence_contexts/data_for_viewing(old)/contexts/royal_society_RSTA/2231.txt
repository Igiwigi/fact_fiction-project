5. Fock space and contextuality eo

In the past two decades, attempts have been made [6] to describe a contextuality in random 8
observation processes by interference of probabilities, as is done in quantum theory. For this purpose, in : 8
fact, the representation of random observable as a normalized vector, see (4.6) in Fock space (4.6), : 4
and the Born rule were used. Contextuality (for non-compound systems) was expressed in the

form of interference of probabilities as, for example, in the two-slit experiment. In mathematical

terms, such probabilistic interference was expressed as the violation of the classical formula

of total probability [7-12]. Taking into account that (as shown above) the Fock space can be
constructed in different ways, we conclude that such a linear representation of random observation

processes which depend on contextuality is also not unique.

It is easy to show (see the electronic supplementary material) that in the Doiâ€”Peliti probability
