In
particular, the dendritic morphologies disappeared. Nagashio & Kuribayashi [28] explained this
finding by the fragmentation of dendrites during recalescence. In fact, microstructures of samples
solidified at large undercoolings exhibit an equiaxed grain refined microstructure. Fragmentation
of dendrites by a Rayleigh type instability has been found in metallic systems [36]. Karma worked
out a model of dendrite fragmentation by a Rayleigh type instability that explains microstructural
double transitions from equiaxed grain refined to coarse-grained dendritic at a smaller critical
undercooling and from coarse-grained dendritic to equiaxed grain refined microstructure at a
higher critical undercooling in alloys [37].
