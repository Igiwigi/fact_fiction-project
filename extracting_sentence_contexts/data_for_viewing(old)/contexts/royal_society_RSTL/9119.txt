(8) Five units of hydrogen and a unit of pentoxide of iodine are identical with
five units of water and a unit of iodine.

Snch examples might be greatly multiplied, Equations possessing this peculiar
property are not due to accident, but to the simplicity of natural laws. In the chemical
metamorphoses of which they express the results there is no change of gaseous yolume.

It would be by no means difficult thus to make a system of carefully selected equations
to which, as satisfying the condition given above, the processes of algebra would be truly
applicable. That such a system should be possible, that a system of * normal” equa-
tions, subordinate to algebraical laws, should actually be found in the midst, 80 to say, of
an abnormal system, is undoubtedly a most striking and suggestive fact. But neverthe-
less, 80 far as any realization of the objects of a calculus are concerned, this cireumstance,
if taken alone, is totally inoperative. The result of constituting such a system would be
to divide chemical equations into two classes—a class with which we could really deal alge-
braically, and a class with which we could not so deal; and corresponding to these classes
we should have, as will presently be seen, two systems of phenomena—a system which
we could realize, study, and comprehend, and a second system absolutely unintelligible to
us. 'These anomalies, however, may be completely removed by a mathematical trans-
formation of the equation, to which I must now request the attention of the reader.

(3) It has been remarked (I. Sec. IV. 3), where the meaning and properties of the
chemical symbol 1 are under discussion, that any number of numerical symbols 0, 1, 2, 3
may be added to a chemical function without affecting the interpretation of that function
