\. 13. On the absolute
quantity of Electricity associated with the particles or atoms of Matter.

Preliminary.

661. THE theory which I believe to be a true expression of the facts of electro-
chemical decomposition, and which I have therefore detailed in a former series of
these Researches, is s0 much at variance with those previously advanced, that I find
the greatest difficulty in stating results, as I think, correctly, whilst limited to the use
of terms which are current with a certain accepted meaning. Of this kind is the term
pole, with its prefixes of positive and negative, and the attached ideas of attraction
and repulsion. The general phraseology is that the positive pole attracts oxygen,
acids, &c., or more cautiously, that it determines their eyolution upon the surface ; and
that the negative pole acts in an equal manner upon hydrogen, combustibles, metals,
and bases.
