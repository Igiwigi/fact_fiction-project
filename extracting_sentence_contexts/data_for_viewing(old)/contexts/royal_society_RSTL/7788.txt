5 Meanwhile Mr. GrorGE JENNER, the magistrate of Rodriguez, was urged to make a
Anore thorough search for further remains of the Solitaire in the localities whence the
Zapocimons last mentioned had been found.
2 Accordingly, on the 1st August 1865, a box from this gentleman reached one of the
Zputhors at Mauritius. It was found to contain upwards of eighty-one specimens of
-Sbones, belonging to at least 8izteen individuals. Among these bones were a portion of
Zthe coracoid, examples of the ulna, radius, and fibula, portions of the pelvis and one of
Sthe digital phalanges, all of which had been previously unknown. But, more than this,
Shown a series 80 large it became at once plain, by the presence of many specimens of in-
Stermediate size, that the theory of the existence in the island of Rodriguez of two
Sspecies of Solitaire (originated by Mr. BarTrervr, afterwards adopted with a modification
Sby STRICKLAND, and followed subsequently by one of the present authors in describing
the rexults of the previous © find”) became untenable, and this fact was declared when
Va few months later the specimens arrived in England, and were exhibited at a meeting

Reountry g, the British Assciation for the Advancement of Science, then assembled at
Birmingham, at the instance of Mr. P. T.. ScLarer, appointed a Committee to assist
