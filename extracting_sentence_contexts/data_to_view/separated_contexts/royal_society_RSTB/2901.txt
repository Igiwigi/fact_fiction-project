They are not continuous rods of uniform width extending the full height of the
2 demibranch, but consist of a succession of short rods which taper off to nothing in the
middle of each interfilamentar junction. The length of each rod is thus slightly less
than the mean distance between one interfilamentar junction and the next above it. This fact is easily demonstrated by soaking in 10 per cent. potassic hydrate for
24 hours a piece of the lamella of the Anodonta or Unio gill, and examining in
glycerine under the low power of the microscope; but it is also apparent in a
continuous series of sections taken transversely to the filaments. As an interfilamentar
; junction is approached the sections of the rods become smaller and smaller, and in the
middle of the interfilamentar junction are wanting entirely.
