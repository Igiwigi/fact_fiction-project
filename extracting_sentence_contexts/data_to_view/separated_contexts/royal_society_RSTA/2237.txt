The separation is of another order of magnitude to the corresponding
magnetic separation. Thus at ’ = 4000 ALU. the separation of the outer components
of a normal Zeeman triplet in a field of 30,000 Gauss is about 0°5 A.U., whilst for the
hydrogen line H, in an electric field of 30,000 volts x em.~', the outermost components
are separated by 13°0 A.U. Sark considers that the broadening of spectrum lines
at high pressures and under powerful conditions of electrical excitation is intimately
connected with the electrical resolution of the lines, being in fact due to the electric
effect of neighbouring atoms on the luminous particle. The phenomena appear to be
strictly analogous. Srark also points out that the electrical separation of the
components increases with the term number in a series, just as the broadening also
increases.
