PuRIFICATION OF HISTONE AND PROTAMIN SULPHATES

Histones

The sulphates of the histones prepared by the above method from various cell nuclei
were, in our earlier experiments, purified by dissolving them two or three times in water
acidified with a small amount of dilute sulphuric acid, centrifuging the material to remove
any insoluble material and then reprecipitating the histone sulphate with alcohol. Table 1
gives some analyses, which are useful for comparison with later figures, made on histones
from various sources purified in this way. The results at first suggested that the histones
present in the thymocytes, lymphocytes and liver cells of the ox were, in fact, different
substances. But when the tyrosine contents of numerous preparations of thymus histone
sulphate from the calf were determined, discordant figures were obtained. The tyrosine
