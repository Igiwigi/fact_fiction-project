Substituting the values of x and & in D, and taking the mean value for a complete
period, we find that the average rate of radiation is given by

which are real, are in general different. We therefore have regions for which there is
radiation, separated by regions for which there is absorption. The above expression for the radiation is true only if ka is a small quantity, and
this must be observed in discussing the application of the expression to actual fact. The positively charged particles associated with the electric discharge appear to be

and

of atomic size and to have a ratio of mass to charge of the order of the electro-
chemical equivalent of hydrogen. For such a particle the ratio of electric mass to
ordinary mass is comparatively small.
