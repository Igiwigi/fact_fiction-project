As regards both molecular viscosity and molecular viscosity work, the formates—
as was to be expected from what has been already stated—give values which are
much larger than those of other compounds. Of the remaining liquids the general
mean of the values of ethers and esters as regards molecular viscosity is 62 + 8. The variations of the individual values are no doubt large, arising mainly from the
fact that in the case of normal isomers the same calculated value is deducted from
the observed numbers, no regard being paid to the effect of symmetry of the
molecule, etc., on the viscosity. A quantitative measure of these effects will only
be possible after a much larger number of compounds has been investigated. There
can, however, be no question of the large differences which exist between the atomic
constants of hydroxyl oxygen, carbonyl oxygen, and ether oxygen.
