All my
fresh preparations lead me to regard this conclusion as quite fallacious, and demon-
strate in the cleares6 possible manner the passage of the callosal fibres from the
convolutions of one hemisphere to those of the other. As maintained by Arxoup,
OBELLACHER, and MEyNERn, it is truly and exclusively & commis8ure of the hemispheres. In vertical sections of the brain the following facts T have repeatedly aud zatisfactorily
demonstrated. In sections thus taken through the region of the septum lucidem, the
callosal commissure upon entering either hemisphere meets the mass of the projection
system obliquely, and decussating and interweaving with this system proceeds along
the curved centric pole of the striate body, becoming more and more attenuated as it
extends along the lateral aspects of the ganglia, owing to the constant distribution cf
fibres from its mass to the cortex throughout the whole of this course. In the first
part of its course, where it first blends with the projection fibres to the ganglia, a very
large proportion of its mass (one-third to one-eighth of the whole) takes a curved
course upwards and inwards 80 as to reach the median and marginal cortex here
