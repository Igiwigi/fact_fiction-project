very strong. Also, none of the methods is able to allow us to distinguish between the aluminium
and silicon.

The reconstructions with the nonlinear model are shown in figure 5. We here use
our conjugate gradient method with a range of constraints, positivity, low rank, wavelet
row-sparsity, wavelet-tree sparsity, a combination of wavelet row-sparsity and low rank, a
combination of wavelet row-sparsity and non-negative matrix factorization and non-negative
matrix factorization on its own. While some of the results have reduced beam-hardening artefacts,
the artefacts are still visible here. However, the use of the matrix models has led to better SNR
figures, especially for the model that combines wavelet row-sparsity with a non-negative matrix
factorization. For the same constraint, the nonlinear model leads here to worse SNR results
compared with the linear model. This is due to the fact that the nonlinear model has significantly
more parameters. But once we start to use some of the constraints that are only available for
matrix models, such as the non-negative matrix decomposition constraint, we see improvements
over the linear model.

The results for the Sheppâ€”Logan phantom are summarized in figures 6 and 7, where we show
box plots of the SNR values achieved with the different methods for 10 different random instances
of the two problem settings.

Again, while the non-convexly constrained linear approaches do in general work as well as if
not better than the approaches based on the nonlinear cost using the same constraints, using more
advanced constraints such as the non-negative matrix factorization can preform much better.
