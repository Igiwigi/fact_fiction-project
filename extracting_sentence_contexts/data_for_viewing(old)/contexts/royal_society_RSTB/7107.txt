from the neighbourhood of the adductor scutorum to the ventral edge (Rande)’ of the body cavity. I shall refer
to the muscle simply as the attrahens.


OF THE PEDUNCULATE BARNACLE LITHOTRYA 105

brought about, according to my views, by hydrostatic pressure controlled largely, but not
entirely, by the dorsal longitudinal muscles, and only in this sense can they be referred to
as the extensor system.

The dorsal longitudinal muscles are not simple, any more than are the ventral muscles,
but a detailed description would not be significant to my argument. The relevant fact is
that the dorsal series is divided into two distinct parts (figure 6), the anterior group—
Nussbaum’s retractor corporis (1890, p. 26) and Batham’s ‘mantle-body-wall muscles’ (1945,
p- 368, figure 17)—and the posterior group—Nussbaum’s longissimi and Batham’s ‘lateral
body-wall muscles’. The latter run from the terga of the hind end of the body downwards
and forwards to end below the stomach on the dorso-lateral walls of the prosoma. From
this latter region an equally massive group of muscles, the anterior group, runs upwards
and forwards to converge on the peduncular wall just lateral to the pleats. There are thus
attached to the soft lower side walls of the prosoma two sets of muscles, one running
forwards and the other backwards, but both pulling upwards. When they contract they
will pull the thin flexible prosomal wall inwards and so force fluid out of the prosoma into
other parts of the body. It is this action which I maintain distends, and so extends, the
trunk region (figures 7a and b). It is not so much that blood from the prosoma is forced into
