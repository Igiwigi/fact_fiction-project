In addition,
numerous aspects of the present contribution are covered to some extent in the books X-ray Free
Electron Lasers—Applications in Material, Chemistry and Biology edited by Bergmann et al. [4], and
Synchrotron Light Sources and Free-Electron Lasers—Accelerator Physics, Instrumentation and Science
Applications edited by Jaeschke et al. [5]. They all build the basis for the present contribution. By
no means can my contribution, and in fact it is not intended to, give a complete account of the
literature on time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy of photochemical reactions with XFELs and the
reader is referred to the references above for an overview of the field. Here I focus on time-resolved X-ray spectroscopic studies of 3d transition-metal complexes.
3d transition-metal systems are essential in many photochemical processes from photocatalytic
solar-fuel production [6,7] to photosynthetic water splitting with metalloproteins [8,9]. A
mechanistic understanding at the molecular level of photocatalytic and photochemical processes
of optically excited 3d transition-metal systems may help in finding new ways to predict and
control photochemical reactivity and selectivity.
