tation given by these authors to the paralysis observed in their cases, because («) the
medulla oblongata was not microscopically examined at the post-mortem examination,
and (b) the total paralysis (respiratory as wellas phonatory) of the vocal cord observed
in their cases is according to our ablation-experiinents absolutely incompatible with
the idea of its being due to a cerebral lesion.

Recently Rosssacu{ has published a very interesting paper on the subject, in which
from a carefully observed case under his own care he draws the conclusion that
unilateral paralysis of a vocal cord may be caused by a lesion of the opposite insula.
Seeing however, that in his case there was atrophy of the corresponding side of the
tongue due to an undoubted lesion of the ganglionic cells of the hypoglossal nucleus
in the medulla oblongata, and that the integrity of the vago-accessory nucleus in the
medulla was merely surmised from the fact, that the fibres of the nerve itself, and of
the laryngeal muscles, had undergone no atrophy, while it was not at all sl own that the
