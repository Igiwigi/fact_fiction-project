Q
R these surfaces are each of the order 4, and the order of their intersection is =16.
2 But the two surfaces contain in common the line (y=0, w=0) 7 times; in fact on the
& first surface this is a cusp-nodal line 4xw+3*+Ay#=0; and on the second surface it is
= nodal line w(4xy+182w)=0; the sheet w=0 is more accurately 42w+y*+By*. . .=0;
Swhence in the intersection with the first surface the line counts 5 times in respect of the
5 first sheet and 2 times in respect of the second sheet ; together (5+2=)7 times, and the
Zresidual curve is of the order (16—7=)9. Z 113.
