T found also that the refracted images were much more distinct for angles of
incidence greater than that for minimum deviation, than for angles les.

On passing through the position of minimum deviation, I therefore reversed the
prism, 80 that the face of incidence became that of emergence.

Fig. 1.

Thus, if A B C D be the ray undergoing minimum deviation, for a ray such as
PBQR, I made P B the incident ray, Q R the emergent; while for a ray like
SBTU, I reversed the prism, 80 that U T became the incident, BS the emergent ray.

The cause of the increased distinetness lies in the fact that as the angle of incidence
increases from that giving minimum deviation, the breadth of the image of the slib
decreases, and vice vers.
