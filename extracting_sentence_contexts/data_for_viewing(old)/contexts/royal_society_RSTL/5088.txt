by which the superficial termini of meta] or of oxide, as the case may be, are highly
ignited or brought into a state of chemical exaltation at which their affinities can
act; the anode thus becomes oxidated, and the cathode, if an oxide, reduced. I
bave elsewhereF shown strong reasons for as8uming that the electric or voltaic dis-
charge, the moment polarity is subverted, may be regarded as an intensely heated
state of the electrodes, and of the intermedium across which it passes ; and my
present explanation is perfectly consistent with and derivable from my previous
views of the disruptive discharge.

Two other theories might be proposed to account for the phenomena I am con-
sidering; the one, that the disruptive discharge itself is analogous to the electrolytic,
and that the oxygen and hydrogen are reciprocally transferred by the discharge
itself; this would not, I think, be consistent with the generally known facts con-
nected with the discharge, and is entirely ineffectual in explaining the experiments
