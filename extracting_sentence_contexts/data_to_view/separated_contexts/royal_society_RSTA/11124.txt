On the same figure are placed outlines of the aggregates drawn
to scale. Two things at once strike the eye. First, that the spherical aggregate
evidently lies on the E.V curve of the rings, belongs, in fact, to the same family ;
and, secondly, that the variation of V with the energy is small over a very large
range. The shape and nature of the aggregate when the energy is nearly that of the
spherical form have not yet been determined. It is probable that as the energy
diminishes the form lengthens along the polar axis, until when the energy is very
small it becomes a long, thin, cylindrical aggregate.
