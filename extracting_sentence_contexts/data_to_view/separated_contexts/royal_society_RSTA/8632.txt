In the work described in the present communication, we are concerned with
pressures somewhat greater than have been used by these investigators, and with
the cathode glow itself in addition to the dark space, and although a knowledge of
the precise distribution of potential, from the cathode to a distance at which there is
no longer any perceptible luminosity, would be of value, it is not in the first instance
essential to a discussion of our results. For this purpose we may, in fact, merely
assume that the electric field falls away rapidly with increasing distance from the
cathode without the necessity of postulating any exact law. For it would appear
that the average velocities of the electrons at different distances from the cathode (in
which the effect of collisions naturally plays an important part) are probably more
strictly relevant to a discussion of the results, A visual examination through
coloured glasses of the cathode spectrum of the tube used in this investigation at
once shows that the term “dark space” is, in fact, a purely relative one, and refers
only to the integrated effect on the eye of all the radiations emitted.
