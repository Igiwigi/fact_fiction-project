beds, and remarks on the fossils of Leighton Buzzard, Woburn, and Potton Lower
Greensand, many of which are derived from older horizons.

The actual age of the beds, however, is determined by the fact that they are
clearly overlain by the Gault, and also by the presence of indigenous fossils such
as Waldheimia woodwardi, Terebratula depressa, Opis neocomiensis, Trigonia
aleformis, and others in situ.

Lamptuen and Waker (1903), in an important paper on the neighbourhood,
established the fact that, in undoubted Lower Greensand which was overlain by
Gault, was a fossiliferous band containing a fauna with distinctly Upper Cretaceous
affinities. From the present point of view, it is of interest to note this in connection
with the flora, which also suggests a more modern aspect than that of the preceding
beds. It is also germain to the subject to note Lampiucn’s and WaLKEr’s remark,
p. 264, in their summary, where they say: “ The lithological characters of the bed
indicate a sea-bottom of moderate depth, swept by powerful currents; and the
conditions were thus similar to those which persisted in the neighbourhood
throughout Lower-Greensand times. The overlying Gault shows a change to
more tranquil waters, probably of greater depth.”

At present we have no paleobotanical knowledge of the continent or islands which
caused those currents and supplied the débris that has been petrified in the sands.
