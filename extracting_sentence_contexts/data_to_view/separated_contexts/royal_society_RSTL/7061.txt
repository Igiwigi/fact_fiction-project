'The steering-compass is
about 4 feet, in front, and the same height above it; while in the Defence these compasses
are about 20 feet abaft it. Such a bulkhead, when magnetized at right angles to its plane, will produce a fore-and-aft
force on all points in, or nearly in, the same plane in the opposite direction to the mag-
netizing force. It will therefore, in the case of the standard and steering-compasses of
the Resistance, introduce @a —a as well as a —e, while it will produce little or no —a in
compasses placed as in the Defence, and a much smaller —e.

'These differences do not show themselves in the value of D, which is in fact less in
the Resistance than in the Defence, notwithstanding the much more powerful action of
the forces which cause it. In order to see them, we must obtain separately the two
parts of the quadrantal deviation D, or the value of @ and e. This is done in the fol-
lowing Table !—
