at or near their nests in Leeds, near Beamsley in Wharfedale, and at Askham Bryan near
York. In December 1940 and January 1941 an attempt was made to trace these birds near
the old nesting places where they had been ringed. In Leeds six of the eight birds ringed
were found again, near Beamsley all the four birds were by their nests, and at Askham
Bryan one of the three ringed birds was rediscovered. All these undoubted British birds
were of the type known as British. One further ringing record may be mentioned here.
A starlingt of peculiar colouring, whose beak description indicated that it belonged to the
British type, was ringed at Oxford in November 1933. It was seen often in the following
years, and there are records that it probably nested in Oxford in 1938 and 1939 (Mr W. B.
Alexander, personal communication). In May 1939 it was shot a few miles from the place
of ringing.

The final evidence that this type of bird is British is given by the fact that it is the only
type left when the Continental starlings leave about the middle of March. The Continental
birds are known to leave at this time from the results of ringing, from observations at light-
houses, and from the times of the bird’s reappearance in the Baltic countries recorded by
Szmirnov (1929-30).

The type of starling which has been distinguished as of Continental origin appears
suddenly in great numbers in Yorkshire during October and early November. This type
of bird has never been seen to roost singly or in pairs in nesting holes, and it would appear
that it always roosts communally in such places as reed beds or plantations. Unfortunately,
only one of this type of adult was found to be ringed,§ and this, obtained near Leeds in
late November 1939, had been marked as an adult at Lijasciema in Latvia on 2 April 1935.
Another bird, ringed as a nestling in Sweden, was also obtained in January 1940, but this
