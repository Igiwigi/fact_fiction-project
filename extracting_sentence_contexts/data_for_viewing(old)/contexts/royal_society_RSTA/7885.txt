the 6 material was formed. Eosin was particularly effective and caused ? crystals
to be produced, and to remain without change in contact with water (containing
the dye) even at 50°. The curiously specific nature of these relations may be illus-
trated by another fact. Mercuric azide also exists in both a stable orthorhombic
x form and in an unstable one of lower symmetry,* but the presence of dextrine is
quitewithout influence on the formation of the § modification or on its stability when
formed.
Rapid Deposition

The effect of dextrine or gelatine on the crystallization of the « azide was first
noticed by Lownprs}. In whatever way the precipitation may be carried out in
the absence of colloid there is always a marked tendency for some or all of the crystals
to appear either in one or other of the two types of parallel aggregation which have
been mentioned, or in twinned combinations. An unusually perfect aggregation in
the (001) plane is shown in fig. 14, Plate 22.{ In the presence of small amounts of
any of the colloids this tendency is more or less repressed, and often it is possible to
