THE limited number of elementary substances which are concerned in the elabora-
tion of the endless variety of organic compounds, long ago directed the course of
chemical inquiry into the channel of speculations as to the mode in which the
various constituents are grouped in bodies of this nature. The necessity of these
speculations became more and more imperative as the boundary of the science ex-
tended; they were indeed forced upon us by the discovery of substances isomeric
with each other which deprived us of the resort to mere quantity for the explanation
of their contrasting qualities. Wild and incongruons though some of the views, pro-
posed from time to time, may have been, it must be admitted that their influence
upon the progress of chemistry has been most beneficial ; especially in the organic
department of this science, it is to the theory of the compound radicals, the result of
these speculations, that we are indebted for the light which now begins to dawn upon
the chaos of collected facts, even if we should never succeed in isolating these radicals.

Among the various classes of organic snbstances, there is perhaps none of which,
from an early period, chemists have 80 constantly endeavoured to attain a general
conception as the gronp of compounds which have received the name of organic
bases, all—and they are now very numerous—being capable of combining, like the
metallic oxides, with acids, and being derived either from vital processes in animals
or plants, or from a variety of artificial reactions conducted in the laboratory.

The remarkable analogy between all these substances and ammonia, which in its
turn imitates as it were in its chemical deportment the mineral oxides, naturally at-
tracted the notice of chemists s00n after SgrTURNER's discovery of the first of these
alkaloids in the beginning of this century. Nor have they ever since been classified
