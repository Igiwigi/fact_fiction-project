This remark
emphasizes the fact that in order to change the base, and a fortiori in order to discuss basic
series, we must have a base to start with. Now contrary to what happens in the algebraic
theory, it is false in general that every linear topological space has a base. We could, in fact,
have proved theorem 1-1 without the hypothesis that the topology is locally convex, by
using max d (3 E(x) x, 0) instead of max Zz &,(x) af while, on the other hand, there

+v = nv |k=p
exist sins pie spaces on which thiete aie no non-zero continuous linear functionals
(Banach 1932, p. 234; Day 1940). The problem of existence of bases in locally convex
spaces has not, to the authorâ€™s knowledge, been solved even for separable Banach spaces
over an Archimedean-valued field. It will therefore perhaps be worth while to characterize
bases in F,-spaces.
