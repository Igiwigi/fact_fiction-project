Section 2(b) deals with elements that are more under the con-
trol of the expert appearing in court.

(b) Presentation in court
The information and terminology presented in forensic testi-
mony plays a critical role in determining the impact of forensic
evidence on court proceedings. There is an ongoing debate on
how forensic examiners should best express their conclusions. The key issues involve not only what constitutes the most accu-
rate way to present the findings, but also how the manner of
presentation and how it is presented affects what is actually
understood by the trier of fact when hearing expert opinions
[11], and these problems are compounded if those opinions
involve decision scales [12], or statistics and probabilities [13,14]. These are important issues. How forensic evidence is pre-
sented is at least as important as what is presented, because
the ‘packaging’ determines to a large extent if and how the
trier of fact takes on board the content.
