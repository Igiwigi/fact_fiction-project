But if the three specified criteria can be fulfilled, the data must be very nearly con-
sistent in every respect, unless there are a number of quite fortuitous compensations in
the errors. The latter state of affairs is sufficiently improbable to justify the presump-
tion that the distribution curves obtained are a close approximation to the true curves
pertaining to the same normal eye as is defined by the standard visibility data. It is
important to point out, however, that in the absence of the check afforded by the
independent measurements of the luminosity factors of the primaries, no such con-
clusion could have been drawn. It is possible to fit any set of trichromatic coefficients,
within reason, to any assumed visibility curve by choosing suitable values for the
luminosity factors of the primaries. This is easily done in a few trials by successive
approximation, and values for Lp: Lg:Ly, are obtained in the process which give
an exact luminosity summation to the assumed visibility curve. But these luminosity
factors may be quite fictitious, and may not represent the proportions by luminosity,
in which the three primaries have to be combined to match white. â€˜This is especially

the case with the blue primary. Owing to the relatively low luminosity of this primary
as compared with the red and green, and the manner in which the positive and negative
values of these two primaries appear in the blue and violet region of the spectrum, a
small error, either in the trichromatic coefficients in this neighbourhood, or in the
assumed visibility curve in the neighbourhood, may make a large difference in the value
of Ly which is required to give the desired luminosity summation. In fact, errors in
the trichromatic coefficients in the blue and violet region, which would be sub-limenal
as regards colour discrimination, may produce large errors in the luminosity factor to
be attributed to the blue primary, and would give distribution curves which were quite
unreliable for computations involving stimuli which have localised concentrations of
