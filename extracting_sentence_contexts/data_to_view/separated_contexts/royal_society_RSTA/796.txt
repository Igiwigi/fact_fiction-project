Figure 6. (a) Typical variance scaling with system size L at fixed bond dimension x = 32. The inset shows the same plot for
W = 5 with fixed error density, truncating the Schmidt spectrum at a variable bond dimension such that the total cut-off error
is less than 10~", which shows a linear scaling as expected. (b) Typical 5 of I-bits scaling with system size L at fixed bond
dimension x = 32. For high W, the typical -bit is captured to machine precision, flattening out at (log; 5) + 10-®.

superlinear growth in variance is that our states are in fact not of constant error density, as we are
simply truncating each bond at x singular values. To construct a state of constant error density,
one would have to consider a variable x on each bond such that the total discarded Schmidt
weight is below an error threshold. In such a scheme, one would still need to define a maximum
allowable x, Xmax, Such that the computation completes within a reasonable time frame.
