Group IX.

Division I.—Asymmetrica.

Section III. Lanata-typica.

Subsection 2. Lanata-zonata.

This group includes two species, Ad. 82 (P. commune THom) and Ad. 19 (P. fusco-
glaucum Biourcx), the carbon balance sheets for which are given in Table VII.
These carbon balance sheets, which are very similar in characteristics, are of the same
type as those given in Table VI for Ad. 46 and Ad. 12. This is, in fact, so much the
case, that it is difficult to distinguish between the balance sheets of Ad. 19 and Ad. 12
and from this point of view these two species might quite well be included biochemically
in the same group as Ad. 46 and Ad. 12.

Morphological details of Ad. 19 are given in Tuom’s ‘ Penicillia’ on p. 326.

Group X.
Division II.—Asymmetrica.
Section IV. Lanata-divaricata.

Two different strains of P. lilacinum TxHom, obtained from different parts of the
world, are included in this group, their carbon balance sheets being given in Table VII.
