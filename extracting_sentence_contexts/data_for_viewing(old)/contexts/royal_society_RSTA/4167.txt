We are well aware of the extent of speculation in which we are now indulging towards the end
of this work. Not only do we favour the highly unorthodox account of time-symmetric quantum
causality, but we are willing to ascribe it exchanges of negative momentum and mass to account
for the fact that, despite its spatial and temporal oddities, the quantum interaction does obey
conservation laws.

5. From information to ontology

How, then, can non-events play a part in the quantum process? The challenge’s acuity is reflected
in the various radical moves it has elicited from the rival interpretations of QM. Among these,
two famous schools have resorted to the following opposite extremes:

(i) Abandonment of ontology: Copenhagen. Since counterfactuals are facts of our knowledge,
just like actual facts, let us define QM as dealing only with knowledge, information, etc.,
rather than with objective reality.

(ii) Excess ontology: Many Worlds. The counterfactual does occur, but in a different world, split
from ours at the instant of measurement.

Our option is moderate ontology. It does not seek shelter in strict positivism, which can seldom
be falsified yet is equally barren. It rather indulges into a modicum of speculation with its
inherent risk of being proven wrong. Our inspiration comes from Wigner’s seminal essay ‘The
unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences’ [17]. Following a long line of
thinkers ever since Plato, Wigner mused that ‘The miracle of the appropriateness of the language
of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither
