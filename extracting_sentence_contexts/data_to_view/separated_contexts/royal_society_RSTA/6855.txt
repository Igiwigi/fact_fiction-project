The foregoing description of the manner in which the statistical character of the tur-
ie bulence will become gradually established is in general agreement with the experiments
& of Schmidt & Saunders (1938). It also explains why the transition between the ‘cellular’
Sand the ‘turbulent’ patterns of convection cannot be a sharp one and why it is only for
= Rayleigh numbers larger than the critical one for marginal stability by factors exceeding
& twenty that the random character of turbulence manifests itself.

& 12. THE TWO MODES OF TURBULENCE CAUSED BY THERMAL INSTABILITY

& While the description given in § 11 of the initiation of turbulence by thermal instability
‘g is in agreement with general ideas on the subject, the mathematical theory which has been
6 developed in the preceding sections is limited in its applications by the fact that the inertial
term in the equation of motion has been neglected. An essential element in all turbulence
phenomena, namely, the transfer of energy from one Fourier component of the velocity
fluctuation to another has been ignored. The linear character of the equations resulting
from this neglect of the inertial term implies that each Fourier component evolves in-
dependently of the others.
