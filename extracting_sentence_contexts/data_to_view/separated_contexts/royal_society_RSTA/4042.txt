It was found that the critical aperture radius increases with the vesicle size,
having an approximate radius of 5nm for a 40-nm wide vesicle bud [74]. Of note, the results of
this model are frequently quoted as stating that the neck radius needs to collapse to 3nm to
reach the hemifusion state. In fact, the calculations showed that for a 40-nm-wide bud the neck
radius is closer to Ineck = "aperture /Tvesicle = 1.3nm. This result is sensitive to the bilayer thickness,
spontaneous curvature and the bending moduli of the membrane, which depend on the lipid
composition and the bound protein. Another way of rupturing membranes is by applying tension.
