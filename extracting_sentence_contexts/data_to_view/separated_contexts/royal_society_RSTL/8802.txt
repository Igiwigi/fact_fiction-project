In our calculations also we have taken 2, the specific
heat of the non-gaseous portion of the charge, at its mean value. It should, however,
be taken at a higher value, since the specific heat must increase rapidly with the
temperature ; and this difference no doubt more than compensates for the 1oss of heat to
which we have referred as not being taken into account. Our hypothesis as to a portion of the charge remaining unconsumed until the pro-
jectile approaches the muzzle, is confirmed by the well-known fact that in short guns, or

Q where powder of high density or very large size is employed, considerable quantities
NJ sometimes escape combustion altogether. E The appearance of pellet. or pebble powder which has been ignited and afterwards
bay extinguished in passing through the atmosphere is well known to artillerists.

Â£ The general appearance (and in this appearance there is wonderful uniformity) is
= represented in Plate 15. fig. 5, and gives the idea of the combustion having proceeded
S from centres of ignition.

= If we imagine a grain, or rather (taking into account the 8ize of the grains of
= the present day) a pebble, of powder arriving unconsumed at a point a little in advance
= of that of maximum pressure, it is not difficult to conceive that such pebble will
Z traverse the rest of the bore without being entirely consumed, when the great influence
Z of diminished pressure, combined with the shortness of time due to the increasing
=x velocity of the projectile, is considered,

=) Thus by reference to Table X, it, will be found that the time taken by the projectile to
= describe the first foot (-305 metre) of motion is about 005 second, while the time taken
= to deecribe the remaining length of the bore, 7:25 feet (2:21 metres), is only about
=, *011 second. E The mean powder-pressure oyer the first foot, again, is about 15 tons per inch
V (2300 atmospheres), and oyer the remainder of the bore is only 525 tons (800 atmo-
E spheres).
