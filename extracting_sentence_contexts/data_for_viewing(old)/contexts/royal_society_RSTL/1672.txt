the same subject, in which he does not offer any new facts respecting these worms,
except that he successfully inoculated them upon grains of rye and barley, In the
7th volume of the Journal de Physique, published in 1776, page 369, RoyyreDI
gives a third memoir on the $ubject, chiefly intended to clear up the confusion occa-
sioned by many authors giving a different name to the same disease.

In the 7th yolume of the Journal de Physique, published in 1776, pege 43, Fer1z
FoxTANA gives a long letter on the subject of these worms ; but his chief object
is, to establish two most erroneous ideas ; first, he maintains that the infected
grains in which the worms are found, are extraneous tumors, or gall-nuts, the mere
produce of the worms ; this, however, to every one who has seen one of the infected
grains, must appear totally at variance with the fact. Secondly, that the Suspen-
sion of the muscular motions of these worms, which is extended to such extra-
ordinary length of time, is not a state of torpor, but real death, and extinction of
life ; that the worms really die as often as they get dry, and are again brought to
real life, as often as they are moistened with water.
