lymphatic nature.” These vessels formed delicate and intricate networks in the con-
nective tissues around the arteries and lymph channels and were ultimately distributed
to the mucous membranes of the mouth, pharynx and gills, to the walls of the arteries,
and to the skin, The individual vessels presented a structure similar to that of a small
artery and frequently contained blood ; but so far as I could observe the system was
not connected in any way with the blood vessels, but was continuous through a terminal
capillary network with the lymphatic vessels of normal type described by Trots, SAPPEY,
and other older anatomists.

In young Teleosteans the lymph circulation has been shown (10, 12) to resemble
that of the blood, with an outward flow to the periphery and an inward flow in the
reverse direction, necessitating afferent and efferent component vessels. From the
facts observed in Lophius, I put forward the suggestion that the ‘‘ fine” vessels were
probably the afferent component of this double-lymph circulation.

A preliminary examination made upon the Cod showed that there were in that fish

also vessels of a similar nature, associated (so far as that particular observation went)
with the ventral branch of the hypobranchial arteries, and it seemed likely that the
