place, it particularly deserves to be remarked, for possessing, in
the most eminent degree, one of the great characteristic features
of the genus to which it belongs. Hyperoxygenized muriate of
Silver is soluble in about two parts of warm water ; but, by
cooling, it crystallizes in the shape of small rhomboids, opaque
and dull, like nitrate of lead or of barytes. It is somewhat
soluble in alcohol. Muriatic acid decomposes it; as does nitric,
and even acetous acid : but the result of this decomposition is
not, as might be expected, nitrate or acctite of silver. At the
moment that the acid is expelled from hyperoxygenized muriate
of silver, a reaction takes place among its elements: oxygen is
disengaged; and the muriatic acid remains in combination
with the oxide of silver. If this fact be compared with the
manner in which nitric and acetous acids act upon hyperoxy-
genized muriate of potash, it will give a strong proof of the
proportionate affinities of all these acids for oxide of silver, in
comparison with that which they exercise towards the alkali,
Hyperoxygenized muriate of silver, when exposed to a very
moderate heat, begins by melting, and then gives out a consi-
derable quantity of oxygen gas, with effervescence; and muriate
of silver remains behind. These phenomena however differ
much, according to the degree of heat applied. When hyper-
oxygenized muriate of silver is mixed with about half its weight
