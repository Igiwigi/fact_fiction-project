I have nob thought it expedient in the map to give the wave lengths as
absolutely definite ; there may be, and probably is, a little uncertainty regarding t|
at the present time, but I hope at some future date to be able to make a ta
absolute wave lengths which can be applied to the map. At any rate, it is beli
that there cannot be any great error, since certain of the lines have been com:
with the less refrangible end of the next order of the spectrum as photographed:
the same plate, as described in the foregoing pages. Tt is worthy of remark that
this portion of the spectrum we come to a locality in which it is continuous. At fir
sight this seemed inexplicable, and many endeavours were made to obtain p
graphs of such definition as to show absorption lines of some description. I have
guecceeded in 80 doing, nor do I believe that they are to be found, except they
of the very finest description ; in fact, much finer than any I have met with below
A. In this conclusion I am borne ont by a reference to the prismatic spectrum of
this portion, in which the same locality exhibits a perfect blank as regards absorpÂ»
tion. From smaller photographs taken with the grating I believe it will be found
that this region extends beyond wave length 12,000. Tb might be thought
expedient that a reference should be made to the bands of lines which are due to
atmospheric absorption. All that can be said is that, whether ab a high altitude
or a low one, the same intensities of lines exist, except, perhaps, in one or two cases
which are very far from being well marked. I have therefore preferred to give all
the lines present, leaving a discussion as to what they may be due to a 8ubsequent
paper.

Of one thing, however, certainty may be expressed, viz. : that all rays will pass through
