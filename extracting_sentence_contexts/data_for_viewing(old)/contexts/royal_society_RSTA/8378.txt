fore|f(Z)| must be constant along each of the lines y = + ¢. It is easy to verify that
in the case of the single vortex between the barriers, |/(Z)| = 1 on both harriers and in
the case of the bounded * KARMAN street.”

C(X, #) = exp(— 4nd) and C(X, — }) = exp (4xd).

The fact that C, and therefore Y, has different values on the two barriers indicates that
across any line drawn perpendicular to the barriers and terminated by them, there is a
mean flow of 4 (X, }t) — ¥(X, —). Hf, however, we use the function F(Z) where

I (Z) = exp (=) .f (Z), it is easy to see that |F (X + 47)| = |F (X —}r)| = 1.

3.2. In spite of the fact that f(Z) has been obtained rather arbitrarily, it can be shown
that it is the unique function for the problem under consideration—or rather, any other
function that satisfies the conditions of the problem is of the form exp (IZ + m) f(Z)
where 1 and m are constants. As explained previously, the introduction of the
exponential does not alter the shape of the relative stream lines.

3.21. The conditions that /(Z) must satisfy, when expressed mathematically,

become :—

(1) f(Z) is regular in the strip — ¢ = y <c and has simple poles and zeros at the

negative and positive vortices respectively.
