104 PROFESSOR F. 0. BOWER ON THE MORPHOLOGY

Ferns at large, does not stand in any constant relation to the segmentation of the
sporangium-mother-cell, though that segmentation itself shows so singular a con-
stancy. This fact leaves the question of a shifting of the annulus more open than
it would otherwise appear.

My own opinion is that the annulus of the Leptosporangiate Ferns is homogeneous
throughout; that it has in the course of evolution undergone a shifting, not only
of its position as a whole, but also of the point of dehiscence. That the more primi-
tive type of complete annulus is that seen in the Gleicheniacew and Schizeacese,
with oblique position and median dehiscence; that while Zoasuma maintained the
oblique position and median dehiscence, part of its annulus is incompletely indurated.
In others, while the complete oblique ring was maintained the point of dehiscence
was shifted laterally, the result being as in the Cyatheacese, Hymenophyllacez, and
others with a basipetal sorus. With the transition from the basipetal sorus to the
mixed, came also a change of the annulus; maintaining the lateral dehiscence, the
