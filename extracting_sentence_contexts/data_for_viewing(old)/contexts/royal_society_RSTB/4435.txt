to the type species, an identification which may be correct, although it rests on very
slender evidence. ,

Meanwhile, Grrnrrz and Drrcumutier had described a tooth as Onchiodon
labyrinthica, and subsequently identified with it a crushed skull which they trans-
ferred to the genus Zygosaurus as Zygosaurus labyrinthicus (12). v. AMMon (11)
recognised this as another species of Sclerocephalus.

To this species CREDNER (13) in 1893 referred some imperfect skulls, a shoulder
girdle, femur and hind foot from Niederhasslich, The hind foot is that of a
Pelycosaur, and need not be further considered here. Of the other remains all,
except the original of Plate XXX, fig. 2, seem to be specifically identical, the skull
mentioned differing in the fact that the frontal is shown to enter into the orbital
margin.

These animals certainly do not belong to Sclerocephalus. The type skull of that
genus has the orbits in the middle of its length. CrepNur’s skulls have theirs far
back, so that the distance between the orbit and the otie notch is small.


EVOLUTION, AND ORIGIN OF THE AMPHIBIA. 5

The shoulder girdle described by v. Ammon as belonging to the type species of
Sclerocephalus has a large rhomboidal interclavicle and very wide triangular clavicles.
CrepNer’s animal has a small interclavicle and narrow clavicles. As CREDNER’S
