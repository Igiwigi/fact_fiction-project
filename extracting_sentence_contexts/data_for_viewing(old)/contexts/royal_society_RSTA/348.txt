This changes the statistical characteristics because 5; are zero-mean while the v; are non-negative.
In fact, the s; are then linearly correlated. A topographic kind of dependencies was proposed by
Sasaki et al. [59].

Very general kinds of dependencies can be modelled by non-parametric models. However,
such as all non-parametric models, estimation may require very large amounts of data.
A framework modelling dependencies in the form of trees and clusters was proposed by Bach &

Jordan [60]. A related approach was proposed by Zoran & Weiss [61]. 13

A recent trend in machine learning is ‘deep learning’, which means learning multi-layer : =
models, where each ‘layer’ is a linear transformation followed by a nonlinear function taken : ca
separately of each linear component, like in a neural network [62-64]. In fact, many such models : go
can be considered to be related to ICA: ICA essentially estimates one layer of such a ae
representation. This may lead to the idea that we might just estimate ICA many times, i.e. : Ss
model the independent components by another ICA, and repeat the procedure. However, this : 8
is meaningless because a linear transform of a linear transform is still a linear transform, and : S
thus no new information can be obtained (after the first ICA, any subsequent ICA would just if

return exactly the same components). Some nonlinearities have to be taken between different
layers. The connection between ICA and deep learning models is a very interesting topic for
future research.
