W. NICHOLSON ON OBLATE SPHEROIDAL

ScuaruerrLin developed his formule of connection between Legendre and Bessel
functions for their mathematical interest, and they do not appear hitherto to have been
applied to any physical problem, or even to have arisen in connection with any. It
may be stated, in fact, that they are isolated parts of a very general scheme of relation
of Bessel functions to spherical and spheroidal harmonics which would be worthy of
further developments on its purely mathematical side. In addition to ScHArHErrLiy,
it is only necessary to refer to WuirrakerR* and Macponatp,t who have obtained
formule which are in a sense converse to previously known relations, but again without
indication of their physical applications or connection with problems of spheroidal
harmonics. The typical ScuarHErrLtn formula,{ which will serve to indicate the kind of relation
under notice, is—for all positive integral values of » (zero included)—
