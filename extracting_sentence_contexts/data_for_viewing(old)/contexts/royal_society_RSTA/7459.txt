(2) If collision broadening of the energy levels is taken into account, an extra factor
e~'/7## must be included in equation (1), or more generally a factor e~/"/7/4 in each term
of (5). Here 7 is the collision time, and it should be emphasized that this rather simple
result with 7 independent of H and T is valid only on certain simplifying assumptions. It
should be noticed that as far as equation (1) is concerned the influence of the extra factor
in reducing the amplitude of the oscillations is exactly the same as if the temperature had
been raised by an amount x, where

x = h/2n*kr. (6)
The introduction of the extra factor e~?7"**/4# turns out to be very useful not only in the
interpretation of the present experiments but also of the earlier results on bismuth and zinc.
Indeed, it was pointed out as an empirical fact in the discussion of the bismuth results
(Shoenberg 1939) that the field and temperature variations of amplitude could have been
made to agree much better with (1) if the temperature had been for some reason about
1Â°K higher than it was supposed to be.

(3) It is probable that other causes of level broadening exist, for instance the periodic
electric field of the lattice, and these will also reduce the amplitude; thus the above theo-
retical formulae should be regarded as giving only upper limits to the amplitude, and they
may not even give the form of the field variation correctly. The theory of such effects has
not yet been worked out quantitatively.

We are now in a position to review briefly the information that can be obtained from
suitable measurements of the de Haas-van Alphen effect. To avoid confusion the discussion
