However, there
are significant differences between these products [29]. Coverage of in situ observations of
fluxes in the Southern Ocean is generally very poor and particularly so in austral winter. In
fact, the first successful air-sea flux mooring measurements of the Southern Ocean were only
carried out in 2010 using the Southern Ocean Flux Station (SOFS) [30]. This gave us the first
estimate of the annual air-sea flux climatology (a small net ocean heat loss of 10 Wm~?) and the
seasonal cycle, including several extreme turbulent heat loss events. That SOFS deployment was
extremely valuable but it only lasted 1 year and sampled a single location in a very large ocean.
