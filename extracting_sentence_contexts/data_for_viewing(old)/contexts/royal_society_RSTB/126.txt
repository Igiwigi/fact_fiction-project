to dry, the cap of the tube B was cautiously removed, and the apparatus arranged in
the position described. The observer expired through the tube E, inspiring through his
nose, while immediately afterwards the aspirator attached to C was set in motion. The
object of D was to allow of the free escape of the breath not sucked into B. In order

crystallisation of a supersaturated solution of a salt is set up by dust particles dropping into the solution.
The fact that the crystals were larger when there were few present doubtless depended on their having
more jelly from which to draw during their formation. The whole phenomenon suggests a possible
method for determining the number and relative rate of settling of the dust particles in given volumes of
air. As the data given above tend to show, there is probably a rough correspondence, under similar
conditions, between the number of solid particles suspended in air and the number of micro-organisms.

* This observation gives one a vivid idea of the manner in which an infectious disease may spread
through a ward.
