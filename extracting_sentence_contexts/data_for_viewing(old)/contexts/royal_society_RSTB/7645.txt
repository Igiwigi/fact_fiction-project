Material. Two nuclei, locality 55.
Description. Whorls stout, with a single row of inner lateral tubercles, more closely

spaced than in Bouleiceras arabicum, from each of which forks a pair of strong, widely
splayed, distant V-shaped ribs.

Ficure 5. Suture-lines of Bouleiceras from Jebel Tuwaiq. (Drawn on enlarged photos subsequently
bleached and reduced to natural size.) For explanation see p. 262. Nos. 1 to 4, SM. F 10807-10;
5, plate 15, figure 2, F 10661; 6, plate 15, figure 4, F 10663; 7, plate 18, figure 1, F 10691;
8, plate 15, figure 3, F 10662; 9, F 10811; 10, F 10812.

Remarks. Differs from B. arabicum in the fact that all, instead of only some, of the ribs
spring from a tubercle; in the coarser, more distant ribs; in the more numerous tubercles;
and in the stouter whorl. Theveninâ€™s pl. ii, fig. 13, may belong to this species, if the
(hidden) inner whorls are not bituberculate.
