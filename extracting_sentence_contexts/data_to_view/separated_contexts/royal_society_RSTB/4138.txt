Before doing so we may briefly indicate two explanations which have formerly
been offered regarding the delayed development of early sowings. The first of these
is that the average of the population raised from early sowings is lowered by the
inclusion of many stunted plants ; while such is actually the case, it does not suffice
as an explanation; the presence of exceptionally stunted plants “dilutes” the
observed phenomena, but does not alter their nature, and we can see from fig. 3 that
not only stunted plants, but the best plants also, show the incidence of the depressant
factor. The second explanation which has been suggested is based on the fact that
early-sown seedlings are much more likely to suffer from after-effects of the attacks
of the “sore-shin fungus,” and this view is not easily controverted. On consideration,
however, its probability is very small. Although the fungus is ubiquitous in the
soil of Egyptian cotton fields, its attacks are by no means uniform in their incidence ;
one clump of seedlings in one hole may be completely destroyed, while the next hole
