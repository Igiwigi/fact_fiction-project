Although certain details were made out regarding the nature and position of the
hyphe, their relations to the seed and seedling, and to the poisonous properties
referred to, almost nothing was discovered regarding the systematic position of the
fungus, the course of its life-history, or even how it obtains its entry into the Lolium.

In the following account of an investigation pursued in the Cambridge Botanical
Laboratory during the past session, I have succeeded in carrying our knowledge of
this remarkable fungus considerably further, and especially in rendering clear the
principal points concerning its life in the plant, and the mode of infection of the
embryo. Nevertheless, all attempts to grow the fungus outside its host-plant, or to
induce it to form spores, have failed with me as with other investigators, and although
some suggestive facts have been obtained which may help in future efforts to establish

an Ustalagine, a Uredine, or an Ascomycete of the nature of ergot or other toxic
species as yet unknown.
