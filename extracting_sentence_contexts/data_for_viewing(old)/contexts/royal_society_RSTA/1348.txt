From the viewpoint of objective structures the environment seen by an atom, rather than how
the atoms are arranged in space, is the basic concept. In the simplest case of the elements, consider
an atomic structure S = {x; € R°:i=1,2,...,N} where N < 00. We say that it is an objective atomic
structure if S is discrete and, for each i=1,2,...,N, there is an orthogonal tensor Q; such that

{Qi(xj — a) +737 =1,...,NJ=S, (1.1)

i.e. each atom sees the same environment up to orthogonal transformation. As described in [3], the
structures of elements in the first six rows of the periodic table, including Bravais and non-Bravais
lattices and structures that are not lattices at all, comply with (1.1), with few counterexamples.
Also included are the celebrated forms of carbon: carbon nanotubes (any chirality), graphene and
buckminsterfullerine (Co). A glaring counter-example is manganese. In fact, bulk manganese,
whose structure is the union of four interpenetrating Bravais lattices, is better considered as an
alloy than an element, due to degenerate spin configurations [4].

This concept (1.1) could apply to the vertices of an origami structure, and we use this
interpretation in some of the examples below. An alternative concept, also used below, will be
one that applies to the tiles, that is, to collections of points. The atomistic analogue of a tile is
a molecule. In an (ideal) origami structure each point on a tile is labelled by x €T in the flat
configuration (before folding), where the tile T C R? is a connected region bounded by creases.

The analogue of (1.1) for a collection of molecules is a set of points S= {x;,j :i=1,...,N,
j=1,...,M} where N < oo and M <0, ie. N molecules, each with M atoms. Here, consistent
with (1.1), xj; represents the position of atom j of molecule i. A useful generalization of an
