The density
of Hf is driven by the ionization of molecular hydrogen, and so an increased solar EUV flux could
potentially generate increased densities. Whilst high densities in figure 3b do occur during solar
maximum, they also occur during very low solar activity, and no direct trend can be inferred from
the long-term dataset. The fact that the densities are larger towards 2010 onwards than the earlier
measurements is of note, but could be related to an increased calibration uncertainty that can
come with using instruments with narrower slits. The HST observations of auroral emissions from Uranus [31-33] show relatively weak auroral
spots on the body of the planet, similar to Voyager 2 observed in 1986 (figure 2). Lamy et al. [31]
was the first to coordinate the observations with the arrival of a coronal mass ejection (CME) at
the planet, which likely produced enhanced auroral emission.
