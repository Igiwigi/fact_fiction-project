Hence it is justifiable to treat it as zero from the beginning. It appears then that we are justified in using the formula for internal gravity
throughout the investigation. If the artifice of the enveloping ellipsoid had not
been adopted, it would have been necessary to take note of the fact that the pear
is in part protuberant above and in part depressed below the ellipsoid of reference. M. Porncar√© did follow this last plan, and then proceeded to prove the justifiability
of using the formula for internal gravity throughout, The argument adduced above
seems, however, sufficient to prove the point.
