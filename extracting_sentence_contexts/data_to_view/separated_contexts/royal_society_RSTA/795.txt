Findability: hybrid density matrix renormalization group-X algorithm

Having seen that the localized eigenstates of the XX model can be represented reasonably

efficiently by MPS, we turn to the issue of finding such representations using the DMRG-X : =
method. In performing DMRG-X for this relatively simple model, we found that the algorithm : S
was having great difficulty converging for certain disorder realizations within a particular range : 2
of parameters. The problem is not in the ability to represent such a state as an MPS, as better MPS aed
representations can be constructed from the exact eigenstate, using an algorithm by White [46]. 22
Note that this algorithm is not the only way and may not be the optimal method to construct such ne]
MPSs, and in fact there has been much work on MPS representations for known states [47-49]. : fe
White’s algorithm iteratively applies pairwise rotations to an initial product state MPS, truncating : S
the bond dimension as necessary, to construct a variational approximation—not necessarily the [6

best one—to the exact eigenstate. Given such an MPS as an initial state, performing a DMRG-
X sweep will actually worsen the state when in the problematic parameter range (W ~ 1.5). The
typical energy variance o7 of the DMRG-X-obtained eigenstates is shown for L = 32 as a function
of W and x in figure 3a.
