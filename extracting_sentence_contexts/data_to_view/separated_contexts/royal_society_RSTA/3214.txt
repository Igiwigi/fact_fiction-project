We have shown that the running of perturbatively renormalizable couplings in
the relevant top-Higgs sector of this hybrid model can indeed be mapped onto that of the full
standard model [33]. In this gauged model, the mechanisms induced by higher-order operators affecting the
conventional lower Higgs-mass bound work much in the same way as in the Yukawa models
discussed above. Still, one quantitative difference arises from the fact that the flow of the top
Yukawa coupling receives an important contribution from the gauge sector, such that it behaves
like an asymptotically free coupling in the region between the Fermi and, say, the Planck scale. Therefore, also the strong influence of the top quark fluctuations on the running of the scalar
potential is somewhat reduced. In total, this leads to a flattening out of the lower Higgs mass
curves as shown in figure 1b towards larger cut-offs as well as to an IR window centred near
smaller Higgs masses.
