The nature of the circulation thus indicated agrees well with what is known from
other sources. The ascending current in the lower part of a cyclone can be inferred
with certainty from the inward tend of the surface winds; it is also proved by the
formation of clouds and rain. That the region of ascending air increases with height
may be deduced from the fact that the formation of cirrus is often the first sign of an
advancing cyclone, and rain may fall from high clouds some time before the lower
cloud sheet and scud are formed. Also high clouds are generally visible after the
lower sheet has cleared when the depression is passing away. The descending current of the anticyclone is proved by the absence of high cloud
at the centre of an anticyclone, for no cloud can remain uneyaporated in a descending
current, also by the great dryness that prevails at such times on mountain summits.
