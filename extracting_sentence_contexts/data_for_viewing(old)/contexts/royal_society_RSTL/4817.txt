1 equiy, of Iodine-compound 2571 100-00

Hence it would appear that the formation of the white crystals simply depends upon
a direct combination of triethylamine with iodide of ethyl, for—

In perfect accordance with this formation is the change which the iodine-compound
undergoes when subjected to the action of heat ; when rapidly heated the crystals
fuse and are decomposed, the products being triethylamine and iodide of ethyl, which
form two layers in the receiver, but rapidly unite again to the original compound.
In fact this recombination takes place to a considerable extent in the neck of the
retort; 80 that when first I became acquainted with this substance, I was for 8ome
time under the impression that the iodine-compound might be volatilized without
decomposition.

I confess I had not anticipated the possibility of the existence of a compound
having the above composition ; it appeared at the first glance in direct opposition to
the theoretical view repeatedly referred to. For if it was possible to decompose the
new iodide by potassa just as the preceding iodides, obtained respectively by the ae-
tion of bromide (or iodide) of ethyl upon ammonia, ethylamine and diethylamine, if
it was possiþle to separate from this substance a new volatile base analogous to the
preceding ethylated alkaloids, there was no reason why the process of ethylation
should cease with the fourth equivalent of ethyl, On the contrary, it then appeared
