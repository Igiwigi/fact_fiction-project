The probability curves offer incontestable evidence that the existence of these links
is not due to chance coincidences. But other evidence is available. The fact that the
vast majority of the spark lines are thus connected can be explained in no other way. A glance at the maps of the linkages given below, and consideration of the way in
which the links are combined, are convincing that although some of the links shown
are certainly due to coincidences the linkage effect is a real one. Amongst such
peculiarities may be mentioned the long sequences of the same link referred to above,
the existence of numerous meshes and congeries of meshes, of parallel sequences,
repetitions, &c.
