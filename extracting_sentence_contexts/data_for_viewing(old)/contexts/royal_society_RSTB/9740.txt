As it became apparent that both beta-barrel and lipopro-
tein biogenesis pathways are involved in the assembly of the
LptDE translocon, a number of questions developed. How do
LptD and LptE interact? When do the essential disulfide
bonds in LptD form? How does the cell regulate assembly
to ensure production of functional complexes? In particular,
LptE emerged to play a critical role in the folding and
proper oxidation of LptD.

Initial studies focused on understanding how LptD and LptE
interact. Chng et al. [41] found that LptD and LptE co-purify ina
stable 1:1 complex when a polyhistidine-tag is installed on
LptE. In fact, LptD cannot be overexpressed without LptE, and
the C-terminal domain of LptD strongly protects LptE from pro-
teolytic degradation [41]. This finding led to the development of
the plug-and-barrel model, in which LptE resides in the lumen of
the beta-barrel of LptD. Guided by the structures of three LptE
orthologues, Freinkman et al. [42] introduced a photoactivatable
amino acid into LptE at various positions and found many to
contact LptD. For one LptE position, they identified the inter-
action site in LptD to be part of a putative extracellular loop of
the barrel, confirming the plug-and-barrel model [42].

The importance of the plug for barrel biogenesis became
quickly apparent. Deletion of nine amino acids in LptD
