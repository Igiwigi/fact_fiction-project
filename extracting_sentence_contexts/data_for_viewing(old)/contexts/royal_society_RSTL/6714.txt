cilia and cells from the same sponge, are also represented by figs. 1, 2, 3 & 4, Plate

In the course of my endeavours to detect the cilia in Halichondroid sponges, I have
frequently observed, in slices of the sponge taken from the surface, that the incurrent
action has continued for a considerable period, while in sections of the same sponge
taken from deep amid the tissnes no such action of the currents could be detected. In
sections from the surface in which the inhaling process was in vigorous condition, when
the inside of the section was examined, that peculiar flickering appearance was often
visible in the cavities immediately beneath the dermal membrane which is so characteristic
of minute cilia in very rapid motion ; and although many molecules were rushing inward
with considerable velocity, others might be seen which continually waved from side to
8ide but made no progress forward; in fact they presented precisely the appearance that
T have described as taking place in the oscula of the proximal ends of the great inter-
marginal cells of Grantia compressa; and T have no doubt, in my own mind, that those
of the Halichondroid sponges were also extraneous particles of matter adhering to the
apices of the minute cilia, rendering their motions apparent, while the cilia themselves
were perfectly invisible.

Carve, in his paper on © Zoosperms in Spongilla,” published in the Annals and
Mag. Nat. Hist.” vol. xiv. Second Series, p. 334, describes ciliated bodies from a Spongilla
from the water-tanks of Bombay, somewhat similar to those of Grantia compressa, but
the basal cell appears to be proportionally larger and the cilium shorter than in those
of G. compressa. The author, in describing the detached cells and cilia, says, © At first
the polymorphism of the cell and movements of the tail are s rapid, that, literally,
