according to the different circumstances of the case, is very remarkable, and tends to
throw light on the discrepancies of different theorists, as regards the direction of

vibration.

It is further remarkable that a similar interchange, according as we substitute

critical angle. In fact, if 2e denote the acceleration of phase in the reflected ray, the
following general formula will be found to result from Mr. Green's equations,
