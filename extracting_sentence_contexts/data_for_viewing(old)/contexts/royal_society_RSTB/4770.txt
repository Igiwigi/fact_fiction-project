In support of this view is the fact that when, as in the vertical rays of fig. 30, D,
the rays fail to reach the surface, their ends are rounded, and the perichondrium
in the floor of the neural canal and in the roof of the hzemal canal does not differ
histologically from the general external perichondrium ; these rays, that is to say,
grow by virtue of the original growing zone. In further support of the view is
the fact that in some Batoids there is evidence that the perichondrial tracts may
become active without experiencing the stimulus due to the approaching primary
growing zone. In some of the caudal vertebrae of Raia, for instance, the inner and
outer parts of the horizontal rays are discontinuous (fig. 32, D, E, p. 387); the

inner part has grown outward by increments from the primary growing zone, the
superficial part is growing outward by virtue of a perichondrial meristem.
