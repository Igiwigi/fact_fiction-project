In the end of August there was renewed activity at Pelée, and on the 15th, 28th,
and 30th of that month and September 3rd there were eruptions. On September Ist
and September 3rd the Soufriére was active, the latter especially being one of the
greater eruptions of this year. These facts are sufficient to show that a distinct connection exists between the
outbursts of these two mountains during the present year. The eruptions of the
Soufritre have sometimes followed, sometimes preceded, those in Martinique, but, as
a rule, the greater eruptions of the one volcano have been accompanied by eruptions
at the other within a period of one or two days. The outbursts of Pelée have been
more numerous than those of the Soufriére.
