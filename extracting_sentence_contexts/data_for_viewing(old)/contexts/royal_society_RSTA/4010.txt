Saliva specimens do not normally require extensive treatment prior to MS analysis. Typically, only
solid particles are removed by centrifugation. In several studies, proteins were precipitated with
small amounts of an organic solvent prior to analysis of low-molecular-weight drugs [38,70]. In


addition, SPE may be performed to preconcentrate and purify the analytes [69]. Nasal mucus can
be collected by blowing out the nose over a beaker or by using a swab. Nostrils can be pre-washed
with saline solution prior to specimen collection.

Saliva is normally used in the assays targeting drugs of abuse (amphetamines, opioids and
cannabis) [71,72], therapeutic drugs [67,70,73], alcohol (ethanol), hormones (cortisol) and steroids
[64]. Salivary metabolomics can provide an outlook for diagnosis of oral cancer and periodontal
disease [74,75]. In fact, many researchers are interested in the composition of saliva proteome
[76]. Saliva can also be analysed to monitor human exposure to toxic elements such as arsenic
[77]. MS analysis of nasal mucus has not yet become popular. In one study, volatile organic
compounds were analysed in nasal mucus specimens [78]. Some of these compounds were
produced by the bacteria causing sinus infections. Nasal mucus can also be used to investigate
the exposure of human subjects to air contaminants; for example, traces of cocaine dust in forensic :
laboratories [79]. =
