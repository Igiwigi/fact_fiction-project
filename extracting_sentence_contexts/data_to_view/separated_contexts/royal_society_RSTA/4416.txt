But the correlation of /, and J, will be
Bidentical with that of gl, + ¢ and ql, + ¢, as I have shown elsewhere.t Thus the
smean of the patent character in the offspring may be used to measure the correlation
Sbetween latent characters in their parents. % Tosum up our results for thoroughbred mares, we conclude that their fecundity,
notwithstanding the imperfections and difficulties of the record, has been demon-
E strated to be inherited, and this, both through the male and female line, so far as
“we can judge, with an equal intensity. The apparent value of this intensity, except
gin the case of latent characters, is much below that required by the law of ancestral
5 heredity, roughly, perhaps, 2/5 of that value; but there is considerable reason
2 to think that this reduction may take place owing to the presence of fictitious values
in the record arising from the peculiar circumstances under which thoroughbred
horses are reared and bred. These fictitious values would hardly influence the
means and variability of arrays like they must do the relationship between pairs of
individuals. Hence, when we deal with such means and variabilities as in the cases
