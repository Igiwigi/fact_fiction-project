ments in segmentation of Sarsia, I may quote an experiment in which a score of specimens were diyided in all
sorts of ways, such as leaving the polypite attached to one half, or three marginal bodies in one portion and
the remaining marginal body in the other portion, ' &c., &c. Yet, although it was yery exceptional to
find the two portions presenting an equal degree of endurance, no uniform results pointing to the cause of the
variations could be obtained. In most cases, however, the energy, as distinguished from the endurance, of tho
larger segments was conspicuously greater than that of the smaller. But it is curious that in many cases the
effects of 3ock appeared to he more marked in the larger than in the smaller segments—the latter, for ome
time after the operation, contracting much moro frequently than the former, To show hoth these effects, one

presumably to be accounted for by the consideration that the ganglia in the s8maller
segments were more potent than those in the larger.

experiment may be quoted. A specimen of Sarsia was divided into two parts, of which one was a quadrant.
Immediately after the operation the results were as follows :—
