Hoim in museo, STRAND (1929), p. 350.

The evidence for the presence of this species in the Rushton area is cumulative and
depends upon a number of fragments of detached portions of the dorsal shield, with
characters both of shape and surface in complete agreement with Liynarsson’s figures
and descriptions. The reference to Ssé@REN’s species cannot, however, be regarded
as certain, owing to the fact that P. pinus, Houm MS., and P. elandicus are very much
alike, only differing at all clearly in the number of thoracic segments and in the shapes
of the pygidia. The two species are found in the same horizon at Borgholm, in the
Isle of (land, Sweden, and also at Roykensie, in Norway (Mjésen district).

Dr. WestercArp was kind enough to send photographs of the two species, and also
specimens of P. elandicus from the type locality. The latter are now deposited in the
British Museum (Nat. Hist.) at South Kensington (Nos. In 28393-28398).

Locality and Horizon.—Rushton, loc, 3.—Middle Cambrian, from loose block
