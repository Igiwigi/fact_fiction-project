Support for geoengineering was not significantly altered
by the experimental manipulation at all, and, in line with previous literature, people with
higher and lower levels of scepticism responded to the argument in different ways [38]. This
suggests that the overall impact of moral hazard arguments in public and policy discourse
may be simply to reinforce existing beliefs. For those strongly opposed to geoengineering,
the moral hazard argument presents another piece of evidence confirming their views; for
those sceptical about climate change, the moral ‘hazard’ of reducing mitigation is in fact not a
hazard at all. In addition, it is clear that the counter moral hazard argument could have been constructed
differently. In this study, the argument states that, although geoengineering may distract from
current policies, this is not in fact a moral hazard.
