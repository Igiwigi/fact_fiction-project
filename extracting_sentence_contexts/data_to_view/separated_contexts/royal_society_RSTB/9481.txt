(i) Genome evolution in fungi

Fungi are characterized by two life forms: one, yeast-like, is uni-
cellular. The other is multicellular and includes fungi with
macroscopic fruiting bodies as well as filamentous fungi. In
this study, we focus on the clade Dikarya, a subkingdom of
fungi that account for roughly 98% of described species.
