These experiments were often repeated with the same general results; and yet
there were times when every care had been taken not to vary any of the circumstances
of the arrangement, when they could not be reproduced.

In seeking for the cause of these phenomena, there were two which naturally sug-
gested themselves as probable : the first was the unequal action of heat npon the dif-
ferent elements of the battery, exciting thermo-electric currents; and the second the
possible excitement of opposing currents from the metallic steam case.

In heating and cooling the battery by the means which I have described, it is ob-
vious that the temperature of its different parts would be unequally affected ; and, in
fact, I found by the thermometer that a difference of ten or twenty degrees would
occasionally exist between the liquid in contact with the zinc and that in contact
with the copper: these differences I attempted to increase and modify in numberless
experiments. On one occasion 1 charged the battery with a cold acid solution of
sulphate of copper on the outside, and poured boiling standard acid into the interior
tube: the inequality did not long exist, but its action was steady at 85 cubic inches
per five minutes. I heated the connecting wires to different degrees, and ultimately
placed spirit-lamps under them, to maintain them at a low red heat; but the
working rate of the battery, and its steadiness as measured by the voltameter, were
not sensibly affected thereby. In short, I convinced myself, that though heat was
obviously connected with the phenomena, heat, alone was not their exciting canse.

With the view of ascertaining whether the residual current, after the sudden cessa-
