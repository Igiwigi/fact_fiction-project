case of sharp measurements, one can always assume that the response functions &(k|A, M) take 6 |

only values 0 or 1, i.e. they are deterministic functions of A [24]. As a consequence, one can restate

the KS conditions of equation (2.1) in the language of measurement-non-contextual ontological 3

models as [3S
Ei, ME(jIA, M)=0 for ix; :g

and Yella M)=1. (3.4) 2

The situation changes, however, when measurements are not sharp. In fact, it has been proven :2
that, due to the statistical identification above, one can no longer assume the response functions 18
are deterministic. A rigorous proof has been provided in [24], the intuitive explanation is the &
following. Given a POVM effect E, consider its spectral decomposition >; i/7;, where the :ยง
eigenvalues j; satisfy 0 < 4; <1.
