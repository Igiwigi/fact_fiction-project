One of the reasons why the life history and physiology of the pennate diatoms is so
much better known than that of the Centricae may be found in the fact that the
former are more resistant and easier to culture than the latter. The classic work on
culture conditions for centric diatoms was done by Mique. (1892-7), ALLEN and
NELson (1910) and ALLEN (1914). The technique used by these authors was either to
pick out individual diatoms under the microscope and to place them in a sterile
culture medium (Miguet’s or ALLEN’s modification of it) or to dilute a small quantity
of a plankton sample containing diatoms in a certain amount of culture fluid and to
subdivide this into a number of culture flasks.
