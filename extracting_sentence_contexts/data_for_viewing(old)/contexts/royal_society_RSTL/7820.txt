The fixed order of the combinations in the written abecedarium renders it necessary to
consider them separately, and to pick out by repeated acts of mental attention those
which fall into any particular class, Considerable labour and risk of mistake thus arise.
The Logical Abacus was devised to ayoid these objections, and was constructed by placing
the combinations of the abecedarium upon separate moyeable slips of wood, which can
then be easily classified, selected and arranged according to the conditions of the pro-
blem. The construction and use of this Abacus have, however, been sufficiently described
both in the © Proceedings of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society” for 3rd if
April, 1866, and more fully in my recently published work, called © The Substitution 3
of Similars,” which contains a figure of the Abacus. I will only remark, therefore, that
while the logical slate or printed abecedarium is convenient for the private study of
logical problems, the abacus is peculiarly adapted for the logical classroom. By its
use the operations of classification and selection, on which Boorz's logic, and in fact any
logic must be founded, can be represented, and the clearest possible solution of any 4
question can be shown to a class of students, each step in the solution being made
distinctly apparent. 4

23. In proceeding to explain how the process of logical deduction by the use of the f
abecedarium can be reduced to a purely mechanical form, T must first point out that
certain simple acts of classification are alone required for the purpose. If we take the
eight conceivable combinations of the terms A, B, C, and compare them with a propo-
8ition of the form
