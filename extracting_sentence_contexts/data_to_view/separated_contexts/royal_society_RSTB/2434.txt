In many respects the curve for Platypus is between that of Echidna and
Marsupials, whilst the curve for Marsupials approaches in character that of Mammals. For comparative purposes, it is instructive if the production of CO, found in the
experiments is plotted as ordinates against the difference in temperature between
animal and environment as abscisse. This takes into account the fact that the
temperature of the different animals is itself varying, and to a different degree, in the
various groups of animals. This was done for each experiment from the data tabulated on pp. 22-24. From
such curves an average curve for the three Echidnas, three Marsupials, and two
Mammals was derived by taking the values for a difference of temperature of 5, 10,
15Â° C., &., as indicated by the individual curves and averaging them.
