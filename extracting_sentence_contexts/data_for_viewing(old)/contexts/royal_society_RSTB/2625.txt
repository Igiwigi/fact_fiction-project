whose elliptical axes give rise to a “median dark line” in transverse sections.

at the edge of the septum. This apex is, in many cases, visible to a careful observer as
an extremely fine “serra,” or tooth; in other cases again, magnifying power must be
used to demonstrate the distinct apices of “strie.” As a matter of fact, a great
number of genera, in which serree are readily visible, have been described by former
authors as smooth-edged, e.g., several in the sub-division of Eusmilinw, E.H. It is
only the precise microscopy of such genera which can permit of their proper description
and classification. Now, after the microscopic research of this paper, one may compare
a Turbinolid type (fig. 688) and any Eusmilinid or Stylinid type (¢f fig. 35). Com-
parison will show the fundamental similarity in their microscopic structure, aud the
contrast they present to the various types of ridged septa below.

T need scarcely repeat again how each pair of striz on the opposite septal surfaces
is the external expression of a “trabecula” in which “fascicles” of fibres are
gathered round successive opaque-looking ‘‘ centres of calcification” in the median
