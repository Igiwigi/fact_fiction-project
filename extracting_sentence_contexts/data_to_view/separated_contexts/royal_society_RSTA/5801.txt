For


simple Bianchi types this is indeed true, but later it was shown that such smoothing processes
were probably not efficient enough [125]. In fact, the problem of explaining why the universe is homogeneous on the largest scales must
be decided long before the universe became Friedmann-like, due to a geometrical property of
the non-intersection of the past light cones called the horizon problem. The existence of particle
horizons would prevent the further synchronization of conditions in such a universe because
domains in the microwave sky separated by more than a few degrees are causally disconnected,
and, in fact, were so since the time of emission (last scattering surface). The Mixmaster universe,
although describing a period before the Friedmannian stage of evolution of the universe, cannot
solve the horizon problem and allow causal communication between such regions. This follows
from detailed calculations of D.
