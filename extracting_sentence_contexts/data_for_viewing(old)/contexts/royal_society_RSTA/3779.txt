The samples show very high values around 90000 fs? for the GDD, which is a prerequisite
for a possible applications in dispersion compensation. Although the GDD curves are rather
fluctuating, the samples could be employed in certain wavelength regions and in situations
where some losses are tolerable. Group refractive indices of 700 and 70 were determined for TE
and TM polarization, respectively, which are substantially larger than the ones expected in the
metamaterial case. These values are remarkable, given that the sample structure is only of the
order of 100nm thick. This work was conceived in A.S.’s diploma thesis (University of Bonn,
2005).

Symmetrizing the spectral line shapes of the resonances for device applications was aided by
using the simple and intuitive design features of the presented complex transmission model in
the complex plane. In fact, we can symmetrize the observed spectral waveguide resonances by
choosing the thickness of the waveguide layer appropriately.
