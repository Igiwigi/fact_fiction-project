(g) Transdifferentiation of chondrocytes into
osteoprogenitors

It was previously hypothesized that all chondrocytes under-
going hypertrophic differentiation also underwent apoptosis
to allow void spaces to be formed for subsequent vasculariza-
tion and bone formation. However, recent lineage tracing
studies have demonstrated that a portion of these cells trans-
differentiate into osterix (Osx/Sp7)* osteoprogenitors [53,54].
These cells contribute to both endosteal and trabecular bone
formation within the primary spongiosa. Flow cytometry
assisted cell sorting (FACS) further confirmed the metabolic
activity and bone formation capacities of these cells, indicat-
ing that hypertrophic chondrocytes actively contribute to
bone formation. Indeed, up to 60% of the total mature

osteoblasts found in endochondral bones of one-month-old
mice appear to originate from ‘terminally’ differentiated
hypertrophic chondrocytes [53]. The molecular programme
of how hypertrophic chondrocytes transdifferentiate into
active osteoblasts is not yet fully understood and remains to
be elucidated.
