& that an observation with the ship's head Zast would in consequence differ 100*
even more from an observation taken at the same place with the ship's he: :
It was doubtless the experience of such extreme differences which led to what mig
almost appear an excessive multiplication of observations, as well as to the const;
endeavour to diversify the circumstances of the direction of the ship's head,
which precautions have contributed in no small degree to reduce within such eo
paratively small limits the differences which are seen in the Tables between t
mean values of the Declination on the ' 8game or on successive days. Even t
remaining minor differences which appear might probably have been still
reduced by another precaution, the desirability of which may not have been 80 clear
apprehended at the time, namely, the recording the direction of the ship's head at tl
precise instant when the pointing of the compass is read. Unless the two observe
facts strictly synchronize, the very slight and almost momentary change in the dire
of the ship's head will occasion an apparent discordance in snccessive results when t|
Ship's head is near the extreme points of Fast, or West, though it may have little ulb
mate influence on the position or the direction of the isogonic lines in the final re

of a great body of observations. This remark applies in a far minor degree to the diff ;
ences of successive or of nearly adjacent, results of the Inclination or Intensity, when
no such excessive increase in the amount of the deviation-corrections takes place wh el
approaching the point of 90% of Inclination. A critical eye may well regard the gener
