those from lymphocytes (or thymocytes) from the ox, fowl and man. It would be similarly
impossible to distinguish between salmon and herring protamins on the basis of the small
differences in their arginine contents given in table 5 were it not that other differences

in their composition are present. It is thus clear that, except in favourable cases, species
specificity in the basic proteins of cell nuclei is difficult to detect by purely chemical
means, although it must be assumed to exist.

The demonstration of cell specificity in basic proteins would, a priori, be expected to
present more difficulties. In fact, its detection seems to depend, as does that of species
specificity, on the choice of favourable material. When a protamin is present in the sperm
head, as it is in the salmon, its difference from the histones present in the nuclei of the
somatic cells is so obvious that it provides a clear-cut case of cell specificity which is as
definite as that of the species specificity shown by a comparison of the basic proteins in
salmon and cod sperm heads. On the other hand, as a reference to table 4 will show,
there is little, if any, difference between the analytical results yielded by the histones
from different cell nuclei of the ox. The same analytical methods, however, if applied
alone, would scarcely serve to detect species specificity in salmon and herring protamins.
Hence the results with histones from the ox must not be taken to disprove the existence
of cell specificity in this species; they must be regarded as negative. The histones from the
fowl present a much more favourable case. Those from the spleens and thymus glands,
assuming them to originate from the nuclei of identical cells, would be expected to be the
