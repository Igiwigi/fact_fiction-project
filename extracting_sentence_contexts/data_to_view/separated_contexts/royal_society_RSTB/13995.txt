This negative effect is likely a consequence comparable to genes found in the bee-associated L. apinorum
of high concentrations of saturated fatty acids (SFA) in and L. kunkeei [121]. These findings render Leuconostoc a
food limiting the uptake rate of FAs by midgut cells (as potential candidate taxon for further studies on bee nutrition
reviewed by [111]), which can subsequently damage cell with respect to PUFA biosynthesis. In fact, PUFA biosyn-
membranes [112]. At the same time, polyunsaturated fatty thesis is an established biomarker for distinguishing
acids (PUFAs), and more precisely the ratio of omega 6:3 microorganisms and their implications for host health
fatty acids, are important for cognitive abilities in honeybees [122,123]. Our findings suggest that this link might also
