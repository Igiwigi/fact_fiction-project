, that a
tooth found in the cave at Scharzfels was ascertained by M.
HOLLMAN to be that of a rhinoceros ; and of Espe, that large
cervical vertebre of an elephant were found by M. Frx1scu-
MAN in the cave of Schneiderloch ; it follows, that these two
animals occur, though very rarely, in the caves of Germany,
and they may have been introduced by the few hyznas that

occasionally inhabited them ; that they lived in the neighÂ»
bourhood of these caves, in the period immediately preceding
the formation of the diluvium, is probable, from the occur-
rence in it of the bones of the elephant and rhinoceros near
the caves of Scharzfels and Alterstein, mentioned by BLu-
MENBACH. ( Archaeologia Telluris, p. 15.) The fact mentioned by M. Cuv1ies, of the same hyzna being
common to the caves and gravel of France and Germany,
and that ascertained by myself, of the Ursus spelzus oc-
curring in the gravel of Upper Austria, proves both these
extinct species to have been the antediluvian contemporaries
of the extinct elephant and rhinoceros; there is therefore no
anachronism in finding the remains of the two latter in a den
that was occasionally inhabited by such hyzenas and bears. With respect to the analogies of the diluvian sediment and
the 8talactite in Germany and Yorkshire, in the case of the
open caves that have been disturbed and ransacked for centu-
ries, it is hopeless to expect evidence of what was the precise
5tate of these deposits'in each individual cavern at the time it
was first entered. Still there is information respecting some
that have been recently discovered, which is to our purpose.
