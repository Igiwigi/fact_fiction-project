As soon as the specimens had become quiescent
in the bath they were removed from the liquid air and allowed to lie on the table
until they had regained the ordinary temperature, when they were prepared for
microscopic examination, as previously described. The object of using liquid air in
this instance, it should be noted, was simply to ensure the most rapid possible rate
of cooling, and not in any way to test the effect of liquid-air temperatures upon the
alloys. It was, however, necessary to ascertain whether the mere fact of exposure to
such a low temperature produced any change in the micro-structure of the alloys, and
to test this point duplicate specimens of the alloys were immersed in liquid air for a
similar length of time, but the immersion in this case only took place after the
temperature of transformation had been passed ; specimens of pure lead and of pure
tin were included in this experiment. A third set of similar specimens was then
allowed to cool very slowly in the electric oven itself, and the micro-structure of the
three sets was subsequently compared. In the case of pure tin, the experiment was
tried in view of the fact that tin is known to exist at low temperatures in the allo-
tropic form of a grey powder, and it was supposed that some sign of this phase might
be detected in the specimen cooled in liquid air; this was not the case, however, and

the conclusion is justified that the duration of the exposure to liquid air was not long
enough to allow this transformation to occur.
