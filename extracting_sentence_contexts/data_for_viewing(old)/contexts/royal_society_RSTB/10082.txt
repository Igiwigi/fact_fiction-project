erate different extinction risks during a taxon’s existence.
Altered extinction risks change species longevities, which,
as a consequence, change the strength of any inferred diver-
sity-dependent regulation [29].

Any empirical correspondence between the species and
genus diversity curves [5] should not therefore be taken to

imply that analyses at either species or genus level are equiv-
alent. Genus-level origination encodes substantially more
divergent ecologies than those perceived by speciation:
higher taxonomy is, in one sense, a crude index of morpho-
logical disparity through time [38]. If speciation is in fact a
rather easy and common process that perpetually produces
ecologically similar species [39], then it could be argued
that the limits to long-term equilibrium models of diversifica-
tion [40] are not regulated by speciation but rather by
origination of evolutionarily significant units at higher taxo-
nomic levels [41-44]. Equilibrial assumptions are more
common for species-level analyses performed by neontolo-
gists than analyses on higher taxa [45], which contradicts
the empirical palaeontological evidence [5] and standard
palaeontological practice [4,27,46—48].

The assumption of the species as the canonical unit of
