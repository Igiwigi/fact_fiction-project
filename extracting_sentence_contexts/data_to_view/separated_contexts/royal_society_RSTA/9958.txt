The Dead-Weight Standard Pressure Gauge. During the course of the experiments it was found that more concordant results
could be obtained than had been anticipated. The beam apparatus already described
only gave pressures agreeing among themselves to about 1 per cent.; this was
surmised to be due to the fact that the hardened steel balls at the fulcrum and at the
top of the plunger gradually crushed the metal under them so as to form a
depression, thus slightly altering the effective ratio of the arms of the beam every
time it was put up. That some such effect was produced is shown by the fact that
the oscillation of the arm HI (Diagram 2) caused a vertical oscillation in the beam,
especially when the movable metal piece at the top of the plunger (not shown in the
diagram) was worn into a depression. Tt was therefore decided to substitute one of Messrs.
