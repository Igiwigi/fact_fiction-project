aim of this work is to investigate such a strain-limiting model for the response of vicoelastic
materials. More precisely, we are interested in studying a model where the linearized strain is
given as a function of the stress and the stress-rate.

Implicit constitutive theories certainly allow for a more general structure for material response
compared to explicit ones, which, in fact, can be seen as a subclass. Moreover, models with
limiting strain provided by implicit constitutive theories are able to capture experimental
observations providing theoretical justification for the response of materials such as Gum metal
and titanium alloys that were previously proposed in a rather ad hoc manner (see [3] and
references therein). Even though some implicit models for describing the elastic response of
solids existed for a considerable amount of time, the importance of the cause and the effect in
those descriptions was not realized until recently when constitutive models were introduced
to describe the response of elastic solids wherein the stress T and the deformation gradient are
related implicitly.

In the classical Cauchy elasticity, the stress is a function of the strain B. As a result of
linearization of the strain we obtain T = C: €, where : stands for matrix product, C is the fourth
order elasticity tensor and € denotes the linearized strain. In conclusion, one could only obtain a
