One possible direction could be the use of self-controlled
designs such as the self-controlled case series [41]. Other possible future additions include
estimation of absolute risk (instead of relative risk) to better facilitate benefit-risk assessment,
as well as evaluating effect heterogeneity across subpopulations. In fact, we sincerely hope that
observational researchers will move their focus from performing one-off studies to refining the
high-throughput approach as described in this paper. Rather than each researcher working in
isolation, we hope the scientific community will come together to build the process that generates
evidence. To facilitate this, we have made all software necessary to execute this study available as
open source (https: / /github.com/OHDSI/StudyProtocols/tree/master /LargeScalePopEst).
