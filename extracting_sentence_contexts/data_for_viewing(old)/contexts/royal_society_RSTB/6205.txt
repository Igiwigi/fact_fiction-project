only known from the Lower Devonian of the Northern Hemisphere in the Silurian
of the Southern Hemisphere. This may be merely due to the conditions for the
preservation of a record of the flora having been favourable in this region of Victoria.
On the other hand it may indicate an earlier development of land-plants in this
region. Another point of importance in considering the evolutionary history of
plants concerns the size and structural complexity of these Silurian plants. They
are by no means very primitive land-plants. Their existence implies a preceding
period of evolution, of what length there is as yet no evidence.

It is evident that further discoveries may be anticipated in the Silurian rocks of
Australia and perhaps in more ancient rocks. The beds dealt with here have
yielded the most ancient land-plants as yet clearly known and of definitely determined
age. What is wanted is an extension of the body of accurate fact regarding the
pre-Devonian land-flora. Without neglecting other regions of the world, the early
rocks of Victoria appear at present to be the most promising field for this work.

Driacnosis oF NEw GENERA AND SPECIES
Baragwanathia, n. gen.

Stems of considerable size clothed with spirally arranged, long, simple leaves.
Leaves maintaining a uniform width, not contracted from a markedly expanded
base and not spine-like. Sporangia, among the leaf-insertions in certain zones
of the ordinary shoots; possibly adaxially, near the bases of leaves. Large
cylindrical central cylinder with primary xylem, which is stellate in cross-section
and composed of uniform tracheides with narrow annular thickening.
