not aware that the rapidity with which any portion of the
spinal marrow is destroyed, influences the result. We also
see why the sudden destruction of one half of the spinal mar-
row, after it had been divided; not only brought death'to that
part-of the animal to which-it belonged, but to the other also;
a'fact which -seems in direct opposition, to-M, LE GALLors'
explanation of that we have just been considering.

In M. Le GaLro1s' experiments, the --spinal marrow was
always crushed by a stilet, of precisely: the'same dimensions
with the cavity of the spine:\ In the foregoing experiments,
the spinal marrow was either removed- or destroyed by a
comparatively small wire moved about in-it till all its func-
tions ceased. The reader will easily understand, from what
has been said, why this apparently slight circumstance occa-

We have just seen the difference of the result when any por-
tion of the spinal marrow 1s successively destroyed. by parts,
