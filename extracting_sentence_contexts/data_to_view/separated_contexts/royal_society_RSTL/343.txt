count of similar formation of the organs of generation in a dog,
is the intention of the present Paper. The subject having already

observations which have been made respecting them. The- causes of monstrous productions of every kind are at
present equally unknown, but it is highly probable that they are
very similar; and, when once, they. have been brought into
action, it would be reasonable to suppose, that the influence
should be continued.
