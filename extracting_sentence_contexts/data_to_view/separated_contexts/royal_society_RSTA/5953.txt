The negative term —o?/2 may be surprising, given that the multiplicative changes in equation
(2.1) are distributed symmetrically about jdt. It is, however, a well-known property, usually
derived using It6 calculus as in [22]. In simple terms, it reflects the fact that the product of the
symmetric perturbations of a number is less than its square, e.g. (1 + €)(1 — €) =1— <1. The ensemble average (or expectation value) of resources is defined as

a LS
(xO) = lim 5 Do xi). (2.5)
i=l

Its evolution is computed by applying this operation to equation (2.1) to get
d(x(#)) =u (x(t) dé, (2.6)

since (dW;(t)) =0. With initial condition x;(0)=1 for all i, this describes exponential growth,
(x(t)) =exp(ut), at a rate equal to the drift, ~.
