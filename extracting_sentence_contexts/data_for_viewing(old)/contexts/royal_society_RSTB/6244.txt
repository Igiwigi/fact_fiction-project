capacity for self-differentiation of the main vessels of the embryo has yet been made.
Experiments are, however, in progress on this problem using tissue culture methods.
To apply the conceptions of THoma and others to the problem of intra-embryonic
vascular development, we must picture an underlying morphological plan which
gradually unfolds as development proceeds, and in conformity with which the
vascular system condenses out of a series of capillary plexuses. Unless we can shed
some light on the nature of this pre-existing plan, each stage in the development
of which presumably conditions the next, and which involves the whole general
problem of the nature of the causes underlying development, we are not likely to
advance far along this path. One fact we may, however, notice at the outset.

The capillary system of even an early embryo is by no means a uniform one, and
is itself conforming to a morphological plan. It is this fact which renders the
“ Netztheorie ” in a rigid form untenable. Certain areas of early embryos have a
dense supply of capillaries, while others in certain circumscribed areas remain bare
for considerable periods. One of the most fruitful lines of advance in the study of
capillary distribution would seem to be the intensive study of such non-vascular
areas. The somites until about the six day stage in the chick are non-vascular areas,
so is the central nervous system until about four days, so also are layers of definite
thickness beneath the limiting epithelia of the body. The last type of non-vascular
area we can readily see in injected limb-buds.

It seems permissible as a preliminary hypothesis to attempt to explain the
condensation of capillary plexus round an organ which itself for some time remains
