when the parent is about half or two-thirds grown, The careful observer will, how-
ever, be always able to detect a trace of its former attachment, in a sort of cicatrix,
left at the corresponding part of the respiratory chamber. 35, It is not clear by what channel fecundation takes place, whether each Salpa B
impregnates its own oyum by discharging the contents of its own testis into the cir-
culatory fluid, which would be a procedure altogether anomalous ; or whether, on the
other hand, impregnation do not rather take place from without, a presumption
which is strengthened by analogy, and by the fact, that the testis does not seem to
attain maturity early enough to fecundate its own ovum. The spermatic fluid may
have access to the ovum by the gubernaculum becoming hollow and tubular, as will
be seen to be the case in the Pyrosomata, and indications of such an occurrence have
occasionally manifested themselves. 36.
