It turns out that not just man-made laboratory measurements but any
interaction with the natural macroscopic environment will break up the state of an ensemble of
entangled quantum systems into independent, ultimately collapsed states of its components. This
process is called decoherence (e.g. [13]). As a matter of fact, it is impossible to completely shield a
quantum system from unpredictable macroscopic influences of the environment, and superposed
states are difficult to maintain in the laboratory. =
A measurement apparatus is a human-built artefact in which a quantum system is deliberately :
made to interact with a macroscopic device. This device is constructed in such a way that in
the special case when the quantum system is in an eigenstate of the observable which the nee)
apparatus is supposed to measure, the initial perturbation propagates through the instrument :
and is amplified to give an observable classical, macroscopic effect that depends on the initial a]
eigenstate (e.g. the particular position of a pointer). When the quantum system to be measured DNS
is now in a superposed state, it gets entangled with the ‘quantum end’ of the apparatus—but area
as subsequent interactions propagate through the instrument, inevitable entanglement with the eal
environment will eventually cause the single quantum state of the total system (measured system .
plus instrument) to break up into mutually correlated basis states: (i) the instrument signals a
specific macroscopic change and (ii) the original quantum system emerges in a corresponding
eigenstate.!> Because of the human intention involved in the construction or use of a measurement
apparatus, does a quantum measurement process represent an information-driven interaction?
