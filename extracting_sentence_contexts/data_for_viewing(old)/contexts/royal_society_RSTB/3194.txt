Sulcus diagonalis.—In this, the right hemisphere, the suleus diagonalis is a
strongly-marked independent sulcus. It notches the edge of the operculum
superficially.

Sulcus centralis.—The Rolandic sulcus of the right hemisphere is not divided so
remarkably by change of direction of its two parts as in the left hemisphere. Thus,
the line joining its two ends makes an angle of 76° with the mesial plane. This

difference is owing to the fact that the genua are not so sharply marked, and the
direction of the inferior half of the sulcus is vertical and not backwards as on the
left side. The gyrus centralis anterior (ascending frontal) is, consequently, much
narrower than on the left side.

Suleus Sylvii.—This important fissure is remarkably symmetrical with that of the
left hemisphere. Tt extends by its ramus posterior somewhat further posteriorly,
i.e., to the normal central plane of the gyrus supra-marginalis, but otherwise requires
no special description.

Lobus insularis (eri).

Sulcus limitans insula Reilti.—This sulcus, though shallower, has the same typical
