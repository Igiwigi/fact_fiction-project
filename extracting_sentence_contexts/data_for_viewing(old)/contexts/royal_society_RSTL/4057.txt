nuclens was circular (fig. 12.). In a few nucleated cells indeed the cellzeform nucleus
was of a somewhat oval shape (fig. 17.), but this did not seem to be more than what
I had occasionally observed in the blood of those Mammifera, in which the © red
corpuscles” are circular.

85. My reference to the blood of the Paco thus appeared to decide against an
essential correspondence in form between the cellzeform nucleus of the nucleated cell
and the © red corpuscle.” A little further study of the blood of the Paco however
800n cleared away this apparent difficulty, and showed me a state of things more
corroborative of my view regarding the nature of the © red corpuscle,” and in mnch
closer correspondence with analogy perhaps than would have been that which I sup-
posed possible. I discovered, in fact, corpuseles in different stages of transition, from
the circular form similar to that of the cellzeform nucleus within the nucleated cell,
to the oval form of the perfect © red corpuscle;” and I also discovered that in these
different stages of transition in respect of form there are different degrees of colora-
tion (figs. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.).

86. I had already observed progressive degrees of coloration in the circular © red
corpuscles” of the Mammifera generally. Thus, in the blood of the Horse, for example,
I had observed corpuscles (fig. 19.) similar on the one hand to the © red corpuscle”
(fig. 20.) but uncoloured, and on the other to the cellzeform nucleus of the nucleated
cell (fig. 15.), and this in all respects. Such corpuscles I was disposed to regard as
celleform nuclei recently set free from the nucleated cells, but not yet reddened by
the secretion of colouring matter into their interior, Again, I had obseryed corpuscles
