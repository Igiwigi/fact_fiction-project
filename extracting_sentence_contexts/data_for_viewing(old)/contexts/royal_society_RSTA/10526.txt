§ 59. I have also applied the sun-spot formula to the results for non-cyclic effect in
Tand H given in Tables VI. and VIL, and to the monthly results obtained for the
variability of D as explained in § 39. The years were grouped after the fashion
explained in § 52.

The results are given in Table XLV. for the whole year, and for the three seasons.
Owing to the extreme smallness of the observational quantities, it would require a
very long series of years to eliminate accidental sources of error. Thus the seasonal
results, more particularly for the non-cyclic effect, are probably affected by consider-
able uncertainties, especially as regards the values of b/a. In fact, my object in
recording the seasonal values was largely to enable the reader to judge for himself
what attitude he should adopt towards the mean results for the year.
