individual molecules constituting it, because of their strong mutual influence. Hence,
even under favourable conditions, the optical data can give only qualitative indica-
tions. Asan example of the uncertainty attendant on the use of the optical data for
this purpose, we shall mention /-dichloro- and p-dibromobenzenes, recently
analysed by Henpricks (loc. cit.). The unit cells of these crystals have practically
the same dimensions, and the available X-ray data give the positions of only the
halogen atoms in the lattice, which are found to be nearly identical in the two
crystals. They do not, however, enable us to choose uniquely the pair of halogen
atoms which belong to the same molecule. But we can estimate, from considerations
of interatomic distances, the distance between the halogen atoms belonging to the
same molecule, and use that knowledge as a guide for properly pairing the halogen
atoms. It so happens that there are two alternative ways of so pairing, both of
which give the Cl-Cl or Br-Br distance looked for. Now the experimental fact that
the optical extinction directions in the (010) plane are very different for the two
crystals is used as the basis for choosing the pairs in one way for p-dichlorobenzene
and in the other way for p-dibromobenzene. The result is, the molecular planes
in the two crystals are assigned different orientations. On the other hand, as we
mentioned in an earlier section, we have definite reasons to believe that the orienta-
tions in the two crystals should be very similar. This discrepancy arises from the
large mutual influence between the strongly refractive halogen atoms, which has
been ignored, and which further is not easily taken into account. On the other hand
in the magnetic case, the mutual influence of the neighbouring molecules is negligible,
and this is responsible in a large measure for the success of the magnetic method.
