characterized by the addition of new structures or modules.
The idea that the brain proceeds by superimposing a ‘mam-
malian’ cerebral cortex over a neopallium and ‘reptilian’
midbrain [38] has long ago been rejected by studies of com-
parative neuroanatomy [39,40]. Evolution cannot simply
invent a new structure, complete with a full developmental
schedule, and connect it up to an existing system. Instead,
brain evolution involves the elaboration and specialization
of existing structures and elongation of ancestral circuits
whose neuroanatomical topology is remarkably conserved
[41]. For example, circuits interconnecting the striatum, palli-
dum and cerebral cortex/neopallium are effectively the same
in both mammals and birds [42], despite the fact that their
respective lineages diverged about 310 Ma [43]. Indeed,
such major features of the human telencephalon are shared
with teleost fishes, which diverged from the lineage leading
to humans about 450 Ma.

Because the neuroanatomical organization of these circuits
was laid down so long ago, we obviously should not attempt
to explain their functional roles from a perspective that focuses
exclusively on human cognitive behaviour. Instead, we should
first consider the kinds of behavioural challenges that were
faced by our distant ancestors. This even pertains to the cer-
ebral cortex, which is by no means a mammalian invention
