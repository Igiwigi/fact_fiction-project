LIVING IN THE BLOOD OF CERTAIN FRESHWATER FISHES. 31

and trypanoplasms in their blood. Upon hunting carefully among the broad-leafed
rushes, I found that leeches of almost every British species were to be obtained in
good numbers. The following is a list of those collected :—

(1) Helobdella stagnalis. (5) Herpobdella octoculata.
(2) Glossosiphonia heteroclita, (6) Hamopis sanguisuga.
(8) Glossosiphonia complanata. (7) Protoclepsis tessellata.
(4) Herpobdella atomaria. (8) Hemiclepsis marginata.

A few remarks upon the habits of these leeches are necessary to make clear the
conditions .obtaining in the reservoir. The facts recorded are derived partly from
personal observation and partly from Mr. W. A. Harprne’s excellent account of
British leeches (5).

(1) Helobdella stagnalis is a very common form in the reservoir and also in the
neighbouring ponds. It broods its eggs and feeds upon the juices of Gasteropods, and
also upon the larvee of Chironomus. I have observed that it attacks the embryos of
quite young leeches, still showing yolk, of the genus Hemiclepsis, in cases where
these have been detached from their parents. Flagellates were never found in
Helobdella, but a ciliate parasite belonging to the genus Anoplophrya, and closely
allied to the species A. paranaidis, Preranront (16), parasitic in the alimentary
tract of a Paranais from the Gulf of Naples, was found pretty frequently in these
leeches, both in specimens from Elstree and also from Histon, in Cambridgeshire.
