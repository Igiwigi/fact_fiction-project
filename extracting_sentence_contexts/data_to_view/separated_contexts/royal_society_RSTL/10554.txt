The telephone being
pub into circuit with a battery and rheotome in a distant room, each motion of the
diaphragm inwards naturally produced compression of the air in the chamber behind. A 8mall flame being placed in front of the orifice, ib was found that nob only
musical vibrations, but alsv the more complex vibrations of speech, impressed upon
the diaphragm, could be quite loudly reproduced. In fact, when the telephone was
pub in eireuib with another telephone, or better with a battery and microphone in the

distant room, speech loud enough to be heard over a small apartment could be readily
produced. The words, however, were certainly lacking in distinctness. A mos natural assumption was, that the sonnds heard regulted from the impact of
a series of pufls of air against the flame.
