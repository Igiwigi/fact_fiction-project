where Az» means the value at the point P, or 2, %,. . Dn3 A2p,, that at the point on
the boundary which has the same values for all the coordinates except a,, which has
the value a, given by $(a; a... a,)= 0, where 6=0 is the equation of the
boundary ; and similarly for the other coordinates, As L, — %,', Ly — We’, &e., are
everywhere of the same order, 8, it might appear that d Az/dx,, d Az/dx,, must each
be of the order az/B. This, however, is only the case when d Az/da,, d Az/dx,, &e.,
do not rapidly change sign. For, while it is clear that d A2z/dx must exceed Az in the
ratio 1/6 at least, it is easily seen that the ratio may be greater if the terms in the


MINIMA SOLUTIONS IN THE CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS. 125

integral change sign rapidly. In fact, if the order of dAz/dx, is unity, and its
fluctuations recur at intervals of order 8", then the terms in the integral
ma dAz

will cancel, provided «, — x,’= mB", m being any integer ; and so the integration up
to any point can only contain terms of the order 6". Moreover, since, if any function
is periodic with respect to any variable, all its fluxions with respect to that variable
are of the same period, it follows that, if one differentiation introduces a coefficient of
athe order B~", two will bring in B~™*, and so on.
S It thus appears that, if we assume Ay, = A, multiplied by a function whose fluc-
‘uation-periods with regard to x, %2, &¢., are p,, Py, &c., the order of
