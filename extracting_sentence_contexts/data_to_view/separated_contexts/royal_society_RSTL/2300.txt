hypothesis of FraxkLiN and AEeixus, many acute inquirers haye contended, on the
anthority of the Earl of STaxnops *, that the recession of electrified bodies is depen-
dent on atmospheric attraction, and that snch recession would not occur in a void ;
whilst others, in accommodating electrical divergence to the hypothesis of the French
philosophers, endeavour to show, that although greatly dependent on the presence of
an atmospheric medium, it still arises out, of a repulsive force existing in the elements
of the electrical principle itself-. It was upon the above statements that I adopted, by
way of precaution, the method of using the gold-leaf electrometer in experiment (F.),
fig. 12. My subsequent researches, however, with electrified bodies in receiyers, more
or less exhausted of the contained air, led me to investigate this point very rigorously;
and I am inclined to think that the following fact, taken in connexion with the pre-
ceding (44. 74. 75.), will go far to show, that any explanation of the phenomenon
of electrical divergence involving the necessity of an atmospheric action, upon any
principle of mechanism whatever, is likely to be quite fallacious.

(z.) Two gold-leaves were suspended in free space from a stout brass wire supported
horizontally on a long insulating stem of glass: these being electrified 80 as to diverge
freely, were covered by a capacious receiver, made extremely dry, and somewhat warm
within ; the insulating glass stem also being varnished, was warmed with a stick of
burning charcoal. The leaves did not, under these circumstances, cease to diverge
when the receiver was exhausted of its air to the greatest extent which could be
effected by a moderately good air-pump of the common kind. Dr.
