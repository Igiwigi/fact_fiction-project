However, it has
recently been shown that the existence of interacting sub-
networks (or modules) and the way they interact strongly
determine the distribution of centrality within the whole net-
work [129]. This ultimately means that the reorganization
within a sub-network affects the importance of nodes belong-
ing to other sub-networks. Similarly, recent results show that
the way network modules are interconnected also determines
the ability of the whole network to synchronize [134], a fact
that influences the analysis of functional networks. Clearly, this reformulation has to be translated to brain
functional networks, where it is crucial to understand how
