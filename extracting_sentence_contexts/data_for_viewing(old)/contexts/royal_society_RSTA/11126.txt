is true for three out of the four individual cases; in the fourth case the difference
is of the order of the probable error of the difference. The mean correlations ot
nephews and nieces are as ‘2923 and ‘2377 respectively.

(iii.) Paternal uncles and aunts are more closely correlated with their nieces and
nephews than maternal uncles and aunts. The mean values are as ‘2719 to “2580.

(iv.) Resemblance between individuals of the same sex is closer than between
individuals of opposite sex. The mean values for the avuncular correlation in the
same sex and in the opposite sex are respectively 2751 and ‘2549.

(v.) Uncles are more closely related to nephews than aunts to nieces (mean
correlations as ‘3455 to °2046). In fact, generally, we see a very considerable
preponderance of heredity in the male line so far as these avuncular relations for

and eye-colour, being characters of local races, or even families, and the husband seeking his wife in his
own locality or kin; (ii.) in a possible correlation of homogamy and fertility. See ‘Roy. Soc. Proc.,’
vol. 66, p. 28. Neither seem very satisfactory. Consciously or unconsciously, man and woman appear to
select their own type in eye-colour and stature, until they are apparently more alike than such close blood
relations as first. cousins! Until we know how far this correlation extends to other characters, it would,
perhaps, be idle to draw conclusions as to its bearing on widely current views as to first cousin marriages,
