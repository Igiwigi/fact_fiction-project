through the fibres, which extend over the cornea, and which
are very minute, but opaque ; by these they are decompounded
into fringes, having the red outermost, and the violet inner-
most ; and the fringes formed by each fibre being joined to-
gether, form the bow. How then does the pressure enlarge
and vivify them? The fibres are naturally extended over the
surface of a spherical segment; when this surface is compressed
into a plane circle, they are condensed into a much less space,
and consequently brought nearer to one another, the rays are
therefore more inflected and separated than before. If this
explanation be true, it will follow, that the like bows may be
produced by small hairs, like fibres, placed near one another ;
and this I found perfectly consistent with fact ; the bows are
in this case brighter than in the other : and the small hairs on
a hat, or the hand, made them brighter than any other I have
tried : a circumstance which I observed in both cases, seems
to show clearly the identity of the causes ; the white space,
which reached from the interior bow to the flame, was speckled
or mottled, in a manner which cannot be easily described, but
which any one will perceive upon trying the experiment.
