renormalizability seems to suggest that the cut-off can be removed by renormalization conditions,
it cannot be sent to infinity in the standard model because of its triviality problem in the U(1)
sector. Hence, A is a (place holder for a) physical scale which should be kept track of.

It is instructive to try to reconcile the two contrary ends of the puzzle. For this, we may naively
expand the interaction part of the potential (2.5) in powers of 1? g?/A2 for large A. Then we
may absorb the log A divergence into a renormalization of 4, introducing a renormalization scale
A—k,and end up with

2 1D gg Pg hg?
Urls = Fe hitot in SF +O ( E ). (2.6)

This in fact looks like an unstable interaction potential for large ¢ (in obvious contradiction with
(2.5)). This corollary of the original puzzle is resolved by noting that the instability sets in for
large fields where (i?¢7/ A?) ~ O(1), ie. where the large-A expansion is no longer justified. We
emphasize that our line of argument does not rely on the momentum cut-off regularization, but is
identical for gauge-invariant regulators such as propertime or zeta function regularization. Some
care is required for dimensional regularization which fails to keep track of the explicit cut-off
dependence, because it is a projection (on log divergencies) rather than a regularization scheme.
For details, see [14].


To summarize: in order to get global information about the stability of the Higgs effective
potential in the standard model, it is advisable to (i) keep track of the cut-off A or the RG scale
explicitly, and (ii) study the features of the potential globally. Both aspects can be taken care of
