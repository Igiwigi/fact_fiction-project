In contrast the stiff pipeline drops later and over a longer period of time, leading to a
final depth of 1.28D. Consequently, for the experiments considered herein, the potential changes
to stability as a result of sagging are experienced faster for the flexible pipeline, but the extent
of lowering and the potential for greater long-term stability are larger for the stiffer pipeline
provided it does not become unstable during the lowering process. The reason for the difference in final lowered depth across the three experiments is due
to the fact that the vertical position of the pipeline has an effect on scour locally beneath the
pipeline. This interaction is clear in figure 12 which presents the scour profile around the pipeline
as it moves vertically into the scour hole; as the pipeline drops (but has not yet touched the
bottom of the hole), the scour hole increases in depth and the side slopes become steeper and
more symmetric. This increase in scour hole depth does, however, take a finite time to occur.
