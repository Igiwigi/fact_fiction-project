amongst the best, conductors, such even as the metals. Upon consideration, the cones
produced by Dayy# in fluid metals, as mercury and tin, seemed to be cases in point,
and probably also the elongation of the metallic medium through which a current of
electricity was passing, described by Awrerz+; for it is not difficult to conceive,

that the diminution of convective effect, consequent upon the high conducting power
of the metallic media used in these experiments, might be fully compensated for by
the enormous quantity of electricity passing. In fact, it is impossible not to expect
some effect, whether sensible or not, of the kind in question, when such a current is
passing through a fluid offering a sensible resistance to the passage of the electricity;
and, thereby, giving proof of a certain degree of insulating power (1328.).

1604. I endeavoured to connect the convective currents in air, oil of turpentine, &e.
and those in metals, by intermediate cases, but found this not easy to do. On taking
bodies, for instance, which, like water, acids, solutions, fused salts or chlorides, &c.,
have intermediate conducting powers, the minute quantity of electricity which the
common machine can supply (371. 861.) is exhausted instantly, so that the cause of
the phenomenon is kept either very low in intensity, or the instant of time during
which the effect lasts is 80 small, that one cannot hope to observe the result songht for.
If a voltaic battery be used, these bodies are all electrolytes, and the evolution of gas,
