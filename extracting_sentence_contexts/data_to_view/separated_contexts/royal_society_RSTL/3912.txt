It is sufficient to have onee seen the induced contraction originated by arousing
the inducing contraction by any mechanical stimulus, to no longer have any kind of
Suspicion that the electric current used for exciting the contraction is propagated to
the nerve of the galvanoscopic frog*. How must we understand the induced con-
traction of the second and third order? How are we to explain the fact that the in-
duced contraction is wanting (although the current may be applied as usual upon
the lumbar plexuses of the inducing frog), only because by the section of the nerves in
the thigh the inducing contraction is prevented, or at least greatly weakened ? Why
is the induced contraction wanting when we apply the same current upon the nerves
below the thigh in which there are no inducing contractions? Why, when we act with
a current upon the lumbar plexuses of a frog already weakened $0 as no longer to
haye the contractions except at the beginning of the direct current or the cessation
of the inverse, why in these cases alone is there induced contraction ?
