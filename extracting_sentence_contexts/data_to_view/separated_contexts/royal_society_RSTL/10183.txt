ab this stage to an epibolic gastrula has already been noted, and the idea naturally
Ruggests itself that this regemblance may be due, nob to accident, but to actual
Nreversion of the gastrula form, though the essential features of the development are
entirely different from those of the gastrula. There are a number of facts which
Sindicate the derivation of the delaminate planula from an epibolic gastrula like that of
SPuarxes; and if the planula has had such an origin, it is not improbable tha it might
