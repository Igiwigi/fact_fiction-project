It will be seen that, A, behaves much as B, and Â©, in Curves [V., so far as the rapid
rise in the first few days is concerned. The peak shown about the tenth day, and which
appears in A, and slightly in A, itself, is not found in Curves LV. That it corresponds
to something happening in the eggs seems to follow from the fact that the sitting boxes
from which the eggs for A,, As, A, were taken were, in the main, different; and, in the
case of Ay, that the peak was reproduced in an incubator. This incubator, a 60-egg Hearson, was set with 50 eggs, which were weighed separately
each day. Among the eggs were several infertiles, and these, with others that died
at the start, furnished 15 eggs of the A; type.
