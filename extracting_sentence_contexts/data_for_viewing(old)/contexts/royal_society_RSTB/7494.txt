become apparent between the 24th and 26th days when degenerate nuclei are extruded into the distal
part of the respiratory lumen from ruptured cell envelopes. The healthy epithelium of the more

proximal parts of the lumen persists as bronchiolar epithelium, in which quantitative evidence of
normal cell division is found.

These facts explain the difficulty in interpreting the picture of cell outlines which is seen when
silver nitrate impregnates the cement lines between epithelial cells. In the earlier days of embryonic
life the impregnated cell outlines reveal the regular meshwork characteristic of a complete epithelium.
In the adult lung no such clear and regular picture is seen, and a close study of the intervening stages
discloses that this irregularity of cell outlines starts at the 24th day and progresses with the de-
generative changes in the epithelium and extrusion of nuclei. When the lung starts to breathe such
traces of impregnated epithelium as were present at term finally disappear. In the adult rabbit,
counts of nuclei in the alveolar septa show that there are not enough cells to do more than invest the
capillary plexus and to provide nuclei for a few alveolar phagocytes. Moreover, a method of in-
vestigation whereby the structure of the alveolar septum may be dissociated fails to reveal any trace
of lining epithelium. On histological grounds, therefore, the presence of an alveolar epithelium in
the lung of the adult rabbit seems to be ruled out.
