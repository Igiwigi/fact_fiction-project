We also acknowledge that
there may be viable alternatives to our definition 7.1 that also take into account inconsistent
connectedness in a different way. Finally, we would like to refer the reader to the concluding part of [3] to emphasize that absence
of contextuality in behavioural and social systems does not mean that quantum formalisms are
not applicable to them. The so-called QQ equality, in our opinion the most impressive outcome
of quantum cognition research to date [29,30], provides a clear illustration of how absence of
contextuality can in fact be precisely a prediction derived from quantum theory. Authorsâ€™ contributions. All authors significantly contributed to writing of the paper.
