two considerably in defect.

Lastly, comparing the results without manure, with superphosphate of lime alone,
with the mixed mineral manure including potass, and with the same excluding potass,
it is manifest that the effects, both as to quantity and to botanical and chemical com-
position, are more dependent upon the supply of the potass than of any of the other
constituents,

One more striking point in regard to the botany of this plot is that ib is here, where
there is no nitrogenons manure to induce luxuriance, and where there is relative
deficiency of potass, that, as on plot 4-1, where there was equally no nitrogenous
supply and less potass still, fairy-rings are of very frequent occurrence, whils they
are scarcely observed on any other plot ; and this is 80 notwithstanding the fact

â€” that fungi are among the most highly nitrogenous of plants, and are also very rich in
potass. The principal fangus met with on the rings is the common Champignon,
Marasmius oreades; and the grass of the rings is extremely luxuriant, the species
most favoured being Poa trivialts and Holeus lanatus ; whilst among the Leguminose
Lathyrus pratensis is the most prominent, and among the Miscellanees Rumer Acetosa
and Conopodium denudatum are particularly luxuriant. On the comparatively
exhausted space within the rings every description of herbage is much less luxuriant,
and the finer-leaved grasses again become more predominant. Further particulars on
