EH. esculentus and FE. acutus might be two separate species which varied towards
one another.

3. The intermediate forms might be natural hybrids between the two species. Now, considering the ease with which the sperm of the one form will fertilize the
eggs of the other in the laboratory, and the fact that the two forms are found in the
same habitat, in the neighbourhood of Plymouth, and that their breeding periods
overlap considerably, there is no reason why hybridization should not occur. Rather
it is surprising that hybrids should not be found, as the cross-fertilization is so easy
to bring about in the laboratory, and the hybrids are quite as healthy as the pure-
bred forms. This does not apply, however, to the possibility of natural hybridization
between . miliaris and the other species, since the principal habitat of the former is
different.
