We name these Mébius triangles because it was Mobius (1849, pp. 360, 661; see also Coxeter
1948, p. 66) who observed that the planes of symmetry of {/,¢} decompose the sphere into
such a network of triangles (2 p q). Since the network contains four triangles for each edge
of {p, q}, the total number of triangles (i.e. the order of the group) is
& =4N, = 8pq/{4—(p—2) (q—2)}.

Another way to find this number is to divide 47 by the area of (2 / q).

The whole network is derived from any one of the triangles (the fundamental region)
by the various operations of the group. Mobius illustrated this fact by means of his poly-
hedral kaleidoscope, consisting of three mirrors forming a trihedron whose dihedral angles

are 1/2, 7/p, 7/q. It is most convenient in practice to use mirrors cut into the shape of circular
sectors of appropriate angles ¢, y, y (Coxeter 1948, pp. 24, 293). A small object, repre-
senting a point, placed within the trihedron, yields g ‘images’ (strictly, the object itself
and g—1 images). When the object is placed on one of the mirrors, the images coincide
in pairs, leaving only }g points. The number is further reduced when the object is on an
edge where two mirrors meet. In fact, as we shall soon see, the images are then the vertices of
