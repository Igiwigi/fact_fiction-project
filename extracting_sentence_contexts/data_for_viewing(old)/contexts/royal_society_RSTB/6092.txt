shown by Cocutt (1929) that the outgrowth of the ventral roots is conditioned by
the existence of regions possessing a high rate of physiological activity at the centre
of the somites, towards which the nerves grow, and it would therefore seem rather
more probable that the development of the ramus recurrens is conditioned by the
presence of the transient second metotic somite, and that its anterior and posterior
anastomoses are a secondary result of the disappearance of that somite with the
consequent absence of an end-organ to control the further outgrowth of the nerve.
The first metotic somite, no doubt, disappears too early to have an effect of this
nature, although Jagur (1924) believes that he has observed in a four-day chick embryo
a few muscle-fibres derived from this first somite, a condition which he admits is
exceptional.

The other fact which requires emphasis here is the existence (mentioned above)
of a cell-strand connecting the anterior head cavity of the duck with the lateral lobes
of the hypophysis (Goopricu, 1917). There is excellent justification for regarding
this connexion as a “ proboscis-pore,” which means that the anterior head-cavity
can be traced back through the head-cavities of Amphioxus and the proboscis coelom
of Balanoglossus probably to the anterior coelom of Echinoderms; the importance of
this point as evidence for the somitic nature and against the “ expansion” interpre-
tation of the head-cavity is obvious.

The peculiar origin of the first pair of somites and their transverse commissure from
the prechordal mesoderm in a manner differing from that of all succeeding somites
has often played an important part in the criticisms of those who are unable to accept
the somitic interpretation.
