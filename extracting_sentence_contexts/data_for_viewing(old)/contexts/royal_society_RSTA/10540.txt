A glance at this table reveals the fact that, whether the specific heats vary or not,
but on the assumption that combustion is complete in each case, the explosion ot
cyanogen to carbonic oxide (which according to all observers gives the brightest flash

© and the highest pressure) gives apparently the coolest combustion products a short
© time after the explosion-wave has gone by. Now I have found* that the velocity or
€ the reflexion-wave is nearly equal to that of a true sound-wave of small displacement
© travelling through the flame produced by the explosion of cyanogen burning to
carbonic oxide; it is not therefore open to us to reject the temperature calculated for
_ this mixture as entirely wide of the truth. The natural inference to be drawn from
the figures is, I think, that the combustion is not complete in the other mixtures (in
3 all of which steam or carbonic acid, or both, are produced) at the moment the reflexion-
wave is measured. If we suppose that the formation of carbonic acid and steam is
