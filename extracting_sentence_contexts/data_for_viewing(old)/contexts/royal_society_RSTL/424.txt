after the brain is wholly removed, and its powers seem not
at all immediately impaired by the removal of the brain; yet
we constantly see injuries of the brain impairing the functions
of the spinal marrow. We may wholly remove the brain,
and the animal performs the various motions of its limbs as
well as before its removal. Yet an injury of the brain often
produces complete hamiplegia, nay often instantly destroys
every function of the system. Of this apparent inconsisteney,
M. Le GarLLots justly remarks, that two facts well ascertained,
however inconsistent they may seem, do not overturn each
other, but only prove the imperfection of our knowledge.
Whichever of the disputed opinions respecting the func-
tions of the neryous system we adopt, the foregoing pheno-
mena seem to imply a contradiction ; for an explanation of
them, therefore, we must recur to principles different from
those hitherto assumed. The following experiments point
out till another-instance of this apparent contradiction, and
seem to suggest the principle on which the whole depends.

of a frog, strong and repeated contractions were excited in
the muscles of the hind limbs, as long as the stimuli would
