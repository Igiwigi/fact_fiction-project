The survey asked households about the incidence of disease during the previous two weeks prior to survey adminis-
tration. Survey results revealed an average of 2.2 disease incidents during this period, which ranged between zero and
six. Based on the last three disease incidents at a household level, we found that the average direct costs spent on treatment
were 306 KSH, but could be as high as 5300 KSH, with medicine usually constituting the bulk of these costs (table 3). The


poverty-promoting aspect of disease is demonstrated by the fact that a family member could lose up to 10 days of work, or up
to 7 days of school.
