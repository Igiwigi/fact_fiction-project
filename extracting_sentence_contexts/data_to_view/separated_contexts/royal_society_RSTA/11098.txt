made with other chlorides and with other copper salts, this value for p’ can not be
far wrong. Experimental Details. The following facts, in addition to those already stated, may be recorded concerning
the series of experiments, the results of which are tabulated in this paper. Gelatine.—The small conductivity of this has been already referred to. As
additional evidence that its impurities are unimportant, it may be mentioned that
ractically no difference is observed in the value of w/v got for the same concentration

@f the same salt, whether the jelly contain, as usual, 12 per cent. of gelatine or only

galt that amount.

= Salts.—The salts used were all re-crystallized, and were what is generally called
Bure ; but no ver 'y special purification was attempted, as the present object was rather

Ro test the method in a preliminary manner than to get the most accurate quantitative

“Tesults attainable.

2 Jellies.—These were made as follows.
