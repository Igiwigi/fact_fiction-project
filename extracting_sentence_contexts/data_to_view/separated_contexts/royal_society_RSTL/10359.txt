As a further test observations were made of the external effect of the helix
= upon a suspended magnet, when a powerful current was passed in one direction
S through the first wire, and in the opposite direction through the second. If the
© positions of the two wires could be treated as identical, the external effect ought
Z everywhere to vanish. In consequence, however, of the fact that one wire lies
® throughout on the same side of the other, the compensation could not be expected to
Z be complete, except, when the suspended magnet is equidistant from the two ends.
= Experiment with the magnet of a reflecting galvanometer showed that the effect, in
Skact, varied as the magnet was displaced, but even in the symmetrical position there
Z was a perceptible outstanding differential effect. In order to eliminate the influence
Z of other parts of the circuit, the readings referred only to the deflection of the needle
Sas the current was reversed in the heliz; and the scale of sensitiveness was obtained
S by repeating the observations after altering the connexions of the two wires, s0 thab
| the current circulated the same way round both, and after insertion of a high resis-
= tance by which the intensity of the current was reduced in a known proportion.
& From this it appeared that the differential effect of the two wires (with a given
B gurrent) was 525g of the combined effect. $ :
S This fraction is tolerably small, but I had expected to find it smaller still. It seems
£ probable that the incompleteness of compensation is due to a small difference (o059)
5 in the mean diameter of the windings in the two cases.
