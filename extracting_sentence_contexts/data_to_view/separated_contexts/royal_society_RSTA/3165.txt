This is based on very tight constraints on deviations [16], but there
is nothing logically wrong in lifting it. The amount of new structures that are possible in a
comprehensive effective field theory expansion about the SM (and General Relativity) seems
formidable, and many have been constrained [17]. The fact that none of them seems necessary
to describe our observations of Nature makes us believe that there is something fundamental
about Lorentz invariance. Lorentz invariance is also at the basis of General Relativity. However,
this great degree of symmetry is a big obstacle to build a perturbative quantum field theory of
gravity in four dimensions.
