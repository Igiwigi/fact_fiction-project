Slaxy years have elapsed since Mr. VauGnax Tromson made the important discovery
'Jat the Zoca of naturalists was but, the immature form of an adult Decapod.
8 His fortunate: observation was received with the greatest caution by zoologists in
Zneral, and several undertook researches upon the subject to demonstrate the error
ato which they assumed he had fallen. The researches of RaTHKe upon the ASfacus

ae statements of Mr. 'TH0MsON, and admitted that, * relying on the history of the deve-
'Zpment of the Crayfish, and trusting too much to analogies in the structure of tull-
Srown Decapods,” he had done Mr. 'Tnowso0N injustice in not putting faith in his dis-
Byery.
