By increasing the resolution of the simulation domain, e.g. considering L = 512, these errors are
further reduced but are still observable. The remaining dissipation error can be explained, in part,
because v # 0. Interestingly, the fact that LBMs introduce more dispersion than dissipation errors,
as shown by Mari√© et al. [67], is further confirmed here by the non-circular shape of the vortex for
the finest resolution. In the end, taking one step back and looking at the big picture, it seems clear that these collision
models (SRT-RR, REG-CHM and REG-K) not only lead to stable simulations for non-negligible
Mach numbers and low-viscosity values but they also allow the resulting LBMs to accurately
transport information over long distances, even if one must keep in mind dispersion issues. Of
course, more numerical validations are required to extensively quantify the accuracy of these
models, for the simulation of finite Mach number flows in the low-viscosity regime.
