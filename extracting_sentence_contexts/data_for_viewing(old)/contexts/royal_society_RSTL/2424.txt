819. Then protochloride of tin was subjected to the electric current in the same
manner, using, of course, a tin positive electrode. No bichloride of tin was now
formed (779. 790.). On examining the two electrodes, the positive had lost precisely
as much as the negative had gained ; and by comparison with the volta-electrometer,
the number for tin came out 59.

820. It is quite necessary in these and similar experiments to examine the interior
of the bulbs of alloy at the ends of the conducting wires ; for occasionally, and espe-
cially with those which have been poxsitive, they are cayernous, and contain portions
of the chloride or iodide used, which must be removed before the final weight is ascer-
tained. This is more usually the case with lead than tin.

821. All these facts combine into, I think, an irresistible mass of evidence, proving
the truth of the important proposition which I at first laid down, namely, that the
chemical power of a current of electricity is in direct proportion to the absolute quantity
of electricity which passes (377. 783.). They prove, too, that this is not merely true
with one substance, as water, but generally with all electrolytic bodies; and, further,
that the results obtained with any one swbstance do not merely agree amongst them-
selves, but also with those obtained from other subsfances, the whole combining toge-
ther into one series of definite electro-chemical actions (505.). I do not mean to say that
no exceptions will appear: perhaps some may arise, especially amongst substances
existing only by weak affinity ; but I do not expect that any will seriously disturb
the result announced. If, in the well considered, well examined, and, I may surely
Say, well ascertained doctrines of the definite nature of ordinary chemical affinity,
such exceptions occur, as they do in abundance, yet, without being allowed to disturb
