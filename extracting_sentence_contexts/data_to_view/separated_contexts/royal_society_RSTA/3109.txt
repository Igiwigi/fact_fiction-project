On the other hand, the topics addressed by Wiechert would start attracting Hilbert’s
attention over the next years, at least since 1905. This sixth problem is not really a problem in the strict sense of the word, but rather a general
task for whose complete fulfillment Hilbert set no clear criteria. Thus, Hilbert’s detailed account in
the opening remarks of his talk as to what a meaningful problem in mathematics is, and his stress
on the fact that a solution to a problem should be attained in a finite number of steps, does not
apply in any sense to the sixth one. On the contrary, the sixth problem has important connections
with three other problems on Hilbert’s list: the nineteenth (Are all the solutions of the Lagrangian
equations that arise in the context of certain typical variational problems necessarily analytic?),
the twentieth (dealing with the existence of solutions to partial differential equations with given
boundary conditions), closely related to the nineteenth and at the same time to Hilbert’s long-
standing interest on the Dirichlet Principle, and, finally, the twenty-third (an appeal to extend
and refine the existing methods of variational calculus). Like the sixth problem, the latter two
are general tasks rather than specific mathematical problems with a clearly identifiable, possible
solution.
