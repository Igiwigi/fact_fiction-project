THE IGUANODON AND HYLAOSAURUS. 277

collection which unquestionably belong to the pelvic region of some great Saurian,
most probably of the Iguanodon, but at present all the elements of this part of the
skeleton have not been found in a state sufficiently recognizable to admit of their
positive identification.

Caudal vertebre.â€”The characters of the anterior caudals are s0 well known that it
is unnecessary to describe them ; but on the somewhat angular caudals, originally
referred by me to the Iguanodon, and snbsequently ascribed to the Cetiosaurus by
Professor Owex, and now restored to the former reptile by Dr. MgLvii, I will offer a
few remarks. In the first place, in confirmation of the opinion that these vertebre
belong to the Iguanodon, I would especially call attention to the fact, that with the
nnquestionable Iguanodon sacrals found at Loxwood, and examined by Baron Cuvig
(as previously mentioned, ante, p. 275), were several caudals belonging to the same
individual, and these possess the angular forin, and more or less grooved base, as may
be seen by reference to the Geological Transactions, vol. ii. New Series, pl. 15. figs.
1,3. TI can vouch for the accuracy of the figures from having carefully examined
the specimens at the time they were being drawn by that able artist, Mr. Scnare.

I would next call attention to the spine of the Hyleosaurus, which exhibits in the
s8everal modifications of its vertebre, as great a discrepancy in the elements of the
dorsal and caudal regions, as our proposed restoration of the spinal column of the
Iguanodon. In the highly instractive specimen from the Weald of Sussex, represented
on a $mall scale (one-sixth linear) in Plate XXXII. fig. 22, a nearly uninterrupted
