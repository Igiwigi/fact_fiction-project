Sir Joun Murray records that among his specimens
not a single one contained ordinary protoplasm such as is found in the shells of other
Foraminifera.'!_ He refers, of course, to the large terminal chamber as a whole, the
dual nature of which did not impress itself upon him, although the figure which he
gives (which had already appeared in Brapy’s monograph*) clearly suggests it
(fig. 45), the rotaline initial portion of the shell being always filled with a deeply
coloured protoplasm. But Sir Jonn Murray also records a very remarkable fact,
that in all his specimens the shells, .e. the terminal chamber, were “filled with
immense broods of minute zodspores, and that these latter spread over the field of
the microscope in a cloud-like swarm when a shell was broken under the cover-glass. *
Before speculating upon the significance of this phenomenon, it may be observed that
the disposition of the float-chamber presents a marked difference in the species
C. milletti.
