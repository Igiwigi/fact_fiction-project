T&S T only S only

Figure 17. The number of ocean profiles available in the EN4 dataset [45] as a function of year. Note they are split into
those profiles that were just temperature data (green), just salinity (blueâ€”practically zero) and then those that were both
temperature and salinity are stacked on top (red). As for the deployment of the Argo array, the number of joint T and S profiles
has begun to exceed those of temperature alone. Kindly provided by Simon Good, Crown Copyright. (Online version in colour.)

(b) Initialized predictions

Idealized model experiments are useful tools for understanding mechanisms of variability,
assessing potential predictability and suggesting which are the key ocean observations. However,
such studies are always limited by the fidelity of the climate model(s) being used and also by the
fact that the real world has both internal and external forcings (e.g. volcanoes or anthropogenic
industrial emissions).

Real-world decadal predictions have emerged in the last few years, with one of the first being
the Met Office Decadal Prediction System (DePreSys) [44]. Such predictions use a climate model
that has been initialized from a best estimate of the state of the ocean and atmosphere and then run
forwards in time with projected changes in the anthropogenic emissions (e.g. greenhouse gases
(GHGs) and aerosols) included. Given that the prediction time scale of interest is generally 2-20
years, hindcasts need to be made over half a century or more in order to assess their skill (typically
1960-present). This places very tough demands on the historical ocean observing systems.

As discussed above, the Argo observations of T & S down to 2000m are thought to be well
suited for use in initialized predictions and hence it is essential that the Argo array (or equivalent)
