Clearly we require one more equation. At first sight it might seem that a fourth
equation would come readily, from the fact that the mid-ordinate m of the frequency-
curve is the sum of the mid-ordinates of the component probability-curves. This leads to

a = 4/(2c) mh/a. But besides the disadvantage of throwing our solution back on the correctness with
which we may have observed measurements of one size only, namely, the mean, the
result of eliminating between (81)-(34) leads to an equation of the eighth order.
