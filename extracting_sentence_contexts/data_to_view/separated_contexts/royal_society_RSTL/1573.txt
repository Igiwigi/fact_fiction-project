OBSERVATIONS. I do not mean to waste the time of the Royal Society, by
applying the. facts. above stated- to confirm, : or . invalidate,
either of the great rival theories ; still less to support any
hypothesis of my own. A moxt instructive lesson has been inculcated by the recent
discoveries of Sir Humeury Davy, in his examination of the
cavities of crystals. In that "ingenious Paper, a fact, which
had for many years been considered as evidence almost con-
clusive in favour of one system, has been converted into an
argument nearly. irresistible, in support of the other.
