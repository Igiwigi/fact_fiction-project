Harder still,
innovative control concepts that are eventually brought to fruition in a laboratory
setting face the additional, often major, obstacle of being translated into practical
systems that operate effectively, efficiently and reliably over a wide range of
conditions. Closing this gap is conditional on an ambitious collaboration—a
meeting of minds—between university-based scientists and engineers in industry,
with each group recognizing and responding creatively to the priorities and
constraints of the other. Most flow-control challenges arise simply from the fact that the stability
characteristics of fluid flows—for example, those governing transition—are very
difficult to influence using energy-efficient, fast-response sensor—actuator systems. Moreover, the highly complex, multi-scale nature of turbulence makes it very
hard to target particular mechanisms with actuation devices that, necessarily,
operate within a narrow range of scales, or even a single scale. An example in
the latter area is the reduction of frictional drag, requiring control over both
the small-scale streaky structure in the viscosity-affected near-wall layer and the
large-scale structures (‘super-streaks’) in the outer, fully turbulent region—and
this needs to be achieved using only a small number of fixed wall-mounted sensors
and actuators.
