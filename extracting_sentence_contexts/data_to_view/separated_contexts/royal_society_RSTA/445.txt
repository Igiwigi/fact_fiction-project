As already pointed out, the values of a; and az differ from those determined by Vittori &
Blondeaux [17] of an amount of O(5). Because the value of the parameter 4 is usually quite small,
we argue that the investigation of O(5) effects on the coefficients a1, a2 and the solution (3.13) of
equation (3.11) is not useful. In fact, the results concerning the region of existence of rolling-grain
ripples and vortex ripples in the parameter space are only marginally affected by the uniform
steady streaming. On the other hand, it is interesting to look at the O(8) correction of the value of
ow predicted by Vittori & Blondeaux [17], because O(5) terms in ow cause qualitative changes
in the bottom profile. In fact, 7 is no longer symmetric with respect to the crests and the troughs,
because co) has an imaginary part of O(5).
