demonstrate also that two or more epidemics with different periodicities may run
concurrently. Any but a biological explanation of these phenomena seems to me
untenable, and the facts further seem to prove that the periodicity is infinitely more
probably due to such changes as may easily constitute the life-cycle of an infecting
organism rather than to periodic changes in the susceptibility of the host. To explain
the phenomenon by the number of susceptible persons present in the population at
any one time seems hardly possible. The influence of the climatic variation of the solar year has had more darkness than
light thrown upon it by the present investigation.
