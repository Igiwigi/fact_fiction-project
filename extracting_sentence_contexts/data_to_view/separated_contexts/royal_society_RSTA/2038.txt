Theories, based on these concepts, lead to different dependencies of the macroscopic stress
on the global rate of the composite deformation and can provide realistic prediction of
the material behaviour. However, the chain model is rather a very simplified approach
suitable for very diluted systems. In fact, the morphology of particle structures depends
on various physical parameters and may differ significantly from simple chains. Optical
microstructural observations have shown that particles in magnetorheological suspensions
build thick columnar aggregates and more complicated structures oriented in the direction of
the applied field [2]. Moreover, recently it was experimentally shown, using a microchannel
filled with a low concentrated magnetic fluid, that geometrical parameters of the particle
structures depend not only on the strength but on the duration of the applied magnetic field
as well [7].
