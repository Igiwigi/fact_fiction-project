Panel (b) is a histogram of the action changes for t = 8 iterations along the ia
manifold. The solid line is a Gaussian function, whose width is given by the classical action diffusion constant, equation (2.12). : =

If this overlap integral were amenable to a saddle point analysis, then the reversibility
properties of the quantum and classical fidelity would have to be identical, because one could
follow the orbits forward and backward in time using the saddle point approximation the
entire way. In fact, the information about this issue is exactly contained in the criteria on y
just mentioned. For example, if € is fixed, in the limit of h — 0, there comes a point where the
typical or majority values of the {55;} become greater than the value of fi. The crossover occurs
just where the relation above switches to y* <d/hxsty.
