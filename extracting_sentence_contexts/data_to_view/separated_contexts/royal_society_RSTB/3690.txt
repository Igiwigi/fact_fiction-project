The angular possesses, as Broom has described, a complicated form. Its exact
relations to the other bones are difficult to determine without the help of sections. These reveal the fact that the surangular is a bifurcate bone, one limb, the lower,
being applied to the upper surface of a ventral and anterior process of the articular,
and the prominence thus formed is clasped by the bifureate posterior end of the
angular. The angular extends upwards, reaching the ventral surface of the surangular
for a considerable distance in front of this interlock. Turning now to the dorsal surface of the ramus, the surangular is seen to have
considerable thickness and to meet the articular in a suture which is directly
transverse for some distance on the outer side and then runs obliquely inwards and
forwards against a short dorsal anterior process of the articular.
