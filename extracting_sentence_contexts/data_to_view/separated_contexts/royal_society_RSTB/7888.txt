It is not possible to age the embryo accurately, but it is likely to
be more than | month, and is probably 2 months, post-coitum. The ovaries of the mother,
like those of most of the pregnant animals examined, contained the remains of several
corpora lutea in advanced stages of regression, but there is no evidence that the corpus
luteum of conception had regressed to this degree. Some, and as far as can be seen all, of
these very old corpora lutea can be accounted for by the fact that conception is preceded
by the formation of a number of corpora lutea whose remains may be expected to persist
in the ovaries for a long time. There is therefore no one corpus luteum in any one of the
ovaries which can be identified as that of conception by its being older than those which
were active at the time of death. The ovaries of E25, the earliest pregnancy, contained five
corpora lutea which appeared, macroscopically and histologically, to be fully active.
