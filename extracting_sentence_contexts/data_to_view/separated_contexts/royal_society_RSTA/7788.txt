The idea that the apparent sorption of acetone, as determined in this way, was the
effect of the attachment of water and acetone separately, say, the acetone on the nitro-
groups and the water on the hydroxyl groups, was considered at one time. Two
smooth curves of similar shape could be postulated, which when combined would give
an apparent acetone solvation rising to a maximum at the compatibility point, and
then falling to zero at 100Â°% acetone. That this is not a true explanation is shown
by the fact that the apparent sorption calculated from two continuous separate sorption
curves would always be continuous. Any theory of the sorption curve must therefore
explain the discontinuity. The solution of nitrocotton is apparently a continuous
process, but there is some change in the mechanism of solvation which begins when
the nitrocotton goes into solution.
