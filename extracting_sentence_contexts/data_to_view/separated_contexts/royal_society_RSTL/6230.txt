EZ The ammonio-tartrate of iron, ammonio-citrate of iron, and similar pharmaceutical
Spreparations are chiefly colloidal matters. S Suerate of Copper â€”The deep blue liquid obtained by adding potash to a mixed 80lu-
ER of chloride of copper and sugar appears to contain a colloidal substance. Placed
n a dialyser for four days, the blue liquid became green, and no longer contained either
otassium or chlorine; it in fact consisted of oxide of copper united with twice its
weight of s&ugar. The external liquid remained colourless, and gave no indication of
copper when tested with sulphuretted hydrogen. The colloidal solution of sucrate of
copper was sensitive in the extreme to pectizing agents.
