GENUS TINOPORUS :—AFFINITIES. 561

numerous large pseudopodian foramina*, This relationship is admitted by Messrs.
PARKER and RvuegRt Jones; who state, however, that Planorbuling are differentiated
by having © two or three tubular and margined apertures to each chamber, coarser
pseudopodial pores, and no umbilical cells.” Now I have shown that every chamber in
the adult is connected with its adjacent chambers of the same or of alternate planes by
two apertures; s0 that at the free growing margin of the young disk there would pro-
bably be at leas: two such pairs of apertures in the wall of every chamber. 'The
difference in the size and number of psendopodian pores is a very trivial character.
And the superposed umbilical cells will probably be absent in the young Tinopors,
when as yet only a small number of rows of chambers have been formed around the
< central cell. I have, in fact, specimens in my possession which would be unhesitatingly
Scharacterized as Planorbuline by such as are unacquainted with the structure of the
Ztype we are considering ; yet which I cannot help regarding as in all probability young
Sforms of Tinoporus, having been found in the same dredging, and presenting just the
characters which I should expect from analysis of the structure of the adult to find in
Whom. Moreover, I have Planorbuline whose early growth is 80 distinctly spiral as to
Seorrespond in every essential particular with the young of Rotalia.
= 218. It is not a little remarkable, however, that this organism should also be very
Sdlosely related to a body of which the true nature has hitherto been doubtful, viz. the
SIillepora rubra of LAMARCKF, the Polytrema miniacea of BLAINVILLEþ. This grows
Z3parasitically upon shells, sometimes spreading over their surface in a laminated form,
Zzometimes rising into a sort of stem and sending off branches. I have ascertained by
Zexamination of thin sections, that it is composed of minute chambers piled together yery
