Part II. embodies the experiments on the vapour pressures of solutions
of cane sugar and a-methyl glucoside at 0° C. and 30° C., also some determinations of
the vapour pressures of dilute sulphuric acid. All the experiments, except a few
dating later than January 22, 1916, were done in conjunction with Mr. Harriry. As both these gentlemen have left the laboratory and are not within reach, the
other author should be held responsible for all mistakes in presentation of fact or
theory. PART, ier
Tue Compressisiiities, (BERKELEY and Burton.) In a previous communication we have given the results of our measurements on the
