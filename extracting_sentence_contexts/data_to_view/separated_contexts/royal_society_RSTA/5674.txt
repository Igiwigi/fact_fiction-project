Such a restriction for blood flow is directly related to mechanical
compression of the distal parts of the coronary arteries located in the thickness of the heart wall

and is directly related to the contractile function of the myocardium. Figure 9b also shows a retrograde blood flow in all arterial branches after stenting at the
very beginning of the left ventricular systole. This fact coincides in time with the isovolumic
contraction phase of the left ventricle, when the heart chamber volume does not change (all
valves are closed). At the same time, an increase in mechanical stress in the myocardium and
the associated increase in intramyocardial pressure in the heart wall create excessive pressure in
blood vessels. This phenomenon is commonly known as the ‘intravascular or intramyocardial
pump’, which is first discussed by Spaan [47] and discussed in detail in a review paper [48].
