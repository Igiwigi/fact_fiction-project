process, in one form or another, is of widespread occurrence among the Protozoa, and
appears to be, in fact, practically speaking, a necessity. This is, indeed, at the present
day, almost a truism, but it is one which is badly in need of re-statement. In my
opinion, the most important deduction to be drawn from these Ciliate experiments is
not that under certain special circumstances they can exist without syngamy, but
that it is the ordinary conditions of the natural environment which are primarily
responsible for and necessitate the occurrence of syngamy in the Protozoa.

In this connection, the case of the non-conjugating strain of Helkesimastiv is of
very immediate interest. I have now cultivated this form for nearly 18 months, or
for between 2500 and 3000 generations, without any conjugation or cyst-formation
