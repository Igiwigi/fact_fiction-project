Using ab initio calculations based on
density functional theory, Domain et al. have studied the interaction of hydrogen with stacking
faults in the Zr-H solid solution. Hydrogen seems to reduce stacking fault energies, which favours
the spreading of the dislocation core in the prismatic plane and consequently hinders cross-slip
[46]. In fact, there are no experimental results to confirm these observations and the interactions
