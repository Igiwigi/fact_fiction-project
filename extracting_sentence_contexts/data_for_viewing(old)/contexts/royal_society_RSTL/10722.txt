In Raja (fig. 12) the cerebellum has the same fundamental arrangement as in
Scyllium, the four layers, the molecular, the PURKISTE cells, the fibrous and the
granular, are all present. Externally there is a deep transverse furrow formed by the
molecular layer; in the lateral walls also there are two involutions of the molecular
layer all followed by that of the PuRKINJE cells. Internally the ventricle is occupied
by the four tori of the granular layer, which nearly fill it, leaving only a comparatively
8mall cruciform fissure between them. The inferior lobe is well developed, and the
fold of the molecular layer therein is larger than in Seyllinm,

The total outcome of the difference is that in Raja the cerebellum is more s0lid and
massive; there is a larger quantity of material. The molecular layer is more extensive,
being folded into several furrows, and the granular layer forms larger tuberosities,
These facts 8eem to show that the greater activity of life, in conjunction with the
lighter and less muscular but more agile body, of the dogtish, does not require the
quantity of nervous substance to start ib that is necessary to move the more massively
museular and heavier carease of the sluggish Ray, 80 that ib would appear that
quantity of muscle requires more nervous activity than quickness of motion.

The case of Rhina seems to contradict this theory, for with a massiveness of body
less, certainly, than that of the Rays, but much greater than that of Scyllium, it is pro-
vided with a brain possessing less nervous tissue than that of Seyllium. How to
reconcile this incongruity is more than I can 8ay. Both in Rhina and Acanthias the
cerebellum resembles that of Seyllium, except thab ib is lighter and thinner, and con-
tains a larger ventricle.
