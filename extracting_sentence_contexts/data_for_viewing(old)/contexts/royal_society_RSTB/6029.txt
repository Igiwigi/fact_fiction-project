specimen was not suspected until they had been partly scraped away during exposure
of the perignathic girdle ; but the series of transverse sections unwittingly produced
could not have been better devised for display of the structures.

For the purpose of this description four specimens were used. One of these (E. 103)
is a complete lantern extracted bodily from its test. A second (EH. 252) shows a more
or less disjointed series of lantern ossicles, mixed up with numerous peristomial plates,
lying in the cavity of the test : MorrEnsEn (1933, p. 433) has already recorded the fact
that this specimen proves the Stirodont nature of the lantern. The third (EH. 251)
affords evidence of the nature of the rotula, and shows the interpyramidal faces of the
maxillee very well. The fourth (EK. 101) has been referred to above.

Description.—The pyramids, fig. 12A, are short and relatively wide; in E. 103 the
full height of the pyramid is 7-3 mm, and its width at the epiphysis is 4-9 mm. The
open foramen is 3-5 mm deep (practically equal to the symphysis) and very widely
splayed distally. The epiphyses appear as small corner-pieces rising into short spines
when seen from the outside—there is very little tendency to convergence across the
foramen, The interpyramidal face, fig. 12C, is very flat and rather coarsely striated ;
