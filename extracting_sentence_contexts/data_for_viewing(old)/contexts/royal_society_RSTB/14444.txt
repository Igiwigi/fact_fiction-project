Counterfactuals are mental simulations of ‘what might have been’—imagined
alternatives to past outcomes that might have occurred if circumstances had been
different [3,4]. Counterfactuals often support causal inferences, particularly when
the counterfactual takes the form of an ‘if-then’ conditional [5]. Psychologically,
counterfactual thoughts are consequential in that they help individuals to learn
from mistakes and to plan for the future [6,7]. Politically, they allow societies to
judge the effectiveness of past actions, assign praise or blame to leaders, and
determine how much to support various policies (e.g. [8]).

Yet counterfactuals also provide fertile ground for partisan reasoning. Counter-
factual events, by definition, did not occur and hence cannot be verified [9]. People
may imagine counterfactual events that fit with their beliefs and motivations,

content and the conclusions of their counterfactual thinking.
