The

whole ring, however, did not behave alike. Opposite the primary phloém, secondary

xylem consisting of trachese with narrow secondary rays was formed, while outside
the primary xylem, parenchyma, constituting the large principal rays, was at first
$ chiefly developed.t
S We thus find the secondary tissues broken up into distinct bundles corresponding
in number and position to the primary groups of phloém and separated from one
@ another by the principal rays, which correspond to the pr otoxylem-strands. In fact,
= the mode of secondary growth is exactly that which is characteristic of a large
5 number of roots among recent Dicotyledons.{ Among Gymnosperms, curiously
3 7 chough, we find a less close analogy, though in some of the finer roots of Cycads, as,
zy for example, in rootlets of Stangeria, the process is essentially similar. 5 Sooner or later the principal rays often become sub-divided by the intercalation of
additional strands of xylem and phloém (see especially photograph 14).
