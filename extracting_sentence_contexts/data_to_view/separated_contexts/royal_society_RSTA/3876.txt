Goethite (a-FeOOH, Raman peaks at 247,
301, 388, 482, 552 and 546cmâ„¢!) is a stable compound forming a protective layer on the spur
core. On the other hand, lepidocrocite (y-FeQOH, Raman peaks at 250, 379, 525 and 650 cm7!)
and akaganeite (FeOg gg3(OH)1.167Clo.167, Raman peaks at 311, 390, 537 and 722 cm!) are reactive
phases that can be considered as degradation accelerators [6,21]. In fact, akaganeite is the most
dangerous one because the presence of chloride ions in its molecular structure increases the
porosity of the corrosion layer, facilitating cracks and swellings [33,34].

(b) Laboratory analysis

(i) Surface analysis

As explained above, laboratory analyses were carried out on M01 and M02 fragments to better
understand the characteristic of the decorative layer and the surface degradation. SEM-EDS maps of sample M01 allowed us to study in depth the nature of the gilded layer. The
elemental image (figure 1c) obtained by use of INCA software showed a degraded silver layer.
