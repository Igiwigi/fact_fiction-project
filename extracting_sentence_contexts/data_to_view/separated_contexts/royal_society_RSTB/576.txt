E. BEEVOR ON THE FIBRES OF THE CINGULUM AND THE

amygdalee, with which it has connections which have not yet been clearly elucidated. Behind the splenium of the corpus callosum the bundle is thinner, and again increases
in thickness as it descends in the hippocampus; this difference in size is due to the fact
that different systems of fibres contribute to its formation. There is no doubt that
there are fibres here which connect the internal surface of the frontal conyolutions with
the cortex of more distant parts, viz., the apex of the temporal lobe. During the
course of this bundle, it forms various intermediate stations of communication, and this
is proved by the fact that the bundle of fibres, when traced from their beginning to
their ending, do not get progressively smaller, but below the corpus callosum they
become larger, as also in the temporal lobe.
