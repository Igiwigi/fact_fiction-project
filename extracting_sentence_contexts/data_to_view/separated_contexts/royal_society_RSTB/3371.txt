Although a parathyroid is derived both from the third
and fourth clefts, yet the one derived from the latter does not become enclosed
by thyroid tissue as is the case in mammals. Apparently as a consequence of this
we do not meet with the transition forms between the two kinds of tissue which
T have described (vide infra), and depicted, in mammals,

Forsytu has largely employed birds to support his main thesis, and although the
results of my own investigation fully support his conclusions in mammals, I am
inclined to suspect that he has been somewhat hasty in placing thyroid tissue with
few and small vesicles in the category of parathyroid. It may seem inconsistent to
use the arguments put forward under another section (vide Mammals, infra) as applied
to mammals, and refuse to admit the same arguments in birds; but it seems, in fact,
that the intimate physiological and anatomical connection obtaining in mammals has
not yet been established in the class aves. *
