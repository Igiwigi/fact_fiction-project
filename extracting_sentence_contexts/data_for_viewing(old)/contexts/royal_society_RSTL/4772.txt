do not present any wavy longitudinal lines (fig. 11). When acetic acid is applied the
fibres enlarge and assume a certain degree of opacity, and in some instances this
lamina also has presented distinct oval nuclei, elongated in the direction of the fibres
(fig. 12). Like the radiate lamina, the separate fibres were never observed to reveal
the existence of nuclei, and as a general rule their presence in the tissue is not de-
tected.

It is often not easy to decide whether a structure is muscular, and doubts may
arise as to the real nature of the two fibrous laminz of the membrana tympani. My
own researches do not seem to favour the view of that membrane being a contractile
tissue.

The facts which seem to militate against the idea of its being muscular are,â€”

Ist. The absence of distinct nuclei in the fibres.

2nd. Their great denseness and hardness, their firm and unyielding structure,
they being s0 strong that it is with some difficulty they can be torn across.

The mucous membrane forming the inner layer of the membrana tympani is in
the healthy ear so extremely thin that its presence is with difficulty detected ; by
careful dissection however it can nevertheless be removed entire from the inner
surface of the circular fibres, to which it is connected with considerable firmness by
fine cellular tissue.
