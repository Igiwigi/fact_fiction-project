with n—1 = 2(s—1), (70)
so that O = (w/v) Be, (71)

Comparing this with (57) shows that in the present approximation,
Kassel’s rate for a molecule with s oscillators is the same in form as the present theory gives for
n = 2s—1 normal modes. (72

The one difference, namely, the factor /,, occurring in the parameter /, (60) of the present
theory, and not in ’ (71), will be estimated below.

The mathematical basis of the contrasted n and s in (72) is to be seen in the formulae (6
and (11) for Zin the two theories, ‘The physical basis is obscure, because of the quite different
approaches to the formulation of L; the contrast may be connected with the fact that the
present criterion for dissociation is accumulation of extension or amplitude, not of energy.

The factor f,

To complete the comparison with Kassel’s theory, and to lighten the calculations of the
next section, the numerical factor /, (61) in / will be estimated.

For the dissociation of a particular gas, the product “4, ... 4, = %...%,%-" inf, can be
calculated from the vibrational structure; but here typical values are sought to represent
an unspecified molecule. The product “,...4, has its maximum value, n-!", when
My = =, =n! this maximum decreases strongly as n increases. For general values
of the 4, it is convenient to introduce a molecular characteristic, 4, between 0 and 1, by
