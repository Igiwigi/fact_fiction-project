In Mammalia the superior intercostals have the opposite action to the inferior, be-
cause the $uperior and inferior ribs have opposite motions. When I exposed the muscles of the living and breathing Ass, I was surprised to
find that while the superior external intercostal muscles were invariably inspiratory,
the inferior were as invariably expiratory, and that while the posterior fibres of the
same muscle were inspiratory, the anterior were expiratory. These were the facts ; |
I could not gainsay them. It was only after much inquiry that they became intelli-
gible, not until I had comprehended the varying movements of the ribs at different
parts; then everything, step by step, became lucid. The sole duty of the muscles is to move the ribs.
