(e) Tsunami warning products

Owing to the earthquake-centric nature of tsunami warning systems, emphasis was placed
on earthquake monitoring and seismic data processing, not on coastal flooding. The warning
centres were staffed with seismologists whose expertise was earthquake data analysis. Even
though about 20% of tsunamis were generated by non-earthquake sources, the initial tsunami
warning systems evolved into earthquake information centres, providing timely information on
earthquakes. The fact that tsunamis are a flooding hazard was largely disregarded.

(a) Japan led the world in developing an ultra-sophisticated seismic network that, by =
1995, could detect and size earthquakes in three minutes. Japan’s system delivered two :§
products—tsunami advisories and tsunami warnings. Tsunami warnings were divided Lo

locations and (ii) major tsunami warning, where waves in excess of 3m were predicted. : =
Keep in mind that these were empirical predictions based on real-time earthquake [oa

translate into flooding in my community? iS
