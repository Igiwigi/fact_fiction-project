According to EMELIANOFrF (1925),
Pelobates fuscus follows the same sort of development of the vertebral centrum of the
trunk vertebra. Gorrre (1875) is the first worker who noticed a difference between
the cellular structure of the cartilaginous semi-ring dorsally to the notochord, and
the cells of the overlying cartilaginous dorsal arcualia. But he failed to detect the
two layers of the sheath of the notochord, and tried to reconcile this fact by saying
that this perichordal tube was the outer layer. As almost all the workers in this
line found these two layers quite distinct, and as the outer layer is not cartilaginous,
nobody took any notice of the statement of Gorrre, and especially as no one has worked
on this particular species since his time. Xenopus levis is a unique and most interesting case.
