—4-8x 107’ sec. during the two expeditions. On each occasion the mean of the values
observed before and after the voyage was used to compute the results, using the value of
g=981-265 cm./sec.? adopted for the Pendulum House, Cambridge, relative to Potsdam
(Bullard & Jolly 1936).
3-2. BAsE-STATION OBSERVATIONS

The base-station observations were carried out under conditions as similar as possible to
those experienced on board the submarine, with the apparatus hanging freely in its gimbals.
“The pendulum period was calculated from the record by the graphical method described
by Meinesz (1929). Each record lasted for 30 min.; observations of the coincidences be-
tween the pendulums and chronometer were made between the beginnings of the 2nd and
2 6th minutes and again between the beginnings of the 26th and 30th minutes. It is estimated
‘© that the error in the measurement of the period of the fictitious pendulum due to inaccuracy
§ of reading of the records was only 1 x 10-7 sec. Corrections were applied as follows:
> (i) Temperature. The temperature of the pendulums was measured by the thermometer
SpMounted in the dummy pendulum. A small correction was applied to allow for the scale
= error found when the thermometer was standardized in Holland. The pendulum periods

ES were then reduced to 0° CG, using the following temperature coefficients:
