the sporogonium of Bryophytes, it has been desirable to see how far this is a faetor
also in the Pteridophytes.* Examination has shown that sterilisation occurs in the
sporangia of many of them; it may affect only individual cells of the sporogenous
tissue, which then serve as transitory nutritive cells; in certain cases, however, it
involves tissue-tracts, or even whole sporangia. Jt 7s thus seen that there is in the
Pteridophyta the essential basis of fact necessary for a theory of sterilisation in them
also. Theory of the Strobilus. The fertile zone of a strobilus may, like the fertile zone of a Moss-sporogonium, be
regarded as a residuum from sterilisation, since it has a similar relation to the vege-
tative system.
