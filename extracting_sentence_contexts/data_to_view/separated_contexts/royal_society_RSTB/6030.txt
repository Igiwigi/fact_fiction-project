Here we cannot agree with him. After having had the opportunity of studying
the development of this region of the skull in all groups of vertebrates we are of
opinion that the Selachii form no exception. However, the question of the trabecular
horns is in a confused state owing to, the fact that PARKER (1878) applied this term
to more than one structure. We have accordingly thought it advisable to make
a short digression from the Holocephalian skull in order to record our observations
on this subject.

ivâ€”The Trabecular Horns

In fig. 16, A is shown a ventral view of the ethmoid region of a skull of Scyllium
(45 mm), omitting the nasal cartilage but including the nasal sac, with its inhalant
and exhalant apertures almost separated from one another by a flap (frontonasal
process) which projects backwards and outwards. The median rostral cartilage represents the fused anterior prolongation of the
trabecule, and gives rise to the nasal septum from which a trabecular horn projects
outwards on each side, and on a level with the ventral surface of the rostrum.
