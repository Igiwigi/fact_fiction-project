Tf we put w,=w, +575, the above equations become the same as those which are given

in Rovrn's © Dynamics,” page 134, where they are deduced from EULER's equations.

65. To the above equations, however, the same remark applies as has already been
made with regard to Eurgr's equations. They merely express the fact that D(H) has
L, M, N for its components; and it is far better in most problems to start with that
simple fact, and, without using those equations, to choose any axes which the nature of
the problem may suggest. Take, for instance, the problem of the top spinning upon a per-
fectly rough plane. Let O be the fixed point, 9 the top's centre of gravity.
