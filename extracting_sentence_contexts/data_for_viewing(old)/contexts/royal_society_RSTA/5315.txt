in this calculation are the distances between the source mass stacks. These separations
were measured daily and the G value calculated using the average distances from the
measurements immediately before and after each dataset. Interferometer frequency differences
and calculated G values for each set are listed in table 1, and the G values are plotted
in figure 5.

Between 15 May 2004 and 3 June 2004 the motor failed and there was a significant (0.1 mm)
shift in one of the source mass stacks when they hit the stops hard several times during trouble-
shooting and readjustment. The gravity signal shifted by 3 parts in 10+, but there was no
significant shift in the calculated value of G after the new positions were taken into account.
Between the datasets on 3 June 2004 and 4 June 2004, the source mass stacks were all rotated
180° (around their vertical axis). The scatter in the first group of points also appears lower than
in the second group. This correlates with the fact that the day-to-day shifts in the measured stack
positions increased by about 50% after 14 May 2004. Before we started taking data on 12 May,
the source mass system had been running for some time and was well adjusted. After the motor
failed, we were never able to get the system quite as well adjusted as before.

4. Interferometer design

Identical Fabry—Perot cavities and laser systems compare the displacement of the pendulum bobs
with the length of the top support. The mirrors making up the cavities have a dielectric coating,
which is better than 99.9% reflective at the He-Ne laser wavelength of 633 nm. The mirror surface
is concave with a radius of curvature of 60cm and the back side is flat with a single frequency
antireflective coating. The length of each cavity is 34cm corresponding to a free spectral range
(FSR) of 440 MHz. The actual FSR was measured by repeatedly scanning the pendulum cavity
