In tracing the larger vessels of the system towards the mid-ventral line of the pharynx,
either from the open networks that they form amongst the lymphatics and arteries
upon the ventral surface of the body, or in the other direction from the plexus that
they form in the gills, one is struck by the fact that as the larger vessels of both plexuses
come in either direction towards the anterior end of the pericardium, they become
simplified and their constituents ultimately combine to form a single trunk* of rela-
tively large size (1 mm. diameter) that forms a common connecting stem between the
two (figs. 7, 8, m.f.).

This trunk, which lies upon the lateral wall of the thyroid body and extends thence
across the ventral surface of the pharyngeal floor to the point of entry of the first afferent
branchial artery to the gill-chamber, forms, in fact, a main common stem or focus for
the entire system of vessels. From it, on the one hand, branches out upon the ventral
surface of the body a plexus of finer vessels, which is ultimately resolved into intricate
capillary networks in the skin and elsewhere; on the other hand, from its opposite
extremity are given off networks of vessels that break up into capillary plexuses upon
the gills, the buccal membrane, and the walls of the lymph sinuses at the base of the
skull, and the skin upon the dorsal surface of the head and fore part of the trunk.

The entire system of fine vessels has thus the arrangement commonly associated with
a portal circulationâ€”a circulation, that is, in which the circulating fluid is brought
from a capillary network to a main trunk, from which it is in turn distributed into a
second system of capillaries.
