The liquid phase was described as solution phase using the same relations as given in
equations (4.1)-(4.5).

The parameter optimization was performed using the OptiSage module of the FactSage
software package. For optimization, the liquid phase was defined as precipitation target of the
fcc phase and the fcc phase as the formation target of liquid. Only data for liquidus and solidus
lines were used for the optimization. For liquidus, the equilibrium phase diagram data from the
COST507 database [1] with an uncertainty of 0.1 were used. For solidus, the equilibrium phase
