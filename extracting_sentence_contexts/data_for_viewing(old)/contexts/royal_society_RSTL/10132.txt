(Plate 12) suggests this view at once. I must again refer the reader to the researches
of SALENSKY and BALFOUR on the embryology of this type; my own recapitulation
and comparison mus be confined to the cephalic skeleton,

A. The primordial skull.

We 8aw that in the larvee of Acipenser ruthenus only about a third of an inch in
length (94 millims.) the © embryonic cartilage” had largely become © hyaline ;” that
the foundations of the cranium were laid, and the visceral arches were differentiated
and becoming quite solid. Here, it would seem, that in 80 small a larva of 80 large
a Fish—and that Fish lying at the base of the greab archaic group of the Ganoids—we
have a good chance of seeing the primordial vertebrate skull in its utmost simplicity.
The fact is, that we have a confusingly simple state of things.

In the fore part of the spine, as well as in the whole basi-cranial region, the
paired skeletal tracts that lie right and left of the mesoblastic sheath of the notochord,
the hardening cartilage shows no signs of segmentation or intercalary vertebral 8ub-
division ; this is just like what occurs in the Selachians (Trans. Zool. Soc., vol. x.,
plate 35). Moreover, this Chondrosteous Ganoid remains in this condition, as far as I
can find, throughout life, and does not acquire the occipito-cervical articulation, 80 well
known in the Selachians, but which in them is a secondary modification of the parts.
By careful comparison of all the facts I have been able to gather by observation of
many types and at many stages, I cannot help coming to the conclusion that the
normal intereatary vertebral segmentation with which we are s0 familiar in the post-
cephalic region of the Vertebrata, generally, is « comparatively late and 8econdary
