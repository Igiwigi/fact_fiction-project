On the tension side two or three
isolated patches have appeared possessing new orientations, but the amount of change
there has been far less than on the compression side. It is also noticeable that the
ends which were not subjected to any strain have not in any way altered. When we
look more closely into the newly oriented patches, it is seen that a great number of .
straight-line boundaries exist between them, and this fact is still more striking when
we use a higher magnification. It is then seen that in some cases the boundaries are
quite irregular and have been more or less eaten out into channels during the
etching process, but that in others the boundaries are straight and sharp, one
orientation changing quite abruptly into the other with no such channel between
them. In the latter cases it was also apparent that there was some distinct
geometrical relation existing between the pits on either side of the boundary, an
edge of the pits on either side being always parallel to the boundary between.
