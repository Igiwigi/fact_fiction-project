But the yolk in Birds and oviparous Reptiles is invariably the product
of the ovary, and derives no appreciable increase from the secretions of the efferent
tube, which supply only the albuminous part of the egg, or the material for the first
formation of the chick. If, therefore, the gestation of the Ornithorhynchus termi-
nates by the exclusion of an egg, as in the Bird or Tortoise, the preparatory steps in
the formation of the oyum are widely different, for the parts concerned manifest the
essential characters of the mammiferous type, and the germ itself has a correspond-
ing structure. These facts, it is agreeable to find, are in exact accordance with the now ascertained
functions of the abdominal glands ; for since the yolk in the Bird, besides its uses in
the course of the foetal development, is intended as an after-substitute for a mammary
secretion, remaining, as it does, but little diminished at the close of incubation, it
might have been concluded, from & priori physiological deduction, that the Ornitho-
rbynchus, in which no such substitute is required, would approximate the other
Mammalia in the small s8ize of the ovarian ovum. The nature or amount of subsequent deviations from a true viviparous generation,
can be determined only by future examinations of more advanced ova. From the
structure of the cortical membrane it is probable that they do not become organized,
and that the Monotremata, like the Marsupiata, are essentially ovoviviparous.
