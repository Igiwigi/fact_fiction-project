20. From a review of the results of these experiments, we cannot help being struck
with the very energetic power of electric currents of weak tension ; currents of suffi-
cient energy to reduce to the metallic state oxides on which currents of higher ten-
8ion from large batteries are comparatively powerless. This fact, although pointed
out by BzcqQuertL and other philosophers, has (as far as I am aware) never been
before shown to hold good in the reduction of the alkaline metals. Potassium and
ammonium not having, I believe, been previously obtained by the weak current ema-
nating from the chemical action of saline soJutions on a single pair of plates; and
Silicon, although obtained by BzcquertL combined with iron, has not been procured
before in a pure state by electric currents, at least by those of feeble tensionÂ®. In conclusion I may be permitted to observe, that in applying weak electric cur-
rents to the reduction of metallic oxides, it is absolutely necessary that a continuous
current be employed, and that its cessation even for an instant is often fatal to the $uc-
cess of the experiment on hand, which cessation or suspension, as far as my experi-
ments have gone, the modification I haye proposed of Professor DaxiguL's battery
appears to be capable of obviating.
