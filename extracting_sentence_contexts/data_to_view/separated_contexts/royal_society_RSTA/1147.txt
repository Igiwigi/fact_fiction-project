Our main message is simple:
many types of quantified asymptotic behaviour of operator semigroups can be characterized, or at
least described very precisely, in terms of simple resolvent bounds for semigroup generators and
of various related resolvent conditions. Strikingly, the passage from resolvent bounds to decay
rates can often be achieved without essential loss, so that optimal decay rates are possible as long
as one has sharp resolvent estimates. In fact, sharp resolvent estimates are (almost) equivalent to
sharp decay rates. While resolvents have long been used in the study of decay rates, a unified
approach leading to optimal rates of decay has emerged only relatively recently. The techniques
outlined in the present survey are intended to serve as a partial remedy, although they too have
their natural limitations and will not be the optimal tool in all situations.
