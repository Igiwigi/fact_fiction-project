Figure 1. Ideal reduction of transmission area A. (Online version in colour.) Dw

resulting from the decisions all other TSOs would take if the transmission network of the area in
question was an ideal medium to the market actors (i.e. generation and load) inside that area.

To find such what-if decisions, we model a fictitious situation wherein the detailed
transmission network model of the area in question is replaced by a fully controllable link to the
area generation, loads and redispatch resources. To model an area as a fully controllable link (i)
all generators and load are connected to a single super-node, and, (ii) the super-node is only linked
with the buses connecting the original network to external areas through transmission paths of
variable impedance and infinite capacity. For demonstration, figure 1 exemplifies the reduction
of a single area (transmission area A of the multi-area system shown in the upper part) into the
simplified ideal medium. In the lower part of figure 1, all transmission links shown in black are
to be modelled in full detail, whereas the links in area A shown in green are variable impedance
and infinite capacity paths.

In the compact notation, we will employ symbol u,, to denote the controllable physical
variables (e.g. variable impedances) within any reduced area acA as well as function
