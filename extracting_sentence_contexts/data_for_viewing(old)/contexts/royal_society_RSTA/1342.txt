quantifies the net impact of any control area on the system security cost. An important feature of D8
this settlement scheme is that it imposes no additional limitation in modelling the physics of the : 4
power system. Indeed, the same process used to identify mutually acceptable decisions to secure De
the multi-area system is also integrated in the counterfactual what-if analysis for the impact of : ยง
any single control area. Moreover, we underline that the proposed settlement process stays at amd
the inter-TSO level. Each TSO could follow a local regulatory scheme to allocate this ex-post cost :&

to the grid users. We could further also envision that energy market operators could propose
hedging products related to these ex-post costs.

To exemplify our proposal, we relied on a demonstrative application to the problem of static
N-1 security management for a fictitious three-area interconnected system. We designed such
a system with varying degrees of intra-area grid flexibility, as well as intra-area generation
resources of different cost magnitude, for the sake of demonstrating the functionality of the
settlement scheme. The results clearly showcase how the proposed scheme would reward intra-
area grid flexibility, provided that it also creates a global benefit for other external areas of
an interconnected system. In other words, it would promote using intra-area grid flexibility
in a cooperative manner. At the same time, the case study also exemplifies that the proposed
settlement scheme would allocate a larger share of the multi-area system security management
cost to a single individual area relying more on the security of the interconnected transmission
infrastructure (i.e. a heavy user of the grid).

We should at this point acknowledge that the counterfactual analysis relies on modelling
multiple hypothetical alternative situations to the actual security management problem of the
