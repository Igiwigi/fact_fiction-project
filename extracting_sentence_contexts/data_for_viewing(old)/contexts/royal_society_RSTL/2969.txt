DEAR SIR, Dublin, 22 Jan; 1774«

Redde, Mays, Incloſe to you two letters, which I re-

1774> ceived from Mr. $TUCKEY | SIMON,
<oncerning that extraordinary fact in Natural Hi-
ſtory, which you ſeemed to regret had not been
ſufficiently authenticated to: be communicated, to,
the public, in the Philoſophical Trania&tions of
laſt year, —The Royal Society are undoubtedly in
the right to be extremely cautious of allowing
any thing, ſo very much out of the hitherto-ob-
ſerved courſe of nature, as this is, to. appear in
their publications, without the fulleſt evidence.
