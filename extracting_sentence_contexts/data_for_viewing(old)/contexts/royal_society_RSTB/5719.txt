The probable cause of the varying time of completion of maturation has been
considered above (p. 223).

In view of these observations of the variation of the time of completion of spermato-
genesis in different habitats, it is impossible to consider that the completion of spermato-
genesis bears any direct relation to the breeding season, nor can it be considered even
as an important critical point of the reproductive cycle.


THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACK, GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS. 261

That the spermatozoa of the fish from the habitat Gc, Cambridge, were functionally
mature at the time of completion of spermatogenesis was shown by the fact that they
fertilised the eggs of a female which had been artificially brought, to maturity (see
p. 257).

2. ii. The Completion of Maturation of Female.

When the fish egg is nearing maturity there is, as far as I am aware, no change in
the microscopic structure, and it follows that the only criterion of maturity in the
case of the female is the fertilisability of the eggs. As far as could be judged from
negative artificial fertilisation experiments, the eggs of the female Gasterosteus do not
mature until very shortly before the natural breeding season. These experiments
may, however, not afford a trustworthy guide to maturity, since it is well known in
experiments on the artificial propagation of fish that the eggs of females in apparently
