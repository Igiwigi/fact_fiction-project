The occipital, cervical and thoracic regions are quite well defined and the vertebral
structures, although still entirely membranous, are in a fairly advanced stage of
differentiation. Dorsal nerve roots have been developed and the vertebral arteries,
together with the basilar artery, are complete. Intersegmentally, the vertebral artery
is large, but within the segments its diameter is smaller, which fact lends support to
the view that it is formed by anastomosis of the intersegmental arteries. The inter-
segmental arteries between the 6th and 7th cervical segments form a connection
between the vertebral artery and the aorta. From this point, the vertebral artery
runs forward lateral to the notochord, curving over the anterior part of the atlas
rudiment to course between the floor of the hind-brain and the occipital vertebral
rudiments as the A. basalis.
