magnetic (phosphor bronze) balls; the value found was about 0-018 cm~?, in good agree-
ment with an independent estimate based on observing the variation with specimen
position of the magnet current at which a particular feature of the de Haas-van Alphen
effect in tin occurred. Putting in typical numerical values, 1/H = 0-65 x 10~4, 2E,/PH = 225
(for  ~ 10°), we find that v = 2z, so for a specimen 1 cm long symmetrically placed, / differs
from unity by less than } %, while if it is displaced to bring one end to the magnetic centre,
f= 0-9. For a field two-thirds as big, and for a period one-third of that assumed (as for
values of y near 90°), v becomes about 4z, and for the displaced specimen f= 0-3. These
figures show that in most of the measurements, where care was taken to place the specimen
centrally and the length was usually only 2 or 3mm, this effect could be safely ignored, but
in some of the early specimens which were as long as 1 cm, and not so carefully placed, a
reduction by 10 % or so might have been possible. It should be noticed that in this discussion
only a single direction (in fact the vertical) has been considered; it is possible, however, that
in spite of the small thickness of the specimens (1 or 2mm) in the horizontal direction, an
appreciable reduction might occur due to horizontal inhomogeneity, because of the
difficulty of accurate horizontal centring and since ¢ for the horizontal direction parallel
to the field should be about twice as large as for directions perpendicular to the field.

(b) In the course of an experiment (Sn3, 16 August 1950) to see if the reduction of
amplitude just discussed could be made appreciable by deliberately putting the centre of |
the specimen farther from the centre of the magnet, it was observed that the amplitude at
first increased with increasing distance from the centre before finally decreasing; the
