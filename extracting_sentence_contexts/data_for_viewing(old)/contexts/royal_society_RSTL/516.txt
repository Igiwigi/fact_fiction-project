From the examination of the few species of Alcyonium which
have been mentioned, it appears, that as the Sponges resemble
the horny stems of Gorgonie, s0 these, in external and chemical
characters, resemble the fleshy or cortical substance which
invests some of those bodies; and that they chiefly differ from
the Gorgoni@, by being destitute of the horny stem, which' in
the latter seems to supply the place of bone.

EXPERIMENTS.
The simplicity and uniformity of the experiments here de-

attention; and I must again repeat, that the minutiae of analysis
did not form part of my present plan, which was only to sketch
an outline, comprehending the most prominent chemical cha-
. racteristics of certain bodies appertaining to the animal king-
dom, which hitherto had been but little or not at all examined ;
s0 that this outline (although defective) might serve as a chain
of connection, and as a basis, upon which a more perfect super-
structure may in future be gradually raised; and it appeared
