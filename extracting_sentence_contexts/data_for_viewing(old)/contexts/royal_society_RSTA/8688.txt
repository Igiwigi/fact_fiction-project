In view of the fact that the linear law is valid to this extent over the wide gap between
the anhydrous acid and its saturated solutions in water, we were prepared to find that,
although closer examination would show marked deviations in the values for dilute
solutions, no substantial errors would occur in the case of the more concentrated solu-
tions. This anticipation was, however, by no means correct. Basing the linear formula
again on the rotatory powers of the acid in solutions containing 55 and 85 per cent. of
water, we find that the deviations which are produced by increasing the concentration
to water 45 per cent., acid 55 per cent., are even greater than those which result from
diluting to water 95 per cent., acid 5 per cent. ; and this is true, not only for one wave-
length, but for the whole range of wave-lengths shown in Table II. The linear law is
thus shown to be even less exact in concentrated than in dilute solutions.

A natural sequel to the recognition of the fact that the linear law is inexact, is the
introduction of a third term into the equation, which thus changes from

[a,] = A.+Be to [a2] = Ao+ Bie+C.eâ€™.

This method of expressing the specific rotatory powers of the acid was adopted by
WrintHER in 1902, Its application to the data now recorded is shown in Table II.
The parabolic formule were all based on the readings for solutions containing 55, 70
and 85 per cent. of water ; in a few cases these readings may have been less exact than
others that might have been selected ; but no great advantage would have been obtained
from any laborious attempt to smooth the values or to adjust the curves, since the
general results were perfectly obvious when the errors were examined over the whole of
the series of nine wave-lengths. Within the range from 55 to 85 per cent. of water, the
