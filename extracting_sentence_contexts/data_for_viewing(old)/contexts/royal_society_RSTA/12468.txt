100. Although this term involves a contact force it does not explain the known
facts, since, as can be easily seen, the contact force here obtained is such that
equation (1) would be invariably true. We seem then to be driven to the conclusion
that to explain contact force, /, cannot any longer be assumed to be zero.

Adopting the suggestion of Professor Curystat, ‘Encye. Brit.,’ 9th ed., vol. 8, p. 85,
we will assume that there is no real contact force between conductors. This simplifi-
cation is not, of course, necessary on the present theory, but the simpler the
asstimptions—so long as they are not intrinsically improbable—the better. Professor
Curystat shows that the assumption serves to explain all the known facts, the
apparent contact force between conductors being explained by the difference of their
contact forces with one and the same dielectric.

We now assume that J, contains the termt SaU»,[d], ,,/2 where a is of the same
class as before, but now depends on V,, Vj and 8, and where of course the suffix a has
nothing to do with the linear vector function a. It is assumed that a is zero for a
surface of separation of two conductors.

In place of equations (2), (3), we now have

or, if @ be a scalar,
