to the usual effect on brittleness of low temperatures, tensile properties are obtained
showing a desirable combination of specially high tenacity with excellent ductility
such as has not been obtained at ordinary temperatures.

Thus, in the report of the Alloys Research Committee referred to, a steel designated K
containing 0-41% carbon, 0-96Â° manganese, and 19-91% nickel showed in liquid air
not only the remarkably high tenacity of 157-2 tons per square inch, but a ductility
of 15-5%.

The nickel steels of more or less high percentage, depending on their content of
carbon, manganese, or other additional element, undergo a permanent transformation
at low temperatures. This, however, does not destroy the beneficial effect of the
nickel. The alloy K mentioned above was, in fact, such a steel, being non-magnetic
before immersion in liquid air and strongly magnetic on return to normal temperatures.
A similar remark applies to specimen 1449A, fig. 6, Plate 7, in the Hadfield research,
containing 0-70% carbon, 0-82% manganese, and 31 4% nickel. This with a tenacity
of 111 tons per square inch in liquid air had a ductility of 10%.

The transformation occurring in these high percentage nickel steels, however, has

the effect of giving them a specially high tenacity in place of a comparatively low one.

Thus the tenacity of the alloy K at ordinary temperature before immersion in liquid
air was only 43-9 tons per square inch, and of the alloy 1449A only 41 tons.
