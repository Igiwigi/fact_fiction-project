167, Nv. V.2%)—
passes downwards and forwards through the trigeminal foramen, while the other—the
first division or orbitonasal nerve (figs. 164-166, Nv. V.1)—passes forwards along the
surface of the orbitosphenoid bone, finally making its exit from the skull by the orbito-
nasal foramen (figs. 162 and 163, Nv. V1), The sections of Stage H show con-
2 clusively that OWEN is in error when he says that it is the ventral ramus of the
orbitonasal which supplies the tactile organ at the end of the beak, while the dorsal
ramus “ becomes lost upon the septal membrane” ; as a matter of fact it is the dorsal
ramus (figs. 149-157, Nv. V.”) which supplies the tactile organ; the ventral ramus
(Nv. V.") supplies the outer surface of the beak. The seventh nerve (figs. 298 and 299, Nv. VII.) arises from the lateral region of
the metencephal (Meten.), behind and above the root of the fifth ; it is immediately
: followed by the eighth (Nv. V/JI.) which, as already stated (p. 45), divides into two
main and about three smaller branches, which enter the auditory capsule through
separate foramina.
