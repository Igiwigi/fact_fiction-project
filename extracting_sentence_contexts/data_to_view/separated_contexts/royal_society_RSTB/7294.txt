The pollen-analyses were undertaken by Mrs E. M. Megaw (then Miss E. M. Hardy),
who supplemented her observations at this site by similar series elsewhere in the district. These results have been recorded in ยง 5. Her analyses clearly brought out two facts about
the Hawks Tor series: (i) that the base of the upper peats contain an unmistakable early
post-Glacial forest sequence, so confirming the earliness of the still lower muds and peats
of the channel, (ii) that tree pollen was so scarce, absolutely and in relation to non-tree
pollen, in the lower muds and peats as to support the idea that they formed in the open
landscape of the late-Glacial period. B\ A288 34
