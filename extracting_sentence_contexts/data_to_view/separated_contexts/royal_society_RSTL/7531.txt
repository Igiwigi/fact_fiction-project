But
there are others, which, either from the nature of the matrix, or from the compact
texture of the peripheral layer of the test, contain no such deposit ; but remain, as nearly
as can be judged, in the state of a dead and empty recent shell. In addition to these,
a few examples of Parkeria have been met with partially infiltrated ; only their exterior
layers having been consolidated by mineral deposit. Each of these three sets of speci-
mens has added its quota to the facts upon which the elucidation of a 8omewhat com-
plex organization depends ; and each has a distinct value in the study of Loftusia. By
comparing the appearance of corresponding portions of the infiltrated and uninfiltrated
test in Parkeria, reliable data are obtained from which to estimate the condition of
Loftusia prior to the filling up of its cavities with inorganic matter. Constant compa-
rison with the less altered type has been found needful, in order to demonstrate the
organization of the more obscure form ; and for the opportunity of pursuing the subject
in this way I am indebted to the kindness of Dr. CARPENTER.
