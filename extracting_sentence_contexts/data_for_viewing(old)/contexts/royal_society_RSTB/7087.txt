the precocious growth of the gonads of a proportion of the starlings present in the British
Isles, and finally, the heavy bombardment and anti-aircraft barrage of the second autumn
and winter of the war failed to accelerate the speed of development of the gonads. It is
in any case unlikely that, as postulated by Rowan, disturbance alone would cause any
acceleration in gonad growth. Bissonnette (1931) has shown experimentally that nightly
disturbance without extra light is insufficient to induce any abnormal growth of starling
gonads.

Because of these points, Rowan’s theory has been rejected, and on evidence given in full
earlier in this paper, it is suggested that the only theory which will fit the known facts is
that the precociously developing type of starling is actually the resident British bird, and
that the other type is an immigrant from the Continent of Europe. This theory would also
fit Rowan’s facts as, except in very bad weather, flocks of Continental starlings are not
commonly seen in towns. The lack of sexually stimulated birds which he observed in the
country was probably due to the fact that a sufficiently large sample was not taken. The
theory of separate races is further strengthened by the results of Nicholson’s 1925-6 London
starling survey (see Fitter, unpublished). The town birds with large stimulated gonads,
which were taken by Rowan, were starlings roosting communally in the middle of London.
Nicholson carefully traced the movements of these birds during the daytime, and he
concluded that they represented the resident suburban population. Contrary to popular
belief, no Continental immigrants were involved. All the evidence therefore points to the
conclusion that the British starling is a distinct physiological subspecies of the Continental
race, and it is evident, as the two kinds of starlings are present together during the autumn
and winter in exactly the same environment in the British Isles, that this physiological
