storm suggests, however, that usually the lower negative charge in the cloud con-
siderably exceeds in magnitude the upper positive charge.

When the electric field of a thunderstorm is not disturbed by field-changes or by
the recovery curves which follow them, its variations are usually comparatively slow.
On a few occasions, however, it was observed to be disturbed by violent and rapid
fluctuations. Striking examples of this not very common phenomenon are reproduced
in figs. 45, 46, 48-50, and 54, Plates 8 and 9. These fluctuations were usually observed
when the cloud was not producing lightning discharges and seemed on several
occasions to be characteristic of an earlier stage in the development of the cloud. They
were usually observed when the cloud was comparatively distant and could not
therefore be explained by the passage overhead of small charged clouds. It would
seem, in fact, that they were due to corresponding fluctuations in the electric moment
of the cloud. This implies that the electric moment can fluctuate with a quasi-period
of a few seconds and with an amplitude comparable with the whole value of the
electric moment. The effect may conceivably be due to some form of turbulent motion
in the cloud. It was noted that, on more than one occasion, during or shortly after the
occurrence of such fluctuations, clouds in the neighbourhood developed pronounced
mammatiform structure.
