SHARIF ON THE EFFECTS OF

X. cheopis, that only contained the resting larvae; whilst a very large number of larvae died
in the prepupal stage within cocoons 2 or 3 days old, which contained many larvae ready
for the metamorphic change. A low percentage of pupation within the cocoons of
X. brasiliensis was due to this cause. The fact that in both these species growth occurred in
a much higher percentage of the pupae than of the larvae shows that the developmental
thresholds of pupae are lower than those of larvae; this is corroborated by slightly lower
theoretical developmental thresholds for stages within the cocoons of these species, being
11-83° C in X. cheopis and 11-63° Cin X., brasiliensis. A few of the naked pupae of X. cheopis
showed signs of growth; but the naked resting larvae of both species died. The larva and pupa of each of the three species have different thresholds of development,
which are lower in the latter.
