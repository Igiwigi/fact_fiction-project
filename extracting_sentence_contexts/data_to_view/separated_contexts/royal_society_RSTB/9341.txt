US experience
teaches that the science/non-science divide offers neither
greater clarity nor stable consensus than the primary
expert/non-expert dichotomy [30]. The operative concept in
English law remains ‘expert’, rather than ‘science’ or anything
claiming similar methodological stringency. This approach
endows the legal rules with maximum coverage and inclusiv-
ity: the substantive field and content of expert evidence could
be just about anything, so long as it relates to a disputed ques-
tion of fact at issue in the proceedings. If English criminal
litigation is too conservative in its reception of novel or unortho-
dox science (criticism (12) in the ‘top 20’), it is not because
the formal rules of admissibility—before or after their recent
revision—are too restrictive in defining ‘experts’. A generic
approach does, however, entail that the rules are written at a
fairly high level of abstraction, often requiring significant
interpretational effort to apply them to the instant case.
