The circulation area in the LAD beyond the bifurcation
zone becomes more extensive and stable. Another interesting hemodynamic feature is the occurrence of retrograde (opposite directed)
blood flow. For example, before stenting (panel 2, figure 10), a retrograde flow occurs in the LAD
branch (sector II) due to the fact that the pressure in the section Outl exceeds the pressure at the
entrance to this branch near the bifurcation site. This is obviously because of the blood flow to
the neighbouring DA branch near the flow bifurcation point. After stenting (panel 2, figure 11),
retrograde flow occurs in both branches due to the alignment of velocity flows at the bifurcation
site (panel 2 in figures 10 and 11).
