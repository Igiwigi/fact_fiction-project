close of their period of vegetation, and especially as the seeds ripen: in accordance
with this, their root-system is abundant and far-reaching in the soil poor in nitrogen.
The nitrogenous materials not employed at the time are stored up in the root-
tubercles, which are emptied as the seeds begin to ripen, the. nitrogenous contents
being absorbed for the good of the latter.

As I have shown, this hypothesis is utterly untenable with regard to the tubercles
on the roots of Vicia Faba, and everything points to its being equally so for the
other Leguminose : not only is Tscmircu’s attempt to explain away the hyphae and
the gemmules a failure, but his drawings indicate that he is not in possession of the
histological facts necessary to constitute him an authority on the subject of the
development and physiology of the root tubercles of the Leguminose, whence his
repeated assumptions lose in value.

It now remains to give some account of the experimental cultures which have had so
much importance in leading to the discovery of the infecting hypha, and to the general
results given above. I found some time ago that Beans grown in a soil which had
been burnt did not develope the tubercles, and that the same results followed as a
rule when the cultivations were made in solutions of nutritive materials. I have since
observed that if cultures in burnt soil are watered with washings ef common garden
soil, or of compost heaps, the tubercles are almost sure to be developed in the course
of a few weeks ; even river or pond water is dangerous—at least, in one case I traced
the infection to the water with which I had watered the plants. Moreover, as I have
