microscope is prepared. It must be remembered that the outer tube carries the
riding level, and that the whole theory rests upon the assumption that the axis of
collimation can be brought into an invariable position with respect to the horizontal.
In order to avoid spending too much time over levelling the instrument when it is in
actual process of observation, it is of some assistance to have the tube of the micro-
scope and the V-grooves of the riding level so perfect that, in ordinary phraseology, the
level will reverse. The microscope tube was ground and lapped by us on one of
Brown and SHarpe’s cutter grinders, which are not recommended by the makers for
producing a cylindrical surface. However, by applying care and attention and
rotating the tube between centres we have succeeded in making a tube so cylindrical
that we are unable by any of our appliances to detect any defect of form. We have
to thank the mechanical assistant of the laboratory, Mr. James Coox, for making the
V-grooves so perfect that the sensitive level we employ does in fact reverse when
mounted on the microscope tube.

The riding level is a very substantial affair, the frame is of brass cut away as much
as possible for the sake of lightness, A cross level is attached to the frame by
adjusting screws. The main level is mounted in a copper tube (see p. 232).

Quartz Thread and Lever and Attachments.

This being the essential part of the instrument, requires considerable care both in
its design and its manufacture. The general methods have been described by Boys,*
also THRELFALL ;+ but it will suffice for the present purpose to refer the reader to a
book on ‘ Laboratory Arts,’t Sections 80 to 91.
