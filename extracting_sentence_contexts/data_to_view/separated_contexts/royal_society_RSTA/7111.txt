This absence of deflagration by
E self-heating may be due to (a) different crystal size; (6) evolution of nitrogen by the crystals
A in sufficient quantity to allow the shock wave mechanism to operate; (c) absence of dextrin;
(d) the fact that the region of detonation of Service azide is higher than that of dextrinated
azide, and consequently nearer to the boiling point of nujol. If (d) above is the correct explanation, then a higher-boiling liquid should give a possibility
of deflagration by self-heating with Service azide. This is in fact found with tricresyl phosphate, which boils at 385°C. The behaviour
obtained was similar to that with nujol, except that between the region of ‘crackles’ and

that of real detonation a temperature interval was found in which ‘ puffs’ are given, exactly
as in the case of dextrinated lead azide. Vor. 241.
