Eighth day. The surviving surface layer of the graft has undergone a powerful burst of
proliferation, a scaffolding being provided for the new tissue by a strong fibroblastic
reaction on the part of the surrounding dermis. Dilation and engorgement of the graft
vessels had subsided. The dead core of the graft has been partly absorbed.

Twelfth day. The newly proliferated tissue has begun to differentiate from its condition
of multilayered nests or solid buds of cells towards a duct-like or vesicle-like condition.
Further absorption of the core.

Sixteenth day (and onwards). Further differentiation of the regenerated graft tissue and
complete absorption of the dead core.

A fuller account of these autografts will be given in a later report. But two other facts
are relevant here:

(1) graft survival time is, for practical purposes, indefinite,

(2) a small number of lymphocytes and even fewer pyronin-staining cells were found
in most of the graft series; the number of lymphocytes appeared to reach a peak at 16 days
and thereafter to fall off.

The number of grafts on which the above description is based was not less than six
(representing six different rabbits) at any stage.

(ii) Homografts transplanted to non-immunized animals (‘first set’ grafts)
