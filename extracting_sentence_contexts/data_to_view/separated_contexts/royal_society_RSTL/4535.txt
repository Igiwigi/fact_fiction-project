In the months from October to February inclusive (or in the
summer months at Hobarton), the horizontal force is 0017 greater on the average
than its mean amount, and from April to August inclusive (or in the winter months
at Hobarton), it is on the average *0013 less than its mean amount. The inferences to be drawn from these variations of the inclination and horizontal
force taken conjointly, as respects the total force at Hobarton, are as follows: the
inclination being greater from October to February than from April to August, if the
total force remained unaltered, the horizontal force should be below its mean amount
in the months from October to February, whereas we find a higher amount in those
months ; therefore, 80 far as the observations have yet gone, the total force at
Hobarton appears to be subject to an annual variation, being kigher than its mean
amount from October to February, and lower than its mean amount from April to
August. It may assist the recollection of the facts regarding the annual variation of the two

magnetic elements at Toronto and Hobarton to state ;—that in the months from
October to February the magnetic needle more nearly approaches the vertical direc-
tion at both stations, and from April to August the horizontal direction ;—and that
the total force is greatest at both stations from October to February, and least from
April to August. It is much to be desired that 80 remarkable a result should receive a full con-
firmation, by the continuance of the observations at 'Toronto and at Hobarton for 8uch
an additional period as may appear necessary for that purpose ; and that the general
conelusion indicated by the observations at those stations should be verified by simi-
lar investigations in other parts of the globe, especially at the observatories which
now exist. The facts, as far as they go, indicate the existence of a general affection
of the whole globe having an annual period, and would appear to conduct us natu-
rally to the position of the earth in its orbit as the first step towards an explanation
of the periodic change*.
