In length the queen generally exceeds that of the winged female, and
measures on an average 15 mm, The abdomen is slightly more bulky, and attains a
width of 4:5 mm. across its broadest region. The antennse were imperfect in the
queens which were examined} one or more of the terminal joints being missing. Hearn (1903, p. 51) has recorded the same fact in Termopsis, and mentions that he
has observed the mutilation actually taking place. In some instances the insect bites
off joints of its own antenne, and on other occasions its companions performed the
operation on one another. The significance of this process is unknown.
