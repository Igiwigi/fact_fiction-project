with platina; and the other metals were merely accessaries, in
promoting their union and precipitation. This is sufficiently
proved, by the uniformity of the results in different Processes,
whether it was palladium or the substance I now mention which
was formed. The chief property which distinguishes the latter
substance from platina, is its density. It is not unusual to obtain
it of a specific gravity so low as 1g; very frequently 15 or 17.
In the first experiments, I suspected this lightness to be owing
to some air-bubbles ; but repeated fusion, and comparative ex-
periments upon platina, s0on convinced me of the contrary.
The augmentation of weight also, which the platina never fails
of acquiring, proves that this metal has combined with some
ponderable substance ; and, in fact, the result of these operations

is, an alloy which is a mean betwixt platina in its pure state and
what has been called palladium. It is, consequently, subject to
infinite variation. , The first effects which mercury produces upon
platina are, to render it more fusible, and to diminish its specific
gravity. The next new property conferred upon it is, the power

Â© of uniting with sulphur; and, lastly, it becomes soluble in nitric
