In the standard factorization theorems for inclusive processes, one is forced to deal with
an infinitely large number of longitudinally polarized gluon exchanges that appear to threaten
factorization graph-by-graph. A significant amount of the effort in deriving a factorization
theorem for a process like Drell-Yan scattering in real QCD amounts to using arguments based
on gauge invariance to show how a cascade of cancellations removes any resulting factorization
breaking effects from these ‘extra’ gluons in specific physical observables. The picture from Ref.
[6] leads to an interpretation of this as confirmation that transitioning to a non-abelian quantum
field theory preserves the normal expectation from a classical analogy.

Formally, the longitudinally polarized gluons simply get absorbed into the Wilson line
operators of separate parton densities, where they appear to play the purely formalistic role of
ensuring gauge invariance for parton densities. The Wilson lines are rather abstract objects, but
they essentially just account for the fact that a colliding parton must pass through a background
field on its way in or out of a hard collision, similar to the description in figure 5. The phases
accumulated along those paths need to be accounted for to preserve formal gauge invariance in
parton densities. But at least in the simplest and most highly inclusive cases, they do not impact
the general overall partonic picture. Indeed, specializing to the light-cone gauge reduces the
Wilson line in a parton density to a unity operator, and the parton density gets an interpretation
very close to that of an actual number density.
