A feature worth noting is that in the axils of many of the sterile bracts the surface
of the receptacle is raised into a more or less prominent hump (text-fig. 6), usually
distinguishable from the swollen base of the bract. The entire receptacle is thus
composed of the swollen axis, the swollen bract bases, and these axillary humps,
which, to judge from their vascular supply, are probably vestigial axes (see p. 267). Attention must be drawn to a curious fact constantly observed in the material at

my disposal, namely, that the most distal sterile bract of each receptacle differs from

the others in two respects. Firstly, the tip of the bract is awl-shaped instead of

seale-like ; secondly, the cushion bearing this free tip is considerably larger than the

swollen bases of the other bracts, and is always circular with the bract-tip projecting

from the centre (Plate 11, fig. 23, text-fig. 6).
