8entation. Thus GERHARDT, in the remarkable words which I have placed as a fitting
motto to this paper, thus defines the object of a chemical formula. © Les formules
chimiques, comme nous Favons dit, ne sont pas destin6es A representer Varrangement
des atomes, mais elles ont pour but de rendre 6videntes, de la maniere la plus simple et
la plus exacte, les relations qui rattachent les corps entre eux s0us le rapport des trans-
formations”*, Now if this be the object of a formula, how unreasonable is it to attempt
the expression of that formula by symbols which not only permit, but even compel us
to regard it from the atomic point of view. We cannot adopt the atomic symbol
and at the 8ame time declare ourselves free from the atomic doctrines. The symbols
which are here employed impose no such limitation upon our view. They are simply
the 8ymbols of the operations, from whatever point of view these operations may be
regarded, by which chemical transformations are effected. In the symbol of the unit of
water «£, we assert an indisputable fact as to the operations by which that unit is com-

posed and decomposed in the actual system of chemical transformations. The symbol
asserts that the unit of water is composed by two indivisible operations—indivisible, that
is, 80 far as our experience extends—operating successively upon the unit, of space, which
are known to us throngh their results and are defined by their results. Again, we
agsert that the units of certain other snbstances are similarly composed, the units of
hydrochloric acid and of hydrosulphuric acid, for example, of which «x and «6 are the
