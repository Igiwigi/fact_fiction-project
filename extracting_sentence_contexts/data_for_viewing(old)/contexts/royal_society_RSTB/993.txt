epithelium. a

The outer layer of certain pieces is more marked than it is in others, but in all the
same tendency is observed, and, in some, the likeness of the flattened outer layer to
newly-formed flat epithelium is very remarkable. pe

Finally, the history of the development of the uterus shows that it is formed from |
the coalesced Miillerian ducts, and that the epithelium of the embryonic duct, whi
forms these parts, is at one time of a stratified character, becoming modified later into
cylindrical epithelium (6 and 76). /

This epithelium is derived from embryonic mesoderm cells in the embryo, from the
same layer of cells, in fact, which gives rise to the rest of the mucosa.

It can, then, hardly be a matter of surprise to find, in dealing with a tissue whic
has so many primitive characteristics, that the new epithelium formed after
menstrual mucosa is cast off, is first of all formed of flat cells, and that its re-formai
may be due largely to the specialization of cells from the same layer which, in
embryo, performed the same feat.

Ll should here draw attention to the absence, â€˜on the healing surface of the mu
of any pus. The multi-nucleated leucocytes, which give rise to pus, are either w
away with the menstrual flow, or included within the newly-formed vessels of
circulatory system.
