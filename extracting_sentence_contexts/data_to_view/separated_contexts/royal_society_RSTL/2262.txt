Hence I conclude, that notwithstand-
ing the new and extraordinary state which must be assumed by an electrolyte, either
during decomposition (when a most enormous quantity of electricity must be tra-
versing it), or in the state of tension which is assumed as preceding decompoxsition,
and which might be supposed to be retained in the solid form of the electrolyte, still
it has no power of affecting a polarized ray of light ; for no kind of strueture or ten-
Sion can in this way be rendered evident. 956. There is, however, one beautiful experimental proof of a state of tension
acquired by the metals and the electrolyte before the electric current is produced, and
before contact of the different metals is made (915.) ; in fact, at that moment when
chemical forces only are efficient as a cause of action. I took a yoltaic apparatus,
consisting of a single pair of large plates, namely, a cylinder of amalgamated zine,
and a double cylinder of copper. These were put into a jar containing dilute sul-
phuric acid*, and could at pleasure be placed in metallic communication by a copper
wire adjusted 80 as to dip at the extremities into two cups of mercury connected
with the two plates.
