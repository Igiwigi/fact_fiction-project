494 PROFESSOR W. C. WILLIAMSON ON THE ORGANIZATION

merely results of the expanding growth of the inner portions of the stem fissuring
outer bark, as is the case with exogenous stems.

I may here express my conviction that many of the trees that have been 1
designated Sigillarian have no claim to be regarded as 8uch. Dr. Dawsox and other
palzeontologists have recorded the fact that the characteristic leaf-scars and other
superficial features of the younger stems and branches disappear towards the base of
the older trunks ; and this has evidently been the case with the Arran specimens.

Our prolonged researches failed to supply the smallest portion of a true Sigillaria,
T obtained one fragment of a cast of the outer surface of a bark exhibiting what at the
firs glance had a Sigillarian appearance. It exhibits strongly-marked ridges, but,
these proved to be but casts of the unsymmetrical longitudinal fissures just referred
to. That such is the case is shown by the positions of the oblong leaf-gcars—which are
wholly independent of those of the ridges —which could not have been the case in a
Sigillaria. These leaf-scars are of the Lepidodendroid type.

The most numerous fragments which we met with were long, slender Lepidodendroid
