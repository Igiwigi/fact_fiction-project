The Marsupials, however, kept
their temperature more constant than the rabbit, though less so than the cat. Imperfect homeothermie adjustment cannot explain this relative economy on their
part. It is, I believe, largely due to their better insulation, though the fact that
their average body-temperature is 2° lower than that of Mammals will account for
it to a small extent. This explanation certainly does not explain the small heat
production of Echidna, which is covered with spines and coarse hairs which do not
afford a good insulation, One must accordingly look to their low temperatures
(under 30°) and defective homeothermism for an explanation. Fig. 6 is a graphic
representation of the relation of CO, production to the difference in temperature
