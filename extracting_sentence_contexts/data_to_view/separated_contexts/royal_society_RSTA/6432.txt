In the thin-walled case, we observe a field enhancement
of over two orders of magnitude in the transition from k=ky/2 to k=ky, with Â¢sc taking a
maximum value at the resonator mouth. A similar behaviour is observed for the moderately
thick-walled case (h = 4), although we find that the field enhancement is approximately halved. This reduction continues for the extremely thick-walled resonator where the field enhancement
is now slightly over one order of magnitude, and is likely due to the fact that the volume inside
the resonator decreases, since we increase the aperture neck length 2m while keeping the outer
radius b constant. Accordingly, to achieve the strongest field enhancements, we advise that the
resonator wall thickness be taken as thin as possible. Additionally, the strongest backscattering is
observed in the thin- and extremely thick-walled representative configurations.
