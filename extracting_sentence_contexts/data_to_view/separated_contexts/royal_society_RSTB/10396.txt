In each learning trial of their study, a pair
of objects were shown to infants between 11 and 15 months of
age, accompanied by a pair of words. The problem was that, on
each trial, the infant could not possibly know which of the two
objects should be paired with which of the two words (the
‘Gavagai’ problem; [20]). Smith & Yu [19] reasoned as follows: if in the first learning
trial, the two objects were a bat and a ball, and the two words
were ‘bat’ and ‘ball’ (in the study, nonsense objects and non-
sense words were in fact used), the ball could, in principle,
become associated both with ‘bat’ and with ‘ball’, and the bat


could similarly become associated both with ‘bat and ‘ball’. words in a language corpus (within a sliding window of fixed | 3 |

Thus, on the basis of a single trial, the infant could not know width) and treating the ensuing matrix as a high-dimensional
