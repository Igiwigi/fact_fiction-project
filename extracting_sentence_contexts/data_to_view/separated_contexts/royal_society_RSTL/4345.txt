Very fine nights, when
the air seems to set no limits to magnifying power, are extremely rare, and the dumb-
bell has not been seen with the great instrument, on such nights. On the other
hand, on all ordinary nights, a variety of details are shown by the great instrument
which were not seen on the finest nights with the smaller instrament. There is
another fact I may perhaps add, that while high magnifying power brings out minute
stars it extinguishes faint nebulosity. The optical reason is obvious ; but in sketching
the dumb-bell nebula in 1845 that fact was overlooked, and but one eye-piece was
used, a very high one; had there been a low one also used the sketch would have
been more complete. To return to the annular nebule.
