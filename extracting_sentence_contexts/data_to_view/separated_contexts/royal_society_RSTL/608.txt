From the results of these experiments (which were made
with the greatest possible care) it appears, that the radiations of
cold bodies act on warmer bodies, at a distance, and gradually
diminish their temperatures. It will likewise be evident, when we consider the matter with
attention, that the cooling of the vessel which was suspended
over the ice-cold platter, was/in fact 'considerably more acce-
lerated by the frigorific radiations from that cold surface than
it appears to have been, when we estimate the' effects produced

simply by the difference of the times taken up in the cooling of
the two vessels, without having regard to any other circum-
stance. These times are, no_ doubt, | inversely as the velocities of
cooling ; but, as all the heat lost by the vessels, during the. time
of their cooling, did not pass off through their flat bottoms, and
as the rays from the cold surface fell on the bottom only of the
vessel which was suspended over it, without at all affecting its
covered sides, the velocity with which the heat made-its way
through the covered sides of the vessels was the same in both ;
consequently, more heat must have passed that way, and.
