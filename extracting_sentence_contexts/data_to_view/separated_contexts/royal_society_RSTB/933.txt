The acceleration of the heart does not occur until after the ligatures are remo
the vagus inhibitory centre having been stimulated by the vascular stagnation up to
this time ; the stimulation of the inhibitory centre ceases on removal of the clamps,
and cardiac acceleration follows in due course. The above results, which have been repeatedly obtained, agree very closely with
those of Mayer and Friepricu, who found that, after all vessels passing to the brain
had been ligatured for a considerable time, a fall of pressure still followed inhalation
of the nitrite of amyl, and that when it had access only to the vessels of the brain
fall of pressure ensued. Although these experiments are justified in their bearing on the question so far
it applies to the chief vaso-motor centre, i.c., that situated in the medulla, it ae
necessary to bear in mind that additional vaso-motor centres probably exist in

cord, and upon them the nitrites might exert an influence independent of an effect on
the peripheral vessels,

___No perfectly satisfactory plan of eliminating these centres is in our hands, nor is
there likely to be, unless a more exact localization of their position becomes an
accomplished fact. We know from the researches of Gourz, SCHLESINGER, VULPIAN,
