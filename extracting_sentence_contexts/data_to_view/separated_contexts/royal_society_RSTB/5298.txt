The Branches of the Vertebral and Basilar Arteries. The anterior spinal artery arises on either side from the vertebral artery at the level
of the second last hypoglossal rootlet, immediately cranial to the site of origin of the
posterior inferior cerebellar artery, which passes between the last two rootlets of this
nerve. In Echidna the stems of origin of the anterior spinal artery are remarkable for
their large size ; being in fact as large as the vertebral artery itself. This question of
size has an important bearing on the distribution of blood to the higher centres of the
brain. In man, from the experiments of Moxon “ there is good reason to conclude that
the anterior spinal fills from above downwards *’ (1881); whereas here in Echidna one
is justified in assuming that the longitudinal channel fills from the opposite direction.
