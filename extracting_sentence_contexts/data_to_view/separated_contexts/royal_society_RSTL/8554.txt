The angle at which the scapula and acromium meet is
much less obtuse than in T. elephantopus (about 100Â®); the body of the scapula is com-
pressed, elliptical, with both its anterior and posterior sides equally convex ; a trans-
yerse section through its middle would be represented by the figure of a greatly elon-
gate O. The shaft of the acromium is trihedral, with the edges rounded, and with
the extremity compressed and slightly dilated. The coracoid is not anchylosed to the
scapula, and its proximal part (neck) is singularly dilated,-and yery much broader than
the corresponding part in 7. elephantopus. - In fact the differences in the scapularies of
