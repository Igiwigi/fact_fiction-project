Fig. 8, Plate 55, shows the appearance of the peritoneum of the ovarian pouch
b of the upper side in the Pleuronectes microcephalus, a network of black chromato-
phores resting on a granular deposit of granules of guanin ; no “coloured” pigment
was present. In the corresponding portion of the lower side there were two or three
> minute black chromatophores in the same area. This difference can only be explained
“8 as the effect of light falling on the upper side of the Fish, and not on the lower.
| 4  Wehave written of Flat Fishes in general as having no pigment on the lower sides,
& but the subject is still further complicated by the fact that in certain species there is
r normally some pigment on the lower side. We have already referred to the frequent
occurrence of dorsal and ventral spots on the lower side of the Turbot and Brill; but
E Mr. Hour has kindly brought to our notice the fact that in normal specimens of the
Witch or Pole Dab, Pleuronectes cynoglossus, the lower side is not white but grey.
