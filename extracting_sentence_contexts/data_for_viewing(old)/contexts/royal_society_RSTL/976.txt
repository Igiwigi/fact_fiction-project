natural and artificial bodies hitherto examined, as to render
me extremely desirous of prosecuting the research, with the
aid of more perfect specimens, and improved methods of
observation.

Having arrived at the general result of a dispersion of the
axes by the s8ole consideration of the gradation of tints' in
plates of various thicknesses, it becomes interesting to verify
it by direct and independent observation. This I have ac-
cordingly done ; and the fortunate discovery of a substance
in which it is of enormous magnitude, puts it in our power to
render the fact sensible to the eye of the most unpractised
observer, by an exceedingly simple experiment, to be de-
8cribed in its place.

II. Of the general phenomena of crystals which develope tints
deviating from NEwToN's Scale, by exposure to polarised light.

In describing the phenomena, I shall at present confine
myself to the tints developed along the principal section of
the crystal, which is supposed placed in an azimuth 45* with
the plane of primitive polarisation. The observations of the
tints in this position are most easily made, and least liable to
error, and we shall see presently that it would be superflu-
