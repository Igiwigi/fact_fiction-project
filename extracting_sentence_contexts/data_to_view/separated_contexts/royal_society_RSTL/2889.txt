The bulb of the ther-
mometer was not brought into contact with the bodies of the insects. When the
thermometer was placed among the beetles, and in contact with their bodies, the
mercury rose to 745, a difference of at least 4* above the original temperature of
the bottle ; but this was far from being the full amount of the heat of these insects. During these obseryations I found that a large amount of heat generated by the in-
sects confined in the phial becomes latent, and also that much caloric is radiated
from the exterior of the phial, which becomes heated by the beetles and warm air
within, as is proved by the fact that when the thermometer is held very close to the
8ide of the phial without touching it, the mercury is considerably affected, and when
the bulb of the thermometer is held in contact with the phial the mercury ascends
the scale. In the present experiment it rose more than a degree when the bulb of
the thermometer touched the side of the phial. It must not be forgotten that besides
this difficulty in our observations on the temperature of insects, there is another which
prevents us from knowing the exact amount of heat generated by the insect under
examination.
