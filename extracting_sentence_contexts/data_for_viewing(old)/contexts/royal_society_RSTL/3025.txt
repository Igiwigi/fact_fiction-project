Nor $hould it be overlooked in reference to this view of the subject, that the
oblique bearing which is generally obseryable in the strata and veins, with
respect to the equator, causes them, as it were, to cross at opposite sides of the
globe in the same parallels of latitude, so that their tendency, if any, must
necessarily be to produce more than one magnetic pole in each hemisphere.
Thus, in this respect also, the hypothesis accords with the interesting fact
lately announced ;—of Professor Hansreen baving ascertained the existence of
a second magnetic pole within the arctic circle. The revolution of the earth
on its axis from west to east seems moreover to harmonize with the idea of
oblique electrical currents ; since rotation in the same direction may be pro-
duced by corresponding electro-magnetic arrangements.

Before I conclude, I will briefly mention a few facts relative to the tempera-
ture of some of the mines in Cornwall.

At Tingtang copper mine, in the parish of Gwennap, at the bottom of the
engine shaft, which is in killas, and 178 fathoms deep, the water about two
months ago was at the temperature of 82%. In 1820, when the same shaft was
105 fathoms deep, the temperature of the water was 68? : thus an increase of 14®
has been observed in sinking 73 fathoms, which is equal to 1* in 5 fathoms.

At Huel Vor tin mine, near Helston, the water was 69* at the bottom of a
shaft 139 fathoms deep, in the year 1819. It is now 209 fathoms deep, and
