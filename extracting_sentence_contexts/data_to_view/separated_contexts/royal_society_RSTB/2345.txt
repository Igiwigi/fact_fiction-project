Thus, in fig. 17 the distal
extremity is missed, the plane of section here passing below the sporophyll. The
vascular bundle of the sporophyll appears at three places, twice at the proximal and
once at the distal end. On entering the sporophyll it made a sharp curve, which is
clearly shown in some of the radial sections.t| The fact that the attachment of the
sporangium is seen near the distal end, and that the bundle reappears in this region,
indicates that the pedicel of the sporophyll was curved, with its convexity down-
wards, an inference confirmed by the radial sections. The sporangium shows the
usual structure and contains a large megaspore, much contracted. It may be
mentioned that the membrane of the megaspore in this species shows an irregularly
reticulated structure.
