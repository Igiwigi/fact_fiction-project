the beginning required many millions of years, at the end only requires as many thou-
82nds. The reason of this is that the moon's distance diminishes with great rapidity ;
and as the effects vary as the 8quare of the tide-generating force, they vary as the
inverse sixth power of the moon's distance, or, in physical language, the height of the
tides increases with great rapidity, and 80 also does the moon's attraction. But there
is a counteracting principle, which to some extent makes the changes proceed slower,
It is obvious that a disturbing body will not have time to raise such high tides in a
rapidly rotating spheroid as in one which rotates glowly. As the earth's rotation
increases, the lagging of the tides increases. The first column of Table I. sghows the
angle by which the crest of the lunar semi-diurnal tide precedes the moon ; we 86e
that the angle is almost doubled at the end of the series of changes, as traced back-
wards. It is not quite 80 easy to give a physical meaning to the other columns,
although it might be done. In fact, as the rotation increases, the effect of each tide
rises to a maximum, and then dies away ; the tides of longer period reach their maxi-
mum effect much more slowly than the ones of short period. At the point where I
have found it convenient to stop the golution (8&6 Table IV.), the semi-diurnal effect has
passed its maximum, the diurnal tide has just come to give its maximum effect, whilst
the fortnightly tide has not nearly risen to that point,


AND ON THE REMOTE HISTORY OF THE EARTH. 531

As the lunar effects increase in importance (when we look backwards), the relative
value of the solar effects decreases rapidly, because the solar tidal reaction leaves bhe
earth's orbit sensibly unaffected (see Section 19), and thus the solar effects remain nearly
