The islands on which they met with these animals, although all
XZ between the equator and southern tropic, form two most distant zoological stations,
[=] widely different in their physical characteristics. One of those stations was the
- Galapagos Islands, the other comprised Aldabra, R6union, Mauritius, and Rodriguez.
© But they had this in common, that at the time of their discovery they were unin-
_ habited by man or even some larger terrestrial mammal. Not one of those yoyagers
VS ever mentions having met with those Tortoises in any other island of the tropics or in

A the hardy sailors of that period took the greatest interest in these animals, which
were to them a most important article of food. At a time when a voyage now
performed in a few weeks took as many months, when every vessel, for defence sake
and from other causes, carried as many people as it was possible to pack into her,
when provisions were rudely cured and but few in kind, those tortoises which could be
captured in any number with the greatest ease within a few days proved to be a most
welcome addition to the stock.
