which give the coordinates of a point of the caustic in terms of the angle 08, which Aeter-
mines the position of the point of incidence. The values in question satisfy, as they
$hould do, the equation

{(4@—1N(a*+1)—20ar—}—2T&f (a +1 —fY=0.

We have, in fact, P
4a (cos) —a)
BY —EZ(7=32 con 0+ 20)

(4—1N&+#)—2ar—a*= 77 124%(cos 6— a)?

—3a cos 20 + 24)”

from which it is easy to derive the equation in question,

XX.
If we represent the equation of the reflected ray by »
Xax+Yy+a=0,
