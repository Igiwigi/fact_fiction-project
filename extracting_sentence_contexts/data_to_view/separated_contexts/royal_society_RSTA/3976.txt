We consider
the limit C,(t) - C(t) in which the two fronts coalesce in the simplest case of an impermeable
medium C’ = 0 (for further details, see [36]). Assume that the confinement op is large compared
with a reference stress so that o9/(/VE7?/K’) > 1 then the fluid lag 4 decays exponentially as
this ratio increases [34] and vanishes as 09 > oo (here V = |V¢| <|V)). In this limit w(x, f) > 0 for


x € Cr, the Stefan condition V¢ = q/w, combined with |V¢| <|V|, and the fact that the crack front
velocity is finite, implies that q=0 and Vs — V. Thus, the zero pressure boundary condition at
the fluid front (2.13) is replaced by a zero flux boundary condition at the crack front and from
(2.3), it follows that the net pressure p = —o9 + —oo. Thus the boundary conditions that apply for
coalescent fluid and fracture fronts are

K(x, t)=Kje for |V| >0

w(x, t) =0,
Kj(x,t) < Kj, for |V| =0

, and q(x,f)=0 for x €C(t). (2.15)

We observe that as the first condition in (2.15) implies that C is a level set for w and the limiting
process implies that it is also a level set for p¢, thus (2.6) implies that the flux vector q is orthogonal
to the fracture front C.
