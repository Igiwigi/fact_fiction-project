S chamber from the outer side of the preceding, just as in Nummulite or any other
Ss imple helical form. But before one turn of the spire is completed, each newly-
S formed chamber is seen to be double (cc) instead of single, a small portion being
= divided-off (as it were) near the marginal part of the whorl; and just about the part
where the second turn is completed, the gradual opening: out of the Spire gives room
for the interposition of a third chamber in each rov (4); and the number is 800n
further augmented, in accordance with the progressive increase in the breadth of the
Spire, the dimensions of the individual chambers retaining a pretty close conformity to
a constant ayerage. An examination of this figure will further show, that the increase
in the number of chambers in successive rows always takes-place at the inner margin
of the spire; some of those nearest the outer margin dying-out, as it were, without
giving origin to new chambers in the next row. This may, I think, be connected
with the fact, that there is always a large free opening (e, e) between one row of

chambers and the next, at the inner margin of each spire (the situation of the open-

ing in Nummulite), and that the chamber of the row abutting on the'preceding whorl
is nearly always much larger than the rest, and gives origin to two or even three
chambers in the next row. Further, it is shown by vertical sections (Plate XXXI.
fig. 7), that the innermost chambers of the whorl are not only broader but thicker,
their upper and under walls diverging from each other where they are to be con-
