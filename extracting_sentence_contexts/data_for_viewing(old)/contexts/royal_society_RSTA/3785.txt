(iv) inject the normal mode decomposition exp(i(kx — wt)) to obtain an eigenvalue problem of the
form iwB(k)X = A(k)X, which can be solved analytically when the number of degrees of freedom
included in the unknown disturbance variable X can be reduced rigorously (as in the most cases
reported in this review) or numerically when X is a discretization of the disturbance variable.

Let us now exemplify these four steps by considering the Rayleigh—Plateau instability in
the inviscid limit (Oh <1). Denoting by the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and by 9 its
density, the Ohnesorge number Oh = 1/(,/ py Ro) compares viscous effects and inertial effects. The
Ohnesorge number is in fact the inverse of a Reynolds number where the velocity scale \/y/(pRo)
would be capillary driven. Let us start from the depth-averaged equations governing slender jets
introduced by Eggers & Dupont [17], which express the conservation of mass and momentum in
the inviscid limit:
