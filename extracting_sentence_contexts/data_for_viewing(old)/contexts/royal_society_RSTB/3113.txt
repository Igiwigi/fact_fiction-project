HISTOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS ON INTUMESCENCES, ETC. 239

intumescences (while still attached to the growing plant) was darkened for four days
and five nights, and at the end of that time the oil and starch were as abundant as at
the beginning of the experiment.

2. Hemispherical Outgrowths.â€”By far the greater number of outgrowths belong
to this type, which has accordingly been already described by various authors in a
considerable number of species.

Some new facts have, however, been observed in the course of the present
investigations. Intumescences of this type consist of both epidermal and mesophyll
cells, and are of two kinds, each kind having a different pathological effect upon the
plant which bears it. In the one kind (a) the cells of the outgrowth, both the
mesophyll cells and those of the epidermis, are in uninterrupted connection, and no
rupture of the tissues occurs. In the other kind (b) the mesophyll cells soon break
through the epidermis, and the whole intumescence separates into its component cells,
so that a mechanical injury is inflicted upon the organ. The two kinds may be
considered separately.

(a) Outgrowths in which there is no Rupture of the Tissues. In some cases as in
Ipomea Woodii (fig. 7) the intumescence is made up almost exclusively of epidermal
cells, which contain large quantities of oi but no starch. This oil is almost confined
