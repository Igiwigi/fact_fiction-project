Using a similar notation to that on p. 478, we have as the equation of condition

where the temperatures are measured from that of the surrounding envelope.

For the sake of simplicity we can assume that the values of a and M
constant.

Integrating and putting \ = p/M, » =a/M, and determining the constant
the fact that when t = 0, = — 4, we obtain the equation

If there had been no radiation, p = 0, and the equation of condition would
been d0/dt = p.
Integrating, and using the same constant as before
