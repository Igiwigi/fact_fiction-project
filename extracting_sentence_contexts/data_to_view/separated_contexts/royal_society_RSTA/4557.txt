Applying a simple bias correction method to allow for differences
in present-day global mean net CRE substantially reduces the differences between the global
mean cloud feedbacks with and without parametrized convection in the individual models. The
cloud feedbacks in the two ensembles become strongly correlated, with the Convoff experiments
exploring 85% of the overall range from the standard models. This correlation, and the fact that the
models are capable of exploring much of the overall range in cloud feedbacks without convective
parametrizations active, strongly suggests that although parametrized convection influences the
strength of the cloud feedbacks substantially in some models, aspects of model formulation other
than convective parametrization ultimately determine the overall range in the cloud feedbacks in
the models examined here. It is in principle possible that changes to the details of convective parametrizations which
are not included in our current ensemble could have larger impacts on global cloud feedbacks
than those seen here. However, our current standard and ConvOff ensembles already span the
range in cloud feedbacks typically seen in climate models.
