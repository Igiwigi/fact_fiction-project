if they could be made, would apparently indicate much less darkening than this ; for
they could never be made exactly at the limb, and even for a point 95 per cent. of the
radius from the centre the value of cos @ is 0-312, considerably different from the limb
value zero.

On the other hand, for small values of AT) (or 4/Amax) the darkening increases, the
limit as AT, +0 being complete darkening at the limb. This can be shown by means
of the asymptotic formula for a large.

To be clearly separated from these results is the fact that for the integrated radiation
the darkening is independent of temperature. We find, in fact, that with the
approximation (2),

[ 1, (0, 0) da = $F (144 cos 0),

so that, as the temperature increases, the decreased darkening in the longer wave-
lengths is exactly compensated by the increased energy thrown into the shorter
wave-lengths which show the greater darkening.

The general inference is that on strict radiative equilibrium, with no selective
absorption and no scattering, blue stars should show decreased contrast in any given
wave-length, as compared with red stars, but should show the same darkening in
