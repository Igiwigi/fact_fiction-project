While projecting different sets of observations of the same vapour, the attention is
forcibly drawn to the tendency which the line shows to alter its inclination on the
most trifling change of circumstances. This inclination depends on the value of the
denominator hk, It will be remarked that this constant is nearly the same for the
vapours of ether and of water, also for a considerable number of the liquified gases. In fact the difference is not greater than might be caused by a slight want of purity. Even the s8pecific nature of the vessel in which the observations are made seems mate-
rially to affect the results. Dr.
