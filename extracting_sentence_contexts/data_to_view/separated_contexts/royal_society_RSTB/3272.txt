Here we see, even more clearly than usual, the connection that
exists between the marine conditions succeeding the deposition of the coal (as
evidenced by the marine shells in the roof) and the formation of the calcareous
concretions containing plants in the seam. Here, in the Gannister Seam, which is
otherwise without “coal balls” in its coal or marine shells in its roof, we see the coal
balls appearing in a perfectly typical form, directly the Gannister comes near enough
to the Upper Foot Mine to be within the sphere of influence of the marine conditions
which prevailed while its roof was deposited. No fact in the course of our work has stood out so clearly as that the “ coal balls”
owe their formation to the influence of sea water. In the light of this view let us
further examine the chemical composition of the structures as revealed hy the series
of analyses. Detailed Consideration of Analyses.
