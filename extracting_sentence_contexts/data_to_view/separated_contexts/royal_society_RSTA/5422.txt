These are all the
mechanical demands of the ordinary theory. Equation (19), ยง 61, shows that the
relations between the whole magnetic moment per unit volume, the permanent
magnetic moment per unit volume, and the magnetic force at the point, may on the
present theory, be regarded as the same as in the ordinary theory. Only one other

* Notwithstanding this, and the fact that I have in this paper called the stress of equation (29) the
normal stress, I think equation (28) is to be preferred, partly because of the greater simplicity of the
assumptions which lead to it, and partly because of the greater simplicity of the electrostatical results
flowing from it. THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM. 745
