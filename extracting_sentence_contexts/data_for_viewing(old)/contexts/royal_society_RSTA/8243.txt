where U = 0, and the disturbance is of infinitesimal magnitude) without following out
the detailed history of any disturbances other than those of “normal” type. To
determine completely the history of a given disturbance, we should in general have

required to know the value of A, ..., ete. in the expansion (6),—that is, actually to
perform the expansion. Tt is a great advantage of the method that this procedure is
not necessary ; but on the assumption that the expansion exists, the conjugate relation
does in fact provide us with a method for determining the coefficients.
Initially (when ¢ = 0), we have from (6) and (7)

b= b =A +... PAW, +o. 2.5.54... (16)
Multiplying both sides of this equation by V2,, and making use of the conjugate
relations (13), we obtain on integration

[J yovew, dedy = A, [fuevev,dedy, . 0.0... (7)

~a relation which serves to determine A, when by is given and the form of ¥, is
known.
