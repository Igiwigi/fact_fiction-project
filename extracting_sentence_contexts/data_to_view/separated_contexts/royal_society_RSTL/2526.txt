Hence it was
impossible to distinguish the particular effects at the moments of making or breaking
contact from this constant effect.

1083. On using the thick wire helix (1055.), the same results ensned. Proceeding,
however, upon the known fact that electric currents of great quantity but low inten-
sity, though able to ignite thick wires, cannot produce that effect upon thin ones, I
used a very fine platina wire at z, reducing its diameter until a spark appeared at G
or E, when contact was broken there. A quarter of an inch of snch wire might be
introduced at x without being ignited by the continuance of contact at G or E; but
when contact was broken at either place, this wire became red hot ; proving, by this
method, the production of the induced current at that moment.

1084. Chemical decomposition was next effected by the cross-wire current, an elec-
tro-magnet being used at D, and a decomposing apparatus, with solution of iodide of
potassium in paper (1079.), employed at x.
