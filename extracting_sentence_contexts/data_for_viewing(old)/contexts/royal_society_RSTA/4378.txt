Organic codes are mechanisms that operate in living systems, and in order to properly appreciate [ss
their role we must temporarily leave the field of ontogenesis and take a look at the other .
mechanisms of life.

The mechanisms of evolution, in particular, have been one of the most controversial issues
in biology and the great debate about them culminated, in the 1930s and 1940s, in the modern
synthesis, the theoretical framework where natural selection is regarded as virtually the sole
mechanism of evolutionary change. But where does natural selection come from?

Let us start from the fact that the copying of the genes is the elementary act that leads to
heredity. When the process of copying is repeated indefinitely, however, another phenomenon
comes into being. Copying mistakes becomes inevitable and in a world of limited resources not
all changes can be implemented, which means that a process of selection is bound to take place.
Molecular copying, in short, leads to heredity, and the indefinite repetition of molecular copying
in a world of limited resources leads to natural selection.

That is how natural selection came into existence. Molecular copying started it and molecular
copying has perpetuated it ever since. Which means that natural selection would be the sole
mechanism of evolution if molecular copying were the sole basic mechanism of life.

The discovery of the genetic code, however, has proved that there are two distinct molecular
mechanisms at the basis of life, the copying of the genes and the coding of proteins. The discovery
