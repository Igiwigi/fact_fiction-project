First, we note that even the ZPL of
the lowermost T) only contains 7% (*T1) contribution and 1% Debye-Waller factor, thus only
1% optical transition dipole moment is visible in the replica of 2.51 eV. Additionally, the A+ tt y(et|
spin-orbit coupling may turn (4Ag|d|*T) optically allowed by (Az/2)* © (50 meV/2510 meV)* =
0.04% amount. The missing fluorescence of the 2.51eV band may be explained by the fact that the optical
transition dipole moment is weak and /?T2), |2T1) and |?E) doublets exist between the 2.51 eV
optical transition that could lead to an efficient non-radiative channel for the 4T> excited state. The estimated spin-orbit coupling between the 2F and 4A, states is about A+ ~ 50 meV, which
mediates the intersystem crossing in the non-radiative process.

(b) The 2.56 eV ODMR centre and Ni? The 2.56 eV ODMR centre is associated with the ground state of Ni; but observed in luminescence
which may be explained by the optical emission from Ni? as speculated in [24].
