shores of this country can be
visible to the flock when they set out.

Again. Is there not something as extraordinary in the
pigeon, which can, in a few hours, find out its home, though
taken away in a box and totally excluded from the light, to
the distance of two hundred miles, as in that bird which quits
one shore to seek another, whatever may be the extent of
intervening seas? The fact seems to be, that we, the /ittle
lords of the creation, are too- prone to. measure the sentient
principle in animals by the scale of our own ideas, and thus,
unwillingly, allow them to possess faculties which may. sur-
pass our own, though peculiarly appropriate to their respec-
tive natures ; but a little reflection must compel us to confess,
that they are endowed with discriminating powers totally
unknown to, and for ever unattainable by man.
