There are one or two hypotheses regarding the ether so elementully obvious that
they may be regarded as almost axiomatic, such as the following :—

(i.) In interstellar space the ether is free; that is, its properties in no way depend
on the existence or motion of gross matter. It may, therefore, be called at rest.
hether it is in absolute rest or not appears to be a question which can hardly be
put into an intelligible shape. If it be moving relatively to itself, we have in those
‘gions no obvious means of ascertaining the fact. But just as it is natural to assume
hat its properties in free space are uniform, so it is natural to assume that its motion
here, whatever it is, is perfectly uniform, and it may be defined as absolute rest. Vhen I speak of the ether anywhere as “stationary,” I mean stationary with respect
