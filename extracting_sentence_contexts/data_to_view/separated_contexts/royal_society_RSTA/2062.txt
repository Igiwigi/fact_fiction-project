Firstly,
the diameter of the outer vacuum vessel of the cryostat fixed a certain minimum value
for the inner diameter of the coil. The necessity for the magnetic effect of the coil
being as large as possible would, however, require the inner diameter of the coil to be
as small as possible. Secondly, the fact that H dH/dÂ« and not H had to be as large
as possible made it necessary to use a more or less flat coil rather than one of any great
axial length. The possibility of lifting and manipulating the coil without the aid of
any very special appliances set a limit to the permissible weight and hence to the outer
diameter and the axial length of the coil. The current for which the coil was to be
designed required a certain minimum thickness of the wire used for winding, and as
many turns of this wire as possible had to be got into the available winding space.
