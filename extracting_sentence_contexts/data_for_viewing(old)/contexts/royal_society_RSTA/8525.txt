and using the cardinal equation of the last section,

indicating that Q («)/cosh gz satisfies the homogeneous equation in its only soluble
case. ‘'Lhis is, in fact, only a verification, but it is useful as the condition to be super-
posed on the solution of the cardinal equation. We write accordingly, as before,
