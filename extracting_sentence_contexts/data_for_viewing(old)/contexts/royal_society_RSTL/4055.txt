1TS DIFFERENT PHASES OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE ANIMAL SERIES. 73

65. Nucleated Blood-cells—Uncoloured stage.—In human blood to which water has
been added, besides the distended granule-cells, cells of the same size may be een,
not containing granules, but presenting most distinctly a single cellzeform nucleus
(fig. 7.). Such cells resemble the granule-cell deprived of its granules by the action
of acetic acid. Moreover, it will be observed that they are essentially similar to the
nucleated blood-cells in the uncoloured stage of the blood of the mammiferous embryo
and of the oviparous vertebrate animals. In their mode of development from granule-
cells, as indicated by the occurrence of cells in transition stages (fig. 10.) as well as in
their structure, they are in fact clearly identical. I recognise them therefore as the
corpuscles in human blood in the phase of nucleated cell, uncoloured stage.

66. In consequence of the collapsed state into which they fall immediately on the
blood being drawn (fig. 8.), these uncoloured nucleated cells of human blood are

*scarcely to be distinguished from the collapsed granule-cells (fig. 2 a.) until after dis-
tention by water. They are usually confounded with them under the same name of
*lymph” or © colourless” corpuscle.

67. In the blood of the mammiferous animals which I have yet examined in refer-
ence to the point under consideration, viz. the Horse, Elephant, Paco, Sheep, Goat
and Rabbit, uncoloured nucleated cells likewise exist, those of the blood of one ani-
