When kept
for a longer time in captivity they came to the surface more frequently, and the specimens
kept in captivity by Smrru in a large bath with bricks and water-weed in it were found
constantly hanging from the surface film. Thus, there appears to be a direct correlation
between the quantity of oxygen in the water and the hanging of the tadpoles from the
surface film. It is well known that the hill-stream animals die after a short time in captivity,
because in still waters they do not find enough dissolved oxygen to sustain their
activities, and the very fact that Smrru (1926, p. 985) was able to rear the Megalophrys
tadpoles in a bath tub shows that they must be using their lungs for respiration. The
Xenopus larvee have to rise constantly to the surface to effect an exchange of gases
because they are not provided with any mechanism by which they can hang from the
surface film indefinitely. The case of the Megalophrys tadpoles is different.
