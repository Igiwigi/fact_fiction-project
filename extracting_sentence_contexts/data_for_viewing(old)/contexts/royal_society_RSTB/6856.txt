some detail. Sapper’s description of the field relations of the Sweeny’s Well fossiliferous
tuffs is somewhat misleading. Earle, in his unpublished report, states that white
limestone with marine fossils is ‘‘incorporated in, over- and underlain by, and mixed
up in heterogeneous confusion with, the volcanic tuffs”’.

The results of the writer’s more extensive observations may be summarized as
follows. There are two series of bedded tuffs in the Roche Bluff area: (1) pale, almost
white, tuffs, locally containing fragments and broken masses of fossiliferous limestone;
(2) reddish to brown rusty tuffs, locally associated with basalt lava (Roche Bluff Point).
The latter (2) belong to the interbedded basaltic lava and tuff series of the South
Soufriére Hill volcano, and overlie the pale tuffs (1) unconformably. The pale tuffs
were upraised, steeply tilted, and much broken up, and they had acquired an irregular
upper surface before the basic series covered them unconformably. These facts were
ascertained by inspection from below and from above, by descending the steep slope
of lava and tuff at Roche Bluff Point, and by climbing gullies in the cliffs to the north.

Near Landing Bay the chaotic relations of bedding planes in adjacent masses of the
pale tuffs, make it obvious that the beds have been uptilted and broken. Locally,
rather sandy strata with vertical bedding strike along the beach near the cliff base;
a vertical junction between pale tuff and a mass of limestone extends at one place for
about 50 ft. up the cliff. North of Roche Bluff Point signs of large-scale brecciation
are less noticeable, but in many places the dip of the bedding is between 40 and 45°,
and the direction of inclination varies. Locally there is little or no sign of bedding

(fig. 18, Plate 2).
