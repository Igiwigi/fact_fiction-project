Often we could see areas of
many hundred square yards absolutely divested of the covering of black mud, and
sometimes the whole side of a valley showed it only in one or two patches (see
Plate 34, fig. 2). :

Fine sand with little lapilli had formed the greater part of the material which lay
upon the slopes. Stones of any size were very few, for when they fell they could not
rest unless they buried themselves in the hot sand, but rolled down into the ravines. This was, in fact, one of the dangers of the ascent, as the rains had loosened many
stones in the old agglomerates, and when once they were set in motion nothing could
stop them till they landed in the stream hundreds of feet below. The ash, as a rule,
held together very well when it was wet, but every now and then the pressure of the
foot started small landslips, which tumbled down the slopes. In the deep narrow valleys which score this side of the mountain little of the new
ash was left (see Plate 30, fig. 2).
