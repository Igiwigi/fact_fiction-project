lineage history when regression in height takes place.

Lineage History is pre-determined.—The balance of evidence afforded by the
investigations, the results of which are given in the descriptions of the “species
series,” suggest that the path of evolution is strictly defined. Parallel stages are
passed through by all the races, and it is possible to prophesy some considerable
part of the lineage development of a form even before the whole of its members are
known. ‘These results are comparable with those obtained by Hyarr and Buckman
from the study of Ammonites and with the well known observations of other observers
upon many groups. They undoubtedly lead to the conclusion that the course of at
least some variations is not fortuitous but predetermined for the race.

The fact that closely allied races differ in their capacity for elaboration supports
this hypothesis. There appear to be essential differences developed in the germ cells
of the Metopaster wacatus and Mitraster Hunteri lineages when they branch off
from the Metopaster Parkinsoni stem which prevented their building up high forms,
differences which also suggest “step ” mutations at birth,

Action of the Environment.—The rate of elaboration is, however, influenced in some
way by the environment. The primitive characters of the members of the Parkinsoni
series which lived in high-zonal times in the inland sea of N.E. Scania have already
been mentioned (p. 119).
