Again, since in equations (18) (14) we should have ¢ instead of C, we
see that no thermal effects would, owing to g, occur in a steady field.

86. None of these difficulties and restrictions are met with in the theory of
irreversibility. We shall find, however, that the thermoelectric consequences of
that theory are inconsistent with known facts. Both theories, therefore, are assumed
as true in part. In connection with thermoelectricity it is necessary first to establish equations (19)
to (22) and (194) to (224).
