the very circumstance of rendering silica soluble in the acids, is |
one of the discoveries that has most contributed to render certain,
and 'to extend; our knowledge of analysis.” No earthy substance
is now thought fit to be submitted to further experiment, till a
complete solution of it in an acid be first obtained; and, when
that solution cannot be effected directly bythe acid, it is always
attempted by previous fusion- with! an» alkali.» This mode of
rendering: silica' soluble-in acids, is no new discovery; it has
been long known ; and/the-analysis of minerals has never been
brought $0 near to truth, as since-it has become an indispensable
condition. ,

'T have no doubt as to the fact of a precipitate being formed,
by mixing together an' alkaline solution of silica and alumina.
Alumina indeed appears to exercise an-attraction, as I before
stated, for silica, for magnesia, and for lime. All stones in which
there /is but little alumina, and a great quantity of silica, leave,
after fusion with potash;”a light and flocculent substance, which


some of the Substances which accompany it, &c, 345

cannot be dissolved by the acids: this substance, however,
which is silica, has been in solution in the alkali. But, if a
greater proportion of alumina be present, none of this flocculent
