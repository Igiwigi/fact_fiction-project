This follows from corollary (5°5) (p. 515) because H can be taken (as in the proof) as sub-
group of a free product of locally infinite groups with one amalgamated subgroup.

18. Philip Hall’s alternative proof

Another proof of theorem (17-1) is given, which uses permutation groups instead of free
products with amalgamations, and which is due to Philip Hall (unpublished).

We consider the regular permutation representation of a group K by right multiplications ;
if k*e K, let p(k*) denote the corresponding right multiplication, that is, the mapping
defined by kp(k*) = k.k*
for all elements ke K. If A is a subgroup of K, we denote by p(A) the group generated by the
right multiplications p(a) (and in fact consisting of these right multiplications) which belong
to the elements ae A. This group is isomorphic to A.

Lemna. If A and B are subgroups of K, then the corresponding groups p(A) and p(B) are conjugate
in the group of all permutations of the elements of K if, and only if, (i) A and B ave isomorphic, and
(ii) A and B have the same index in K. (18-1)

Proof. Let 7 be a permutation of the elements of K, and 1 'p(A) m — p(B). Then p(A) and
p(B) are evidently isomorphic, and so then are 4 and B. Ifnow ke K, ae A and

m'p(a)m = p(b),
then ((kn) a) 1 = kb;
if a here ranges over the whole group A, then 4 ranges over the whole group B, and the
