it becomes more irregular with age (fig. 77), the cells of this sterile tissue for
their way upwards into the sporogenous tissue, and occasionally forming multie
processes. The development of it, however, is not carried to so great an extent as
been already noted in L. clavatum. :

Beyond the facts now described, the structure of the sporangium of L, alj
ealls for no further remark; it is obviously similar, in its main aspects, to
L. clavatum, notwithstanding the rather marked difference of external appe
the two species. Abortive sporangia are commonly found in this species, both at the upper and ;
limits of the strobilus; they show, perhaps better than in any other species,
gradual steps of transition from the fully mature to the completely abortive condi

SELAGINELLA. In the species of Selaginella which have been examined similar abortive spor
are found at the base of the strobilus ; the larger the number of examples of thi
are disclosed, the more important does it become that some adequate explan
of the phenomenon should be given.
