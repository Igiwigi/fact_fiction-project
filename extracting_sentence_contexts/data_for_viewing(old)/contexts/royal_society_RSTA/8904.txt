in certain cases. This illumination gradually died out, showing that the artificial double
refraction exhibited some of the characteristics of permanent set, with a slow recovery.
No precise measurements of this effect, however, seem ever to have been made.

In the few isolated cases observed by one of us, the stress distribution was a complex
one. In such a case, when there is overstrain and the load is removed, the less strained
portions will in general react upon the permanently overstrained ones, and thus an
internal stress system is introduced, which produces its own optical effect ; but this
optical effect is the consequence of a mechanical readjustment and is not a true
optical residual, that is, a double refraction persisting after the stress has been
entirely removed.

It seemed, therefore, of interest to examine whether in fact such optical permanent
set did exist, as if so, it would apparently settle the question whether stress or strain
is the immediate cause of the phenomenon of double refraction.

In addition, this opened up the whole question of time effects in this connection, of
which apparently no observations had been made to date, and it was hoped that a
