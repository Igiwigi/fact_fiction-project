them are grouped together into polar molecules, which may be either in totally i
gular orientation as in an unpolarized dielectric, or may possess features of regule
which can be represented in a statistical manner by the type of theory first developec
by Poisson with respect to induced magnetism. If the element of volume possesse
an electric charge, it must also contain free electrons not so grouped ; but their numbe
is excessively small compared with the former class. 7

tute true currents of various types. A drift of free electrons constitutes an ordin
conduction current, and Farapay’s fundamental law of electrolysis shows
when there is an electrolyte (or a dielectric) in the circuit of a steady curre
the current must be made up half by a drift of positive electrons, and half by
a drift of negative ones. The simplicity of the relations of a steady circuital
current is due to the fact that it involves circulation, but not strain, in
surrounding «ther. As a sub-class there is the so-called convection curre
due to the transfer of a charge of electrons along with a material body, in it
motion through the ether. There is also the current of displacement when the p
dielectric is excited, consisting of a drift within small range of the opposed positi

There is also a current due to convection of an excited dielectric, which in the case 0
uniform velocity may be represented as formally equivalent to a magnetization of
medium, Then again there is the molecular current, due to the orbital motions ¢

we can only consider the time average of this current, and that is most convenien Y
represented as the magnetic polarity of the molecule ; the displacement current in
dielectric above mentioned involves a similar process of averaging with respect
