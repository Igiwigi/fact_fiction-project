Since the resistance to crushing are as the areas, the former of these two values
would give 19677 Ibs., and the latter 22679 Ibs., for the pressures which would pro-
duce an equal alteration in a bolt 1-015 inch diameter ; which is the diameter of the

bars upon which most of the experiments on wrought iron were made. But we
have seen (Art. 59.) that 21187 lbs., and 21355 Ibs. produced a great change in the
strength of the pillars 304 inches long ; it was, therefore, obvious that incipient crush-
ing was the canse of the great falling off in the strengths of these pillars, and indeed
of those in all the preceding experiments (Art. 6.) ; and a knowledge of this fact pre-
pared me for attempting to adapt the formula used for long pillars to the case of short,
ones (Art. 41.).

61. It was shown (Art. 12.) from the experiments upon cast iron, that a uniform
pillar, with its ends flat, had the same strength as one of equal lateral dimensions,
and half the length, with the ends rounded. Making a similar comparison between
the wrought-iron pillars, in Table XII., or in the preceding abstract (Art. 58.), we
obtain an approximation to the same result ; and that even when the pillars, from
their shortness, are much crushed by the breaking weight, which we have seen was
the case with the shortest wrought-iron pillars.
