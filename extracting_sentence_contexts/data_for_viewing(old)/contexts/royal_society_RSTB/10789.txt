From the above, photoperiodism, a physiological adaptation
that relies on day- or nightlength as cued by dark-â€”light and
light-dark transitions during twilight, enables plants and ani-
mals to organize their seasonal patterns of activities, growth,
development, reproduction, dormancy and migration. These
same light transitions enable the circadian clocks of plants and
animals to organize daily patterns of behaviour, physiology
and biochemistry. Hence, light transitions are important factors
in the input of the environment to both the seasonal photoperi-
odic timer and the daily circadian clock. The question remains as
to the mechanistic relationship between them. Elucidating
the exact physiological role of circadian clock genes is compli-
cated by the fact that the core circadian clock genes are
transcription factors or transcription regulators and can exert
pleiotropic effects, making it challenging to distinguish clock
from non-clock functions of these canonical clock genes [8].

One way of disentangling this confound is by comparing
patterns across latitudes with those across elevation. At any
specific latitude on the same day of the year, regardless of alti-
tude, daylength is the same today as it was 10000 years ago
and will be 10000 years into the future. With increasing
latitude, length of the growing season declines while length
of day during the summer growing season increases [52].
Consequently, it could be that correlations between photoper-
