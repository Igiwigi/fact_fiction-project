negative ones. In the special case of that investigation, also, an estimate of the
diamagnetic coefficient may be obtained. It is easy to see that the result of imposing
a magnetic field H at right angles to the circular orbit of an electron e is the sa
as if the effective inertia were increased from Le* to Le? + eH/o. This effect, though
very minute, will be cumulative for all the electrons of the atom, whereas the chan
of orientation, which represents paramagnetism, will be a differential one as betwe
the positive and negative orbits.

By a representation like the present, the origin of the vast number of spectral lines
of some molecules may be simply illustrated. Thus in the analogous astronomical
system of the Sun, Earth, and Moon, which has only nine coordinates, three fur n
body, there exist the much larger number of periodic inequalities or oscillations that
are discussed in the Lunar Theory. The fact is that the oscillations of the coordinates
of the system are not themselves harmonic or even exactly periodic; it is only when
they are analyzed by the mathematical processes suitable to vibrations, or by a
physical instrument such as a spectroscope which yields the same results, that the
lines of the spectrum come into existence. The radiation traverses the free zether asa
homogeneous whole which is a function only of the coordinates of the vibrating
molecule ; it is only under the influence of dispersion or diffraction by material bodies:
that it is broken up into harmonic constituents, which are not independent elements
of it in case they exceed in number the internal coordinates of the molecule.

* In this connection a suggestive result has recently been obtained by Mr. H. C. Pocktinaroy, ‘ Roy. Soe.
Proe.,’ May, 1895, As the energy associated with a simple vortex ring in perfect fluid increases, its velocity
diminishes, so that a theory of gases in which the molecules are simple vortex rings fails to represent the
