In 2008, these voters accounted for 1.42% in the Presidential election, 5% in
the Senate election and 4.9% in the House election. At this stage of the study we omit these voters from our analysis to reduce
the complexity of election outcomes.

8As mentioned above, the number contains the total amount of voters who participated in both the House and
Senate elections. Table 1. 2008 Federal election outcomes.

differences in the frequencies did not occur by chance and in fact reflect the changes in voters’
behaviour? In addition to the overall voting statistics, we present another contingency table 5 with the data
obtained from the Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project. The data provide us with ‘conditional
frequencies’ (that will be approximated by probabilities in §3).

°If one were to go into more depth on this level of analysis, we would have to account for the differences in the eligible voting,
population during different election periods, as well as the changes in their voting activity.
