Langmuir trough compressions and obtained the wavelength, 4. We found a distribution
of wavelengths (see figure S4 in the electronic supplementary material) with a mean value
4 =11.12 + 4.4m. Moreover, the amplitude does not seem to be constant throughout the entire
wrinkle zones. Both these observations raise questions as to whether these deformations are
within the linear regime. In the nonlinear regime, one can observe multiple wavelengths 4, and
Az, where 41 is superimposed on a much longer Az [39,40]. In our case, we do not find such a
bimodal distribution.

Earlier, we found that the tubule structures were aligned parallel with the barriers of the
Langmuir trough. In contrast, the wrinkle zones are often not parallel and one may find wrinkle
zones close to each other, but oriented at differing angles. It has been observed that BslA forms
highly organized domains with neighbouring domains oriented at varying angles [30]. Therefore,
this observation may be explained by the fact that the BslA film is not a single contiguous layer
but consists of domains with varying orientational order. In this case, the propagation of stress
would not be homogeneous and could result in deformations such as those that we observed.

With these caveats in place, let us assume that the deformations we observed are within the
linear regime, so that we can obtain an estimate of the bending elasticity from the expression
in equation (3.1) using the mean value of 4. This gives a value of the bending elasticity k, =
9.9 x 10-2°J and a membrane tension om =—6.2 x 10° mNm_7!. These values are quite close
to those obtained for HFBII: k; = 1.1 x 107!9J and on, = —6.6 x 10-5 mN m7! [31]. So BslA films
have similar structural properties to HFBII, at least within contiguous domains.

It should be noted that such a low negative value of the membrane tension is in disagreement
with the buckling surface pressure we observed in the Langmuir trough compressions (figure 7a).
