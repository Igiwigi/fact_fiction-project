Although the governing equations of the underlying fluid dynamics are known essentially exactly
in the continuum limit, an accurate resolution of their solutions down to the smallest energized
scales is well beyond the capacity of any computers that are available now or foreseeable in the
future. In addition, many climate-critical processes such as convection and clouds are represented
only approximately in climate simulations, and perhaps always will be. Such processes may not
be amenable to a representation by physically based deterministic equations and may in fact be
inherently stochastic. For all these reasons, uncertainties in climate predictions arise not only from
uncertainties in initial conditions and forcing scenarios (including future emissions of volcanic

aerosols and greenhouse gases), but also from inherent uncertainties in model formulation. : =

temperature. Without such principles, it is impossible to estimate the error of a prediction made :f
