WITH REFERENCE TO THE NERVUS COLLECTOR IN MUSTELUS. 349

reach their destination in the fin musculature without previously effecting a junction
with one another. On the rival hypothesis, which seeks to explain alterations in the
position of the fin by excalation of vertebree in front of it, we must suppose that those
nerves which run into the fin without effecting a communication with one another
represent the primitive condition, and that the existence of a collector is a secondarily
acquired modification due to contraction of the fin area. Now on the question as to
which of these conditions is the more primitive the history of the posterior collector is
of importance. Here we have a collector formed in the embryo from which in later
stages the component nerves separate and run singly into the fin. Such a fact points
very strongly to the collector condition being the more primitive of the two.

This, however, is not the only lesson which the posterior collector has to teach. Its
formation has some further bearing on the question whether the existence of a collector
is due to contraction of the fin area or to migration of the fin. Of the two species
M. vulgaris and M. levis, it is generally recognised that the latter is phylogenetically
younger. In M. levis the pelvic fin occupies a more rostral position than in
M. vulgaris. Consequently if the hypothesis that this position is due to a forward
migration is correct, we might reasonably expect to find some traces of it during
ontogeny in the shape of a collector. Such we have already seen to be the case, and
as we know that one collector (the posterior collector) owes its origin to migration of
the limb, it seems only reasonable to apply such knowledge to the anterior collector
