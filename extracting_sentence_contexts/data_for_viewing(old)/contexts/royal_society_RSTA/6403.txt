a pressure gradient implies a thermocline slope. Assumption (v) is the most unorthodox; it is
based on the physical picture that warm water generally moves to the northeast (figure 1), so
subsurface advection of a certain density can occur only until the outcrop latitude of this isopycnal
is reached. That the isopycnals should be level equatorward of the outcrop latitude could be
caused by Kelvin waves, which were later invoked by Johnson & Marshall [33] in what could
be viewed as indirect justification of the assumption of level isopycnals here. This assumption is,
however, neither strictly required nor confirmed by the numerical experiments of Marotzke [25].
Indeed, the three-level structure in zonal flow implied by figure 2 requires some sloping-down
of isopycnals as they approach their outcrop latitude. Nevertheless, we assume level isopycnals
equatorward of the outcropping latitude for analytical convenience. Note that level isopycnals at
the eastern boundary were also assumed in the famous ventilated-thermocline theory of Luyten
et al. [34], a fact overlooked in Marotzke [25].

Our assumptions result in a picture of the density structure resembling ‘stacked boxes’, a term
coined by Jeff Scott (figure 3). The stacked boxes allow us to calculate the meridional overturning
circulation, once the basic stratification parameter—thermocline depth D—is known. The logic
is as follows. Assume that D is known. This implies that the density is known all along the


western boundary. In particular, the depth of any isopycnal at the western boundary is known
at the equator. It is known for all longitudes at the equator because the isopycnal slope is zero.
This depth z, is also known along the eastern boundary, all the way northward to the outcrop
latitude. Hence, density along the eastern wall is known, and we can calculate the east-west
density difference.
