Although, as previously mentioned, the conditions for stability of the boundary are
pointed out by WuerrHam, in his experiments the values obtained are the means of
two sets of measurements in which the boundary moves alternately in opposite
directions, and generally with slightly different velocities. Most of his figures show a very good comparison with those calculated by
Koutravscn, and the measurements as a whole form the first direct confirmation
of the theory. Proof of the fact that the velocity is proportional to the potential
fall is also given in this paper. In a second paper, WHeTHAm (‘ Phil, Trans.,’ A, vol. 186 (1895), p. 507) measured
the velocity of a number of ions in gelatine solution ; in some of these experiments the
position of the boundary was indicated by means of chemical indicators, The
results show a very good agreement with Konirauscn’s figures. Masson (/oe. cit.), employing a gelatine solution of the salt, compares directly the
velocity of the anion and the cation margins, which he shows to be dependent only on
the nature of the ions, provided certain conditions are fulfilled; the potential fall
although unknown is the same for both boundaries, since between these the concentra-
tion, and so also the resistance, is the same at all points.
