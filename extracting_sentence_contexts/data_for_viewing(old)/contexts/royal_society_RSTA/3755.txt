(T = 210K) for K+-(HFBz)g (K*+-(HFBz)g). While for K*-(HFBz)g the dissociation occurs at around
20ns of simulation time, such an event is faster in the case of K+-(HFBz)g (about 12ns). Thus, it
appears that Kt-(HFBz)s is kinetically less stable than K+-(HFBz)g.

In the remainder of this section, we further analyse the dissociation dynamics of
microsolvation clusters of alkali-metal ions with benzene. We have carried out new dynamics
simulations for Nat -(Bz)4 and Cst-(Bz)4, which allows for a detailed comparison with the results
previously obtained [74] for K*-(Bz)4. Similarly to the previous results, MD simulations for
Nat-(Bz)4 and Cst-(Bz)4 indicate that low-energy structures isomerize to form the GM at low
temperatures (T ~ 20 — 25K).

With regard to the dissociation of Nat-(Bz)4, to form Nat-(Bz)3+Bz, MD simulations show
that dissociation occurs at lower temperatures than for K*-(Bz),. In fact, taking as the initial
configuration that of the GM, we have observed that dissociation occurs at temperatures higher
than 275 K. The evolution, along the simulation time at T = 280K, of the six distances between
benzene molecules and the four from Nat to Bz are represented in the top and middle panels of
figure 4a, respectively, while the values of Ecfg are shown in the lower panel.
