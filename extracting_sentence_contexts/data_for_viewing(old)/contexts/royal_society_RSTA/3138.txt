The sixth of Hilbert’s famous 1900 list of 23 problems

http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2017.0221 was a programmatic call for the axiomatization of
the physical sciences. It was naturally and organically

axiomatization is all about. In fact, the axiomatic

foundational questions related with empirical science
Subject Areas: in general. Indeed, far from a purely formal
mathematical physics conception, Hilbert counted geometry among the

sciences with strong empirical content, closely related
Keywords: to other branches of physics and deserving a treatment
