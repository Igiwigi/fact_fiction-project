&= The glycerine extracts increase somewhat, although only slightly, in peptic power
S when treated with dilute acid for twenty-four hours. © BSince in testing a glycerine extract for pepsin, hydrochloric acid is added, it is possible that eyen the
= 8mall amount of pepsin found in it may arise from the splitting up by the acid of combined pepsin. EZ Thexe facts, I think, show that both the cesophageal and gastric glands form zymogen
which under certain conditions, and particularly when acted on by dilute acids, give
S rise to pepsin, The zymogen is only slightly soluble in glycerine. S Similar observations made on the gastric glands of Triton teniatrs give similar

but the experiment mentioned above (p. 694) shows that the gastric glands of the
