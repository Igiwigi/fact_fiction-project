Moreover, the model achieves this not using
a static approach based on curve-fitting, but a non-equilibrium approach based
on evolution dynamics. The Internet AS graph data used to evaluate the model are not a subset, but a
full map of the global Internet collected by CAIDA, which combines traceroute
data probed from tens of monitors located in different countries. In 2004 a few researchers questioned whether such traceroute measurements
could be biased, e.g. generating power-law degree distributions in ordinary random
graphs that in fact have Poisson degree distributions. However, recent measure-
ments and studies have shown that the traceroute measurements have correctly
captured the global Internet structure. The more recent DIMES project collects
data from thousands of observers distributed around the world, which is two orders
of magnitude larger than the number of observers used in previous measurements.
