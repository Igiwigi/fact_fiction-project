of the fangs’ is extremely probable, and leads us to conclude that the developed teeth
of Ornithorhynchus must have possessed many fangs.”

Stewart (1892) gives drawings of the deep surfaces of the teeth which show a
complex arrangement of roots.

The question has recently been raised by OrBAN and MUELLER (1929) as to the
method of formation of the several roots of a multi-rooted tooth. It used to be thought
that, after the crown of the tooth had been formed, Hertwig’s epithelial sheath grew in
horizontally at certain points to effect the necessary subdivision of the single opening of
the pulp cavity. They showed clearly by examining the teeth of developing rats from
5 days before birth up to 20 days old, that the plan of the division of the roots is
determined long before the completion of the crown of the tooth, in fact it is recogniz-
able before any dentine has been formed on the crown. The outlines of the roots are
foreshadowed first by an eccentric expansion of the basal opening of the enamel organ.
During this expansion some parts of the edge of the epithelial sheath of Hertwig
remain relatively fixed, and these parts thicken and grow together to determine the
number and the arrangement of the roots. ORBAN and MUELLER made graphic recon-
structions of the base of the enamel organs to show the outline of Hertwig’s sheath and
the outline of the opening bounded by it; they called the latter the “‘basale Offnung

des Keimes’’.
Using the same method I have made graphic reconstructions of the basal openings
of the enamel organs of teeth “‘x” and “‘y” of the lower jaw of Ornithorhynchus at two
