This is precisely what we do find, and in the bony fishes, where the large
food-yolk would prevent any marked change of form, we find the first set of changes
well marked, but with no trace of the second set. Leaving this subject for the present, T wish to say a few words about another
interesting phase of the early stages of Lucifer. We cannot fail to be impressed by
the very remarkable departure from ordinary Arthropod segmentation, nor can we
overlook the fact that in all the points of difference from the eggs of allied forms, the
eggs of Lucifer show a most suggestive resemblance to the ordinary unspecialized ova
of other Metazoa. In an ordinary Arthropodan egg we have, as the outcome of the process of segmen-
tation, a central mass of food-yolk, which may or may not be divided into segmentation
produets, and which completely fills the segmentation cavity ; and an outer investing
layer of blastoderm cells ; that is, the egg undergoes a centrolycethal segmentation.*

In most Crustacea the early stages of segmentation are regular, and apparently
total, but the lines of cleavage do not pass entirely through the egg, and the spherules
are united to each other by a central mass of food-yolk. When segmentation is
somewhat advanced the products of segmentation become more or less pyramidal,
with the bases of the pyramids at the surface, and their apices fused together at the
centre of the egg. 'The outer ends of the pyramids then become transparent and
separate off as a blastoderm, while the inner portions usually fuse together, more or
less perfectly, to form a central food-yolk, which fills the space which in ordinary eggs
constitutes the segmentation cavity.
