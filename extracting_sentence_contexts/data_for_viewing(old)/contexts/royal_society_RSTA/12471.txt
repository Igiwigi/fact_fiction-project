It will be evident from these data that if, temperature remaining the same, the
concentration be increased, then the amount of nitrous acid present, as also the
amount of copper dissolved per unit time, is increased ; the same result ensues if the
concentration of the acid remains the same, but the temperature is increased. As a
further confirmation of the above results, as also of the simple qualitative experiments
of Mitton, it was shown that if nitrous acid be added to the nitric acid by the intro-
duction therein of sodium nitrite, the amount of copper dissolved off per unit time,
other conditions remaining the same, is also increased. This ready-made nitrous
acid was not, however, so efficacious a material as nitrous acid resulting from the
chemical change between the copper and the nitric acid. Further, the amount of
nitrous acid present at the conclusion of the operation was less than that at the
commencementâ€”a result partly due to some mechanical blowing-off of the acid by the
current of the carbonie acid, and possibly also to the fact that the destruction of the
nitrous by the nitric acid was more rapid than its supply by the reaction between the
copper and the nitric acid.

In the following Table the results are compared of the amount of copper dissolved
off per unit time, with and without the addition of nitrous acid; in the latter case,
the amount of nitrous acid present both at the commencement and at the conelnsion
of the experiment is also given.
