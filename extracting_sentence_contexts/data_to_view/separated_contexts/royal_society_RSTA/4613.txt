The examples above suggest that in general we cannot expect C!!-regularity of solutions,
unless we restrict the problem into a smaller class of equations; this is illustrated in a few
cases below. Note that in example 1.1, although the solution is not Cl! their second derivatives belong to
BMO as a consequence of classical elliptic regularity (see, for instance, the appendix in [11] for
a proof of BMO regularity for elliptic and parabolic fully nonlinear equations). Nevertheless, we
do not expect this fact to be true in general for solutions to (1.3), and it would be interesting to
understand under which assumptions such BMO regularity holds. We conclude this section by noticing that in the book [12, ch. VI, §5] (see also [13]), there are
discussions and few results on ‘overdetermined’ problems with matching Cauchy data.
