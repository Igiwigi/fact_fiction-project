suitable length and considerable capacity is marked with a file at the place where
these (or other) indicators should meet. It is then filled with the KCl jelly and
connected with the cells, in both of which is placed copper sulphate solution. A
copper anode and a platinum cathode are used. During the progress of the experi-
ment, two boundaries travel as usual, though only one is visible, viz., that between
KCl and CuCl. It will, however, meet the other, viz., that between KCl and K,SO,,
at the mark previously made ; and the cireuit must be broken when the blue boundary
reaches this point. The cathode will have gained in weight by as many milligramme
equivalents of copper as there were milligramme molecules of KCl originally present
in the whole tube; and this may be taken as a test of the correctness of the
experiment. That it is so, is evident from the fact that there will have travelled
across that section of the tube, where the meeting of the margins occurred, all the
K ions originally present on one side of it, and all the Cl ions originally present on
the other, but nothing else. These are together equal in number to the total K, or to
the total original KC] molecules. The tube is cut in two at the mark as soon as the
experiment is over, and the contents of each part are then analysed separately, Cl and
Cu being estimated in the part nearest the anode, and SO, and K in the other. The
results may be checked by estimating the Cl that has escaped into the anode cell, and
the K that has escaped into the cathode cell. The results give the value of nâ€™ directly
for each end of the tube, with which the value of the original n may be compared.
The relative specific velocities (w/v) for Cu and Cl, and for K and SO, follow from con-
sideration of the exchanges at the anode end and the cathode end respectively ; and,
as those of K and Cl are already known, as determining the meeting point, the
