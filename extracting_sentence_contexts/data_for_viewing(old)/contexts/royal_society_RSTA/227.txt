been one of the most interdisciplinary Royal Society Discussion Meetings for quite
some time, with participation from leaders in the fields of theoretical physics,
statistics, philosophy, mathematics, cosmology, health, economics, climate, as well
as from the media, government and business.

At the time the meeting was being held, the world was in the grip of what
was collectively called ‘climategate’, a number of events (such as an e-mail hack
at the University of East Anglia) which at face value appeared to undermine

he science of climate change. Some might have imagined that this Discussion
leeting provided climate scientists with an opportunity to admit that the science
of climate change was not as certain as had been claimed, for example, in the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports. In fact,
quite the reverse—following the work of one of the pioneers of chaos theory,
meteorologist Ed Lorenz, meteorologists over the last decade or so have been
dioneering techniques to predict uncertainty in the evolution of complex nonlinear
systems, and this work is in fact well described in the IPCC assessment reports.
In truth, the Discussion Meeting, conceived and organized many months before
‘climategate’ broke onto the world stage, provided an opportunity to showcase
he techniques used to predict uncertainty in weather and climate prediction.

Within classical physics, with their deterministic and precisely known laws,

he evolution of many systems is nevertheless uncertain because these laws are
chaotic—weather prediction is but one example. For other systems, such as
