4. Various examples of elastic instability in flat plating have been discussed by
Timoshenko (1936, Chap. v1), mostly on the basis of Rayleigh’s principle (i.e. by energy
methods). From a ‘relaxation’ standpoint these problems have novelty in that usually
the smallest ‘critical loading” is associated with a mode which is characterized by nodal
lines; consequently it is not easy (as it is, for example, in the strut problem) to make
even a fairly close starting assumption in regard to the form of the gravest mode, and
difficulty may result from ‘regression’ (cf. Southwell 1940, §252 and footnote). This
difficulty is faced in §§ 22-8, where it is surmounted in relation to a case of which the
orthodox solution is known: without serious difficulty (though naturally at some cost
in labour) the critical thrust is found with an error of only 0-25 °%, and still closer
results might be expected if the computations were taken further. In §§ 29-32 the
methods thus tested are applied to a second example, very much more difficult from
an orthodox standpoint. It is, in fact, hard to see how the mode (figure 12) could be
represented in terms of known functions: for the relaxation method, on the other hand,
this example (though it calls for greater labour) is as straightforward as the first.

In conformity with previous papers of this series, at the outset each example treated
is expressed in ‘non-dimensional’ form. The distribution of the loading is specified,
and our problem is to compute (approximately) the smallest critical value of a numerical
parameter (A) by which the magnitude of the loading is related with the elastic restoring
forces.
