The causes of resurgence were poorly documented,
but most frequently resurgence was blamed on the failure to sus-
tain high intervention coverage levels. Resurgence is, in fact, the
outcome generally predicted by the Rossâ€”Macdonald theory of
elimination, since the vector populations are expected to have
retained their capacity to transmit malaria parasites. The fact
that a majority of programmes saw eventual resurgence is,
therefore, unsurprising within this conceptual framework. Albania : : : . Armenia O]:> >. 00000000 | | Booooe .
