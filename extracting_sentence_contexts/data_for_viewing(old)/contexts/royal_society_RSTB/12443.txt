and furthermore many groups have reported increased replay
of the A’, B’, C’ temporal sequence compared to both prior to
the ABC running experience and compared to reshuffled spik-
ing data. This replay is often at reduced timescales (say 5-15
fold reduced, i.e. from seconds down to less than 100 ms) and
with reduced numbers of total action potentials [2,9,10].
These compressed sequences may occur during SWRs that
happen either during offline waking states such as during
eating or drinking [11,12] or during non-rapid eye movement
(nonREM) sleep when SWRs are most common [2,6,9,13].
Importantly, the awake behaving experience of an animal
can shape the subsequent replay activity during SWRs in the
hippocampus [3,6,8], despite the fact that non-random firing
sequences can be found in hippocampal populations prior to
experimenter-introduced experience—a phenomenon known

as ‘preplay’ [3,5,14]. The spiking sequences observed during
the novel and salient experiences, such as maze running to
obtain water in a thirsty rat, for example, tend to be the
same sequences that become increasingly represented in sub-
sequent offline SWRs [6]. This ability of experience to reshape
offline activity in hippocampal networks has led to the idea
that SWR-based replay may represent a critical mechanism
for Hebbian memory consolidation.
