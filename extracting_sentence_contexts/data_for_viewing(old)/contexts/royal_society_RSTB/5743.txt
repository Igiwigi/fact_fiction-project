E-ness is not so abundant as in similar crosses in which wild (Stelfox) dextrals were
used: the other wild strains behaved as if they were, on this hypothesis, free of high
E-ness.

There are then substantial difficulties in the way of these explanations and of any
others we have been able to think of, e.g., that E-ness is a type of sinistrality not alter-
native to K-ness, but with its own dextral-determining allelomorph. It is certainly
not ‘‘ cytoplasmic ” in the ordinary sense, since both sides of the crosses give the same
results ; nor can it reasonably be supposed to be environmental. Taking one thing
with another, there seem to be two interpretations available. (i) That high E-ness
and K-ness are the ends of a graded series and that all sinistrals have a tendency to
embryonic misdevelopment and the production of phenotypic dextrals, which varies
in different strains and is heritable: this does little more than re-state the facts.
(i) That high H-ness is qualitatively different from the habit of « strains to produce
occasional dextrals, that it depends on a genetic factor, and that its manifestation
is masked when it is associated with K-ness.

Our facts are very similar to those described by Wrigut and Eaton (1923) for
otocephaly in in-bred strains of guinea-pigs. The monstrosity varies from a defect in
Meckel’s cartilage to cyclopia and on to an almost headless condition, and the different
forms fall into a single graded series. Monsters appear suddenly in some substrains
of animals, some of which afterwards produce more and more, so that by gen. 20 or
thereabouts one strain may have 20 per cent. of monsters, others practically none.
The tendency to produce them is distinctly heritable, though Wricur and Haron
cannot fit their results on to any simple mendelian scheme any more than we can.
