the gap between the plates, and after about 12 hr. growth had formed a continuous
sheet of tissue connecting them. The plates moved apart fairly slowly during the first
day and much more rapidly during the second day. They sometimes moved through
a distance greater than the width of one plate. The distance through which they
travelled showed no correlation with the amount of connective tissue left attached to
their dorsal borders, indicating that the separation was not due merely to the growth of
the intervening tissue. The tissue of the ventral body wall, peripherally situated in the
cultures, spread out considerably on the clot, so that the diameter of the explant greatly
increased. In one of the two explants where the plates remained stationary, two opposite
rib stumps had fused, thus binding the plates to each other.

Fusion of the halves usually proceeded more slowly in the controls, where the
ventral edges faced each other, owing perhaps to the fact that there is extensive
degeneration in the mid-ventral region as described in Part I, so that the cells probably
migrated less actively than those of the dorsal margins of the plates. When too much
ectoderm was left on the median body wall, the halves sometimes failed to unite after
24 hr. or more and then became joined only by a very thin sheet of cells. In other
cultures union was delayed or impaired by unusual softness and liquefaction of the clot,
a condition which is always exaggerated by the presence of degenerate cells or of
ectoderm. Such delayed or incomplete fusion occurred in all the six controls where the
plates failed to approach each other. As in the experimental cultures, the explants
as a whole expanded greatly.

In sections of the explants, the histological structure of the tissue extending from
both the ventral and dorsal sides of the plates was seen to be essentially the same and
