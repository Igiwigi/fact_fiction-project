Our knowledge of the centric diatoms is far less satisfactory. The life cycle is com-
plicated by the occurrence of resting spores and microspores as well as of auxospores.

Resting spores have been frequently found in many species. They are regarded as
resting stages which sink to the bottom and persist through unfavourable periods
(GRAN 1902). From the literature it appears that the sequence of their formation and
germination has so far never been observed.

Microspores were observed by several authors (see p. 38) and regarded as gametes
or as asexual reproductive cells. It must be pointed out that none of the authors
has actually observed the fusion of microspores or the development of the zygote.
According to GEITLER (1932) this fact might perhaps find its explanation in observa-
tions recorded by WENT (1924; see also his letter to GEITLER (GEITLER 1932)). WENT
studied the plankton on a journey across the Atlantic. One day the only diatoms
to be found were two forms of Chaetoceros of which the larger was full of microspores
while the smaller cells were surrounded by flagellated swarmers of similar size to
those within the larger cells. WenrT suggested that the microspores of the larger form
were microgametes which fertilized the female cells of the smaller type.

The auxospore formation in centric diatoms was formerly generally regarded as a
simple growth phenomenon of the protoplast, not connected with either a sexual
process or any nuclear changes. Recently, however, Persmpsky (1929, 1935) found
first in Chaetoceros boreale and Ch. densum, later in Melosira varians—the same species in
which Scumupt described microspore formation—that the formation of auxospores is
