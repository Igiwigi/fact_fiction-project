thing remarkable.

150. Hydrate of Perozide of Uranium.,—Some crystallized nitrate of uranium was
exposed to a heat a good deal short of redness, whereby most of the acid was expelled.
The residue was of a deep brick-red colour, and consisted no doubt chiefly of an-
hydrous peroxide. It was quite insensible. In order to remove any undecomposed
nitrate, it was boiled with water, whereby the undecomposed nitrate was dissolved,
and the peroxide converted into a hydrate. This bydrate, after having been washed
and dried at the temperature of the air, was of an extremely beautiful yellow colour,
and was I suppose the hydrate U* O*+2HO described in chemical treatises. It was
tolerably sensitive, in fact for an inorganic substance extremely s0, though the sensI-
bility was much less than that of nitrate of uranium, yellow uranite, or canary glass.
The derived spectrum consisted as before of separate bright bands. A small portion
of the powder was attached by water to blotting-paper, and dried before a fire. The

powder thus obtained on paper was duller than before, and inclined a little more to
orange, though the colour was not much deeper than that of the former hydrate.

From its colour and the circumstances of its formation, it was probably the other
bydrate U? O*+HO. It proved on examination to be totally insensible.
