The explanation
is, I think, clear, why we do not see them in the frontal direction, as they would
necessarily be cut across obliquely. One of the most important points is that the cingulum, when traced forward to the
vertical level of the optic chiasma and backwards to the vertical level of the hinder

part of the corpus callosum, does not vary in size, or, at any rate, does not become smaller
as we advance forwards. This fact is very remarkable, as we see from sagittal sections
that the cingulum continually gives off fibres upwards into the centrum ovale along its
whole horizontal course in the gyrus fornicatus, and yet it does not diminish in size. The fibres of the cingulum do not seem to be more closely aggregated together in
these posterior frontal sections than in the anterior. It seems, therefore, reasonable
to suppose that its fibres must be reinforced by continual additions, and it is suggested
that these additions are received from the gyrus fornicatus.
