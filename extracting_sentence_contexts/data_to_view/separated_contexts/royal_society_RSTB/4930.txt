It was to make a beginning towards
the filling in of this gap in our knowledge that the present study was undertaken. The spruce was chosen partly because of the abundance of local material, both in
nurseries and in the wild state. In fact, although nursery stock was ultimately made
use of to perhaps a greater extent than the material from the woods, the study could
probably not have been completed on this material alone, so obscure did the principle
underlying the distribution of the resin canals seem when viewed merely from a study
of nursery plants. There were, however, additional reasons of a scientific nature for
the selection of the genus Picea. â€˜The resin canals, occurring apparently normally in
the wood, are not nearly so abundant as they are in the pines, and are more irregular
in distribution.
