While Wright’s norms, Carbonicola
fallax and C. protea together with C. recta Trueman, were the most abundant forms, C. fallax
and C. protea merged so completely that separation was almost impossible. Although the
variation at every level was very large, Professor Trueman noted that ‘there seems to be
a closer similarity in many of the specimens and a more limited range of variation than is
illustrated in Wright’s paper’. He pointed to differences in lithology and the fact that
the larger shells were mostly found in coarse grey micaceous shale while the smaller speci-
mens were found in the softer and darker shales. The present paper is the first of a series of detailed studies on the Soft Bed-Bassy Mine
succession made by the writer under tht supervision of Professor Trueman. Their object
is to determine, by the study of thin bands and communities, to what extent and in what
