Although these experiments are justified in their bearing on the question so far
it applies to the chief vaso-motor centre, i.c., that situated in the medulla, it ae
necessary to bear in mind that additional vaso-motor centres probably exist in

cord, and upon them the nitrites might exert an influence independent of an effect on
the peripheral vessels,

___No perfectly satisfactory plan of eliminating these centres is in our hands, nor is
there likely to be, unless a more exact localization of their position becomes an
accomplished fact. We know from the researches of Gourz, SCHLESINGER, VULPIAN,
