That this body is simply formed by a union of the cyanide and nitrate in these pro-
portions without decomposition, is confirmed by the fact that, when the crystals are
treated with strong hydrochloric acid and the whole evaporated on a water-bath,
Succinic acid can be detected in the residue. The acid is evidently formed by the action
of the liberated nitric acid on the cyanide of ethylene. The crystals are soluble in
water and alcohol, but insoluble in ether. When heated they explode like gunpowder.
They do not, however, detonate on percussion. This compound may possibly throw some
light on the constitution of the fulminates. It gives a remarkable silver-salt, when
treated with nitrous acid (NO,,), which is insoluble in alcohol, and $0 fusible, that it can
be melted under that liquid. This I am at present engaged in studying.

I have endeayoured to substitute two equivalents of bromine for the two of cyanogen
in the cyanide of ethylene, 80 as to regenerate bromide of ethylene, but without success,
the molecule being completely broken up by the action of the bromine.
