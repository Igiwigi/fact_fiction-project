Figure 8. Same set-up as in figure 7, but now D is computed for an operator located at distance i from the Griffiths region. The D3
theory predicts that, from / = 1 onwards, D decreases with slope —2 log(c), which in the case at hand equals —0.58. This : =

However, what comes very close to a picture of non-ergodicity is the fact that the IPR as
defined above, depending on a local operator O;, does decrease when one moves away from
the Griffiths region. Roughly, one finds

where r is the distance of Oj; to the Griffiths region, where Og, is located. This exponential
dependence has been predicted by the theory of [7] and confirmed numerically (figure 8).
Standard ETH reasoning allows one to translate the factor «”” into a decrease of a local
thermalization time; see, for example, [7,30]. However, as the same wave function yy is concerned
on the left and the right side, the straightforward interpretation as an effective dimension is no
longer tenable literally and therefore it is not quite clear how to precisely rephrase these findings
in terms of the support of typical wave functions.
