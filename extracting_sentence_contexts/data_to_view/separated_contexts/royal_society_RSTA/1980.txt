The
evaluated distribution functions difference is multiplied by a constant factor defined according
to the donor cell type. More specifically, the receiving cell is always an interface one, which may
by surrounded by a fluid, an interface or an empty cell. According to the donor type cell, the
multiplying coefficient can assume three different values:

1 ifx+c¢;At= fluid
Amy (x,t + At) =fj (x + cjAt, B) — fi (xB) ) Vate ALD HYD ity 4 c:At= interface (2.14)
0 ifx+cjAt= empty

All the contributions evaluated according to equation (2.14) represent the mass variation of the
specific interface cell and they are summed over the whole set of allowed directions:

9
m(x,t+ At) =m (x,t) + D Amy (x,t + Ab), (2.15)
i=1


After having performed the mass exchange process, before the streaming phase, a fictitious
boundary condition at interface cells has to be introduced. As stated before, no computations
will be performed for the empty cells, nevertheless the interactions between the two phases are
included in this step and information coming from the empty cells is supposed to reach the
interface cells, where the streaming has to be performed. Therefore, for those cells, starting from
the atmospheric reference density (99 = 1) the missing distribution functions can be computed, at
each time-step, as follows:

Att AD =f" (or, w) +f" (or, w) — fil), (2.16)

where subscript i indicates the lattice direction corresponding to the discrete velocity G=—¢i,
and the interface density is evaluated as pyp = pp + 60x, with o being the surface tension and
« the local interface curvature.
