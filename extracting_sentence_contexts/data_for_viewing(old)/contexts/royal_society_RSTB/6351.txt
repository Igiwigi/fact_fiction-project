then lies in close relation with modified patches of uterine epithelium which are
discontinuous, and it must be assumed that the muscular contractions of the uterine
wall, resulting in rotatory movement of the egg itself, would lead to a rhythmic
alteration in the shape of the flattened uterine folds. Finally a stage would be
reached in which the shell membrane had been in contact with areas of the uterine
epithelium for a period sufficient for the even deposition of secretions on its entire
surface.

Detailed investigation of the uterine epithelium lying in contact with the shell
membrane reveals the development in it of small pit-like areas, each roofing over a
small, dense, ovoid body which stains rather heavily with eosin, ma, fig. 32, Plate 20.
These bodies are easily identified as the mammille of the shell matrix, owing
to their shape and their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the
mammille lie partly embedded in the peripheral fibres of the outer shell membrane
is strongly in favour of the contention that close contact, under pressure, between
the uterine epithelium and the shell membrane, is the normal relationship between
these structures. Owing to this pressure and the intense secretory activity of the
epithelial cells at this stage, there is considerable alteration in the appearance of
the ciliated epithelium in the areas of contact, ep, fig. 32, Plate 20, as compared
