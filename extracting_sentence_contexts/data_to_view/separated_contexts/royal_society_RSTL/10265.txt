The latter cannot, however, be looked upon as a colouring matter

Sntended to carry oxygen, but rather to keep it in combination until ib is wanted by

She cells for purposes of metabolizm. As it is distributed all over the snrface of some

Motiniz, the whole body of such an animal may, in a physiological as well as in a

Aorphological sense, be considered comparable to a single organ of a higher animal, 80

gar, at least, as internal t respiration is concerned.

2 In Sagartia parasitica the hematin-yielding pigment is replaced by a special one,f:

Ss already referred to, and in every species of Actiniz, even in those almost destitute

Sf colour, the presence of respiratory pigments has been detected. Z In Anthea cereus, Sagartic bellis, and Bunodes ballis the same colouring matter is

Dresent nob only in the tentacles but in other parts, and from the observations

Feecorded in this paper, it is quite clear that all the chlorophylloid colouring matter in

Shese three species is entirely due to the presence of © yellow cells.” Tt is not within

ghe scope of this paper to enter on a discussion of the nature of these © yellow cells,”

St will be sufficient to call attention to the facts that whenever present they have been

Sound to possess a cellulose wall and to contain starch. This is in favour of the view

Shield by Geppes,\ Braxpry, the HerTwiGs, and others, that they are of a vegetable

Snature, and are 8ymbiotic algee. Another point in favour of this view is the behaviour

Sf their 80lutions with caustic potash and soda, which, as I have already stated, dis-
tinguishes them from animal chlorophyll and ordinary chlorophyll (of green land
plants).
