BABER ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE THYROID GLAND.

8ubsequent disintegration, has an important bearing both on the physiology and
pathology of the gland.*

I may mention that vesicles containing many red blood-corpuscles have also been
observed in the thyroid gland of Man (male aged 4 years, and adult Man). The red blood-corpuscles in the vesicles have probably hitherto escaped detection in
the physiological state of the gland, owing to the rapidity with which they become
melted down, as it were, and thus rendered invisible. From the fact also that the red
blood-corpuscles in the vessels in these specimens often present no distinct structural
characters, it is quite possible that red blood-corpuscles may be present in the vesicles
at the time of death, although they are not distinguishable as s8uch in sections of the
hardened gland. Although the following applies to a pathological state of the gland it is interesting,
as showing that what T have described in the normal state has been already observed
in abnormal conditions. In speaking of vascular goitre (* Geftisskropf”) KorKeR
(op. cit., p. 482) 8ays that in this disease, besides a hyperzmic condition, there are
numerous aneurysmal dilatations of the s8mall blood-vessels which Ecker regards as
arteries and coarse capillaries.
