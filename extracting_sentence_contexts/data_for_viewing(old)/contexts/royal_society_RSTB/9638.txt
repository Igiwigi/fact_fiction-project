of prokaryogenesis and eukaryogenesis. Finally, we explore
the potential avenues for a resolution of this issue.

2. The complexity of the evolutionary process
makes phylogenetic inference difficult

A striking characteristic of phylogenetics, especially irritating
for non-specialists, is that the ToL ‘evolves’ (i.e. the names
and contents of clades change over time) and that several
mutually incompatible solutions often coexist over long
periods of time. The simplest explanation is that phyloge-
netics is an active field of science, which in itself is a
positive fact. Importantly, contrary to the naive, yet com-
monly held view that open problems eventually get solved
through the accumulation of more sequence data, incon-
gruencies still persist in the genomic era (e.g. for
streptophytes [11-16]) or Bilateria [17-22]). Indeed, while
phylogenomics helps in decreasing stochastic error (due to
small sample sizes), it actually makes systematic error more
apparent. Systematic error stems from methodological
biases (i.e. model violations in a probabilistic framework)
that cause the inference to converge towards an incorrect sol-
ution as more and more data are added. The most well-
known case of this phenomenon is the infamous long-
branch attraction (LBA) artefact, which was originally formal-
