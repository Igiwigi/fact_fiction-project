This refers to the nitrogen thermometer. At a temperature of 19°1 the value
would be reduced to 4°1936, which corresponds to our 4°1905 at the same tempera-
ture. GnirrirHs’ value is to be increased slightly owing to the fact that he really
measures the difference between the specific heat of water and of air. This would
increase the value of J by ‘0011 about, so that the value of J at 19°1 would be
raised to 41947 x 107’, which is exactly one part in a thousand larger than ours. The difference is small, but must be due to some systematic error, as both GrrrrirHs’
value and our own agree so well with each other, that ordinary observational errors
and accidental disturbance could not have produced so large a difference in our
result.
