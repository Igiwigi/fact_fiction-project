I did not publish this experi-
ment; but the apparatus by which it was effected long stood upon my laboratory table,
and, together with the results, has repeatedly been explained by me to other chemists. Since that time, as appears from the pages of the © Comptes Rendus,” this decomposition
of carbonic-acid gas under the influence of electricity has been cited as a noyel discovery. So far as the bare fact of the decomposition of carbonic-acid gas, under the influence

of electricity, in the induction-tube into oxygen and carbonic oxide is concerned, the
results of this experiment might, eyen at the time it was made by me, have reasonably been
anticipated, not only from the circumstance that carbonic-acid gas is, as is well known,
decomposed by the passage of the electric spark, but also that PLitcker® had already
observed (although T was unaware of the observation) that when the electric discharge
was passed through rarefied carbonic-acid gas, the spectrum of the gas after a short time
changed into the spectrum of carbonic oxide, and from this cireumstance had inferred
the decompoxition of the gas.
