Before these results can be compared with each other, it is necessary to examine into
another s0urce of uncertainty, which, however, as will be seen, can not only be got rid
of, but even made to yield a most interesting result. During the month of August an
old and consequently tarnished speculum was used ; this was replaced by one of great
brilliancy before the observations of October were commenced. Hence the readings
taken in August are below, and those in October above what they would haye been with
a mirror of ordinary working quality. Taking these facts into consideration, the obser-
vations were diyided into two groups, according as they were made with the old or new
speculum; and by comparing these groups with the Phase Table for 1871-72, at p. 609,
the following values of speculum factors for reducing the observations to the standard
mirror of those years were obtained. The weight which has been attached to the factor

of each day varies directly as the square root* of the number of ets, and inversely as
the reduction to the zenith, October 4th having only half weight on account of bad
| weather.
