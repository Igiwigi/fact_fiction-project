With such a machine one could only weigh to
0-2 mg which is not sufficiently accurate for dry weights, etc. ; it would be
necessary, therefore, to have a second machine with a maximum of 20 or 25 mg. The dry weights, etc., quoted in the present paper are not accurate, for we could
not weigh beyond 0-1 mg which is about 3°%, of the dry weight of a fly or puparium. In the statistical study of the facts we have received much valued help from our
colleague Dr. J. O. Irwin. The reader unfamiliar with elementary statistics may
misunderstand the phrase that the “‘ difference between the means is not statistically
significant.’ Statistical methods pay heed to the inconsistency or variation in the
original data from which the means are derived.
