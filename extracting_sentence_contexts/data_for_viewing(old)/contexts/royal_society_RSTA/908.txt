several ideas. In order to avoid circularities, they need to be introduced in the right order.

(a) Preferred pointer states from einselection

Everett explains the perception of the collapse. However, his relative state approach raises three
questions absent in Bohr’s Copenhagen interpretation [8] that relied on the independent existence
of an ab initio classical domain. Thus, in a completely quantum Universe, one is forced to seek sets
of preferred, effectively classical but ultimately quantum, states that can define what exists—
branches of the universal state vector—and that allow observers to keep reliable records. Without
such a preferred basis, relative states are just ‘too relative’, and the relative state approach suffers
from basis ambiguity [9].

Decoherence selects preferred pointer states [9-11], so this issue was in fact resolved some
time ago. The principal consequence of environment-induced decoherence is that, in open
quantum systems—systems interacting with their environments—only certain quantum states
retain stability in spite of the immersion of the system in the environment: superpositions are
unstable, and quickly decay into mixtures of the einselected, stable pointer states [1-4,9-19]. This
is einselection—a nickname for environment-induced superselection. Thus, while the significance
of the environment in suppressing quantum behaviour was pointed out by Dieter Zeh already in
1970 [20], the role of einselection in the emergence of these preferred pointer states in the transition
from quantum to classical has only become fully appreciated since 1981 [21].


(b) Born’s Rule from envariance
