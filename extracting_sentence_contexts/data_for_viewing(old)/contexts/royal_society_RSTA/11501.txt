large, but that the probable errors in the position of the mean, of the mode, and in
the magnitudes of the mean frequency and standard deviation are small. The position
of the mean is sensibly more correct than that of the mode. On the other hand, the
distance of the mean from the mode and the skewness have large probable errors, not,
however, so large but what these quantities are probably significant. The frequency
distribution probably differs significantly from the normal distribution, but the
difference is small and would require a very large number of observations to deter-
mine it with extreme accuracy. That there is a significant divergence from normality

ds also indicated by the sensible difference between the percentage errors in y, and o,
Shich would be equal for a normal distribution. Had we taken a normal distribution,
the probable error of the mean would have been ‘0400, and of the standard deviation,
"2831. In fact, the standard deviation of the standard deviation, if caleulated for
€he normal curve = ‘04197, if calculated by our present method = ‘044246, and if
falculated by a modified form of the fourth moment formula given by CzuBER*
= 044240. This shows that the arithmetic of our process has been substantially
orrect.

He “physical” constants. They are
