Presumably similar mechanisms are involved. The additional falling off observed on comparing figure 31 with figure 32 is due to the
fact that the less sensitive high explosives also propagate less well. A compact presentation
of this fact is obtained from the extent to which the percentage sensitization (P.S.G.) figures
fall below the percentage initiation (P.I.G.) in table 31. When the two figures are identical,
propagation is practically complete under the conditions of confinement of the standard
test. When the P.S.G. falls below the P.I.G. propagation is less complete.
