It greatly resembles rubiacine in its appear-
ance and many of its properties; it may however easily be distinguished by sevyeral
characteristics, and above all by its composition. It is obtained from a solution in
boiling alcohol in the form of bright lemon-yellow, silky needles, which, when dry,
form an interwoven mass. It is soluble in boiling water, more $0 in fact than any of
the products of decomposition hitherto mentioned. It crystallizes out again on the
s0lution cooling in yellow silky needles. It is less soluble in alcobol than the pre-
ceding substances.
