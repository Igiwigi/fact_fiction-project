which may be considered as indicating that this back E.M.F. is independent of the
position of the search carbon to within the limits of accuracy of the present experi-
ments. The back E.M.F. between the search carbon and the negative electrode
calculated in the same way, 7.¢., by subtracting the product of resistance by direct
current, or ohmic drop in this part of the are, from the observed direct P.D. between
the search carbon and the negative electrode, is a negative quantity, so that there
exists a forward E.M.F. which helps the flow of the direct current. The value of
this forward E.M.F. was 6°5, 6°4 and 5:3 volts respectively, again practically inde-
pendent of the position of the search carbon.

These experiments show that there is in this are at or near the positive electrode
a back E.M.F. having a mean value of 16°7 volts, and at or near the negative
electrode a forward E.M.F. of 671 volts. The fact that the algebraic sum of these
two voltages is not equal to the observed mean back E.M.F. 12°3 volts of the arc, as
a whole, is probably caused by the distortion of the lines of flow of the current

through the are, produced by the introduction of the search carbon, which renders
the sum of the resistances measured between each of the main electrodes and the
search carbon greater than their total as measured between the main electrodes.

The back E.M.F. of the are as a whole consists, therefore, of two H.M.E.’s located
at or near the electrodes, the larger E.M.F. situated at or near the positive electrode
opposing the flow of the current, the smaller E.M.F, situated at or near the negative
electrode helping the flow of the current.
