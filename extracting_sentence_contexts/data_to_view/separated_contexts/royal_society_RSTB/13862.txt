public jump on the global bandwagon to plant a trillion
trees worldwide, a repeated question has been whether
investing resources in tree planting actually accelerates
forest recovery over the long term [12,13], given that large
areas of forests across the globe have regenerated naturally
without human intervention [14]. In fact, recent meta-ana-
lyses suggest that overall recovery of biodiversity, carbon
sequestration and nutrient cycling are similar or may even
be faster in passively compared to actively (restoration plant-
ings) restored forests [15,16]. Given the paucity of long-term
studies that directly compare multiple forest restoration
approaches at the same site [3,16], however, syntheses pri-
marily rely on data from active and passive restoration
from different locations and studies. Moreover, these
meta-analyses are biased towards more successful naturally
regenerated sites; i.e. studies of passively restored sites are
typically conducted where forest naturally regenerated with
minimal intervention, whereas actively restored sites span
a broader range of conditions, including locations where
recovery is slow or non-existent [17].
