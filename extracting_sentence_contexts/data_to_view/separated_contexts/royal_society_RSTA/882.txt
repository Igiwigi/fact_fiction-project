Definition 1.1 (qubit-minor). Assume |G) and |G’) are graph states on the sets of qubits V and
U, respectively. |G’) is called a qubit-minor of |G) if there exists a sequence of single-qubit Clifford
operations (LC), single-qubit Pauli measurements (LPM) and classical communication (CC) that
takes |G) to |G’), ie. LC

If |G’) is a qubit-minor of |G), we denote this as
|G’) < |G). (1.2)

The reason for calling |G’) a qubit-minor of |G) is that this question is in fact equivalent
to the graph theoretical question of whether G’ is a vertex-minor of G, as we show in
theorem 2.6. In the graph theoretical picture, single-qubit Cliffords operations will be replaced
by operations called local complementations on the graph and single-qubit Pauli measurements
by local complementations and vertex-deletions. A vertex-minor of some graph is by definition
a graph that can be reached by some sequence of local complementations and vertex-deletions.
