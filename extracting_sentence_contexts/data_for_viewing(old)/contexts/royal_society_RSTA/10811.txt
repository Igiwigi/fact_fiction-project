The temperature of the flame of the “over-blow” is therefore much lower than
during the first period, when highly heated carbon monoxide is undergoing combustion.
This will, at least in part, account for the feeble character of the line spectra of the
alkalies, &e., at this stage. Another reason for this is discovered in the work of Gouy
(«C. R.,’ vol. 83, pp. 70-2; ‘ Phil. Mag.,’ 1877, No. 2, p. 156), who found that with
salts of lithium, calcium, strontium, and barium the maximum intensity of their
flame spectra is reached ‘before the flame ceases to be reducing (for a copper -wire),
and is followed by a rapid diminution. With a large excess of air the spectrum
disappears.” The facts appear unfavourable to the opinion which attributes the
bands of their spectra to oxides. ‘ With sodium, on the contrary, the brightness of
the flame augments rapidly as it becomes less reducing ; the maximum is produced at
the instant it ceases to be so, and is followed by a reduction of brightness much slower
than with other metals.”

Now without the decomposition products of the tar in the lining of the converter
the flame cannot be more than feebly reducing ; the only reducing gas is the hydrogen
resulting from the decomposition of the water vapour in the air. Govy’s results,
therefore, also in part explain the absence of the line and bands of calcium, and
account for the feeble character of the other lines and for the changes in the spectrum
described below.* The quantity of fume expelled is very great in the latter part
of the “over-blow”; it is mainly composed of oxide of iron, and yet no bands nor
