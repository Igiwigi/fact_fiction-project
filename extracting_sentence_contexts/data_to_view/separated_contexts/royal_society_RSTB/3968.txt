Mosso furnished apparent experimental
proof that periodic breathing at high altitudes is not abolished by breathing oxygen
in place of atmospheric air. He also published tracings and other measurements to
show that the volume of air is, or may be, diminished at low atmospheric pressures. These tracings are not quantitative records of the air breathed ; and such measure-
ments as were made of the actual volume of air breathed were vitiated by the fact
that the rate of respiratory exchange was not taken account of in making the
comparison, As shown in the preceding section, and in a succeeding paper by
Miss FrrzGeraup, the alveolar CO, pressure is always diminished at high altitudes. In other words, the volume of alveolar ventilation per unit mass of CO, produced is
always increased. If the volume of air breathed is reduced to standard pressure and
temperature there is, of course, a diminution in the air breathed? ; but the volume
reduced in this way has no physiological significance in view of what is now known as
to the relation between respiratory movements and partial pressure of CO, in the
alveolar air and arterial blood.
