appearance, with a distinct dark line, often looking double, in the median plane. This
continuous dark line may be looked upon as a series of very closely set centres of
calcification, or as one long axis of calcification. The calcareous fibres radiate at a low
angle outwards from the median plane to the surfaces.

It happens in some genera that secondary surface thickening gives rise to horizontal
rows of boss-like granulations, each row marking a single growth-period of the septum.
If we regard the infolded tissue in the median plane as originally one horizontally

+ Verritt has already suggested that a sub-family, Flabellinw, be formed, including several of the
Trochosmiliacem, with Flavellum and others of the Turbinoline, E.H., mainly on aceount of the fact
that the tentacular dise is not stretched outwards beyond the wall.

placed axis of calcification, the length of the septum, with a single horizontal row of
granulations, corresponds to a single growth-segment and is the morphological equi-
valent of a horizontally placed “ septal spine ” in Paleozoic forms; at the same time,
moreover, the equivalent of either the septwm or the septal spine in recent Madre.
