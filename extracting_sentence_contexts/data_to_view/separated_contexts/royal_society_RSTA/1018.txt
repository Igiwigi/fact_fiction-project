The strain energy (4.4), (5.8) should also
be considered from this point of view.

(b) Counting chains

The WG and AB models are presented here as a three-chain and a four-chain model, respectively. They are more usually described in the literature as a three-chain model and an eight-chain model. This discrepancy stems from the fact that different network geometries may yield equivalent
models. In the present instance, each network is such that all of the chains intersect at the origin,
both before and after deformation. So, if the chains in a particular network are joined at their
centres and then affixed to the continuum, which is deformed as before, it should be clear that
the stretches and the stored energy will be as before but the number of chains is doubled.
