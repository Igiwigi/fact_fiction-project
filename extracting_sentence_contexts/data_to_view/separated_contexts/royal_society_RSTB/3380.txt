While irregular divisions among the sac-nuclei might conceivably
result from disturbing conditions in the environment, it is difficult to suppose
that any factor other than heredity is concerned in the regular production of twice
the normal number of sac-nuclei and the organisation of the oosphere in a generation
once removed from that of the oosphere in the normal Angiosperm.- CAMPBELL’s
view further receives strong support from the facts now established for Welwitschia. Tt is a justifiable conclusion, from the evidence available, that the sixteen-nucleate
sac of Peperomia represents a stage intermediate between an ancestral type, with
a massive primary endosperm, and the more recent eight-nucleate form, which is
found in the majority of the higher Angiosperms. The fact that the number of
constituents of the fusion-nucleus varies in different species of Peperomia is favourable
to this view, for in Welwitschia, a form less specialised, in which there are many
fusion-nuclei in the same sac, the number of their constituents shows a wide range of
differences. In this connection, Nawascutn’s observations on Juglans regia|| are of great
interest. There is no organised egg-apparatus, but the sac contains several free
nuclei, any one of which may be fertilised.
