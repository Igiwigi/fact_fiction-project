If 36-4 H, is greater than 8 H,,, « = 4, and «’ H,, = ‘070 H,,.
If 36:4 H, is greater than 8 H,, 8 = $, and 8’ H, = ‘070 H.,.
Lastly, if the elliptic tides are unknown, « = B= 1, a = B’ = 45.

§ 4. Reference to Transit of Fictitious Moon.

Suppose that there is a fictitious satellite whose R. A. is equal to the Moon’s
longitude, and let 2, h® be the R. A. of the fictitious moon and of the mean sun at
2 noon of the day under consideration, and let 7 be the mean solar time of the fictitious
5 moon’s transit.

8 Then at transit
in t+h—l=gqr,
