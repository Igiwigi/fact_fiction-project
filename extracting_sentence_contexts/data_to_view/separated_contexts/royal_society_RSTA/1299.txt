The dimensionless parameter w represents the new modified time variable, which increases
with increasing the dimensionless time t. As is easily seen, the dimensionless supercooling w
decreases with increasing w. This is due to the fact that the growing ellipsoidal crystals release
the latent heat of crystallization and thus compensate the melt supercooling. As this takes place,
the main contributions wo and t9 show only qualitative behaviour. The next three contributions
with subscripts 1, 2 and 3 illustrate that the analytical solution converges.
