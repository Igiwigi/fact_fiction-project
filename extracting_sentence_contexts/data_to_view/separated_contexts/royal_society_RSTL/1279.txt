I distilled a quantity of the fusible substance from 9 grains
of potassium in an iron vessel, which communicated with a
Teceiver containing about 100 grains of mercury, and by a nar-
row glass tube the gas generated was made to pass through
the mercury; the object of this process was to detect if any of
the same substance, as that existing in the amalgam from am-
monia, was formed ; but during the whole period of distilla-
tion, the mercury remained unaltered in its appearance, and
did not efferyesce in the slightest degree when thrown into
water. That the nitrogene which disappears in this experinent is
absolutely converted into ox ygene and hydrogene, and that its
elements are capable of being Å¿urnished- from water, 'is a

conclusion of such importance, and so unsupported by the ge-
neral order of chemical facts, that it ought not to be admitted,
except upon the most rigid and evident experimental proofs. I have repeated the experiment of the abscrption of ammo-
nia by potassium in trays of platina or iron, and its distillation
in tubes of iron more than twenty times, and often in the pre-
sence of some of the most distinguished chemists in this coun-
try, from whose acuteness of observation, I hoped no source
of error could escape. The results, though not perfectly uniform, have all been of
the same kind as those described in page 55- Six grains of
potassium, the quantity constantly used, always caused the
disappearance of from 10 to 12.5 cubical inches of well dried
ammonia, From z.z to 6 cubical inches of hydrogene were
produced, a quantity always inferior to.
