in the brain, is necessary to the due performance of the func-
tions of that organ. Reduce the momentum, and you not
only impair those functions, but, if the reduction go to a cer-
tain degree, you bring on syncope, in which they are for a
time suspended. On the other hand, in nervous affections,
the sensibility and other functions of the brain are unduly in-
creased ; and what can be more natural than to attribute this
effect to the contrary cause, or excessive momentum in the
vessels of the brain ? If, however, this analogical reasoning
has any force in ascertaining the principle, I must acknow-
ledge that it did not occur to me till twenty years afterwards,
when a great number of direct experiments had appeared to
me clearly to demonstrate the fact.

From various cases of this kind, I beg leave to select one
which occurred to me in the month of January, 180g.
