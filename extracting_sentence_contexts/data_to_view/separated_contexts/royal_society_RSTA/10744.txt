The following are some of the sources of
error. It was impossible to prevent the condensation of steam in the stem of the
pyknometer, and it was therefore necessary to estimate the length of each drop, and
add this length to the reading of the level in the stem. There was also an error
introduced by the fact that, for the purpose of reading its level, the solution had to
be sucked into the cold part of the stem which projected through the indiarubber
stopper; on reaching this colder part, salt immediately crystallises out; the total
volume thus changes, and the observed level is not that which the solution would
otherwise have attained. The maximum error possible from this cause was calculated
for the case of rubidium nitrate, and was found to be such as to give an error in the
density of 0Â°1 per cent. Another and a much more important source of error was that the reduction of
pressure on the surface of the solution in the pyknometer, unavoidable when filling
by suction, very often caused steam bubbles to form.
