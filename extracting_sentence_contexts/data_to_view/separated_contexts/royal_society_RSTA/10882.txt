A paper by U. Brun in the ‘Annalen der Physik’ (No. 2 for 1900, p. 257), issued on Feb. 16, did
not come into my hands till some time after the date of my communication to the Royal Society. My
attention was drawn by this paper to the fact that in 1898 the Author had commenced a series of
determinations of the specific heats of metals at low temperatures, and that about the same time some
experiments on the specific heats of three metals,—copper, iron, and aluminium,—at the temperature of
liquid air, had been published by C. C. TRowsripGE in the American periodical ‘Science’ (N.S. 8, p. 6,
1898).
