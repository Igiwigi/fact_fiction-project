anterior commissure, but also the corpus callosum of the Eutheria.‚Äù 4

It might be contended, however, that the fact of one animal receiving its cortical
supply from the middle cerebral artery, and of another from the posterior cerebral, is
not sufficient to allow it to be postulated that the cortices of the two are different in
character. This investigation, however, is concerned with the attempt to correlate the
vascular pattern with what is known of the morphology of the structure supplied ; and
the writer fully appreciates the need for caution in interpretation in a field which has
not previously been explored. The determination of the cortical fields of supply was
made by following the individual branches until they anastomosed with other arteries.
If one examines the junctional field between areas 5 and 8 in figs. 15 and 22 one sees
that the exact line of demarcation cannot be accurately found, for here the vessels
inosculate with one another ; and since size by itself cannot be used for homology, it is
evident that the middle cerebral distribution may be more extensive than that indicated
in the figures. Nevertheless it seems unlikely that this is the case; for the arterial
