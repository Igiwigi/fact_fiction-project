2 Be this as it may, it is, at any rate, abundantly clear that the disposition of the
5 nerve cells on the surface of the dense nervous tissue of the ganglion, and their rela-
& tion to the blood streams, lends no support to the idea that they are nourished, even in
S part, by their processes. The distinction of the processes of nerve cells into “ nutritive
§ processes” and true nerve or axis-cylinder processes has been advocated by Nansent
we for the Crustacea, and by Goxer for Vertebrates. In the latter case the distinction is
ED cn based upon histological facts which appear to me to be adequately explained by the effect
2 of the shrinkage of the tissue in occluding the ly mph lacunze which, we must suppose,
‘5 surround the nerve cells of the central nervous system and their processes during life. THE POST-GiSOPHAGEAL NERVE CORD OF THE CRUSTACHA. 101
