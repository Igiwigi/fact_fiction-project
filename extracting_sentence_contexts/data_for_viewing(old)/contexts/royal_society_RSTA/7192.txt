diameter respectively) were filled with 3cm. of initiator. The bottom was placed in the
aqueous solution, and the time for the solution to creep up to the top was measured.
Comparative tests show that the rate of creep through lead styphnate is accelerated some five-
fold in glass by the addition of 0-1 % by weight of the active ingredient of perminal to the
glycerin + water solution. Similar acceleration is observed in the case of azide. With gutta-
percha tubes no creep occurs without perminal.

The practical conclusion is that this addition facilitates the desensitization of azide and
styphnate to grit, even in bulk, by speeding up wetting.

(d) Preparation of steel surfaces for grit friction tests. (i) It was found that the tests made using
the same surface continuously either on the wheel or plate, or both, for a number of strikes,
were unreliable, whenever grit was used, owing to the fact that the roughness increased
progressively.

(ii) The wheel must in all cases be smoother than the plate, since otherwise the composition
is merely brushed off the smoother surface, and a low sensitiveness observed. F or example,
with emery paper on the wheel, and roughened steel on the table, lead azide is less sensitive

than with a smooth steel wheel and roughened steel on the table, though generally azide
is very sensitive to grit.
