These two yards were found
by GRAHar to be thus related :—

Tower Yard E=Exchequer Yard Zxcheg.+0%*-0075.

*'This Tower Yard E is generally called the © Royal Society's Standard Yard,” by the
earlier authorities:

*T do not know when Bird made his original scale, but from his method of dividing
mural quadrants, a well-divided scale must, I think, have been in his possession before
the graduation of the Greenwich Mural Quadrant. In 1758 and 1760, he made two
Standard bars for a Committee of the House, which are known by those dates, the
Standard of 1760 being in 1821 declared to be the legal Imperial Standard, which I am
attempting to restore. I find, from some notices by MASKELYNE, in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1768, pp. 324, &c., that Bird's own scale was just 0-001 in 3 feet 8horter
than GrRanam's Tower Yard EF; and I believe, though I have no absolute evidence of
the fact, that his own scale was the type followed by BirD in constructing his Standards
of 1758 and 1760, and in fact all the scales which issned from his hands ; so that Birv's
scales are, errors excepted, 0-001 shorter than GrRanan's Tower Yard E. It is certain
that TrRouGnrTox, in laying down his own scale, took the fundamental length from a scale
by Bird (Philosophical Transactions, 1798, p. 137). Hence, as a general rule, all scales,
having Bird or TrovenToN for their authors, will be found to be about 0-001 shorter
in 36 inches than Granan's Tower Yard E; although accidental errors, to half that
amount at least, may occur in any of the older scales which have been examined by
SHUCKBURGH, IKATER, &Cc.

* If this account be, in the main, correct, we see how it comes to pass that SHUCKBURGH'S
scale by TRoOUGHTON Should be nearly of the same length as BirD's Standard of 1758 and
1760, since they are all of the same family.
