The correlation coefficient is here positive, instead of negative as in the previous
cases considered. That is, so far as these data are concerned, decrease in the size of the
leaf tends to be accompanied by a decrease, instead of an increase, in the number of
stomata, and vice-versa. As, however, the correlation coefficient is only -}- 0-074,
which is less than the probable error, no importance can be attached to this feature.
The fact that there is no “ significant ” correlation is, however, to be emphasised, as
despite the comparatively small number of leaves examined, viz., 26, the contrast with
Statice binervosa (30 leaves) is so marked. The Ficaria leaves were obtained from eight
different plants, grown under uniform, conditions as to soil and in a moist atmosphere,
four being well illuminated and the other four in shade. It would, therefore, seem, that
the relation between leaf size and stomatal frequency, which is so pronounced when we
compare leaves of the same node, may be entirely masked under humid conditions.
This is borne out by examination of Mercurialis leaves from plants growing in very damp
air under bell-jars. Since the different parts of the plant will naturally be growing
under differing conditions of humidity it will be convenient to consider next the relation
which stomatal frequency exhibits to the varying positions in which the leaf is borne
upon the plant.
