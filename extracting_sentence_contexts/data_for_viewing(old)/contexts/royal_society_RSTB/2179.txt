effects. The effects manifested by the posterior half of the eyeball or by the isolated
retina are, I find, precisely what is obtained on the injured eyeball, and I therefore
consider as typical the effect obtained on the uninjured eyeball. Moreover the latter
has in my hands proved to, be far more sensitive and far more enduring than previous
accounts had led me to expect—e.g., a “good” eye will give a large electrical
response to illumination by a flash of moonlight lasting z}oth second, and will
respond distinctly to exposure to light reflected from a white card 10 feet distant
lighted by a standard candle 10 feet from the card, while the period during which
response may be witnessed extends to more than 48 hours.

That heat-rays do not contribute to the effect is at once shown by means of an
alum cell or a black-hot poker. And the “ physiological” nature of the electrical
response is proved by the fact that it is subject to the influences of anzesthetics and
of raised or lowered temperature.

The eyeball is carefully excised, pressure of the globe being particularly avoided,
and placed between the soft clay ends of an ordinary pair of unpolarisable electrodes.
A black box with a hole and tube opposite the eye, a candle in a spring stand, wires
through the box to a galvanometer, and a sensitive plate to record the movements of
the galvanometric spot complete the apparatus.

The connections between eyeball and galvanometer are always such that the nerve
stump is to the N. terminal and the cornea to the 8. terminal. Normal current in
the eyeball is thus always upwards from nerve to cornea, northwards through the
