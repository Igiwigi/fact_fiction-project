Some view the notion of probabilistic prediction as too complex for the public to
understand. However, the public knows not only that a horse rated at 100-
against is less likely to win than a horse rated as 2-1 on, but also that the
latter is itself not a racing certainty to win. Hence they understand that if one
loses a thousand pounds betting on a horse rated as 2-1 on, there is little point
complaining to the bookies. Similarly, a forecast of 66 per cent chance of a ‘BBQ
summer’ does not guarantee that it will happen. So why did the Met Office come
in for such ridicule in the press, when making a probabilistic prediction for the
summer of 2009? Perhaps, it is the media rather than the public that does no
understand (or maybe chooses not to understand) these matters.

In fact, if the public were more exposed to weather prediction as inherently
probabilistic, perhaps there would be more acceptance of the simple fact tha‘
one’s view about the risk of dangerous climate change should not be framec
in the black and white terms of ‘belief’ and ‘scepticism’. For one thing, belief
should have no real role in science, and, in truth, all good scientists are inherently
sceptical people.

However, we can go further than this. Let us accept that we cannot be
certain whether or not anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases will lead
to unquestionably dangerous changes to climate in the next century. However,
consider the question: how probable would such dangerous climate change have
to be for it to warrant some mitigating action now, to limit anthropogenic
emissions? By ‘unquestionably dangerous’, we could mean the complete loss
of the Amazonian rainforest owing to shifting rain patterns, or of large parts
