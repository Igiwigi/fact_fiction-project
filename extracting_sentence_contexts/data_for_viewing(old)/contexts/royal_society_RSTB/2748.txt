the additional stimulus set up by sexual intercourse, ovulation can. occur during an
cestrus outside the normal sexual season.

Whether or not the relation between copulation and ovulation is the same for all
breeds, I have no means of knowing. But seeing that it can vary with circumstances
with one breed, it is possible that different breeds show different degrees of adjust-
ment in this respect. However this may be, the fact of the occurrence of spontaneous
ovulation during cestrus in sheep, belonging to some breeds at least, is of importance,
since it indicates the possibility of obtaining successful results by artificial insemina-
tion.

According to Hausmany’s description (1840) it would appear that sheep ovulate
normally as a. result of coition, but this conclusion may be due to the fact that
HavsMann’s observations were upon sheep which had been served before ovulating ;
and, as I have shown above, copulation not infrequently does occur prior to
ovulation.

Ovulation in other Mammals.—The rabbit, it would appear, is the only other animal
which is known to vary in regard to the stimulus necessary for ovulation. Mr. Heapr's
experiments (1897) show that in the virgin rabbit both copulation and the presence
of spermatozoa in the uterus may be essential, while the number of atretic follicles to
be observed in almost any rabbit’s ovaries renders it probable that it is not only
virgins which fail to ovulate spontaneously when “on heat.” FLEMMING (1885) states
that he found at least twenty degenerating follicles in each of the ovaries of two
virgin rabbits, and also records atretic follicles in an animal that had given birth to
