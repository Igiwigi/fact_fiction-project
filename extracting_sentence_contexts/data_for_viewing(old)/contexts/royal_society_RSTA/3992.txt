repeated freeze and thaw cycles. This approach was initially used to extract ocular metabolites but
obtained a low yield (approx. 800 significant features by XCMS) with significant contamination
from proteins. For this study, we developed an extraction approach that uses a cold (4°C) miscible
cocktail of methanol/chloroform/water /acetic acid at a 60:25: 14:1 ratio (cocktail mix). Manual
grinding and homogenization of the samples in the ‘cocktail mix’ yielded a substantial number
of metabolites that included both polar and non-polar species.

The utilization of methanol/chloroform at 60/25 was adapted from methods reported by
Folch et al. [19] and has been successfully used for decades to extract lipophilic molecules and
precipitate proteins. The addition of 1% acetic acid lowers the pH of the solvent to approximately
2 to inhibit the enzymes that catalyse metabolic reactions. Lastly, the water in the ‘cocktail mix’
(14%) was designed to enhance dissolution of polar and water-solvable metabolites (e.g. amino
acids). In fact, the data from the extracted BPCs revealed that the ‘cocktail mix’ approach was
more effective (yielding 6-300x higher sensitivity) and extracted more polar (retention time
(RT) <5 min) and non-polar (RT 20-60 min) species than the LN freeze and thaw method
(figure 1a). Very polar compounds, i.e. hypoxanthine (figure 1b) and phenylalanine (figure 1c)
that eluted at approximately 3-4 min under current LC conditions, were readily detectable using
both methods. However, the lipophilic species, including lysophosphatidylcholine (16 :0/0:0),
