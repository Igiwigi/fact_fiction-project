The approach adopted is also quite distinct from the auto-regression moving average
(ARMA) [8]. In the statistical microeconomics approach [1], an action functional (as well as the Lagrangian)—
consisting of the sum of a kinetic and a potential term—is postulated to exist in the market. The most important result of [2] is that an action functional does in fact exist in the market; the
existence of the action functional for multiple commodities has been empirically verified in [4]. Hence, for both single and multiple commodities, the formulation of statistical microeconomics
finds clear support from market prices. The microeconomic Lagrangian provides a self-contained
and comprehensive framework for the study of microeconomics.
