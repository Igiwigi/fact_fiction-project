Moreover, the linear span of the generalized eigenfunctions of Ap is dense in Ly.


As a by-product, we get that the spectrum of Ay is independent of p € (1, 00), but this follows
directly from the compactness of the resolvent. In [23, Section 4], it is also proved that all the
eigenvalues of AE have index 1 if and only if the matrix B is diagonalizable; 0 is a simple
eigenvalue and every eigenfunction is constant: in fact, if u € D(A) and A} u=0 then T(fu=u.
On the other hand

lim T(t)u =| udy,
t>00 RN

and therefore u is constant.

Let us come to the case p = 1. In this case, the spectrum of A) is the half-plane {Red < 0} and
all complex numbers 1 with Red <0 are eigenvalues. Moreover, all the eigenvalues associated
with polynomial eigenfunctions are the same for all p > 1. In all other cases, the eigenfunctions
in Ly are not polynomials. As a consequence, for p=1 the semigroup is neither compact or
differentiable, analytic, norm-continuous, e.g. [31, ch. II, §4] for a discussion on the relations
