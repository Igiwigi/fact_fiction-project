This variation of the specific
heat at constant pressure with pressure can be calculated by means of equation (7),
p. 387. In the case of steam, at a temperature of 104째5째 C., if S is expressed in
joules/gr. deg., and 1 cm. of mercury is taken as the unit of pressure dS/dp = 0째0013,
this means an increase in the value of S of 0째065 per cent. for an increase of pressure
of 1m. of mercury. Experimentally, the value of dS/dp is found to be about twice
as great as this, but, taking into consideration both the smallness of the correction
and the fact that the barometer only varied by about 2 cm, during any one series of
experiments under identical conditions, the agreement is very satisfactory. A pressure
