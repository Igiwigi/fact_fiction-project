AxrxoLD (op. cit.) states that they are derived from the Wolftian bodies by means
of a fissure, and that they have the same structure as these organs, a statement which
has not, however, been confirmed by any other author. VarexrixN and MeckeL
believed that the supra-renal bodies exist first as a single mass, which is placed
above and in front of the kidneys, and which afterwards divides itself into two
lateral halves; whilst J. Muller and Biscnore, on the contrary, state that they
have always observed them double, although no account of their origin kas been
given by them. Mr. T. Goops1r is the only author, as far as I am aware, who has
attempted to prove the close aflinity the ductless glands (excepting the spleen) have
to each other, by tracing out their gradual evolution in the embryo. He states that
all of them (excepting the spleen) arise in involuted portions of the membrana inter-
media, and that at an early period of embryonic life they communicate with one
another. He concludes from this apparent fact, their original identity of function,
which he says is that of elaborating a nutrient material, an office which the germinal
membrane itself performs during fcetal life.

The description that I shall now venture to offer, differs from any that has been
previously given of the evolution of this gland. I trust however that I may be able
to prove the close affinity that it has both with the spleen and also with the thyroid,
not 80 much from any resemblance that it may present in its manner of eyolution,
but from the similitude it presents in its elementary parts, and in the development
of those elements to their perfect form.

Between the sixth and seventh days of incubation, I observed that the Wolflian
bodies had become contracted in their length, and more curved upon themselves
