communities is in general motivated when research demands and political drivers necessitate
increases in: the cost of experiments (including human resources and instrumentation),
obligations due to more extensive governmental funding, requirements for interdisciplinary work
and increased specialization in technology. Funding structures evolve, not only as a reflection
of the structure of a research community and its development stage, but also in reaction to the
commercialization potential of a technology. Countries with active volcanoes are not numerous
but have obvious incentives to research these structures. Usually, government plays the most
important role in funding original innovation or basic research projects to protect citizens and
social infrastructure. However, countries without volcanoes are applying muography towards
the study of other objects.

Volcanoes are localized in the world region of the Pan Pacific (the so-called Ring of Fire) and
in the marginal point of the African and Eurasian continents. However, despite the fact that the
majority of the world’s countries are not directly affected by volcanic disasters, multinational
collaboration can be used in order to mitigate and analyse the disaster risks of these particular

regions. As countries are increasingly economically linked, it is within the interests of the
global community to minimize damage to countries at risk from economic disruption from
volcano disasters. For instance, the recent eruption of the Icelandic volcano (Eyjafjallajékull)
also had an adverse effect on the surrounding Northern European region when it disrupted
normal air traffic. In order to better research the process of eruptions and volcano formation,
the unique geological features of countries with active volcanoes can provide unique research
