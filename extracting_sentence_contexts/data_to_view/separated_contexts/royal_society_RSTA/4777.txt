ยง18. After what was said in the preceding paragraph, it will be clear that,
when lim s,(s) exists as a finite number at a point of the open interval (0; 7), all

a>o

the canonical Sturm-Liouville series corresponding to f(s) converge at this point, and
have the value of this limit for their common sum. We may employ this fact to
obtain conditions under which these series converge. Let (s), the bilateral limit of f(s) at the point s, exist as a finite number. In
virtue of (35), it is easily seen that
