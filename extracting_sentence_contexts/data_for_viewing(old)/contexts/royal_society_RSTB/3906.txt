Similar, though more conspicuous, changes are seen over the inferior cava when
the vagus is stimulated, under certain conditions which are described at a later stage.

We interpret these facts as evidences that what we term the intrinsic deflections
signal the arrival of the excitatory process at the proximal contact, this process
travelling along a straight path; and that the ewtrinsic deflections are records of
currents finding their way to the electrodes by different paths.

Further observations confirm and extend this view. Twin contacts are placed
upon the body of the right auricle and the corresponding deflections are recorded ;
the tissue beneath the contacts is then crushed by means of a clamp, which leaves
endocardium and pericardium intact ; curves taken subsequently from the same contact
points show conspicuous differences. While the extrinsic deflection maintains its
time of onset with great constancy (Table V, Part 1), the intrinsic deflection is either
abolished, or, being much reduced in size, the time of its onset is altered. This
experiment necessitates damage to the tissue beneath the contacts, and also moving
