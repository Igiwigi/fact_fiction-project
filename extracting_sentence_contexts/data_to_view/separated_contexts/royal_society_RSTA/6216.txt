Ogden’s model (1.1)
hence belongs to the group of Valanis—Landel-type materials. The argument of simplicity may have lost significance relative to the argument of robust
numerical implementation with the advent of computational finite element techniques. In fact, it
is well known that the computation of derivatives of the eigenvalues with respect to strain tensors
and thus the determination of tangent tensors pose their own challenges under generic non-
homogeneous loading conditions when the principal stretches change order and travel through
coalescing values. However, algorithmic solutions (see e.g. [8], §5.6), closed-form expressions for
the tangent tensors [9-12] and invariant-based reformulations [13,14] or approximations [15] have
helped to overcome these problems so that Ogden’s model can efficiently be used with finite
elements and is available in various software packages for mechanical analysis. In addition to the advantage of compact mathematical form, the use of principal stretches in
general and the Valanis—Landel hypothesis in particular allows an interpretation of the model
in terms of the molecular statistical theory of rubber elasticity, which was not in the scope of the
developments by Ogden [1].
