It is also important to investigate the region near the critical
potential so as to determine whether a type XY peak occurs. The reliability of the theory may depend on the azimuthal quantum numbers of the con-
nected levels and in particular on whether the transition is optically allowed or forbidden
(cf. § 2-1-3). In this connexion attention may be drawn to the fact that, though the 13
transition is a combination of 128325, 12S—+32P and 12S->32D, the calculated con-
tribution from 12S 3?P is considerably larger than that from the others; for example, at the
maximum it is about 5 times that from 12$—> 325 and about 10 times that from 1 2S—> 32D. This adds to the significance of the comparison made in figure 2a, since the agreement shown
suggests that the Born approximation yields accurate results for the dominant optically
allowed transition. Such a conclusion must, however, be treated with reserve, as it is contrary
to a general rule indicated by the bulk of the evidence to be presented.

+ Actually though the gradient of the mercury curve diminishes markedly at moderate energies it does
not vanish.
