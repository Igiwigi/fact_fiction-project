28, December). The Axp.-line showed
in April an average length of cells of 147 (D cells) and 93-5, (H cells) respectively,
slightly higher values than those of line A at the same time (fig. 28); in August it was
distinctly smaller than in April. All these facts show that there is no correlation between changes in the length and
the progressive decrease of the breadth of Ditylum. Whereas the decrease of the
diameter is determined by the structure and division process peculiar to the diatoms
there apparently exist environmental factors affecting the extent of the individual
growth in length of cells. From the slopes of the curves of fig.
