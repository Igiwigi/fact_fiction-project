direction as before, but far more powerfully. Yet it is evident that the parts
of the magnet from the equator to the pole were out of the electric circuit.

228. Then the wire A was connected with the mercury on the extremity of
the magnet, the wire B till remaining in contact with that in the jar (fig. 36.),
80 that the copper axis was altogether out of the circuit. 'The magnet was
again reyolyed screw fashion, and again caused the same deflection of the
needle, the current being as strong as it was in the last trial (227.), and much
stronger than at first (226.).

229. Hence it is evident that there is no discharge of the current at the
centre of the magnet, for the current, now freely eyolyed, is up through the
magnet ; but in the first experiment (226.), it was down. In fact, at that time,
it was only the part of the moving metal equal to a little dise extending from
the end of the wire B in the mercury to the wire A that was efficient, i. e.
moving with a different angular velocity to the rest of the circuit (258.); and
for that portion the direction of the current is consistent with the other results.

230. In the two after experiments, the /ateral parts of the magnet or of the
copper rod are those which move relative to the other parts of the circuit, i. e.
the galvanometer wires ; and being more extensive, intersecting more curves;
or moving with more velocity, produce the greater effect. For the discal part,
the direction of the induced electric current is the same in all, namely, from
the circumference towards the centre.
