5. In illustration of some of these principles, and as a help towards the realization of
i validity of some parts of the subsequent analysis, a dynamical question of sufli-
ent complexity, which has recently occupied the attention of several mathematicians,
y be briefly referred to. The problem of the deformation and vibrations of a thin
en shell of elastic material has been reduced to mathematical analysis by Lord

pear in the energy-function from which its vibrations in which bending plays a pro-
nent part are to be determined,—that in fact the shell might be treated as inexten-
le. But a subsequent direct analysis of the problem, of a more minute character,t
to the result that the conditions at the boundary of the shell could not all be
sfied unless stretching is taken into account. The reason of the discrepancy is
