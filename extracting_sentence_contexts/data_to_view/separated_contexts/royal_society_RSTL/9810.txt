men (se Plate 85, fig. 6), is the disposition of the large vessels in two rings :â€”(1) They,
to a great measure, surround the follicle, more 80, usually, than in Plate 85, fig. 6;
and (2) form nearly a complete circle on the margin of the medullary portion of the

or just on its borders. This disposition of the vessels is true of all cases where the
follicle is polygonal, and contains one medullary centre.
