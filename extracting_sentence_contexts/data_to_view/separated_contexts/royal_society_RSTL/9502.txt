lowest number considerably above the corresponding numbers furnished by
R. L. G. powder. But the mean and the lowest proportions of $sulphate furnished by
F. G. is very considerably higher than the corresponding numbers obtained with the
two other powders (the highest amounts obtained with F. G. and R. L. G. being
identical). The generally greater extent to which the sulphur has undergone complete oxidation
in the case of the F. G. powder is certainly not a result which can be in the least
ascribable to accidental cireumstances attending the experiments, and the fact that. ib
corresponds with the generally higher proportions of hyposulphite furnished by this
powder affords additional support to the view which we maintain, that the production
of the latter substance, in variable, and sometimes very considerable amounts from ;
the powders experimented with, is not to be explained away by ascribing ib to accident
of manipulation. 3.
