investigation, quite apart from any question of leaf-displacement. I therefore made
measurements along reputedly sympodial axes, namely, the floriferous stems of
Myposotis sylvestris and Petunia hybrida, and the tendrilliferous axis of Ampelopsis
hederacea.

In regard to Petunia and Myosotis, the results were disappointing, in that the
curves showed that the graphic method is not competent to distinguish between a
monopodial and a sympodial axis. The statistics dealing with the matter are given
on pp. 79 and 81, while Curves 13, 16, and 17 record the results graphically. It may,
however, be pointed out that the curves would definitely harmonise with the view that
the inflorescence axis in each case represents a cicinnus with the branch on the same
side constantly strengthened ; and this result is not without interest. But apart from
the fact that other interpretations are quite possible (such as leaf-displacements) it is
probable that the longitudinal symmetry of inflorescences is, at least, often of a kind
different from that of vegetative axes.

Ampelopsis hederacea. (Curves 25, 26.)

The construction of internode-curves of this species gave more satisfactory positive
results.
Along the stem the leaves are arranged alternately, and tendrils are inserted

opposite to the leaves in such a manner that two tendrilliferous nodes are succeeded by
one node without a tendril,
