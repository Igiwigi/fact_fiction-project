yet there seems to be no doubt that while it remains dissolved
it is entirely in the state of calx. Its precipitation in the me-
tallic state is occasioned by the nitre contained in the solution,
which having lost part of its oxygen by heat, appears to be
capable of attracting it from the calx of gold; for I found that if
the calx of gold is dissolved by being boiled in caustic alkali,
and a sufficient quantity of nitre which has lost some of its air q
by heat is mixed with it, the gold is precipitated by an acid in |
its metallic state.*

* As the precipitation of gold in its metallic form, by nitre which has lost some of
its oxygen has not, I believe, been noticed, it may not be improper to mention some
of those facts relating to it which scem most entitled to attention. Nitre which has
been heated some time precipitates gold in its metallic state from a solution in aqua
regia, if it is diluted with. water, , If a solution of gold in nitrous acid-is dropped into
Pure water, the calx of gold is separated, which is of a yellow colour ; but if the wa-
ter contains a very small proportion of nitre which has lost some of its air by heat (as
one grain in $ix ounces), the gold is deprived of its oxygen, and becomes blue. The



MWitre upon Gold and Platina. 221

Having found that nitre would dissolve gold, I tried whether
it would produce any effect upon platina.
