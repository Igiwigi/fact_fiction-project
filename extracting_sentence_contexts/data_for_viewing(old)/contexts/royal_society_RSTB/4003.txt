On the buccal membrane there are some small thin but distinct plates which do
not lie very close together. There are no spines on the buccal plates.

The colour of the test is not so pronounced as in the pure-bred £. miliaris of the
same size. There is a dark greenish tint on the median line of each series of plates,
the outer and inner portion remaining more or less white. On each apical plate
there is a green spot. The spines are greenish at the base, assuming a pinkish tint
towards the tip. ‘The secondary spines are white at the tip. The tube-feet are pink,
the colour being arranged in rings on those of the oral surface.

The pedicellarie. While the ophicephalous pedicellarie present no features worthy
of special interest, as might be expected from the fact that in both parent species
they are very much alike, the other pedicellarixe present some characters of
importance, The tridentate pedicellariz are long and slender as in EZ, acutus, and

the triphyllous pedicellarize are likewise of the sort characteristic of this species.
The most important, however, are the globiferous pedicellarize, which are exactly
intermediate in structure between those of H. miliaris and E. acutus. There are
some teeth along the side edges of the end part of the valve (the blade) as in
Li, miliaris, though there are not quite so many as in this species. The end portion
of the valve forms an open furrow, which, however, is much narrower than in
