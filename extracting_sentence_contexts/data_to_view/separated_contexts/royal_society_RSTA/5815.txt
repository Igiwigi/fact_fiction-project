But they can become active due to peers’ influence. As discussed in
[11,14], active agents may gradually lose their interests in the discussion and drop out of it, which
is related to our above Rule 1. In addition, our above Rule 2 is based on the fact that only active
agents participate in the opinion dynamics. Finally, as also discussed in [11,14], active agents can
motivate their inactive like-minded peers. If an inert agent holds the same opinion of an active
neighbour and they have a positive interaction (with takes place with probability 1 — p), then the
inert agent is driven to be active with probability (1 — p)g.
