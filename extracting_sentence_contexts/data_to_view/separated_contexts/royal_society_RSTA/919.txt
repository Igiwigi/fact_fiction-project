Whereas, even with incorrect physics, it is possible to match features of the
observations, capturing the appropriate statistical properties should provide important litmus
tests for models. Our method is agnostic with regard to the number of crossover time scales, and
hence associated processes, that may be present in the system. Therefore, we hope that the fact
that we capture both the shortest and longest observed processes in the ice pack will provide a
useful and robust test bed for modelling studies. Data accessibility. This article has no additional data.
