In the case of agricultural production for sale, without restoration by manure from
external sources, a very important condition of the maintenance of the amount of
nitrogen in the surface soil, or of the diminished exhaustion of it, is the growth of
plants of various range and character of roots, and especially of leguminous crops. Such plants, by their crop-residue, enrich the surface soil in nitrogen. It is, as a rule,
those of the most powerful root-development that take up the most nitrogen from
somewhere; and this fact points to a subsoil source. But independently of this,
which obviously might be held to be only evidence of the necessity of obtaining water
and mineral matters from below, in amount commensurate with the capability of
aequiring nitrogen from the air, the experimental results recorded in this paper can
leave little doubt that such plants obtain at any rate much of their nitrogen from the
subsoil. The question remainsâ€”whether or not the whole of it is derived from the
soil and subsoil?
