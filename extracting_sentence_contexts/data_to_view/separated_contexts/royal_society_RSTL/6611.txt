But the systems of equations in question are of a peculiar '
form. They admit, in consequence of this, of a peculiar analysis. And Jacopr's methods
of solving them are in fact different from the one given by me, though connected with
it by remarkable relations. He does indeed refer to the general problem of the solution j
of simultaneous partial differential equations, and this in language which does not even |
