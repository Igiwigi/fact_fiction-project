4. Coarse graining of rapid relaxation process, and ET? theories as principal
subsystems of ET? theory

Let us study the case where the relaxation time t is of several orders larger than the relaxation
time Tp¢ ((a, 6, c) = (V,K + U,R), (R, K + U, V),(K + U,R, V)). In sucha case, the composite system
of b-mode and ¢-mode quickly reaches a state with the common temperature 6°+. If fact, in the
limit t5 > 0, the equation of 5 disappears and we obtain a six-field theory, namely, ET?. Therefore,
