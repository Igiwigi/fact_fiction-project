in one instant, which no current of lava could accomplish, it would not have supplied
such a volume of water. He came therefore to the somewhat startling conclusion, that
the water was vyomited forth by the crater itself, and was driven out from some reservoir
in the interior of Etna*,

It seems to me very unlikely that the Canon, who was on the ground within three
months of the date of the catastrophe, should have been mistaken in regard to the region
of the mountain whence the waters came. His conclusions on that head seem to have
been legitimately deduced from the fact, that the wreck of the inundation was traceable

Sontinuously from the sea-shore at Riposto up to the highest cone or its neighbourhood. T am therefore inclined to suspect that at the time of the eruption of 1755 there was
