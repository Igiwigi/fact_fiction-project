The consequence is that the
normal velocity and pressure are continuous across the interface, while the tangential velocity
at the interface is discontinuous. The result is artificial local vorticity on the viscous flow side
of the intersection. The latter fact was also observed by Greco et al. [24] in their studies with a
domain decomposition method involving linear potential flow and the Navier-Stokes equations. Figure 9a illustrates that, during forced roll oscillation, we observed artificial vorticity at the
viscous flow side of the horizontal part of the intersection. However, for the nonlinear hybrid
method, the advection terms in the Navier-Stokes equations are communicated with the potential
flow domain (figure 9c).
