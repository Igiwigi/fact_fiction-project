In the past, Method II was not formulated for multi-oscillator systems except for oscillatory
reaction—diffusion systems; space-discrete systems such as networks and populations of
oscillators were carefully avoided [7]. In discrete systems, the pair coupling, which has to be
treated as a perturbation, depends on the two-state vectors of the coupled pair like V(X, X’). This
fact seemed to make it difficult to treat the problem formally as a one-oscillator problem. As we
see later in this section, this seeming difficulty can be circumvented easily. However, before going
into this problem, we begin with an easier case to treat, because the formulation is almost the
same as for discrete systems except for one essential point.

The following example may be practically uninteresting but seems quite instructive for
illustrating the general structure of the theory. Suppose that the perturbation P(t) is simply given
by a function only of X of the oscillator of concern. This means that the nature of the oscillator
has been slightly changed. By putting P(t) = «5F(X), where 5F(X) represents the change in the
oscillator dynamics, the equation to be reduced is given by

X = F(X) + €dF(X). (3.18)
