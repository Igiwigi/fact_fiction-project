A familiar demonstration is to place a leaf between
two plates of glass, when the glass in contact with the stomatal surface becomes
dewed with moisture, while the other plate remains dry. In 1878 Mercert invented
a refinement of this method; he used paper impregnated with certain salts of
palladium and mercury, which assume a dark brown or black colour when moistened. In a hypostomatal§ leaf the paper in contact with the lower surface of leaf changes
colour, while that on the astomatal upper surface retains its original tint or, at most,
shows a change which is insignificant in comparison with the effect produced by the
stomatal side.

* The fact that Uncrr (62) (p. 335) did not find the stomata open at 5 a.m. in June is, according
to my experience, clear evidence of the faultiness of the microscopic method.

§ The term hypostomatal implies that all the stomata are on the lower surface; amphistomatal may
be used for leaves having stomata on both sides, and epistomatal for the rarer cases in which all
are above,

Mercer's method has never come into general use, and to Srann* is due the
credit of having introduced an easily applicable method of a similar sort, and of
having shown that it may be employed as a valuable means of investigation. STaHn
uses filter paper soaked in a solution of cobalt chloride (1 to 5 per cent.).
