Their disagreement was more over the question of whether evolution had a
direction or whether variation was random. Historically, we would do better
to recognize Lamarck as the inventor of the term ‘biology’ as a separate
science, and as championing the idea that species change (transformationism).
Darwin can then be seen as discovering one of the mechanisms in his theory
of natural selection, involved not only in transformations but also in the origin
of species.

The problem with both revisions of Darwinism is that they involve a version of
genetics that we need to revise. This version was one in which the central dogma
of biology was taken to mean that the genetic material is never modified by the
rest of the organism and the environment. Francis Crick’s original statements of
the ‘central dogma of molecular biology’ (Crick 1958, 1970) do not in fact make
such a strong claim. He stated a more limited chemical fact: that DNA sequences
are used as templates to make proteins, but proteins are not used as reverse
templates to make DNA. So, even if its proteins were to become modified during
the lifetime of an individual, that modification cannot be inherited. The ‘dogma’
was then interpreted by many biologists to mean that information flows only one
way. As we have seen, it does not. The quantities of proteins synthesized count
as relevant information just as much as their amino acid sequences. But those
quantities are most certainly dependent on signals from the rest of the system

hrough the levels of transcription factors (including proteins and RNA) and the

epigenetic marking of DNA itself and of the histone tails. All of this is open to
