not maintained. All internal leads are undertaken as the final observations of a given
experiment. Most of our readings have been taken from the lining of the free wall
of the right ventricle, and these are the only observations which we regard with
entire confidence. In studying this region with a rigid curved electrode the thin
muscular wall may be lifted a little on the contact, so that it bulges externally and so
that the contact may be easily felt through the wall and its exact position ascertained
and maintained. In the circumstances there is no uncertainty, the contact is known
to be satisfactory. But when we attempt to obtain readings from the septum on the

that the rate of propagation in the system is very rapid. When an idio-ventricular rhythm dominates
the movements of the ventricle and premature contractions are forced from the ventricle, the length
of the returning cycle (see first article) is little if at all longer than an initial or natural cycle. This
fact has never received adequate explanation, It now seems that the time lost by the excitation wave
in travelling from the point stimulated to the rhythm centre in the auriculo-yentricular bundle would
not be appreciable. If the natural ventricular cycle has a duration of a second or more, an addition of
two or three hundredths of a second would pass unnoticed.

accurate location is almost impossible.*

The power of the left ventricle is so great and the wall so rigid that the electrode may
