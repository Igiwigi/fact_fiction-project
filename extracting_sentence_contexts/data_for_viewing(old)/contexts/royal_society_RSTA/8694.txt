tartrates, does not appear to have been examined by Bror. The rotatory dispersion in
tartar emetic was measured, apparently for the first time, in 1872 by Krecxe (* Arch.
Néerland., 1872, vol. 7, p. 114), who observed a very close agreement with the require-
ments of Brot’s law. Thus he gives for [«] \* the following numbers :—

He calls attention to the fact that “ the specific rotatory power of tartar emetic is
extraordinarily great, and diminishes with rise of temperature,” and includes this salt in
his general statement that “ the tartrates examined follow the law of Bror.”* Even more
interesting than the high rotatory power of the salt is the fact discovered by GRossMANN
(‘ Zeitschr. Physikal. Chem.,’ 1907, vol. 57, pp. 583-556) that when sodium hydroxide is
added, the specific rotation of the salt assumes a large negative value, probably because
“in the alkaline solution an antimony alkali tartrate is present, in which the hydrogen
atoms of the alcoholic hydroxyl groups are also displaced.”

Our own experiments give no support to Kreckn’s view that tartar emetic obeys
Bror’s law. Thus the first preliminary series of observations gave for the product
[M]? values which increased progressively from 156-17 at wave-length 6708 to 203-85
at wave-length 3917. But a “ simple ” dispersion formula [M] = 140-67/(\*—0-0477),
based upon the readings for the two dominant mercury lines, showed an agreement that
was very satisfactory, especially in view of the fact that the observed rotations had been
multiplied by nearly 12 to convert them into molecular rotations. Moreover, the
