required a very strong current to produce any effect, the movements produced were
leg movements (once hallux in one case), sometimes no effect could be obtained, even
with a strong current ; as often as not movements of the leg of the same side were
observed. In the case where the section of the cord was made at the level of the
third cervical, no movements could be obtained except shoulder movements.

The extent of the lesions and the resulting degenerations are represented in
Plates 1, 2, and 3.


THE SPINAL CORD IN MONKRYS. 23

After careful examination of the spinal cords, especially of Case III., facts were
elicited with regard to degeneration, which in the main confirm those of previous
observers, Stvcrr,* Homién,t and Tooru.t

Case III. was the most complete hemisection in which the injury was limited to
one side (vide 4 and 5, Plate 1), A very small portion of the posterior median
column alone has remained, and this is in great measure degenerated. Plate %
illustrates this lesion, and the resulting ascending and descending degenerations.

The comma-shaped degeneration, visible to the naked eye in the posterior column, on
the side of the lesion, for 0°5 centim. below the lesion (vide Plate 2, No. 20, and Plate 4,
fig. 10), can be traced down for about 2 centims., the degenerated fibres gradually
becoming less and disappearing altogether. I examined a large number of sections,
