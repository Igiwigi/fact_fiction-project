& It has been argued by ScuRoTrER, REDTENBACHER, and SCHNEIDER in their official
-Seport upon Von Lexx's gun-cotton, that an incomplete conversion of cellulose into the
Snot explosive gun-cotton may be one canse of the want of stability observed in the
Aarly products of manufacture (at Bonchet, &c.); and consequently the existence in
-Zun-cotton of a proportion of the third class of impurities above specified should, accord-
Jng to these chemists, give rise to, or promote a tendency to spontaneous change in the
Jnaterial. On the other hand, PfLovze and Maury consider it probable that a gun-cotton
Svill be the more liable to spontaneous change the further it is removed in composition
om the cellulose type, and that products prepared by prolonged immersion in large
"Proportions of yery concentrated acids will therefore be more liable to spontaneous
ition than the gun-cotton prepared by a brief immersion in less concentrated acids.
—No experimental data are given in support of either opinion.
S The discordant results furnished by the heat-experiments just described, and the facts
eestablished by investigating the composition of the gun-cotton operated upon, led to the
Sinstitution of a very considerable number of experiments with the view of ascertaining,
if possible, whether the establishment of change in gun-cotton by its exposure to high
temperatures has to be ascribed to the instability of trinitrocellulose itself, or whether
it is to any extent ascribable to the injurious influence of less permanent bodies existing
as impurities in the ordinary product of manufacture.

A careful comparative examination was instituted of the effects of exposure, under
equal conditions, to 100® C. upon a number of samples in portions of which the matters
Soluble in ether and alcohol had been determined. One gramme of each sample was
first dried in a water-bath at a temperature of 50? C.; it was then introduced loosely
into a small flask having a neck about 220 millims. in length, and immersed in boiling
