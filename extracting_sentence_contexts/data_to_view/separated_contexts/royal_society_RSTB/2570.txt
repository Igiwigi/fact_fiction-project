During one growth-period some five or six lamine are laid down
by both of the invaginated flaps, and the septal segment has a thickness of
10 or 12 calcareous lamine.

(2.) A second period of growth finds the same septal segment no longer at the
edge of the invagination, but moved as it were one tier below the edge. Deposit goes on less actively, granulations become more marked. The calico-
blasts are, in fact, developed more fully at some parts of the invaginated flaps
than at others, and the lamina bulges out at those parts,

(3.) A third period follows in which local activity is still more pronounced, a fourth
and fifth period follows, and then, as a rule, the soft body-wall is withdrawn
from the particular segment owing to the upward growth of the polyp. The
primary septa in an Astrasid usually has a large number of calcareous lamin,
from 25 to 35 on either side of the median plane of the polyp. The septa of
the smaller cycles have few laminze, from 5 to 15 on an average.
