218 ON DETERMINATIONS OF THE ABSOLUTE VALUE, SECULAR CHANGE,

mum, in the same hemisphere, was determined a few years earlier (1828 and 1829),
by the expedition of MM. HansrTeen, Erman and Dus ; and we may gather the result
from the following passage in M. Erman's © Reise um die Erde, which I quote from
Mr. Coorey's translation, vol. ii. p. 365 :—© The magnetical results of the last jour-
ney were now examined more narrowly, and it was clear that we had in fact crossed
the meridian of the Siberian magnetic pole between Irkutsk and Yakutsk. The mag-
netic attraction of the earth was decidedly greater between Kirensk and Beresovoi
Ostrov than at any other point which we had visited in the same parallel of latitude
to the east or west. The pole songht for had there exhibited its greatest force, and
extended its influence furthest to the south ; and consequently we must have been
there on the same meridian with it. This probably took place at Parshinsk in
longitude 111* 27' E.*.” Omitting the consideration of the small amount of secular
change which may have taken place between the expedition of MM. HaxsTzex,
Erman and Dus and that of Captain Lzrroy, we have here an interval of (270*
—111*=)159* as the approximate difference of longitude (on the side of Behring's
Straits and the adjacent continents) between the two northern centres. This differ-
ence is diminishing by the effect of secular change, and the epoch, when the centres
