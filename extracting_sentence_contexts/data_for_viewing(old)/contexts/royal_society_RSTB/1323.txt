In the following year, 1880, Munrer-Cuatmas (24) stated as the result of the
investigations of four fossil species of Nummulites and two of the allied genus Asszlina,
his conclusion that these species were dimorphic, and that probably the phenomenon
of dimorphism was general. This conclusion was based on the fact that Nummulites
occurring in the same strata, and having identical external characters, fall into two
groups. These differ from one another, first, in the size of the whole disc ; second in
the size of the central chamber. On breaking them open it is found that the small
ones have a large central chamber, and the large ones a small central chamber.
Intermediate forms, it was stated, do not occur. Although the superficial markings
are alike in the two forms, they had hitherto been reckoned as distinct species.

Relying on the fact that only large examples of the forms with small central
chambers had been found, Munrer-Cuanmas concluded that each species consisted of
two sets of individuals; first, those with a large central chamber, which attained a_
small size, and whose development was arrested at this stage ; second, those in which ]
the size was increased by the addition of chambers at the end of the spiral, while the
large central chamber was replaced by a prolongation of the spire of chambers to the
centre of the shell.

 pâ€™Arcutac and Hare (1) had described the two kinds of arrangement of the central
chambers in this family, and pointed out the corresponding difference in the size of
