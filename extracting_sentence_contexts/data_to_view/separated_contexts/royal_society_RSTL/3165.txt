The solution was gradually
evaporated to dryness, and the dry salt treated with an additional quantity of acid
until decomposition was no longer evident. The resulting salt was then carefully
examined, and it was found to be pure chloride of potassium. This experiment was
repeated several times, and all the results concurred in satisfactorily establishing the
fact, that nitrate of potassa may be perfectly converted into chloride of potassinm,
provided a sufficient quantity of the acid be employed, and the temperature neces-
sary to effect the decomposition be properly regulated.

2. So far the decomposition was admirably adapted for the object mentioned at
the commencement. The usual impurities, such as chlorides, sulphates, silica, &c.
which any sample of crude saltpetre might contain, would obviously remain un-
changed, while the nitrate of potassa alone suffering decomposition, its quantity
could easily be ascertained, by comparing the weight of the resulting salt with that
obtained from a known quantity of absolutely pure nitrate.
