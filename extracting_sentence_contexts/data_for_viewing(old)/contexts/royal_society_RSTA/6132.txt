that is, the averages of the Lagrange parameters are in fact given by averages that can be extracted
from the MSA directly. Equations (3.16) and (3.17) imply that there is a relationship between the
energy contribution to a site (h;) and the entropy H(i) of that site, and it is precisely the relationship
that is summarized by the thermodynamical Helmholtz free-energy relation

Q=E-TS, (3.18)

where 2 = — log Z is the free energy, E is the average energy and S is the Gibbs entropy (T, of
course, is the temperature). We will see below that not only are the averages related in this manner,
but the parameters of the Potts model are given entirely by quantities that can be extracted directly
from the MSA, without the need of any optimization, namely:

i(sq) = Mo? (3.19)
