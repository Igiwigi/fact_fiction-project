MOIR: THE TRANSITION FROM ROSTRO-CARINATE FLINT IMPLEMENTS

refractory and peculiar material like flint is seldom attained. Though, therefore, in
the diagram mentioned (fig. 6) the author has shown the second cutting edge at C to
be immediately under the keel at A he does not wish to convey the impression that’
such accuracy was often attained by the ancient flakers of flint. As a matter of fact
the point C may be lecated almost anywhere along the line B—D, and the truth of
this statement will become manifest in the implements now to be described.

6. The Ipswich Transitional Specimen (Plate 56, figs. 1-4). This Ipswich specimen, though a very early palolithic, river-drift implement,
possessing two cutting edges, presents certain characteristics strongly reminiscent of
the rostro-carinate form.
