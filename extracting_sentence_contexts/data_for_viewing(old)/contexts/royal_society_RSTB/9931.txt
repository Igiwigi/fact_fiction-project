thoughts about her baby [73]. But motherhood is not the only
substantial change that females experience. Female rodents
experience stages of life similar to perimenopause and meno-
pause in women, during which their responses to learning
and stress can change rather dramatically [26,74]. Obviously,
women in perimenopause experience substantial changes as
they transition into a stage of life associated with reproduc-
tive senescence [75]. These examples notwithstanding, I am
not suggesting that researchers investigate all stages of
female life in laboratory studies or that we only study non-
virgins, but rather that we simply appreciate the dynamic
nature of the female brain. Ultimately, we must accept the
fact that the female brain (as the male brain) is always chan-
ging and it is these processes of change that we may want to
understand.
