figures and from Funtnskt’s (1908) work it is seen that ectodermal and mesodermal
teloblasts are present also in Astacus and lie partly in the anterior blastoporal lip. Thus
a close similarity exists between the methods of closure of the blastopore in the three
types. Hemimysis closely resembles Leander, but is remarkable in the late completion
of the process due to the prolonged formation of endoderm.

The relation of the blastopore to the anus in the Malacostraca has often been considered.
The relative positions of the two structures cannot be determined with accuracy since
the blastopore may be a vague area and is obliterated before the anus appears. In the
Decapoda most authors have considered the anus to develop just anterior to the site of
the blastopore, but Sottaup (1923, p. 109) suggests that in reality the anus when it
first appears occupies a position corresponding to the posterior part of the blastopore.
A similar interpretation can be placed on the facts in Hemimysis. ‘The anus pushes in
behind the level of the teloblasts, and so it must be considered to be situated either over
the posterior part of the blastopore or just behind it.

In Hemimysis, when gastrulation begins, the dorsal surface of the body is far more
extensive than the ventral, which comprises only the V-shaped germinal band. Growth
in length of the embryo takes place entirely by the growth backwards of the anterior
ventral lip of the blastopore, interstitial growth, of course, occurring later throughout.
The ventral lip of the blastopore behaves here just as does the dorsal posterior lip of the
blastopore in the vertebrate embryo.

The formation of mesodermal and ectodermal teloblasts in the region of the anterior
blastoporal lip must be general in the Decapoda and Peracarida. ‘The ectodermal telo-
