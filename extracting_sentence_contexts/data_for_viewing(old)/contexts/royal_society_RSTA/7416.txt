for a sufficient period during the initial stages of flight. A more detailed discussion of this
is given in § 6-1. See also § 3-518.

3-63. Assumptions C

These assumptions are made in § 6 in order to simplify the solution of the equations as
far as possible. They refer to quantities defined in §§4 and 5, and are additional to the
Assumptions A and B.

Cl. The acceleration is constant between launch and burnt.

It is not necessary to assume that fis constant while the projectile is on the projector, and
this will in fact be the period when the greatest variation in f occurs.

C2. The following quantities may be neglected:

K, %, B-B,, B-Boy wo.
It follows from Assumptions B3 and C2 that n? (= —v?) and f are constant, and that a,
may be neglected.
