posterior portion formed by the occipital ring, is formed by the auditory capsules. This
statement, however, does not apply to the upper part of the wall, for running back from
the paries nasi (p.n.), and indistinguishably fusing with the flap of cartilage above
the canalicular portion of the auditory capsule (pars v.), is a thin wall of cartilage
forming, for the whole length of the cranium, the supports of its membranous roof.

444 MISS P. C. ESDAILE ON THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF

Hitherto this has been called the orbitosphenoidal cartilage, but bearing in mind its
great extent, and the fact that only a small portion of it will eventually be ossified
to form the orbitosphenoid bone, GAuprâ€™s system (19) of assigning different names
to the different portions of it seems preferable. Hence, following Gaupp, four
regions will be distinguished, namely, in front the portion which unites with the
paries nasi will be called the commisswra spheno-ethmoidalis (figs. 4 and 5, c.s.e),-
behind this the portion giving off the downwardly projecting processus orbitonasalis
(pro.n.o.) is named the ala orbitalis (a.0.) ; posterior to this is the commissura orbito-
parietalis (c.o.p.), connecting the ala orbitalis with the lamina supracapsularis (1.s.),
the posterior portion of the bar which unites with the dorsal edge of the auditory
capsules. It should be emphasised that the lamina supracapsularis does not fuse
with the pars lateralis, but is still separated therefrom by a suture. This is readily
seen in the sections but does not show very obviously in the model, as the suture is
inconspicuous. However, in the latter stages the lamina merges imperceptibly into
