styles it) is the thing first formed, and that the prisms are at a later stage of the
process fused together by an at first semi-fluid material, which runs in between
them ; whereas the illustrations which accompany this paper would indicate that the
interstitial substance and the peripheries of the prisms are the first things to be formed.

And whilst I admire the beauty of his specimens and of the photographs which
illustrate his paper, I cannot help thinking that if he had had Marsupial enamel under
observation, he would have drawn somewhat different conclusions as to the develop-
ment of enamel generally.*

The view that enamel formation essentially consists in the centripetal calcification
of preformed fibres, is applicable to all enamels, and serves to render intelligible many
facts that were otherwise difficult to understand. Tomes’ processes and the existence
of a thin sheet of young enamel, which was perforated, have long been recognised

* Mr. Leon Wituiams (14, i.) writes: “If we look closely at the last layer of developing enamel
shown at d, we shall see that it contains a row of globular bodies of very regular and uniform size.
These are manifestly identical with those seen along the edges of the enamel in the acid-treated speci-
mens shown in figs. 33 and 35 of this paper. They are quite distinct from the masses of calcoglobulin,
such as are seen at C, in fig. 38. In fact, they are often, I may say generally, obscured by the melting
together of the large irregular masses. The enamel rods are built up by the successive, rhythmical
orderly deposit of these bodies of uniform size, which I shall henceforth denominate the enamel globules.
The larger, more transparent, and irregularly sized bodies of caleoglobulin melt or flow together to form
the interprismatic substance ”(p. 36).
