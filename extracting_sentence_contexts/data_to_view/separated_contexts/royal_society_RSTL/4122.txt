When the current
increased, the magnetization of the bismuth increased also, but so did the force which
held the magnets in their position of equilibrium. To remove them from this posi-
tion, a greater amount of force was necessary than when only the residual action of a
feeble current held them there. 'This fact, coupled with the circumstance that less
heat was developed, and less disturbance caused by air currents, when a feeble bat-
tery was used, induced me for some time to experiment with a battery of two cells. Subsequent experience however enabled me to change this for five cells with advan-
tage. Notwithstanding the improbability of the argument, still it may be urged that
these experiments do not prove beyond a doubt that the bismuth cylinders produce
the motion of the magnets in virtue of their excitement by the voltaic current ; for it
is not certain that these cylinders would not produce the same motion wholly inde-
pendent of the current.
