71. It would be mere waste of time to recount the almost numberless experiments
on particular preparations of paper made with this apparatus, especially as they lead
to no general laws. At the same time, a number of interesting facts have been en-
countered in particular cases ; and we are led to form a very high idea of the vastness
of this new field of inquiry, and the extensive bearings and connexions of any theory
which $hall give a rational account of these complex phenomena, from the way in
which these facts, s0 various and s0 remarkable each in itself, stand insulated from
one another. .I shall now therefore proceed to state the phenomena. obseryed on pre-
