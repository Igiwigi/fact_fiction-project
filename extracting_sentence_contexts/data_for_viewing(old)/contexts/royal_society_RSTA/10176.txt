HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN IN CONTACT WITH HOT SURFACES. 65

The remarkable difference between the results of these two experiments is shown
by the two curves for the partial pressures of the hydrogen reproduced in Diagram VI.
By substituting inert nitrogen for the oxygen of electrolytic gas the rate of dis-
appearance of hydrogen was increased something like seven-fold, a fact which at

once disproves the theory that the catalytic process involves a rapidly alternating
series of reductions and re-oxidations of the surface.

In a final experiment (VIII.) the quantity of “oxidised” gauze employed was
only 27'8 grammes, instead of the 100 grammes used in previous experiments, in
order to extend the combination over a longer period of time. The ratio H,/O,
