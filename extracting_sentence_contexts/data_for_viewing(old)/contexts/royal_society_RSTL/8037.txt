mation to the limiting values of the strains incidental to the extreme positions of support
ashore, and to compare them with the statical strains which have been calculated for
ships at sea.

The most severe strains to which a ship aground can be subjected are those incidental
to support at the bow and stern only. In this position the heavy-weighted amidship
portion, of course, tends to make the ship ag ; and as it is a very simple mechanical
problem to determine the amounts of the upward pressures at the points of support, as
well as the weights of the various portions of the ship between the points of support, it
is possible to calculate the shearing-forces and the bending-moments at yarious stations
by a method similar to that previously used for ships afloat. The graphical method of
representing shearing-forces and bending-moments might also be applied to this case
were it considered necessary ; but this has not been done, on account of the fact that
we are principally interested in determining an approximate value for the maximum
bending-strain, and therefore care but little about the other values, which have no prac-
tical importance. Before giving quantitative examples, taken from actual ships, of the
maximum sagging-strains that may occur in this position, it will be only proper to call
attention also to the obviously great increase in the maximum shearing-forces which a
ship then experiences. Roughly speaking, we may say that one half a ship's weight is
taken at the bow, and the other half at the stern when the middle is unsupported ; 80
that near the points of support the shearing-force is approximately one half the ship's
weight. In preceding investigations it has been shown that for still water the shearing-
force has an approximate maximum value of 4; part of the total weight; and that for
