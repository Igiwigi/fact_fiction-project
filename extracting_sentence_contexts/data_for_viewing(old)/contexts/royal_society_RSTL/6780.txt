ence of ammonia in this water, and the loss of combined Nitrogen in the experiment,
Jrere due to the same cause.
E The condensed water showing the amount of combined Nitrogen recorded in the Table
aXIV.) was that which had been evaporated and condensed during the last four weeks of
Srowth (1858); and during this period the high temperature, and the advanced stage of
She plants, were fayourable to the evaporation of ammoniacal water. A considerable part,
Frould condense on the interior of the shade, owing to its comparatively low tempera-
; but a certain quantity of that which was in the state of vapour during the passage
Sf the air through the apparatus would be borne forward into the sulphuric acid in the
Sulb-apparatus M, and thus occasion a loss in the amount of combined Nitrogen deter-
-2nined in connexion with the plants. The reason why the loss is greater with the oats
Jas it is in both experiments) than with the other cereals is not perfectly clear; but the
Sireumstances of growth seemed to afford some explanation of the fact. Tn one case, at
Jeast, they ripened at a much warmer period of the season, and they became much drier
An stem and leaf, and were therefore more liable to eyolve ammonia. On these points,
he cireumstances of growth detailed in the Appendix should be consulted.
S In considering the column of gain or loss of Nitrogen, it is very desirable to take into
Account the total quantity of Nitrogen at the disposal of the plant, in the different series
Df experiments. It is also important to consider the amount of growth in the experi-
ts made under the different conditions. The following Tables (XV. and XVI.) bring
out the character of the results in these respects more clearly than they can be gathered

m Tables XII. and XIV. Table XV. shows, for the plants grown without supply of
combined Nitrogen beyond that contained in the seed, and Table XVI. for those grown
with such supply, the dry matter, and the Nitrogen, per seed sown,â€”the dry matter,
