Here we see that about a fifth of the sea-urchins had pure white spines, about
two-fifths violet and white, a fifth brown and white, and the remaining fifth mixed
colours. There is thus a very distinct tendency to the formation of well-marked
varieties. This is emphasised by the fact. that, of the violet-white individuals,
considerably over half belong to the violet-white class, i.e., had the larger portion of
each of their spines pigmented, and that more than two-thirds of the brown-white
individuals belonged to the brown-white class. Again, the group of individuals in
which the brown and violet pigments were mingled was the smallest of all, instead of
being the largest, as would be the case if there were no tendency to the formation of
varieties.
