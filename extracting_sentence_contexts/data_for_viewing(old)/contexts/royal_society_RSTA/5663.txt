Therefore, we can estimate the target density p,(x) by the rational-quadratic spline Ty and the
prior density pz(z)

Px(x) = pz(To(x)) | detfr, (x) | - (2.6)

(c) Real-value non-volume preserving transformations

After briefly reviewing the general framework of normalizing flows and neural spline flows in
previous subsections, we introduce the construction of the real-value non-volume preserving
transformation [49]. In this subsection, for the sake of simplicity, we only focus on two-
dimensional density estimation. In fact, this method can be extended to any finite dimension.
For the target probability density px(x), where x = (x1, x2) is a two-dimensional real vector and
the prior density is denoted by p-(z), zâ‚¬ R?, we aim to design an invertible and differentiable


transformation Tg such that z = Tg(x) and determinant of the Jacobian is easy to compute. To be
more specific, we propose the following transformation:
