A histological proof that the median and lateral giant fibres are syncitial structures thus
cannot be given, but the fact that the axons can never be traced back to single cell bodies
in spite of their large size, and the fact that they enter into relations of apparent fusion
with axons in each ganglion, seems ample proof that they are fused neurons and, unlike
the motor fibres, connected with more than one cell body (figure 44). The septa in the median giant fibres

In the thoracic ganglia of the ventral nerve cord the axoplasm of each median giant
fibre is frequently interrupted by septa which pass through the axoplasm. These septa
never, however, divide the axoplasm completely, for although they may appear to do so
in one section when they pass from one side of the fibre to the other, it is found on following
the series that they are at some point incomplete (figures 30, 31, plate 24; figure 4, plate 22),
so that the axoplasm of the median fibre in fact passes without interruption from one end
of the cord to the other. The septa are of variable appearance though they always seem
to be continuous with the inner layer of the inner sheath around the axon ; that is, perhaps,

with the cytoplasm of the inner sheath cell. Sometimes they are thin and membraneous
(figures 30, 31, plate 24); at other times they are thicker and show a fibrillary structure
(figure 4, plate 22), though the fibrils are never so coarse as those of the neurokeratin or
the endoneurium.
