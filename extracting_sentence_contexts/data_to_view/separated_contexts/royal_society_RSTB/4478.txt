The Anguilla species, in contrast to other murenoids, are usually termed fresh-
water eels, and are reckoned among the fresh-water fishes of Europe and North
America. From what we have now learned this is fur from literally strict. Both
from their history and their actual manner of life, these “fresh-water eels” are
true oceanic fishes, and the remarkable point in their life-history is not so much
the fact of their migrating out into the sea to spawn, as in their leaving it in
order to pass their period of growth in an environment so unusual for mureenoid
fishes as fresh-water. I have in the foregoing pages described the course of our investigations, and set
forth their results. In conclusion, I will endeavour very briefly to give an outline of
the life-history of our eel, as indicated by the facts now ascertained.
