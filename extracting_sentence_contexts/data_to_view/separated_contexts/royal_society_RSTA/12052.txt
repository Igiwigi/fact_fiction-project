It
Bis well known that small electric sparks may be sent through explosive mixtures of
gases, ¢.g., through electrolytic gas, without causing explosion. Yet the temperature
gin the spark must be extremely high, and combination occurs in the path of the spark.
"2 It would seem that the number of molecules heated by each spark was not sufficient to
BE communicate ignition to the rest. Again, when a sound-wave is started in a mixture
Sof gases, its rate of propagation depends upon the mean density of the gaseous
‘S mixture ; there is no selective propagation of the wave by one of the constituents of
S the mixture.* This fact, of which I could find no experimental demonstration for
Egases of widely different density, has been verified, at my request, by Mr. F. J.
