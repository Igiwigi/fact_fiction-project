But there are at least three critical problems with the life = self-organization equation.

First, self-organizing processes are intrinsically self-undermining. Their increased organization
(local entropy reduction) is a consequence of maximizing the rate that entropy is passed through.
This means that they maximize it at the same time that they reduce the very energy gradient
that creates these regularities. This is not a problem so long as this gradient is available, but it
significantly limits the conditions in which they can be sustained.

Second, the particular dynamical regularities they exhibit are entirely a consequence of the
gradient that drives them and their material constituents. Although the term ‘self’ in self-
organization refers to the fact that the particular forms produced are not imposed from the
outside, neither are they imposed internally. They result from the interaction of internal material
constraints and the form of external perturbation. There is no individual ‘self’ that is the source
of this effect.

Third, because this form is not embodied by any intrinsic feature, it cannot replicate. It can only
propagate by perturbing the dynamics of adjacent regions (as demonstrated by Rayleigh—Bénard
convection cells or vortex streets).

These three properties make self-organized processes merely terminal processes. The stable
regularities that result—though transiently in the case of depletable energy gradients—are a
function of reaching a maximum level of possible entropy generation. And if this eventually
depletes the gradient that generates this regularity, so that they eventually degrade toward a
