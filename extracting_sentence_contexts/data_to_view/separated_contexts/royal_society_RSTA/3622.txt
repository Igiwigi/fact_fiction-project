Oxidation of S-type asteroids almost certainly occurred prior to
terrestrial planet accretion in the early Solar System, causing an increase in the bulk rock D/H
ratio. However, the low water content of the S-type asteroids means their high D/H ratio could
have been overprinted, at least in part, by the low D/H ratio of the C-type asteroids, which have
much higher water contents. This simplistic view is complicated by the fact that no combination
of chondrite meteorite compositions (as a proxy for parental asteroid compositions) has been
able to recreate the bulk Earth. In particular, nitrogen and noble gases suggest that solar wind or
nebula gas played a role in the Earthâ€™s formation. Inner Solar System nebula hydrogen gas (H2) or
solar wind would have had a low D/H ratio at the time of terrestrial planet formation, thus this
addition could have further overprinted the high D/H ratios of the S-type asteroid component in
the terrestrial planets.
