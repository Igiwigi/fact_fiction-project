Corottary—Not only for the circle, but also for every bounded and closed set M,
the lower bound in (7) is actually attained, in fact forn = 3. There are three points
X14, 2, Xs < Mand numbers aj, dg, dy, satisfying

We need only observe that in (64) we can take n = 3 on account of the well-known
fact that every point of (9), lies in a triangle with vertices in %. This, incidentally,
is simply the above corollary for the case_y < (Mt).
