He snggests as an explanation of my regults
that the dry gases were tested under a less pressure than the wet gases. From the
detailed account I have given above, it is evident that Dr. Borson's explanation does
not account for the facts observed. I conclude that he failed to obtain the same result
by nob leaving the mixture long enough in contact with dry phosphoric oxide. I may
add that during the last two years, several of my pupils have repeated the experiment
in the Balliol College laboratory, so that the fact of the non-inflammability of the dry
gases when submitted to an electric spark under ordinary pressure and temperature,
may fairly be considered beyond the possibility of doubt.
