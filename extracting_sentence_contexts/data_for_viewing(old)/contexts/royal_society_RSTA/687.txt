The National Eclipse Weather Experiment (NEWEx) was conceived as a means by
which this denser network of observations could be produced, by engaging the efforts
of citizen scientists across the UK during the 20 March 2015 partial solar eclipse. For NEWEx,
citizen scientists would record simple observations of meteorological parameters throughout
the eclipse and submit these via the Internet. These observations would be collated, analysed
in the context of the eclipse and the results reported back to the citizen scientists. In doing so,
NEWEx would also serve as a valuable public engagement activity, and this aspect of the project
is discussed by Portas et al. elsewhere in this issue [7]. Previous studies have demonstrated the
potential value of engaging citizen scientists in quantitative meteorological research, for example,
the UK Citizen Rainfall Network [8] and the Royal Meteorological Societies Big Urban Heat
Island project [9]. Temperature changes associated with urban heat islands are approximately
several kelvin [10], which is similar to eclipse-driven temperature changes. Therefore, the fact that
urban heat island temperature changes have been detected by a citizen science project [9] gives
us confidence that a similar approach can be used to detect eclipse-driven temperature changes.

In §2, we describe the objectives, design and development of NEWEx. Section 3 describes
the data processing. In §4a, the accuracy of an example of the NEWEx temperature data is
assessed by comparison to a well-established record of air temperature measurements taken
at the University of Reading’s Atmospheric Observatory. Sections 4b-d present the nationwide
results of the NEWEx analysis for temperature, cloudiness, and wind speed and direction. Our
conclusions on the outcomes of NEWEx are summarized in §5.

1A small fraction of solar short-wave radiation received at Earth is emitted from the solar corona, which is never fully eclipsed.
