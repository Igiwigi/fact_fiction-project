During the month of July large numbers of male and female frit-flies were dissected,
and it was found that the worm in most cases brings about the complete sterilisation of

panicles of the oat plant, were dissected and the worms were found in these also.

A study of the relevant literature revealed the fact that there was no previous record
of a parasitic nematode worm in the frit-fly, and it was therefore concluded that the
worms were new to science.

(a) Life-history of the frit-fly in its Seasonal Generations.

In order to render the account of the new parasite quite clear, the writer has considered
it advisable to give a brief outline of the life-history of the frit-fly, Oscinella frit, as it
occurs throughout the year on oats and wild grasses.

The adult flies appear in the spring from overwintering larvae and the females lay eggs
on spring-sown oats whilst the seedlings are still small, generally during May. The eggs
