The transverse section reproduced in
fig. 4 was the first one cut and in its preparation the boundary between the sterile and
fertile regions must have been involved. In view of the fact that the vertical distance
between the two longitudinal sections is represented by the amount of material
destroyed in cutting the transverse section, it is clear that the bract-bearing region
was succeeded abruptly by the fertile region of the strobilus, and there cannot have
been any whorl of microsporophylls between the two as there is in the American
strobili described by WirLanp. The appendages to the upper part of the axis no
doubt originally extended to the conical apex, the actual summit of which is not
preserved (figs. 1, 35); they form a compact zone, 2 mm.
