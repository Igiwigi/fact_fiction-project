the impression is that HCCs following long-term hepatitis
infections in chimpanzees are rather rare [25,66]. What are
needed are systematic and complete data on how many chim-
panzees in total have been chronically infected with HBV or
HCV, their years at risk following infection, and the number
of cases of HCCs that have since occurred in this population.
Another striking difference between humans and NHHs is
the lack of long-term endemic infectious retroviral infections
in human populations [67—69]—setting aside the recent intro-
duction of HIV and HTLV viruses into the human population
from NHH sources [67,70,71]. As chronic retroviral infections
are associated with increased risk of cancer, in general, this
fact also appears counterintuitive.

13. Impact of the microbiome

It is now well established that the complex communities of
microbes that normally live in different sites of the body (the
microbiome) can have a very strong influence on local inflam-
mation, food metabolism, as well as on the processing of
bioactive molecules such as carcinogens. It also seems likely
that components of the microbiota can promote chronic inflam-
mation and tumour development via complex interactions
with the innate and adaptive immune systems [72]. Given
that many epithelial surfaces are in contact with the exterior
