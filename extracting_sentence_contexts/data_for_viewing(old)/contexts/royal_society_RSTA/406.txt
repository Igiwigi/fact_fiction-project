board, and car ownership is a widely held ambition.

In 2000, the Chinese market penetration of cars was extremely low, most vehicles were two-
wheeled, and there was little room on city roads for four-wheeled motor vehicles. National
mandates to control burgeoning car ownership met with little success, so individual cities
enforced differing regulations. Beijing, a pro-car city, simply built more roads. In 1997, one million
cars were registered in Beijing. By mid-2003, this had doubled to two million and by the beginning
of 2010 had doubled again to four million [39]. By the end of 2010 an additional 700 000 cars had
been registered, and the city imposed a lottery which limited new licence plate registrations to
a mere 20 000 per month. By August 2012, there were over one million applicants for the 20
000 registered plates [39]. Similar approaches have been adopted elsewhere; Shanghai began
auctioning new licence plates in 1998 and these now command as much as ¥60 000, which is more
than the national average annual income [39]. But the simple fact is that road building cannot
keep pace with demand for car ownership.

The Chinese car industry is concerned by these constraints. It has grown massively and
is keen to satisfy burgeoning domestic demand with affordable but basic cars, while cars
manufactured locally by overseas manufacturers also generally have lower specifications than
their OECD counterparts. Hence, cars tend to be utilitarian rather than exemplars of leading
edge fuel economy or emissions control. In May 2012, the national government announced a
subsidy package of ¥6 billion for the purchase of fuel-efficient small cars (less than 1.61 engine
capacity, less than 6.31 per 100km fuel economy) [40]. Within months, notwithstanding civic
registration constraints, car sales had increased by 14% year-on-year. China also has incentives
in place to achieve a cumulative output of 5 million EVs and HEVs by 2020 [40], although this is
hardly audacious given China’s overall production and fleet numbers. In 2011, China produced
