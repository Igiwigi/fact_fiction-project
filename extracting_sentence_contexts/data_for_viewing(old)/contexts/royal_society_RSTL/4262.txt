To explain this, let us take the equation

2m
D*u+—Du—Pu=0;

its $ymbolical solution is
u=k(D*—&)"—{a—(D*—c2)="0} ;


LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS, 45

and the assertion is that a solution of the equation in the form of a definite integral
is obtained by writing for pz, k(z2?—c2)"=" and selecting the limits properly ; in fact,
it is known that

u=kſ" (2—&)"='v"d>
is a partial solution ; and as it is a known theorem, that if a= solve
Du+ 2 Du—u=0,
it is also solyed by u=a" if for be written —n, we have for the complete solution
u=kſ" (2 "da+Rarimtſ (22 2) "v"dz
