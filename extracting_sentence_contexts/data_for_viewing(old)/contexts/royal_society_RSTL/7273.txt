proved by BuTLErow * that etheric normal acids, when treated with concentrated s0lu-
tion of hydriodic acid, yield up, as iodide, the alcohol radical which in these acids is
linked to carbon by oxygen; thus in the case of ethyl-lactic acid,

The olefine acids are as yet too little known to allow of their constitution being thus
analytically investigated. These acids do not derive from oxalic acid by substitution
alone, but by simultaneous addition of an olefine. They may, in fact, be regarded as
standing somewhat in the same relation to the normal acids as the polyethylenic glycols
occupy with regard to the normal glycols, as 8een from the following comparison !â€”
