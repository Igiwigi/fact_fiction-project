Suppoxse, for shortness, that the quantic is represented by U, and let U,, U,.. be
what U becomes when the set (&, y) is successively replaced by the sets (a, y1),
(x4, yz), &c. Suppose moreover that 12=d,3,,—d,,?,, &c., then the function
in which, after the differentiations, the new sets (x1, 1), (X,, y2)-- may be replaced by
the original set (z, y)—, will be a covariant of the quantic U. And if the number
of differentiations be snch as to make the facients disappear, 4. e. if the sum of all the
indices p, q.. of the terms 12, &c. which contain the symbolic number 1, the sum of
all the indices p, r, &c. of the terms which contain the symbolic number 2, and 80
on, be severally equal to the degree of the quantic, we haye an invariant. The
operative quantic © becomes in the case under consideration

©=(d,, —dp...+d,Lz, y)",
the signs being alternately positive and negative; in fact it is easy to verify that this
expression gives identically OU=0, and any covariant of © operating on a covariant
of U gives rise to a covariant of U,
18. But the quantic
(a,'b..Þ, a Nev)
considered as decomposable into linear factors, 7. e. as expressible in the form

a(x—ey)(2—PYy)..,
