point, it seems that the change in potential fall required is some function of the
velocities of the ions, and it is most probable that a connection will be found to exist

between this and the Nernst theory of liquid cells. To establish the relation,
however, it is necessary that a very much larger number of experiments should be
carried out. In the table only five of the experiments correspond to the minimum
potential fall. This follows from the fact that the investigation had for its first aim
the production of a margin, and not the determination of the limits of voltage within
which this may be produced.

Two of the boundaries previously referred to for which no satisfactory conditions

could be found are the x Cl and us Cl. From Table IL. it is seen that for this pair

of solutions no change in potential slope is brought about. The densities and
refractive indices of the two solutions, however, differ very considerably. Perhaps it
is on this account that it is possible to obtain an indistinct and undulating refraction
margin whether the Li follows Mg or Mg Li; but in neither case is the velocity
constant. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that, since there exists no difference in
