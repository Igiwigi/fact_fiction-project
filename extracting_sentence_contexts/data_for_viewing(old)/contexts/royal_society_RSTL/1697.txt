Of the real Construction of the Comet, and its various Parts,

Hitherto I have only related the appearances of the several
parts of the comet, in order to determine their linear extent;
but the observations which are now before us, contain facts
that will allow me-_also to ascertain the construction of the
comet and its various parts in their solid dimensions.

From the laws of gravitation we might be allowed to con-
clude that the planetary body containing the solid matter of
the comet must be spherical; but actual observation will Å¿ur-
nish a more substantial argument; for in no part of the long,
geocentric path described by the comet, did I see its little disk
otherwise than round; whereas it would not have preserved
this appearance, if its construction were not spherical.

If what has been said-in my last paper, when treating of
