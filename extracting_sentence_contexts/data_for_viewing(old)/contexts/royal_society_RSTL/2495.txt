FORMED AT THE BOTTOM OF RUNNING WATER. 331

It will be better here also to state, generally, the conditions of temperature and
phases of the weather under which the ground-gru is formed. I have seen it occur
only when the temperature of the whole mass of water was reduced to, or nearly to,
32* Fann., and when the temperature of the air was several degrees below that point.
I have observed it an invariable condition, that it was preceded by a continuance,
for s8ome time, of a clear, or very nearly clear, state of the sky. This is at variance
with another observation of DzsmaresT, quoted by M. Araco, that © when, in conse-
quence of a cloudy sky, the atmospherical temperature experiences little yariation
throughout the day and night, the ice at the bottom of the water uniformly increases
every twenty-four hours ; on the contrary, when the s8un shows itself, the ice docs
not increase during the day.” It is the fact, that while it is forming under the con-
tinuance of a cloudless sky, its increase is impeded during the day, It may be pos-
8ble, amidst the infinite variety of measures of cold that may exist at the time, that
the increase of the gru may go on for a little time after the sun has been obscured
by a thin cloud ; but I have always seen, that when a densely clouded state of the
sky superyened, and continued for the space of even only twenty-four hours, the gru
became detached from the bottom, and floated down the stream. Should the tem-
perature of the air continue low, with the clouded sky, or get lower, the ground-gru
is not renewed, but the river is speedily frozen over at the surface, It is, in fact, a
matter of frequent occurrence, in frosty winters, that our rivers, filled, and 80 im-
peded, by ground-gru, as to be raised above their banks, are found returned into
their natural channels, and there frozen over at the surface, but flowing over a clear
bottom, in a space of time 80 short as to appear very wonderful to those who have
