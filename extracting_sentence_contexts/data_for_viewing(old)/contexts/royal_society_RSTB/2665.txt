Little fibrous deposit is seen on the inner side of the dark line in the wall, whereas
on the outer side, long fascicular groups extend to the serrate costal ridge, which is
present on the outer surface of the wall between two septa-costal ridges, The
shadowy line in the drawing giving apparent continuity to the dark centres and axes
in the median plane is an attempt to reproduce the effects got by changing the focus
of the microscope.



SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF THE MADREPORARIAN TYPES OF CORALS. 121

The transverse sections, fig. 5 and fig. 6, show apparently contradictory facts
regarding the relations of the “dark lines” in wall and septum. In fig. 5 they are
drawn separated from one another, in fig. 6 they appear continuous. The same
corallite varies in this respect in Galaxea at different parts, according to the relative
rapidity of growth between septum and wall. When the “ dark line” of the septum
passes continuously through the wall, more rapid growth of the septum is indicated,

Structure of Tabula, Dissepiments, and Columella.

The complications in the skeletal structure of the septa and wall arise as the direct
result of the wrinkled and pitted character of the ectoderm which envelops those
parts of the calyx (ef. “ Mussa,” p. 1386). If we examine the structure of a dissepi-
ment we find it much simpler. The surface of either tabula or dissepiment in Galaxea
