Active inference rests on the tuple (Q, S, A, P, beliefs, an action is sampled from the posterior marginal over
P,Q,R, S, U) control states. The environment then picks up this action,
generates a new observation and a new cycle starts.
— A finite set of observations . The optimization above is that usually portrayed in terms of
— A finite set of true states and actions S x A. perception (inference about hidden states) and action (a choice
— A finite set of fictive or hidden states S x U. model in which action is a function of inferred states). Action
— A generative process over observations, states and action and perception couple the agent to the environment; where
RG, §, a) = Pr ({00,..., 01} = 6, {80,-.-, $1} = §, expectations depend upon observations—through perception,
{ao,.--, ar} = 4). whereas observations depend upon expectations—through
— A generative model over observations and hidden states action. Usually, expectations are associated with neuronal
POG, §, ti|m) = Pr ({o9,..-, 01} = 0, {50,.--, 8:1} = 8, activity or connection strengths and action is associated with
{ur,..., Ur} = i). the state of effectors.
