the pressure P is the difference between two quantities, both of which may be functions
of the nature of the lubricant and of the solids. P may then be a pure function of the
geometry of the system over an extremely wide range of conditions.

The effect of the contaminant seems to point to the conclusion that the attraction
of the solid is not a shadowless force as Laplace assumed, but a force which, like chemical
affinity, can be saturated. The effect may, however, be due simply to the contaminant
making the surface irregular.

The relative efficacy of wringing is no doubt due to purely mechanical action. In
wringing a cylinder down on to a plate the surfaces are not kept parallel, the resistance
encountered is therefore at no time equal to the pressure P (at the least distance between
the surfaces) x area. By tilting the cylinder the resistance can, in fact, be made
vanishingly small. When any part of the cylinder has been forced down it rises under
capillary pressure relatively slowly, as the table (X). p. 67, shows. There is, therefore
a kind of ratchet and pawl action.

Experiment shows that once the cylinder has been wrung down, it stays there if the
surfaces are contaminated by liquid, save when the joint is surrounded by a fluid
freely miscible with the liquid lubricant. It will therefore not rise in air, but clean
faces wrung down, even to seizing, float apart in clean air. This, of course, docs not
mean that the pressure P in clean air is greater than metallic cohesion, for the injury
to the polished faces show that seizing has taken place at only a few points, so we have,
if A be the area of the plane end of the cylinder and a the total area of seizing,
