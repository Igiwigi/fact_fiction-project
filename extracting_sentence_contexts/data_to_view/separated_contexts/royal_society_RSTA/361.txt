of the order of } eV. However, this method cannot give a? accurately because, for large negative values
of E, the theoretical curve is rather sensitive to the limit Z,,, and, owing to the fact that
a really decreases with increasing £, it is hard to estimate what value of E,, one should
take in equation (11) to obtain the best approximation. A comparison with the actual
curves for positive values of £, using a rather naive extrapolation of that part which
seems to conform to the E! law, probably gives better values. These are tabulated in
table 7.
