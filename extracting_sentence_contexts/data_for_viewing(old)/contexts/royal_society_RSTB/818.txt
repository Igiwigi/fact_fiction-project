when it is found that the force of both the auricular and ventricular contractions is
markedly diminished. If, now, the blood which has been removed be reinjected, the
force of the contractions both of the auricle and ventricle returns more or less exactly
to that which was shown by the myocardiographic curve before the blood was “let.”
This change is well exhibited in Figs. 31 and 82, from a medium-sized Dog. In both
figures the ventricular tracing is above, the auricular below, and contraction pulled
the lever point down. Fig. 31 shows the effect of removing 120 e.cm. of blood from
one of the carotids. The ventricular contraction, as can be seen, becomes diminished
in force in spite of the fact that the lowered blood-pressure, offering less resistance to
the contractions of the left ventricle would of itself have led to increased systolic
contraction ; the ventricle also shows slight imcrease in the degree of diastolic
expansion. The auricular tracing shows marked diminution in force of the con-
tractions, which does not, however, go hand in hand with the weakening of the
ventricle, but follows a curve of its own. In Fig, 32, taken from the same heart a few
minutes later, can be seen the effects of reinjection of the blood which had been
removed, and which, during the interval, has been defibrinated and kept at the body
temperature. As the curve shows, the force of the ventricle is markedly increased :
it must be understood, however, that the tracing does not show the whole of the
resulting increase, as it still continued to improve for some little time afterwards.
The auricular tracing shows an increase of force, the lower or systolic margin
descending with a curve which resembles that obtained on removing the blood, save
