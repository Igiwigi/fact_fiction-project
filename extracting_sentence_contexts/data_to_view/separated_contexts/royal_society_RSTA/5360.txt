Upon
this, near the pole, is laid a hollow sphere of copper. The electromagnetic action
produces a couple so powerful that the friction of rotation is overcome and the sphere
‘Sis spun round. £ The mathematical analysis for this case being complicated I have evaluated the

couples called into action in various combinations of hollow spherical and cylindrical
shells,

Tt is a known fact that in a spherical conductor no external field can give rise to
induced currents that do not circulate in concentric spherical shells. After a
preliminary theorem to the effect that there are no other families of surfaces which
possess similar properties, the case has been considered of an infinitely long, thin,
circular cylindrical shell in a field consisting of alternating currents parallel to its
axis. If the electrokinetic momentum of the primary field be expanded in harmonics over
the cylinder, it turns out that if all the terms of each harmonic have the same phase,

there will be no couple acting on the cylinder: as a particular case, if the externa
field have the same phase throughout there will be no couple.
