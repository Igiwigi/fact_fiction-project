therefore taken these as standard colours for reducing dichromic observations. 'The three
standard colours will be referred to as (104), (88), and (68), these being the positions of
the red, green, and blue on the scale of the new instrument.

Mr. Jags S1MPs0N, formerly student of Natural Philosophy in my class, has furnished
me with thirty-three observations taken in good sunlight. Ten of these were between
the two standard colours, and give the following result ;—

88:7(88)-E38'1(68)=W. . 7. =. (1)
The mean errors of these observations were as follows :—

Error of (88)=25; of (68)=2:3; of (88)+(68)=4:8; of (88)—(68)=1-3.
The fact that the mean error of the -sum was 80 much greater than the mean error of
the difference, indicates that in this case, as in all others that I have examined, observa-
tions of equality of tint can be depended on much more than observations of equality of
illumination or brightness. k

From six obseryations of my own, made at the same time, I have deduced the
+ trichromic ” equation
22:6(104)+26(88)+37:4(68)=W.. . - « « +» - (2)
If we suppose that the light which reached the organ of vision was the same in both
cases, We may combine these equations by subtraction, and s0 find
22-6(104)—7-7(88)+4-3(68)=D, . . . . . . - (8.)
