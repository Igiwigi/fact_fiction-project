With this view, in August 1824, I
elevated the kite in an atmosphere favourable to the exhibition of its pheno-
mena. It was raised from an apparatus firmly fixed in the earth, and was in-
sulated by a glass pillar. The usual shocks were felt on touching the string,
which simple fact I am induced to mention from the cireumstance of no elec-
trometer having been employed. The portion of string let out with a double gilt
thread passed through it, was about five hundred yards. I then made the con-
nection shown in the accompanying sketch, where the straight glass tubes A B,
having platina wires passed from above half way down their axes, and standing
in their respective glass cups CD, were filled with a solntion of sulphate of
soda coloured with syrup of violets, connected also with each other by the bent
glass tube E, likewise filled with the above solution in the usual manner.
