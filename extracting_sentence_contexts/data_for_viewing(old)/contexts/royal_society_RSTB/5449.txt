would see a support for his theory in the conditions in Sorex. However, the pterygoid
cartilage is of a peculiar nature. The histological picture which it presents is quite
different from that of undoubted primitive cartilage (such as that of the ala temporalis,
for example), but is identical with that of the nodules of cartilage which are to be found
in the angular and coronoid regions of the dentary bone of the mandible in several
mammals. I therefore agree with Gaupr (1901) that this cartilage is of a secondary
nature, and that it does not represent any primitive cartilaginous structure. Fawcrrr
(1905) came to the same conclusion. The question then arises as to what such secondary
cartilage really represents. 1 think that there can be no doubt that it represents
a preformation of a dermal ossification, and it may be noticed that, in the case of the
dentary, as well as of the pterygoid, the dermal ossification is not plate-like, but thick,
and is sunk at some little distance beneath the surface. Prof. Watson has also kindly
drawn my attention to the fact that the preformation of dermal ossification in secondary
cartilage tends to occur at places where muscle-attachments are formed. â€˜There seems,
then, every reason to believe that secondary cartilage is an embryonic adaptation of
a functional nature, and that qua cartilage it is secondary, though the dermal bone
which it precedes is a primitive structure, inherited from the reptiles.

Now, the relations of the secondary pterygoid cartilage to the ala temporalis in
Sorex are very suggestive of those of the pterygoid bone to the processus ascendens
of the pterygo-quadrate of a reptile such as Lacerta, and of which a drawing of a
transverse section is given in text-fig. 42. I would draw attention not only to the
relative topographical positions of the structures, including the palatine (or Vidian)
