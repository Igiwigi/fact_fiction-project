It, should be further understood, that, of the many
anatomists who have more or less specially observed and studied these organs, not one
has ever hinted (either directly or indirectly) at the relation in which they stand to the
reproductive system. But the recent paper of HerNGy, on the organs of generation in
the Earth-worm, requires a special historical notice. In the course of the sneceeding
description it will be seen that the author differs from Herr HeriNG on the following
important points :—l1st, as to the size and position of the ovaria; 2nd, not only as to the
distribution of the s0-called vas deferentia; but 3rd, as to the very fact of the existence
of these ducts under any shape; and 4th, and most fundamentally, as to the connexion
between the generative masses and the **segmental organs.” To this latter point HERRING
makes no reference whatever. Lastly, the author is desirous to correct an error into
which he himself was drawn while writing his © Report on the British Annelids” for the
British Association (1852).
