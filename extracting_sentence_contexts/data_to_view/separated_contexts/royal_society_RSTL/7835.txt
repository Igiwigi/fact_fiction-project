In the example of Cala-
mopitus described in my previous memoir, I figured some sections of the vascular bundles
going off to the branches where the vascular tissues were s0 conspicuons and had 0
remarkable an arrangement as coneclusively to demonstrate their true character ; and
though in the specimen under consideration the similar structures (fig. 25, m) are not
80 highly developed, there is no question that in both examples their nature is the same. These facts do away with the possibility of the canals in question having any direct
relationship with the branches. & At the Meeting of the British Association at Liverpool, Mr. Carnumaers snggested
=that these organs were points from which roots had been given off. Such, however,
Zannot have been the case, since in the specimens in which they occur they exist
=throughout the entire length of the stem from its base to its summit.
