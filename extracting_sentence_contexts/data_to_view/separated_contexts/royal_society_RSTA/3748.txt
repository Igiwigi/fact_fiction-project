It will be noticed that the curves in figs. 13, 14 do not always form closed figures. This is probably in the main due to the fact that the preliminary cycles of twisting
were gone through in a few minutes, while the one during which the tests for
B, and W were made occupied about an hour. We have often observed a similar
effect when a copper wire is put through cycles of loading and unloading. There is in
this case so much “creeping” when a load is applied, that, if a cycle of loading and
unloading with a given range of load is performed slowly after a number of cycles of
loading and unloading performed comparatively quickly with the same range of load,
the curve connecting the elongation and the load is not closed.
