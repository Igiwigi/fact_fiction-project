» Natoral Wattr-Table mons Actual Water-tatte .
(Ajter Farrar, )

Fia. 40.—Transverse section of valley (continued).

Fig. 40, above, is the same diagram, repeated twice in skeleton. During the “ well
maximum ” we have the additional source of water in the basins, whereof the Shabra-
mant level is shown (inset). The river is falling, but the natural water-table, shown by
the small dots and based on Ferrar’s diagram, is sufficiently near the levels observed
in our pits to require but little additional seepage from the canals to account for their
height, and especially for the fact that in 1913 our wells rose above the river level.

During the “ well minimum ” we seem to require much more water from the canals,
but it is evident from previous figures that such is actually available. The rise of water-
table near the canals obstructs the leakage from them, and, conversely, the lower the
underlying natural water-table the steeper the gradient from the canals, and the more
they will lose. The double wedge of leakage water-table shown in this figure is 1 m. high
and 2 km, wide, equal to a rectangle 4 m. high and the same width, during the period of
maximum leakage, as against our considered estimate of nearly } m. (10 cm. water is
taken as 40 cm. water-table) over the same width in the permeable soils for an average
over the whole year, so it is not unreasonable.

We are now in a position to divide the well readings on our farm into their com-
