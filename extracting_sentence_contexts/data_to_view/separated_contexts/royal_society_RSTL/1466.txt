He found it composed
of lamine, whose appearance was evidently fibrous, for s0me
depth from the external surface ; but becoming less and less
distinct, till at last this fibrous appearance was entirely lost,
and the middle, or central part of the humour, was compact
and transparent, without any visible lamine. From this struc-
ture it would appear, that in the eye of the cuttle-fish the ex-
terior parts of the humour are fibrous, the interior parts not ;
s0 that the central part is a nucleus round which the fibrous
coverings' are placed. The preparations which demonstrate
these facts will be laid before the Society. As the structure of the crystalline humour in the cuttle-
fish differs in nothing from that of the same humour in other
animals, but in the distinctness of the fibrous appearance, Mr. HunTER was led to consider that the exterior part in all of
them was similar, although no appearance of fibres could be
demonstrated.
