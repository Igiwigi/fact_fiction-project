TOBACCO PIPES IN NEW GUINEA 237

‘The Portuguese, however, are not responsible for the transmission of the tobacco
plant into China. This is outwardly demonstrated by the word ¢an-ba-ku or tam-ba-ku
under which tobacco first became known in Fu-kien Province in the beginning of the
seventeenth century when the Ming dynasty was still in power. The Fukienese were
enterprising mariners and maintained regular intercourse with the Philippines, in
particular with the island of Luzon, several centuries prior to the Spaniards’ conquest
and colonization.’ On p. 4, Laufer says: ‘No species of the genus Nicotiana is a native
of China; in fact, none is indigenous in any other part of Asia. Nor can there be any
doubt that the species first introduced into China from Luzon was Nicotiana tabacum,
the typical species of America, the species with large cabbage-like leaves and purple
flowers. This becomes perfectly evident from the descriptions of the plant in the early
Chinese sources. Moreover it is this species which at present is most commonly culti-
vated all over China and the adjacent territories. Nicotiana rustica, the species with
yellow flowers and broader leaves, is cultivated only to a limited extent, chiefly in
northern Shen-si and in the mountainous districts of Hupeh and Se-ch-’wan....At
these high elevations the other species would not succeed’...‘the foreign word
tam-ba-ku lias always been restricted to the written language, and is now obsolete, but
it survives in the form ma-ku (abbreviated for ta-ma-ku), which is commonly used for
cigarette among the Canton and Fu-kien men at the ports’ (p. 7).
