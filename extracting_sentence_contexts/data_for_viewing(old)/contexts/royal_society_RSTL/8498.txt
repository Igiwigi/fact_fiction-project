I may here mention that when the electrized carbonic acid is passed through a solu-
tion of hyposulphite of soda rendered strongly alkaline with carbonate of soda, the
diminution in yolume is the same as when the gas is passed through neutral hyposul-
phite—a result quite different to that observed in the case of electrized oxygen *, and
due doubtless to the presence of the large proportion of carbonic acid, which, as will be
seen, modifies other reactions also.

In my previous memoir T have investigated the action of ozone upon a solution of
protochloride of tinf, and T have shown that the oxidation there effected by the ozone is
equal in yalue to three times the © titre” of the gas, and also that a diminution in the
yolume of the gas occurs equal to twice that * titre.” The evidence which I have given
of these facts is, I believe, perfectly valid; but the result is not easily ascertained, owing
to the difficulty of disengaging and separating the effects of the 0zone from the effects
of the oxygen with which it is as8ociated; but in the present form of experiment, in
which the ozone is s0 largely diluted with carbonic-acid gas, and in which the proportion
of oxygen present in relation to the total volume of gas is 80 small, the influence of the
associated oxygen is reduced to a minimum, and the oxidation and diminution in volume
are those due to the ozone alone, This point is demonstrated by the concordance of the
