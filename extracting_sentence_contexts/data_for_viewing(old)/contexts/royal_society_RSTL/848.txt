as the disposing cause that nitric acid is decomposed by those
metals. But it is evident that some other action takes place;
for, sulphuric acid, which has a stronger affinity for oxide of

decomposition of nitric acid by gold, or by platina.

CONCLUSION.

The substance which has been treated of in this Paper, must
convince us how dangerous it is to form a theory before we are
provided with a sufficient number of facts, or to 5ubstitute the
results of a few observations, for the general laws of nature. If
a theory is sometimes useful, as a standard to which we may
refer our knowledge, it is at other times prejudicial, by creating
an attachment in our minds to preconceived ideas, which have
been admitted without inquiring whether from truth or from
convenience. We easily correct our judgment as to facts; and
the evidence of experiment is equally convincing to all persons.
But theories, not admitting of mathematical demonstration, and
being but the interpretation of a series of facts, are the creatures
of opinion, and are governed by the various impressions made
upon every individual. Nature laughs at our speculations; and
though from time to time we receive such warnings as should
