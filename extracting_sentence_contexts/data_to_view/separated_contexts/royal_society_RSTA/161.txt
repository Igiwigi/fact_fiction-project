Dynamically adaptive weather prediction 899

The verification of forecasts containing explicitly resolved convection poses a
considerable challenge, as noted by Kong et al. (2007a,6), owing to the fact, for
example, that a forecast having zero overlap between a predicted storm and its
real-world counterpart may have significant practical value, yet produce a very
low skill score based on conventional statistical measures. Adding dynamic
adaptation makes verification even more problematic. With these challenges in
mind, results from the experiments described above are being analysed, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, and will be reported in forthcoming papers.
