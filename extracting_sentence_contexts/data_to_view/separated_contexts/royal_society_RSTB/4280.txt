In this area
of the alveolar margin lie the necks and very small portions of the crowns of the
four incisor teeth, but no evidence of any abnormal distance between canine and
lateral incisor is discernible. The radiographs (Plate 17, fig. 23) show that this
region of the jaw is completely occupied by the alveoli of the teeth and that no
greater space is present between the roots of the two incisors than between those of
the lateral incisor and canine. This fact, in conjunction with the proof that the
crowns of the lateral incisor and canines were in contact, shows that no diastema in
the proper sense of the term was present in this region, The presence and size
of the root canals are also revealed by the skiagrams, but there is nothing worthy
of note in this respect. TasLe 1V.â€”Upper Incisor Teeth. All living races
