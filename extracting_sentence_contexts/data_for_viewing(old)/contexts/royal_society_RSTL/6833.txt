Sdeveloped, a fine fibre passes spirally around it; and this may be accounted for in pre-
© cisely the same way as I have attempted to explain the production of the spiral fibre of
>the ganglion-cells. The arrangement described is represented in figs. 29 & 30. It is

constant, but can only be demonstrated positively at an early period of deyelopment of the
= dark-bordered fibre. The frequent crossing and twisting of fibres around one another
5amongst ganglion-cells, and the strange crossing over and under observed in the case of
Zall fibres in the trunks of nerves, must also be due to a corresponding change of position
between contiguous fibres after they have been formed, but at an early period of their
=Slife's history. . The arrangement of the fine fibre, represented in figs. 29 & 30, is very
Premarkaþle ; and I have seen very many specimens exhibiting the same points. It must
> also be noticed that the nuclei of the dark-bordered fibre are much nearer together than
Z the nuclei of the fine fibre. This fact is also constant in the case of s8nch nerves near
£ their ultimate distribution. I am not yet able to give a satisfactory explanation of the
E fact, but it would seem to show either that the fine fibre has grown very much faster
S than the dark-bordered fibre, or that the fine fibre was developed, and perhaps in an
E active state, at a period anterior to the development of the dark-bordered fibre. These
7 points are of the utmost interest, and well deserve the most searching and minute inves-
Y tigation ; for it is certain that the settlement of many of the questions raised, and but
= yery imperfectly considered here, must lead to the establighment of new general prin-
z ciples of wide application.
