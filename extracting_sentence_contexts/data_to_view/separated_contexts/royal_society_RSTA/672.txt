Most likely, all three will affect the efficacy of an SHS to reduce drag in turbulent flow. To the best
of our knowledge, there has not been a fully developed turbulent channel or turbulent boundary
layer flow that produced increased drag reduction with increased Re. In fact, all studies have
shown that the drag reduction decreased with Re, so much so that drag increased beyond baseline
resistance at some critical Reynolds number. Conversely, the rheometer and microchannel studies
have shown no drag reduction until the onset of turbulence, and then increased drag reduction
as Re increased. The discrepancy alluded to above also highlights the fact that decreasing 5, alters both Ay
and k+.
