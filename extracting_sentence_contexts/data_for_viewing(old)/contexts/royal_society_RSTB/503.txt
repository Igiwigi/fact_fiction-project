3'5 pw, and there are also non-medullated fibres ; sometimes—and this was described
by Brpprr and VotkMANN—there are a few larger fibres, viz., three to six fibres,
about 5°5 pw, and two or three, about 11» in diameter. These fibres, however, are
probably derived from the vagus, and run downward, for after section of the cervical
sympathetic I have found, some weeks later, a group of six to eight similar fibres just
inside the sheath of the superior cervical ganglia.

Notwithstanding the striking corroboration of Broper and VoLKMANy’s theory,
which is afforded by these facts, further inquiry shows, I think, that in the main it is
erroneous.

Before proceeding with this inquiry, it will be convenient to give some observations
on the size of the medullated fibres in the grey rami and in the rest of the sympa-
thetic system.

When a piece of a ramus communicans, or of the trunk of the sympathetic down
to the Ist. sacral ganglion, or of one of the branches running to the solar plexus, or
to the inferior mesenteric ganglion is teased out, after having been treated with
osmic acid for a day, three sizes of medullated fibres at once catch one’s attention.
The fibres are about 3p, 5p, and 8 p respectively. Occasionally in the branches of
the sympathetic, and more frequently in the trunk of the sympathetic and in the
