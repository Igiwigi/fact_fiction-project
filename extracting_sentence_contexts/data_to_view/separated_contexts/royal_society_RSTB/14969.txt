As with
bradycardia, vasoconstriction varies among human subjects; research found more than five times greater vasoconstriction in
experienced divers compared to controls, so it may be more susceptible to training effects than bradycardia, even though it
is less phenomenologically salient to divers [62, p. 723; 63]. The modification in circulation is so profound that physiologist
Gooden discovered blood flow almost stopped to the forearm of a subject who underwent a particularly dramatic dive response
58, p. 7]. The example of novice divers with maladaptive responses underscores the fact that veteran freedivers have more efficient,
better-articulated dive responses than novices [57]. In the most extreme cases, ‘autonomic conflict’ may arise between parasym-
pathetic bradycardia and sympathetic tachycardia, opposed cardiac responses. Shattock & Tipton [64] draw on evidence of
arrhythmias in healthy subjects immersed in cold water to offer a potential explanation for the phenomenon of ‘dry drowning’:
drowning victims found to have no water in their lungs when autopsied.
