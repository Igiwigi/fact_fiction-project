When m=2, the force being inversely as the square of the distance, then z= * and

But this is wholly inconsistent with all the experiments; for all of these give
nearly the same proportion of y:y' without regard to the distance, consequently the
new element must be introduced to reconcile this fact. Thus we can easily suppose
the conditions, disposition and polarization (I use the latter term merely because the
effect of the first edge resembles polarization, and I use it without giving any opinion
as to its identity), to satisfy the equation by introducing into the value of y 80me func-
tion of aâ€”z, But that the joint action of the two edges never can account for the
difference produced on the fringes, is manifest from hence, that whatever value we
give to m, we find the proportion of y':y when z=0 only that of double, whereas 5
or 6 times is the fact. The same reasoning holds in the case of the spheres of flexion
being of different extent ; and there are other arguments arising from the analysis
on this head, which it would be superfluous to go through, because what is delivered
above enables any one to pursue the subject. The demonstration also holds if we

suppose the deflective force to act as L of the distance, while that of inflexion acts as.
