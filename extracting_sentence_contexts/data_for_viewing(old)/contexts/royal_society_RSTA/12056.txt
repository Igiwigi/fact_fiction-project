could not be doubted that it contained nitrogen, the bands of which were distinctly
visible. It was probable, thereforé, that the true density of the pure gas lay not far
from 20 times that of hydrogen. At the same time many lines were seen which
could not be recognized as belonging to the spectrum of any known substance,

Such were the preliminary experiments made with the aid of magnesium to
separate from atmospheric nitrogen its dense constituent. The methods adopted in
preparing large quantities will be subsequently described.

6. Proof of the Presence of Argon in Air, by means of Atmolysis.

Tt has already (§ 2) been suggested that if “atmospheric nitrogen” contains two
gases of different densities, it should be possible to obtain direct evidence of the fact
by the method of atmolysis. The present section contains an account of carefully
conducted experiments directed to this end.

The atmolyser was prepared (after Grawam) by combining a number of “ church-
warden” tobacco pipes. At first twelve pipes were used in three groups, each group
including four pipes connected in series. The three groups were then connected in
parallel, and placed in a large glass tube closed in such a way that a partial vacuum
could be maintained in the space outside the pipes by a water-pump. One end of
the combination of pipes was open to the atmosphere, or rather was connected with
the interior of an open bottle containing sticks of caustic alkali, the object being
mainly to dry the air. The other end of the combination was connected to a bottle
aspirator, initially full of water, and so arranged as to draw about two per cent. of
