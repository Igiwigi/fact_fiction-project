proposed (Halford et al. 2001). A more recent study
on human OPN3 confirms the wide tissue distribution
and in multiple sites within the retina including the
rods and cones, the outer plexiform, inner plexiform
and ganglion cell layers of the retina (White er al.
2008). A comparison of Opn3 with the visual opsins
shows a low amino acid identity of approximately 30
per cent (table 1). Opn3 contains a lysine, at residue
299, which is required for Schiff base linkage. This
residue is equivalent to position 296 in bovine rod
