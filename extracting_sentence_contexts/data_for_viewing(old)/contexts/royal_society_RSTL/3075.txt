11. FROM facts connected with crystallization and elasticity, it seems ex-
tremely probable, that the atoms of matter do not attract each other indiffe-
rently on all sides. There appears to be peculiar points on their surfaces
which have a more powerful attraction for each other, than for other points on
the same molecule. This property is not peculiar to the atoms of ponderable
matter, but seems also to belong to those of light and heat. It is as impossiþle
to prove directly the existence of this property, as it is to prove the existence
of atoms themselves ; but on account of the satisfactory manner in which it
enables us to explain the phzenomena of crystallization and elasticity, it is now
generally adopted.

2. If the atoms of solid bodies be slightly displaced by any mechanical
means, they will endeavour to return to their former state of aggregation when
