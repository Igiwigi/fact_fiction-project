The ‘China Sea Pilot,’ vol. 3, states that for
a few days in each month, when the moon is near the Equator, there are two high
tides in the day. It is easily seen that for two tides to occur in the day the
amplitude of the semi-diurnal term must be at least a quarter of that of the diurnal
term. It would not, however, vary much with the moon’s declination, whereas that
of the diurnal term vanishes when the moon is on the Equator ; and the above fact
shows that the semi-diurnal tide only attains this fraction of the diurnal tide when
the latter is at its least. The true semi-diurnal tide at the Anamba Islands must
therefore be insignificant. The same is evidently true of the currents, for the tidal
streams take a day to run backwards and forwards.
