or other onwards is 0 or 1.

The complementary probability is the probability that |» (n)| =f (n) for an infinite
sequence of values of nm. It follows that this also is 0 or 1.

3.6. We can apply this to KutnrcHine’s result (2.12). ‘This asserts that, z (m) being
a certain function, the probability of |p (n)| < (1 +8) x(n) for all » from some value
onwards is 1, and the probability of |p (n)| <(1—8)z(m) for all » from some
value onwards is 0.

But the probability of |» (»)| <z(v) for all » onwards is, by what has been proved,
itself 0 or 1. If it is 0 we can replace (1 — c) x (m) by x () in Kum rcutne’s enunciation ;
if it is 1 we can replace (1 +c) x(n) by x(n). We shall show that it is in fact always 0,
and indeed that if we replace
