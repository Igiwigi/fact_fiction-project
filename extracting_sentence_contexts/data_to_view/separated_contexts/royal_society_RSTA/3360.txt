We computed numerically the many-body mobility edge of the system in the forward
approximation, finding that the energy eigenstates of the system indeed localize for small values
of the transverse field at finite system sizes. When plotted against the equilibrium phase diagram
of the model, we discovered that the localized region does not coincide with the glassy phase. In particular, evidence points to the fact that the glassy phase is partitioned into a delocalized
region and a localized one. We conjecture that the glassy, delocalized region will exhibit the same
clustering of eigenstates observed in [29] for the p-spin model, where the eigenstates were found
to form clusters inside of which the energies are distributed according to Wignerâ€”Dyson, while
the global distribution of the energy levels of the model is Poissonian. Moreover, we expect that classical methods that exploit the fine-tuning of thermal relaxation
(such as simulated annealing) will perform poorly in the entire glassy phase, while quantum


annealers will perform poorly only once localization sets in.
