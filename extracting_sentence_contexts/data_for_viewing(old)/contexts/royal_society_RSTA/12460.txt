Of course, the normal stress [eq. (30)] we have adopted for solids is by no means
the same as MAxweELt's, except for non-magnetic bodies whose specific inductive
capacities are the same as for a vacuum. But this does not prevent our normal
stress explaining all that MAxwe t's stress explains, and, indeed, from the remarks
at the beginning of last section, it is now evident that for all useful purposes either
the one stress or the other will serve equally well.

70. We have now compared the results of the present theory with all MaxwEz1’s
results contained in equations (5) to (17), § 60, above, except (16). Except for
equations (12), (13), the agreement is exact, and I think it may now be claimed that
what the present theory gives instead of equation (12), agrees, as well as (12), with
known facts, and what it gives instead of (13) agrees better than (13).

Equation (16) itself is obvious enough since it merely asserts that H’ has a potential
when there are no currents in the field. But it suggests another question—does the
present theory lead to the ordinary mathematical theory of electromagnetism? It
can be easily shown to do so. The mechanical results when expressed in terms of
H’ and I’ have just been shown to result in the same forces and moments on conductors
and magnets regarded as wholes, as does Maxwett's stress. These are all the
mechanical demands of the ordinary theory. Equation (19), § 61, shows that the
relations between the whole magnetic moment per unit volume, the permanent
magnetic moment per unit volume, and the magnetic force at the point, may on the
present theory, be regarded as the same as in the ordinary theory. Only one other
