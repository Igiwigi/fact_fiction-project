Based on these grand mean values he published vertical sections and charts for the
sea-surface and bottom. In all the above-mentioned discussions it is pointed out that, over most of the Irish
Sea proper, there is little change of salinity between the sea-surface and the bottom. This fact greatly enhances the significance of a study of the salinities at the surface only. In 1925 G, P. Farran and J. I. Spicer discussed some of the salinities which had been
determined for the Irish lightvessels. They calculated monthly mean values and
anomalies, and their results have been used in constructing table 3 below.
