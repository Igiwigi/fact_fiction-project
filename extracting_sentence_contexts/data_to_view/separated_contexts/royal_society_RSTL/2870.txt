to 84%, The experiments upon the seeds of the turnip, an important
plant in an agricultural point of view, (about one half of which germinated,) shows
thai the nitrogen which was derived from the atmosphere was more than that which
was contained in the seed. In all these experiments we have the quickness of the
growth of the young plants proportional to the quantity of nitrogen present when
compared with 1000 parts of carbon in the same. With these facts before us, we are enabled to account for plants not continuing to
grow 80 well in pure oxygen gas as in atmospheric air; and by following up the in-

quiry in other departments, we see the wisdom of the all-wise Contriver in consti-

tuting an atmosphere with a decided preponderance of nitrogen and a much smaller
proportion of oxygen. Finding that plants under different circumstances of growth differ in the relative
quantity of nitrogen which they contain, as well as in the other elements which enter
into their constitution, I was desirous of obtaining information which would lead us
to account for the well-known fact of plants increasing most in size during cloudy
weather, and of grasses, for instance, which are shaded (as under hedges), increasing
much in straw, but producing seed both small in quantity and inferior in quality. By way of commencement in this part of the research, I made duplicate experi-
ments with the same kind of seeds, steeped them in and supplied them with the same
kind of water, and kept them under equal circumstances in every respect, except that
of placing one of each in the sun's rays in the greenhouse, where the sun shone till
three y.v., and the other in the same situation, excluded howeyer from the sun's rays,
but not from the light.
