24 and 25 (and to a less degree in fig. 26) was greater than in
fig. 23 on account of the fact that the presence of a moderate amount of load increases
the magnetie susceptibility of iron, especially of iron which is treated as the specimen
under test was treated. * The figures show that the presence of load diminishes the general thermoelectric
effect of magnetisation, and finally reverses it when the load is great.
