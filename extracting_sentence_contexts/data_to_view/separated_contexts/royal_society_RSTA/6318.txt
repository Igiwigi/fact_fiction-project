In the single-particle limit of q >> qr, the RPA becomes exact again, and no systematic
deviations are visible for q = 4.39qp and q = 6.27qp (figure 5e,f). Interestingly, the main source of
error in the RPA at intermediate wavenumbers seems to be a constant shift in F(q, t) that does not
depend on the imaginary time. In fact, it is easy to see that the first derivative of F(q,t) around
the origin is exactly reproduced by the RPA, since it fulfils the f-sum rule; cf. equations (2.17)
and (2.18). From equation (2.22), it is then clear that the bulk of the RPA error should already
be present in the SSF S(q), which is shown in figure 6. The green squares show our exact PIMC
results for r; = 4, and the green dashed line represents the corresponding RPA.
