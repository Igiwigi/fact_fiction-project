But the
= cireularity of the orbib is again stable. This figure at once shows that if planet and satellite be revolving with maximum
{5 ergy as parts of a rigid body, and if, without altering the total moment of
2 momentum, or the equality of the two periods, we impart infinitesimal ellipticity to
Stho orbit, the satellite will fall into the planet. This follows from the fact that the
line n=N runs on to the lope of the ravine. & If on the other hand without affecting the moment of momentum, or the circularity,
= we infinitesimally disturb the relation n=, then the satellite will either recede or
& approach the planet according to the nature of the disturbance. bo These two statements are independent of the nature of the frictional interaction of
S the two bodies.
