The highly developed cytoskeletal network and
their ability to maintain stiffness over a variety of cell lengths
make smooth muscle cells especially well poised for directing
epithelial morphogenesis. Another potentially useful property of smooth muscle for
driving morphogenesis is its geometric anisotropy: muscle
fibres tend to orient in one direction within a tissue. Smooth muscle tissues shorten primarily in the direction of
their fibres, but whether they are, in fact, stiffer in that direc-
tion remains unclear. Studies of the stiffness of individual
smooth muscle cells and whole smooth muscle tissues in
different organisms have yielded conflicting results, with
some reporting that tissues are stiffer along the long axis of
the cells [36] and others reporting higher stiffness along the
short axis [37]; significant changes in stiffness anisotropy
occur after contraction [38,39]. This is even less well studied
in embryonic smooth muscle.
