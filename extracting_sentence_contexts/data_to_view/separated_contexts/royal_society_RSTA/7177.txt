The effect of the previous crystalline history on the
subsequent crystallization half-times is illustrated by two crystallizations carried out at
241° C from a previous melt temperature of 271° CG, but using polymers previously crystal-
lized at 160 and 240° C. The half-times of crystallization were 68 and 44 min respectively. The fact that the melting-point of the crystallites in polyethylene terephthalate depends
on the temperature at which they are formed was demonstrated on the hot-stage polarizing
microscope. It was observed that crystalline regions formed at 110° C melted at 256° C,
whereas regions crystallized at 240° C melted at 264° C.

(e) The crystallized polymer structure

Amorphous polyethylene terephthalate is transparent and becomes opaque when crystal-
lized. The degree of opacity depends on the amount of crystallinity and the temperature
of crystallization.
