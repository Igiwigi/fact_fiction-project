From this area he records immigration ofendoderm which fills the embryonic rudiment
(figure 7, to U here shown, p. 544); a gastric cavity then appears in this solid core of endo-
derm, anda mouth becomes differentiated by a secondary union of ectoderm and endoderm. The anus arises a little later just in front of the blastoporal area. There appears to be no
reason to doubt these facts so clearly shown by the figures. Epiperipatus thus differs from the
Peripatopsis species with large blastodermic vesicles only in the independent origin of the anus
from the mouth, but this condition resembles the commoner state of affairs in other arthro-
pods (see p. 543). The endoderm in Epiperipatus, being first a solid core while in Peripatopsis it
lines a large hollow vesicle, are variations dependent upon the shape of the embryos.
