I 8hall briefly point out the verifications. The references are to Mr.
Darrox's paper in the Philosophical Transactions. Tt is unnecessary to refer
specifically to the testimonies to three facts, as almost all the observations co-

is placed at right angles to the magnetic meridian : 2nd, That there it is only
of small breadth : and 3rd, That it moves southwards.
