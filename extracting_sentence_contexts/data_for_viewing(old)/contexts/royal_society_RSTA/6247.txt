Figure 3. Age contact factors and variation in susceptibility. This shows two alternative models used to fit the data: (a) age
contact factors v modify the pre-pandemic contact matrix C° for different age groups in the population (see equation (2.1)).
(6) Age groups are given a relative susceptibility to acquiring infection (see equation (4.1)). The error bars show 95% credible
intervals. (Online version in colour.)

broadly consistent with [5], who find increased force of infection for those under 60 versus older
individuals. Given the reduced severity of symptoms in these age groups it seems plausible that
this results from higher contact rates, rather than increased rates of shedding. The pattern in older
age groups is somewhat more complex; group 40-44 was found to reduce contacts relative to C°
the most, but interestingly relative rates go up again until the 55-59 age group before reducing
for older individuals. It should be noted that, in contrast to other age groups, absence of data
on pre-pandemic contact rates for care home residents means the estimate for vcy (figure 32)
should not be interpreted as an increase in contact rate. Rather, it is simply a reflection of the fact
that contact rates in care homes are much higher than the rest of the population”! (due to being
communal environments with frequent contacts between residents and staff), which has led to
a disproportionate number of cases, and sadly deaths, compared with the elderly in the general
population.
