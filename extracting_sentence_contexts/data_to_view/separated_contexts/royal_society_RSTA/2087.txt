Inserting (2.5) in (2.3) results in the modified

The modification is, that in contrast to the conventional quantum theory, the time rates of the
weights P; of the density operator (2.3) do not all vanish

The modified von Neumann equation shows that the time dependence of the density operator
(2.3) has two reasons: the quantum mechanical dynamics represented by the commutator in

(2.6); and the time dependence of the propagator Q in (2.6)2. In conventional quantum theory

of isolated systems, the propagator does not appear, because the {p;} are presupposed to be time-

independent, a fact which causes reversibility, as we will see below. Accepting setting I means,

that irreversibility is generated by an in time changing composition of the density operator a. From (2.3), (2.1) and (2.6) follows:
