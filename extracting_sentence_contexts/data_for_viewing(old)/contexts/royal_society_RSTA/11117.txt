* Total associations only.

associations are greater for the young than the old. I have not, however, been able
to say with certainty whether the decrease in association was due to growth (change
in the individual) aided by selection, or growth opposed by selection. The only
available evidence suggested that selection acted in the same direction as growth.

The total associations between defects were always high, except in some cases for
the very old, but the partial associations for defective universes were in most cases
low, and in some cases even certainly negative. The partial, associations for un-
defective universes were, on the other hand, higher than the total coefficients, a fact
which I held to imply that no one of the defects recorded was necessary as a connecting
link between any other pair.

§ 70. During the course of the present investigation I have naturally been led
to study pretty thoroughly the “Report” of the Committee on Childhood, and the
papers by Dr. WARNER, bearing on the same subject, in the ‘ Journal of the Royal
Statistical Society ’—papers which first drew my attention to the need of a
theoretical study of the whole subject of association. I may be pardoned, then, for
offering some suggestions as to the work of the Committee as regards both the mode
