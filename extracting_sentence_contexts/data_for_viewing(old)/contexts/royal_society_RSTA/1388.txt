Figure 2 presents the change in runoff for a 7% increase in precipitation for various loss values
and changes in loss. Where the fraction lost is zero, the runoff change is constant, in line with
the precipitation increase. But even if there is no change in the loss fraction, as long as losses
occur, the precipitation increase does not traslate to the same percentage change in the runoff,
and in fact is higher that the precipitation change. If future conditions become wetter (x <1),
say due to increased mean rainfalls, the loss fraction decreases, and the runoff change is greater
than the precipitation change. Alternatively if future conditions become drier (x > 1), say due to
greater evaporation and less rainfall lowering soil moisture content, the percentage change in
runoff is less than the percentage change in precipitation. In fact, the percentage change in runoff
can be negative despite increases in extreme rainfall. These decreases in runoff are only exhibited
for relatively large (soil) drying changes. For example, a 35% loss with 20% (x = 1.2) increase in
drying (i.e 42% loss) will result in a negative runoff change for a 7% increase in precipitation. For
greater drying trends, for example 40% (x = 1.4), negative runoff occurs at a 17% initial loss (24%
after factoring).

Due to the nonlinearity of the rainfall-runoff relationship a change in unit volume may not
necessarily be representative of changes in the hydrograph distribution with storm intensification
leading to changes above what can be expected by simple volume increases [71-73]. Additionally,
as there is an interaction between catchment size and storm duration changes in short duration
rainfall extremes are less likely to affect larger catchments [73]. Likewise, the interaction between
changes in the spatial characteristics of storm cells [46,7476] and catchment runoff is size (scale)
