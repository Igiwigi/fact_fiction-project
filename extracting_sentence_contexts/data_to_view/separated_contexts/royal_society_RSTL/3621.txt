I have distinguished the chief varieties of each kind by different shadings in the
accompanying Plate; whereby it will be more readily seen, that in the same hori-
zontal plane, even in this limited space of half a square mile, there is a very con-
siderable difference in the nature of the soil. Although it might, @ priori, have been
expected that fine earthy particles gradually subsiding from tranquil water, year after
year, would form a series of thin layers, in none of the excavations was there an
instance of the lamination of the sediment. To this remarkable fact, observed in all
the excavations, both here and on the site of Memphis, I sball have occasion to refer
in a subsequent part of this memoir. When we consider the small amount of sediment left annually by the inundation
in any one place, it is very difficult to conceive how there should be in any one spot,
80 great a thickness of one kind of sediment without any lamination or other sign of
successive deposition. For example, in the Excavation E. there is scarcely any per-
ceptible difference in the nature of the soil to a depth of 124 feet, a thickness which,
if accumulated by annual deposits, would be the work of a vastly long period*.
