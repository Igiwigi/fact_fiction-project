Recently, two-dimensional grids of prestressed elastic rods, subject to in-plane incremental
normal and shear forces and bending moment, have been advocated as materials that can be
designed to exhibit instabilities inside the elastic range as well as to display tunable effective
properties [23]. However, loss of ellipticity in these materials has been so far shown to be possible
only when compression is involved, so that the locus of material stability for the homogenized
material is unbounded in tension. This circumstance is a direct consequence of the fact that usually
elastic rods only buckle in compression. However, real materials exhibit localization of strain
for all stress states, including tension [24]. Therefore, it might be superficially (and erroneously)
concluded that it is impossible to design an artificial material with a bounded stability domain,
using a grid of elastic rods.
