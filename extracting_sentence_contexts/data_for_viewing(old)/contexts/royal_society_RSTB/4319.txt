The third pouch (tigs. 19 and 20, cl. 8, and 25, 26, 30, 31 and 33, tm. ILI and
ep-». U1) still shows a remnant of its pharyngeal connection (fig. 30, ph.c.), rather
better marked than in the preceding embryo, and is also joined to the primordium of
the cervical thymus by a solid cellular cord (the ductus ecto-entobranchialis TI)
arising now, not from its ventral end as in the last embryo, but from about the mid-
region of its length (figs. 19 and 20, d.e.b, III). On the right side in embryo (b),
this connection has already disappeared. The pouch itself (figs. 19 and 20, cl. 3) has
much the same general form as in the preceding stage. At its dorsal end it is cranio-
caudally flattened but over the rest of its extent it is cylindrical. Below the connec-
tion with the cervical thymus, it tapers to a blunt point and is slightly curved in the
caudo-ventral direction. The pouch differs especially from that of the last embryo
in the fact that the ventral solid portion in that stage has now grown down for a
distance of 0°08 mm. (left side) below the connection with the cervical thymus as the
well-marked tapering process above referred to. The pouch has a total dorso-ventral
extent of 0°26 mm. and is thus longer than that of the last embryo. As in the latter,
it possesses a lumen in its dorsal half, the lumen being larger in embryo (a) than in
(b), but is solid throughout its ventral half. At its dorsal end, the pouch extends for
a short distance (0°05 mm. on left side) above the level of the remnant of the
pharyngeal connection.

The walls of the pouch show the same differentiation into the primordia of
thymus III and epithelial body II as in the last embryo, but the transformation is
now more marked and is especially well seen in the longitudinal sections of embryo
(a) (figs, 25, 26 and 31, tm. [IL and ep.b. III). In the sections, the cranial and caudal
