of classical mechanics, which one might prefer to be a consequence of fundamental quantum
principles. On the other hand, the principle was related to the fact that the observable parts
of measuring instruments are classically describable ‘circuits’, just as they are in Chiribella,
D’Ariano and Perinotti’s framework. Heisenberg needed new variables because the classical
variables did not give Bohr’s frequency rules for spectra, and the corresponding probabilities
or statistics. Heisenberg discovered, almost by a guess, that these rules are satisfied by, in


general, non-commuting matrix variables with complex coefficients, related to amplitudes, from | 2 |
which one derives, by means of a Born-type rule, probabilities or statistics for transitions

between stationary states, transitions manifested in spectra, observed in measuring devices. In a
this way, Heisenberg’s derivation was essentially related to the fact that the observable parts of 1B
measuring instruments are classically describable devices, which are akin to ‘operational circuits’ ig
in Chiribella, D’Ariano and Perinotti’s or related quantum-informational schemes, such as that 18
of Hardy, except that these schemes, in order to derive QFDT, start with giving a mathematical :
structure to these circuits themselves.

This approach is motivated by Chiribella, D’Ariano and Perinotti’s aim to arrive at the
mathematical architecture of QFDT in a more first-principle-like way; in particular, independently
of the mathematics of classical physics. (The latter, to begin with, does not have discrete
variables, such as spin, which are purely quantum, with which QFDT is associated.) The rules :
governing the structure of operational circuits are indeed more empirical. These rules, however, =
are not completely empirical, because (beyond the fact that no rules could even be completely 3
empirical) operational circuits are given a mathematical structure. This is parallel to Heisenberg’s
