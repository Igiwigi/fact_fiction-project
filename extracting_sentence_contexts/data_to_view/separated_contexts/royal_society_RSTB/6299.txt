With the information we have gained above, however, it is now possible to
correct this 29-day mean for the expected lunar influence based primarily on the
curves shown in figs. 4 and 6 and the information in Table IV. The factors that have to be considered are

(1) the mean + and — departures at no moon and full moon ;

(2) the fact that the differences are at their minimum in June and maximum in
October ;

(3) the alteration in asymmetry of the corrections from the months before mid- -
June to those after. With these facts as a basis, there has finally been added to fig. 7 a third curve
(dotted) showing the 29-day mean corrected as nearly as possible for the lunar
influence.
