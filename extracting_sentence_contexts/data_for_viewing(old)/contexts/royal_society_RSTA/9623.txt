* It is of importance to use strip of pure tungsten. We obtained some tungsten strip which con-
tained impurities, probably silica which completely changed its oxidation properties from that
characteristic of pure tungsten. We obtained pure tungsten strip through the courtesy of the British
Phomson-Houston Company, of Rugby.



ON ADSORPTION OF INDIUM ATOMS ON TUNGSTEN ONIDE = 105

tungsten filament bombarded with caesium atoms, a similar relation has been
observed, the positive ion current being independent of the temperature of the fila-
ment provided that this temperature is above a certain minimum value. This fact
has been interpreted by Lancmure and others as due to a dynamic equilibrium in
which the number of neutral atoms reaching the filament per second is balanced by
the number of positive ions leaving it.

In the present experiments, following Lancmurr, let us suppose that the rate of
emission of positive ions, v., and of neutral atoms, v,, from the filament, depends only
on the temperature of the filament, T°A, and on the population of the atoms on
the oxide surface. Let us express this population as a fraction, 0, of the number of
atoms which could be accommodated on the surface in a complete mono-
molecular layer.

Then v, =f (0,T); »% = 4 (0, T).
