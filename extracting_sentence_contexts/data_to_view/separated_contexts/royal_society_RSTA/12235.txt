The mechanical action between the two regions is fully represented by
stress Py over their interface, and the forcive of B upon A is fully represented
the E and Hin B acting upon the fictitious matter and current produced on
boundary of B, on the assumption that E and H terminate there. If the no
and Py be drawn the other way, thus negativing them both, as well as the fictitious
matter and current on the interface, then it is the forcive of A on B that is repre

sented by the action of E and H in A on the new interfacial matter and current. That is, the E and H in the region A may be done away with altogether, because
their abolition will immediately introduce the fictitious matter and current equivalent,
so far as B is concerned, to the influence of the region A. Similarly E and H in B
may be abolished without altering them in A. And, generally, any portion of the
medium may be taken by itself and regarded as being subjected to an equilibrating
system of forces, when treated as a rigid body.
