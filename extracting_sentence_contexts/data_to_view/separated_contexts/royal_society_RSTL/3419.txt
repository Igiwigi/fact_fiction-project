If they are, he expects and
finds the corresponding current ; if they are not, he expects and he finds no current,
though the circuit be a good conductor and he look carefully for it (1829.).

1864. Again; taking the case of iron, platina, and solution of sulphuret of potas-
sium, there is no current ; but for iron substitute zine, and there is a powerful cur-
rent. I might for zine substitute copper, silyer, tin, cadmium, bismuth, lead, and
other metals ; but I take zinc, because its sulphuret dissolves and is carried off by
the solution, and $0 leaves the case in a very simple state : the fact, however, is as
strong with any of the other metals. Now if the eontact theory be true, and if the
iron, platina, and solution of sulphuret of potassium give contacts which are in perfect
equilibrium as to their electromotive force, then why does changing the iron for zinc
destroy the equilibrium? Changing one metal for another in a metallic circuit causes
no alteration of this kind : nor does changing one substance for another among the
great number of bodies which, as solid conductors, may be used to form conducting
(but chemically inactive) circuits (1867, &c.).
