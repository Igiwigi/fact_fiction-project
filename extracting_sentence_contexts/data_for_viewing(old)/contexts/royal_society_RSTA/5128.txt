localization and interaction with its assembly catalyst: in the periplasm, after DSE traversing the
OM through the usher, and in the extracellular milieu.

(c) Translocation through the usher

By comparing the FimD-FimC-FimH and FimD-FimC-FimF-FimG-FimH structures, two large
conformational changes were identified within FimH. In the FimD-FimC-FimH complex, where
the lectin domain of FimH (FimH_) is inside the FimD pore and the pilin domain of FimH
(FimHp) is in DSC with FimC and bound to the usher CTDs, the two FimH domains are aligned
(i.e. making an angle of 180°) [43]. In the FimD-FimC-FimF-FimG-FimH complex, where both
FimH domains are outside on the extracellular milieu side of the pore, the angle between the two
domains decreases by 37.5° and the FimH,, domain changes from a compressed and translocation-
competent state to a decompressed and receptor-competent state. The fact that FimH adopts a
more angled shape led to the suggestion that the conformational change acts as a lock to prevent
backsliding of FimH into the periplasm and that translocation might be made unidirectional by
conformational changes within subunits as the nascent pilus emerges from the usher pore [27].
Interestingly, the major pilin subunit (FimA in type I pili and PapA in P pili) is known to adopt a
superhelical structure of about 3.3 subunits per turn as the FimA or PapA polymer exits the usher
pore to form the pilus rod [16]. Rod formation at the usher exit would also be able to prevent
backsliding during pilus elongation.

But where does the driving force for the translocation step originate from? Geibel et al. [27
(figure 4, view i) recently described a low-energy exit path within the lumen of the FimD
pore, which imposes on the subunits a combined translation/rotation which is of the same
magnitude as the translation/rotation that chaperone-subunit complexes must be subjected
