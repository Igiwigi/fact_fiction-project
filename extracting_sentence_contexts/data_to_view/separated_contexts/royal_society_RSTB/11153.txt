An elegant description of a mechanism based on
cooperative MinD membrane attachment was formula-
ted shortly after the works described above. It suggests
that membrane-bound MinD linearly increases the MinD
binding rate [32]. Explicitly, the MinD attachment term is
given by

Taq = wa(1 + @aaCa + WdeCde) Cp. (2.7)

In fact, the term waeCae, Which indicates that MinD binding is
enhanced by membrane-bound MinD in any form, can be
omitted and pole-to-pole oscillations emerge [33]. All these mechanisms reproduce essential features of
the Min system in geometries that correspond to E. coli
cells. Notably, they exhibit a reduction of the oscillation
period with increasing MinE concentration.
