Doubtless a plant which has no inherent resistance to the virus will eventually be
infected in all or nearly all its parts; though not necessarily in the same concentration
throughout. Before the complete dissemination of the virus has taken place, however,
reinfection with another strain is obviously possible. Such, in fact, does occur and is
referred to on p. 163 (see X%). It will be observed that whilst the concentration of X‚Äù is very low in the recently
formed stolons and tubers, it is abundantly present at the base of the stem from which
they are growing. Hence it may be said that the concentration of the virus is a function
of the relative age of the plant organs rather than of their spatial relationship.
