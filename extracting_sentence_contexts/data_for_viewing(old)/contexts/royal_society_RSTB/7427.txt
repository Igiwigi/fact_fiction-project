arising from the edges of the disk of blastomeres in P. capensis (pp. 501 and 530), and (11)
the replacement of this endoderm by cells immigrating inwards from the blastoporal area or
primitive streak in several species (see pp. 501, 510 and 512). (12) The nature of the yolk

536 S. M. MANTON ON STUDIES ON THE ONYCHOPHORA. VII

The opposite view, quoted above, concerning the ancestry of the viviparous non-yolky
Onychophora of type 2 cannot be seriously entertained. Willey (1898) states that ‘there is no
reason whatever to suppose that there has been a secondary loss of yolk’ in P. capensis and in
Paraperipatus novae-britanniae, but he obtained no clear details of either segmentation of germ-
layer formation, and had in fact no data with which to uphold his views. Bouvier had no
embryological evidence of his own. His views are discussed on p. 538.

Differences in segmentation, germ-layer formation, yolk sac, etc., occurring in the several
Species of Peripatopsis, and their bearing upon evolution within the Onychophora

The state of the literature on onychophoran development has given the impression that
there is wide variation in ontogeny within the group, and ‘in extreme cases the assembling
of the germ layers seems to be almost haphazard’ and ‘it would appear that the manner of
development has little significance’ (Snodgrass 1938). I am in disagreement with both
these statements. On the contrary, when facts are sifted from fiction, there is extraordinary
uniformity in the essential processes of development, in spite of the enormous variations in
the amounts of yolk present in the eggs of different species, and the manner of development
