PROPERTIES OF THE LEAF OF DIONABA, 439

Experiment V., Aug. 18 (diagram 6).—Here the difference was [10°6, but
diminished to 9°3 during the first rheotome observation. The character of the
excitatory effect resembled that observed in Experiment III., but the

| phase lasted
longer. The after effect, as in Experiment III., was Fs

a A second observation was made an hour after the first, in which the preparation was
'§ found to be changing in the direction of modification, though no extraneous current
2 had been led through it, for the | phase was both weaker and of much shorter
3 duration, as evidenced by the fact that during the second second the under surface
3 was feebly negative, instead of strongly positive. Modification was promptly effected
in the usual way. The difference, which had diminished to {5°6, changed sign
8 and became |3°5, and the resistance had so diminished that with the same length
3 of wire the deflection, which had before been 280, became 75 x 10.
