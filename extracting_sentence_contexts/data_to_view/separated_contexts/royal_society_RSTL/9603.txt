Also, the relatively
greater length of the spines in the smaller specimens makes it much more difficult
for the lantern to touch the table. This view is confirmed by the fact that, on cutting
the spines of young specimens shorter, these small Zchins begin to use their lanterns
after the manner of larger specimens. But, be this as it may, the fact that in young
specimens the lanterns rarely touch the table is proof that the spines are here alone
sufficient to produce locomotion. Again, as before observed, these peculiar movements
of the lantern take place under cireumstances where they can be of no use in pro-
ducing locomotion. Thus, for instance, they take place in young specimens in the
same way as in old, although, as jus stated, the lanterns in this case do not touch the
table at all.
