Even though the surface of the Earth is made up of about 70% water, only 2.5% of this is fresh
water that is fit for human use. The majority of this fresh water is tied up in glaciers or is deep
underground [1]. Water shortage is currently an ongoing global concern, which is reflected in the
fact that water scarcity is one of the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals [2]. It is
imperative that this water need is addressed and, with a growing global population, novel ideas
must be explored. Dew, fog and rainwater collection has taken place for hundreds of years, but
to date only minimum information based on nature has been used to inform the design of such
harvesting devices. Unlike fog and rain water, dew is a source of water that has the potential to be
exploited all year round, with moisture always being present in the air to a greater or lesser degree
depending on the humidity [3]. With this in mind, a review of airborne moisture harvesting :
species of plants and animals dwelling in arid regions was carried out by Malik et al. [4]. That es
review stimulated this particular study on cacti that are able to survive in arid regions of the globe. a

The Atacama Desert is the driest place on the Earth [5] and is host to the cactus Copiapoa 13
cinerea var. haseltoniana. This particular species of cactus was observed to condense dew on its :
spines [6, p. 67] and so became a focus of this study, together with two other known species of 8
