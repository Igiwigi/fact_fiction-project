consistent enough in itself. The variability, normally about 5 per cent., which seems
rather pronounced on the flat part of the curves, is due to the cumulative effect of the
errors inherent in the determination of the currents. The percentage error should be
independent of the magnitude of the currents, and consequently is not so noticeable
on the lower parts of the diagram where the relative currents are smaller. It is
probable that the main source of error lies in the variation of the rate of emission
with the growth of the drops, and it will be noticed that it is most pronounced in
curve III., where the drops were formed with exceptional slowness (at the rate of 4 in
90 seconds). However, I believe that the accuracy of the measurements is sufficient
to establish the conclusions which it is intended to draw from them.

It will be noticed that the shapes of the curves are all much the same, the most notice-
able difference being that they are spaced widely apart on the voltage axis. In fact,
it is clear from an inspection of fig. 3, that if any two of the curves are given suitable
horizontal displacements, they can be made nearly to coincide with the remaining one.
The explanation of such a result seemed obvious. The shapes of the characteristic
curves are the same in the different experiments, but they occur at different places
along the voltage axis. Now the voltage V plotted along this axis is that given bya
