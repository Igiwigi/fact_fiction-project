Under the cuticle lies a clear yellow layer of chitin, 7, and below this again a broad
layer, covered with strize, 7. These can have uo effect on the colour, because they are
situated too deeply. It should be mentioned that special attention was at first paid
to these wings, owing to the fact that by transmitted light they showed such a deep
red colour complementary to that reflected, and it was not until the sections were
examined that it was seen that below the layer of clear chitin, e, there was a double
layer of crimson pigment, p, separated by a pale yellow layer of chitin, f The
pigment is granular and presents a very striking appearance, although its significance
is not clear. Below the pigment is another layer of transparent chitin, and below
this again a yellow layer, 4, the exterior surface of which is covered by small
papillee, s. In the right-hand corner of the section this membrane has been flattened,
so that the papillee are seen in plan.
