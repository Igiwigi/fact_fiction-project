But it is equally
true in the case of Hardy’s continuity axiom. According to M. Dickson: a]

The quantum state is ‘continuous’ (in Hardy’s sense) because for any two pure states, [s
there is another pure state that is ‘between’ them, and in fact this ‘middle’ state is a 8
superposition of the two original states. In other words, continuity holds precisely because :
the superposition principle holds. Continuity fails in the classical theory because the
superposition principle fails there.
