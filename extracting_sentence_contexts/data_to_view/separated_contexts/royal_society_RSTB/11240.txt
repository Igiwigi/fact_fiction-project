There is no conventionality in
the denotative relation (as it is the case for symbols) nor
there is merely a spatio-temporal contiguity between the
icon and the object it denotes (as it is the case for indexes). There is, instead, a similarity relation that depends exclusively
on the structure of the icon and on its quality (CP 2.92).

[...] An icon is a representamen of what it represents and for the
mind that interprets it as such, by virtue of its being an immedi-
ate image, that is to say by virtue of characters which belong to it
in itself as a sensible object, and which it would possess just the
same were there no object in nature that it resembled, and though
it never were interpreted as a sign. [...] A geometrical diagram is
a good example of an icon. A pure icon can convey no positive or
factual information; for it affords no assurance that there is any
such thing in nature. But it is of the utmost value for enabling
its interpreter to study what would be the character of such an
object in case any such did exist. Geometry sufficiently illustrates
that (CP 4.447).
