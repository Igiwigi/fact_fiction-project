probably negligible when measured on a large enough number of separate hatches ;
and so far as the economics of poultry farming are concerned, this information is sufficient.
For it is the average of the incubation results for the year’s working that is economically
important, and it appears that, although individual hatches may fluctuate, this average
will remain sensibly the same whether the eggs are cooled or not. j

Time-Lag due to Cooling.—It will be seen that the times of hatching in Table XT. are
far less erratic than the changes of percentage. In every case the cooled eggs hatch out
later than the non-cooled. Now the eggs were cooled from the second to the nineteenth
day.i.e., 18 times. If these 18 daily coolings are added together and expressed in hours the
numbers in the last column are obtained ; and if these numbers are compared with those
in the last column but one a rough, but unmistakable, agreement between them appears,
the weighted means for the two columns being, in fact, practically equal.

The retardation in the time of hatching of cooled eggs is thus, in all probability, satis-
factorily accounted for by the temporary suspension of growth while the eggs are out
of the incubator, and it does not seem necessary to invoke any other cause, such as a
weakening of the cooled embryos, to explain it.

Fluctuations in Change of Percentage with Cooling.—These are so much larger than the
fluctuations which accompany changes in other physical conditions of incubation that
they seem to require special examination.

When the eggs in an incubator are divided into the two equal groups which are to be
treated differently during incubation, and of which the hatchings are subsequently to
