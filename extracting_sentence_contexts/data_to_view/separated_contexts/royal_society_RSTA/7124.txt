This might either be because the motion was not steady,
or because the velocity gradient was so large that the velocity depended critically on the
depth of the particle of resin below the free surface. In some previous but less precise experiments (1861) Caligny had observed a backward
movement of grains of sand and resin on the bottom. But this movement diminished
rapidly with distance from the wave maker and seems to have been due to the fact that
locally the waves were not progressive. Mitchim (1939)

A systematic experimental study of deep-water waves was made by Mitchim (1939) using
a tank 60ft. long, 1ft. wide and 3 ft. deep. The depth of water was 2-5 ft., and the wave-
lengths investigated were from 2 to 5 ft., or less than twice the depth of water; thus the waves
were, effectively, in deep water.
