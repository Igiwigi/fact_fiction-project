zamia, and Encephalartos coexists with the polystely proper to the genus Medullosa.

While the anatomy of the stem was thus being elucidated by the discoveries of
successive observers, the nature of the leaf was also becoming known. The discovery
that Myeloxylon is the leaf-stalk of Medullosa, originally made by Weser, was
referred to by ScHENK in 1882, but the stem bearing the Myeloxylon was by him
simply described as that of a Cycad.*

The connection with Medullosa was recognised as probable by Count Somms-
Lavsacu in 1887, and further confirmed by ScHENK in 1889.{ ZxrrueR, however,
in 1890 still treated the question as an open one. The memoir of WEBER and
STERZEL (1896) for the first time gave the evidence fully, and, as it seems to me,
established, beyond reasonable doubt, the fact that the species Medullosa Leuckarti
bore as its leaf-stalks a Myeloxylon of the type M. Landrioti of Renavur.ยง The
latest investigations of Count Sorms-Lavsacn have fully confirmed their conclusion,
though that author reserves his judgment as to the specific identification of the
Myeloxylon in question.||

The connection of Myeloxylon with Medullosa having been finally established, the
previous discovery by Renavuut that the Myeloxylon petioles belonged to compound
leaves with the characters of Alethopteris and Neuropteris,1 became of the greatest
importance, as determining the nature of the foliage of Medullosa. It now became
clear, as Srur had previously suggested, that the fronds of these genera (to which
others may probably have to be added) were not those of true Ferns, but of the
peculiar semi-Cycadaceous family, Medullosez.
