The magnetite layer on the clay particles was thick enough for conferring to the composite
particles a high enough magnetic response, capable of providing a very high MR effect in aqueous
suspensions, even for 10% w/v particle concentration.

The SMA/alginate ferrogels, containing a particle volume fraction as low as 0.93% v/v,
presented an MR effect up to 64%, under application of magnetic fields with intensity around that
required for the magnetic saturation of the particles. The MR effect reached significant values for
shear strains lower than 10%. At higher strains, the viscoelastic response of the magnetic gels was
predominantly determined by the resilience of the polymer—particle network, and the magnetic
forces lost their influence because of the large gap between the particles.

The rod-like shape of the composite particles plays a central role in conditioning the intensity
of the MR effect. In fact, we used a parameter for the quantification of the MR effect that only
takes into account the particle shape (normalizing by the saturation magnetization, the applied
field and the particle volume fraction). Using this parameter, such effect in ferrogels with rod-
like particles (64%) becomes considerably larger than those reached in ferrogels with spherical
microparticles (11-15%).
