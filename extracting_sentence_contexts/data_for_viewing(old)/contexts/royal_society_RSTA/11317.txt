These experiments were many times repeated with the same results. The effect
of the electric field was equally marked when the distance between the plates was
increased to 1°3 centims. The drops produced while the electric field was maintained
were too few to be detected. All the nuclei produced by the action of the uranium
appear therefore to be charged.

Metals.

The same apparatus was used, but the float was omitted and a polished zine plate
was substituted for the tin. The arrangements were in fact exactly the same as in
the experiments on the nuclei produced by the action of ultra-violet light on zine,
with the omission of the apparatus necessary for producing these rays. The results
obtained were entirely negative.
