AND CARCINOGENIC PROPERTIES OF 4-AMINOSTILBENE 177

rarity or even non-occurrence spontaneously, the fact that this remarkable tumour is so
frequent and characteristic a result of treatment with aminostilbenes as well (e.g. being
especially prominent in experiment 124 in which 4-dimethylaminostilbene was fed in the
diet), strongly suggests some common feature in the carcinogenic action of aminostilbenes
and aminofluorenes; this point will be further considered below. This first series of experi-
ments therefore revealed the carcinogenic action of various aminostilbenes in the albino
rat; of seventy-two animals exposed to the action of one or other of four such compounds,
twenty-three developed a total of eight sarcomata and thirty distant tumours as a
result. <«  _Im the second series of experiments (table 15), 4-amino-, 4-dimethylamino- and
S 4-dimethylamino-2’-methylstilbenes, with 1-(4’-dimethylaminophenyl)-2-(1’-naphthyl)-
3 ethylene, were examined by repeated subcutaneous injection of solutions in arachis oil in
& male and female mice and rats.
