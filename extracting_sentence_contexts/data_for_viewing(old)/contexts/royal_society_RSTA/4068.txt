antiferroelectric-ferroelectric switch field in the fabricated PBLZST thin films. As shown in
figure 5a-d, e and tan increase at room temperature with bias field Epc up to a certain value
of bias field, after which they decrease rapidly, thus suggesting a field-induced antiferroelectric—
ferroelectric phase transition. Nevertheless, the antiferroelectric_ferroelectric switch field is found
to shift towards higher Epc upon increasing the film thickness. Figure 6 shows the breakdown
field (Eg) and the field-induced antiferroelectric-ferroelectric (Earp—pe) and ferroelectric—
antiferroelectric (EfE— Arg) switch fields as a function of film thickness: Eg decreases and Eare—FE
and Erg_are increase with increasing film thickness, respectively. Note that a great variation of
breakdown and switch fields is detected at 400 nm, at which the ‘mostly’ rhombohedral to mixed
thombohedral/tetragonal phase transition occurs, as mentioned above.

Figure 7a-d depicts P-E loops obtained in PBLZST thin films. Low electrical hysteresis and
ferroelectric-like loops characterize the studied films, a fact attributed to a low antiferroelectric—
ferroelectric switch field. At temperatures above 53°C, P-E loops exhibited a leaky performance,
and for this reason, ECE in the 200nm PBLZST was measured indirectly within the 0-53°C
temperature span, as opposed to 0-120°C in the thicker films. ECE, i.e. temperature change (AT)
