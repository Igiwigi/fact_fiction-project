J. PRESTWICH ON SUBMARINE TEMPERATURES.

in the Mediterranean by SaussURE in 1780, of 55*8 F. at 944 feet, and 55*5 at
1918 feet, remain substantially correct to the present day. It was, however, D'Urvuuis's
more extended observations in 1826 that made better known the fact that the tempe-
rature decreased from the surface down to 200 brasses (1066 feet), below which it
remained constant at about 13? C., or between 54 and 95* F. Still his greatest depth
did not exceed 3189 feet; but BirarD in 1831 extended the observations to a depth of
6377 feet, and till found the same degree of temperature.
