more complex gestural use (table 1). We used similar responses
for our models (but assessed at the dyadic level) and identical
distributions as for the individual models: dyadic repertoire
size (M1-Dyad), dyadic probability of accounting for recipients’
attentional states (M2-Dyad); dyadic flexibility (M3-Dyad) and
dyadic probability of using gestural sequences (M4-Dyad). In
all these sets of models, we included maternal kinship, dyadic
bond and species as main predictors. We always controlled for
absolute age difference and sex combination, and as above, in
M1-Dyad and M3-Dyad, for observational effort. As each indi-
vidual was included in multiple dyads (N= 210), we entered
both individual identities as random factors in all the dyadic
models, using multi-membership models to account for the fact
that the same individual identities can appear in both variables
(individual 1 or individual 2 in each dyad) and thus control for
the lack of independency in these data points. For each set of
models, we finally compared the models above to simpler
models only including random factors and controls (ie.

observational effort, age difference and sex combination in M1-
Dyad and M3-Dyad, age difference and sex combination in
M2-Dyad and M4-Dyad).

Finally, we ran two last sets of models to assess whether the
probability of eliciting recipients’ response was predicted by
