of the same species 21 centims. long not a trace of reflecting substance can be
detected either in the form of iridocytes or otherwise, either near the outer surface
or at the inner surface. This suggests a relation between the presence of the
reflecting substance and the conditions of life of the Fish, which will be more fully
considered in another section of this paper.

II.—-CuemicaL Composition AND SPECTROSCOPIC PROPERTIES OF THE PIGMENTS
AND REFLECTING SUBSTANCE.

The reflecting substance which composes the iridocytes and argenteum of the skins
of Fishes is guanin, the optical properties of which are very remarkable. The presence
of guanin in Fishes’ skins was first demonstrated by Barreswit and Vorr, about
30 years ago. This important physiological fact was reached indirectly by the
analysis of the peculiar substance used for the manufacture of artificial pearls. These
pearls are made chiefly in Paris from material which goes under the names of “blanc
dablette” and “essence d’Orient.”  Ablette is the French name for the Bleak, a
fresh-water Fish whose specific name is Alburnus lucidus, and from the scales of which
the substance is prepared. Barreswit* examined this substance and found that it
was insoluble in water, in ammonia, and in acetic acid, soluble in sulphuric, nitric,
and hydrochloric acid; that the salts from these solutions had a characteristic
crystalline form; that the sulphuric combination was easily decomposed by water ;
that the nitric solution, on evaporation, yielded a yellow compound which was
transformed by potash to a red substance, that the nitric salt was precipitated by
nitrate of silver. In all these, and various other properties the substance resembled
the guanin of Bopo Unger, isolated from guano in 1845.
