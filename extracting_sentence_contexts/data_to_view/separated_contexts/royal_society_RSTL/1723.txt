The specific gravity of the whole I found
to be 10'237 ; and it weighed 34500 grains. No. 15, 16, 17, 18 are cylindrical tubes of brass, 2:06 inches in diameter
on the outside, 4 inches long, and 0-13 inch thick. These, however, are not,
different tubes, but consist of one and the same cylindrical outer piece ; and
is in fact the tube into which the leaden cylinder is made to slide, as men-
tioned in the preceding article. This cylindrical outer piece is capable of
being varied in the four following ways, by means of an inner sliding tube. No. 15 is when both the ends are open, with the exception of a narrow cross
piece at the top, to which the screw is attached.
