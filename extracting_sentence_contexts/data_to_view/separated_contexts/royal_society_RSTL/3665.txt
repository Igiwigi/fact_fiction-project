At the former, the /ower station, the dampness is greatest in
the morning and evening, and has a minimum between 1 and 2 p.m. At the wpper
Station, on the contrary, the dampness increases almost continually from morning till
night. These facts are perfectly normal*, and are readily explained by the continual
rise of the imperfectly condensed moisture which occupies the valleys of the Alps
every fine night in summer, and is gradually exhaled into the upper atmosphere by
the action of currents and the increasing warmth of the inferior strata,â€”a phenome-
non from which arises (amongst other effects) the very frequent formation, about
noon in the finest weather, of clouds at a height of from 8 to 15000 feet, which again
give way during the advance of evening as the vapour descends. 73. The curve of mean dampness at both stations (VII.) exhibits a morning and
afternoon maximum about 9 a.m. and 3 P.y., preceding somewhat the epochs of
maximum loss of solar radiation already referred to.
