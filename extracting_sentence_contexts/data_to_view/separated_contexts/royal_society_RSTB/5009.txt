necessity be an outlet from the common stem into some other part of the vascular
system. But Iam convinced, both by dissection and by the study of serial sections, that
there is no such outlet from the central main stem. For apart from the fact that injection
does not flow freely from this system of vessels into any other, as it almost certainly would
do were the common stem of the system, a factor of some other part of the vascular
or lymphatic systems, the common stem can easily be traced by dissection from one
plexus to the other, and at no part of its course is it in close contact with either a blood
vessel or lymphatic channel, but lies practically free in a stratum of loose connective
tissue. B. Distribution of Main Components on Ventral Surface of Body.
