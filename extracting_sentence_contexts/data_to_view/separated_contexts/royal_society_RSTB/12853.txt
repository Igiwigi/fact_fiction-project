The small deviations between network model and theory are
Let us understand what these equations mean. The matrix due to effects of the random initial values of the connection
IO(t) is the set of output vectors produced by the network weights, which affect the true values of the a;(0), which are
where each row vector corresponds to the output produced approximated by fixed constant values in equation (2.2).>
for one of the inputs to the network. If each a;(t) value was For our purposes, the most important fact to come out of

equation expresses, then, is that the output of the network at captured by the SVD. The time course of learning of each
time t can be described as the weighted sum of the dimensions dimension of the SVD follows a sigmoidal curve whose
