Remarkably, at the level of weak solutions of Navier-Stokes, this has been proved by
Buckmaster & Vicol [33]. However, the solutions produced in [33] are highly irregular and, more
importantly, do not satisfy the stronger condition ‘a la Leray’ (3.5). A totally open question is thus
whether any of the chaotic behaviour witnessed by weak solutions of the Euler equations can in
fact be achieved by limits of Leray solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with bounded kinetic
energy. One possible way to phrase the latter question is the following. Consider the right-hand
sides div R, in the equation (3.16) produced by the iteration scheme described in the previous
paragraph.
