How can communication work, in contexts like this? First, it seems crucial that A and B have
a common understanding that A is trying to help B by providing some useful information (for
example, B needs to establish that A is trying to communicate with her, rather than the person
behind or next to her). It seems they need a common understanding, too, of the fact that B has just
arrived and will be looking to register for the conference (and, among other things, get a name

badge). By drawing attention to her own name badge, A is putting it into common knowledge : =
between A and B that she has already registered, and hence, by implication, that she knows where : =
the registration desk is. It is assumed to be common knowledge between A and B, too, that the : Pa
location of the registration desk is not known to B (after all, the room is crowded). Indeed, were the : =
room empty, the same gesture would have a rather different interpretation: instead of helpfully 28
informing B where the registration desk is (an interpretation that would be blocked by the fact that : 3S
it would be common knowledge that A knows this already because it is in plain sight), it would :3
be more likely to be interpreted as a somewhat officious instruction that A should go straight to : S
the desk and get registered. By smiling back, and pointing, B is acknowledging that the message a
is received, and its content understood, before acting on it (by battling through the crowd in the Ss

appropriate direction). These interpretations only make sense, of course, in the light of a great deal
of shared background knowledge between A and B: that conferences have registration desks, the
registration desk typically gives out badges, and much more.

Suppose that B responds instead by smiling back at A and holding a conference pack aloft,
so that it can be easily seen above the crowd. B could be holding a conference pack that she has
simply borrowed from another attendee, perhaps to check out the schedule; but by holding it aloft
