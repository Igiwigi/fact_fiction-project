added to what has already been noticed in the preceding observations. In general
it may be remarked that, with the exception of the instances in which the bones
found on or close below the stalagmitic floor or on the surface of the third bed,
are more or less dendritic; and in the great majority of cases they present the
characters of extreme antiquity as are shown in the bones of Hyana, Rhinoceros,
It would appear, therefore, from this circumstance, as well as from the positions
which the ursine remains occurred, that they belong to all periods of the Cavern's his
from the earliest to nearly the most recent.

Many among the bones present marks of their having been gnawed, but the conditi
of a great many (and this is especially the case with those of the very young individu
plainly shows that they were tranquilly deposited in or not far from the sites in which
they were found. There can, in fact, be little doubt that amongst the Bear's relics, as
with those of the Hytmna, some at least must have belonged to animals which habitually
used the cavern as a place of refuge, and especially perhaps at the time of parturition
and when they were nursing their young.

With respect to 8ize and other particulars, the bones, as already observyed, exhibit the
extreme diversity which characterizes ursine remains in all situations, and which is as
manifest in the bones of the larger existing species as it is among those of their fossil
representatives. But, besides size, close scrutiny will detect in some of the bones certain
differences, which must, I think, be regarded as indicative of more than mere sexual or
individual peculiarity. Amongst the osteological characters which have been most
generally looked for in the discrimination of fossil Bears, the size and form of the
cranium and lower jaw have been more especially relied upon. The Brixham Collection
