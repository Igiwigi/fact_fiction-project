OXLEY ON THE INFLUENCE OF MOLECULAR

molecules orientate themselves during crystallization under the influence of the local
forcives which are characteristic of the molecular configuration. The influence of these
local forcives will produce in the crystalline medium a distribution of internal stress
which will in general be different across different planes, and in this way the planes
of cleavage can be defined. In the direction where the stress is greatest, we should
expect the elastic properties of the erystal to be abnormally high, comparable in fact
with the elastic properties of steel. In other directions we should expect the elastic properties to be less pronounced,
and indeed the shearing of crystals, merely by the insertion of a knife blade and the
application of small pressure parallel to a plane of cleavage, is evidence of this. The following values of Youne’s Modulus of Rigidity for various ferro-magnetie,
paramagnetic, and diamagnetic media show that the power to resist distortion is of
the same order whatever the magnetic nature of the crystalline medium.
