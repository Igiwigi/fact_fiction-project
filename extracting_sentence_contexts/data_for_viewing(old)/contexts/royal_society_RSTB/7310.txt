It was shown by Helmholtz (1909), Tscherning (1904) and others, that the nodal points
of the crystalline lens are closer to the retina than are those of the cornea. Consequently,
as the refracting power of the crystalline lens is increased during accommodation for near
objects, the nodal points of the eye as a whole move in a posterior direction towards the
retina, thus decreasing the posterior nodal distance of the whole eye, and so reducing the
scale of the images of external objects which are formed on the retina. The decrease in size
is not large, being about 1-6 Â°%, for every dioptre of accommodation. If, then, an object
1 cm. long be placed at a distance of 1 m. from the anterior nodal point of the eye, and if
another object 0-5 cm. long be placed at a distance of 0-5 m. from the same point, then the
images formed of these objects on the retina will differ by 1:6 %, because 1 dioptre of
accommodation is required to change the focus of the eye from the more distant to the
nearer object. This fact may be stated in another way: the image of a given object on the
retina increases in linear dimensions by 101-6 %, when its distance from the anterior
nodal point of the eye is halved. The effect of doubling the size of the test object by using
some other distances is shown in table 79.

It will be seen from table 79 that, provided the distance between the observer and the
