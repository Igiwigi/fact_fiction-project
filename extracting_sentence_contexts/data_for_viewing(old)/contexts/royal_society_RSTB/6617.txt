gated scales, of extreme tenuity in the small individuals, but becoming quite massive
in the large specimens. These are arranged in irregular rows passing downward and
backward. A group of short more massive bones, representing the opercular rays of
other forms, lies just behind the jaw articulation. Immediately ventral to these, that
part of the operculum which lies against the base of the scapula contains a relatively
massive group of polygonal scales. The intergular part of the operculum has small
isolated scales posteriorly, and seems to be naked in front.

The main lateral-line canal can be traced along the flank as a ridge rather above the
middle line on the outer surface of the squamation running into the tail, where it
continues along the dorsal lobe close to the lower margin, becoming less and less
definite as it approaches the tip. The squamation seems to show extremely little
change of character over the lateral-line canal, which is in fact only recognizable along

the flank by the presence of this well-defined ridge. This condition can only imply that
the actual canal ran in a series of special ossifications lying below the scales and perhaps
fixed to their lower surfaces. It is quite clear that the normal Acanthodian condition
of the canal running between rows of scales does not apply to Jschnacanthus, even though
it does to Acanthodes. There is a ventral line on the trunk which can usually be seen
running backward just mesial of the base of the pectoral fin spine.
