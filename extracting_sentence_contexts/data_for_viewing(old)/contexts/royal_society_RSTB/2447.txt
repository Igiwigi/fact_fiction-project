Gleichenias, with the annulus modified as explained above to suit the more crowded
sorus, amd with a smaller number of spores, balanced by a larger number of sporangia
produced in basipetal order, the sorus of Lowsoma would be before us. I do not
suggest that any living Gileichenia was a progenitor of Loxsoma, but Loasoma
appears to me to be a link connecting the Gleichenia-Schizwa affinity with the type of
Dennstedtia and Microlepia. On the other hand, putting aside the low output of
spores, it is from just such a type as Loxsoma that the Hymenophyllaceous series
may have arisen. In all these cases the anatomy of the sporophyte will present
points of interest, and especially the arrangement of the vascular system in their
creeping rhizomes. But this I leave over for discussion by others who are already at
work on this special aspect of the question.

From the facts before us, I conclude that the suggestion of Prest and of Bommer
is a sound one, viz., that the Loxsomacese should be regarded as a distinct tribe,
having affinities with the Gleichenizecese and Schizseaceze on the one hand, and on the
other with the Hymenophyllacese and Dennsteedtiinse ; the attempt should not be
made to force it into any other tribe of living Ferns.

Summary for Loxsoma.

1. The marginal sorus consists of a basal indusium surrounding a conical
receptacle, upon which the sporangia arise in basipetal succession,

2. The sporangia are pear-shaped, with complete, but only partially indurated
oblique annulus, and rather long stalks of medium thickness.
