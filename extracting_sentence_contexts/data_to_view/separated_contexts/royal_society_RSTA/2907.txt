§12. Taking the year as a whole, the ratio borne by the diurnal inequality range
in W to that in N is only 1°18 on disturbed days as compared to 1:46 on quiet days. This is due to the fact that the increase in the range of the mean diurnal inequality
as we pass from quiet to disturbed days is 91 per cent. in N as against 54 per cent.
in W. In this instance the change in passing from quiet to disturbed days is in the
same direction as that observed on quiet days when we pass from years of few to
years of many sunspots. The mean diurnal inequality for the year in N is, on the whole, of the same type
on disturbed and quiet days.
