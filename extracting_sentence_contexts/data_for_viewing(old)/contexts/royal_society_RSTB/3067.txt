and the human female.

Ovulation and the Vitality of the Spermatozoa,—Ovulation in the Bitch takes place
after external bleeding has been going on for several days or when, it is over. It
occurs during the period of cestrus, but is quite independent of coition or of the
presence of spermatozoa in the uterus. Artificial insemination has been performed
in Bitches by SPALLANZANI and others.

No systematic investigation as to the vitality of mammalian sperms has hitherto
been attempted. It has been ascertained by us, however, that the period of survival
in the male passages of Rabbits is probably not more than ten days.

Some Theoretical Considerations.—The fact that ovulation does not take place until
after the procestrum (or at any rate until after the commencement of the external
bleeding stage of the procestrum) is in opposition to the view that heat and menstrua-
tion are produced by ovulation, or by the corpus luteum. It is also contrary to the
theory that the degeneration stage occurs as a result of the absence of a fertilized
ovum for which the preceding growth was preparing. The theory that the destruc-
tion stage of the procestrum is of the nature of an abortion related to an ovum
released at the preceding period is also untenable, owing to the comparative
infrequency of the heat periods (and therefore of the ovulation periods) in the
Bitch. On the other hand, the hypothesis that the entire procestrous process is
of the nature of a preparation for the lodgment of the ovum is in accordance with
the facts.
