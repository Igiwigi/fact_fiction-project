Tt should be explained at the outset that we have con-
centrated attention on this particular problem solely because our interest is centred for
the present in methods rather than in results, Our.aim has been to develop a general
theory, of the kind which RayLeran employed so successfully in relation to problems
of vibration, whereby the critical velocity of steady flow might be estimated approximately
in cases where exact solutions are not obtainable, and in order to test the practical accuracy
of such a theory when found, it will evidently be necessary to compare its results with
those of more exact analysis. Now although the motion (B) is not of any particular
interest in itself, it offers what would appear, a priori, to be the simplest case for
theoretical investigation, because the formal solution is expressible in terms of known
functions. Thus it is for the moment the obvious test case.t

We have not yet succeeded in our attempt to answer the question, whether the
steady motion is in fact stable or unstable. This paper is presented (1) as a critical
review of previous work, indicating reasons why we regard the question as still
awaiting a really satisfactory answer, and (2) as an interim report giving certain
preliminary results which seem to have an interest of their own.

5. The scheme of the paper is as follows : Attention is confined to disturbances which
are two-dimensional, so that the quantities involved do not vary with z, when the
direction Oz is parallel to the plane boundaries and perpendicular to the direction of
their relative motion.
