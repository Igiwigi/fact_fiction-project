power relations with regard to digital data. The public good argument with regard to information
and knowledge has been defined by information economists Stiglitz [6] and Varian [7]. In their
definition, due to the low costs of reproduction, knowledge is a resource that is both non-rivalrous
(there is no extra cost incurred when others use it) and non-excludable (it is impossible to keep
others from using it).

However, in this definition, there are caveats with relevance to big data: Stiglitz and Varian
warn that knowledge can be made functionally excludable where the private sector gains value
from controlling it, and that regimes also determine the extent to which it is excludable, for
example, in the form of taxes and patents. Purtova [8] brings this debate up to date, identifying
digital data deriving from people as a ‘system resource’ comprising an ecosystem of people,
platforms and profiles, and concluding that while it may be possible for knowledge to be a
public good, it is not possible to make the same claim for digital data. In fact, the language of
the ‘personal data ecosystem’ is already in use by the World Economic Forum, among others
[9], to explain the ways in which the knowledge produced through digital data is inherently
commercial, and operates as an interaction between individuals and firms.

This paper will build on Purtova’s logic to challenge the rhetoric of data as a public good. I will
show that multiple, often contradictory considerations are at work behind any corporate decision
to share data pro bono, and that claims that data can be a public good underpin a particular politics
of data and a particular power dynamic that risks empowering some at the expense of others, and
that actually decreases opportunities for data to have positive social impact.
