first digit (pollex), which is retained in the Anteaters and Armadillos, is obsolete in the
Megatherium, as in the Sloths and Orycteropus: three digits are fully developed and
armed with claws, as in the Bradypus tridactylus; and the fifth, though incomplete in
the Megatherium, is better developed, because it was required in the ponderous terres-
trial Sloth for its progression on level ground. In no existing ground-dwelling member
of the Brut is the fifth digit deprived of its ungual phalanx, as in the Megatherium.
The bones of the fore foot of that extinct animal are thus seen to be modified mainly
after the type of the Bradypodide.

The long bones of all the limbs are devoid of medullary cavities, as in the Sloths. The
femur lacks the ligamentum teres, as in the Sloths. The fibula is anchylosed to the
tibia at both ends in Megatherium, as in Dasypus; but this is not the case in the closely-
allied extinct Megatherioids called Mylodon, Megalonyx, and Scelidotherium, a fact
which diminishes the force of the argument which CuvieR deduced from the coalesced
condition of the bones in the Megatherium in favour of its affinities to the Armadillos.
The semi-inverted but firm interlocking articulation of the hind foot to the leg shows
the peculiarities of that joint in the Sloths exaggerated, and departs further from its
characteristics in other ÃžPruta. In all the existing members of the, order, save the
