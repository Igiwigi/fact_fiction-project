Consequent upon such analysis the experiments have a secondary object, which is
to appreciate the reasons underlying the conventional practices of agriculture, and
possibly to improve these practices.

An indirect result of such experiments is the accumulation of precise data which are
subsequently of value in providing constants for studying special cases and new
problems.

The numerical data in the Appendices of this account may, at first sight, appear
unduly large in comparison with the length of the text. The reason for this disparity
is that conjectures as to accidental disturbing factors, which would necessarily form a
large part of the discussion of any less complete set of experiments, are here almost
entirely eliminated by the extent of the data. The records are, in fact, so complete as
to be easily understood. Fully to realise the technical significance of this point would
require citation of many contradictory statements from authorities on the agriculture
of cotton, which statements, being based largely on subjectivity and on plot experi-
ments of low precision, would serve for us no other useful purpose.

The presentation of these Appendices is further necessitated in that these analyses
are the result of new and formerly unpublished methods, which are being extensively
adopted in Egypt, and will before long be used in other parts of the world, The
methods are subject to many sources of error, which can only be avoided when fully
understood, and this understanding can only be attained by study of the actual
original data.
