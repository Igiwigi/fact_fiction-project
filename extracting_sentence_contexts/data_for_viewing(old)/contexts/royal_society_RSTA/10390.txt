The theory here recapitulated indicates the method to be pursued in treating the
definite integrals of Art. 5. We fix our attention, in the first instance, on their
“ principal values,” in CaucHy’s sense, and afterwards superpose such a system of free
Rayleigh waves as will make the final result consist solely of waves travelling
outwards from the origin of disturbance.

It may be remarked that an alternative procedure is possible, in which even
temporary indeterminateness is avoided. This consists in inserting in the equations
of motion (23) frictional terms proportional to the velocities, and finally making the
coefficients of these terms vanish. This method has some advantages, especially as
regards the positions of the “singular points” t6 be referred to. The chief problem
of this paper was, in fact, first worked through in this manner; but as the method
seemed rather troublesome to expound as regards some points of detail, it was
abandoned in favour of that explained above.

7. The most important case, and the one here chiefly considered, is that ot a
concentrated vertical force applied to the surface, to which the formule (52) relate.
The case of a horizontal force, expressed by the formulze (55), could be treated in an
exactly similar manner.

Since w, is evidently an odd, and v7) an even, function of @, it will be sufficient to
take the case of x positive.

As regards the horizontal* displacement w, we consider the integral
