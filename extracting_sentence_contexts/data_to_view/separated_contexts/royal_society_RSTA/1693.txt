To achieve the objective of stabilization we need to find conditions for which the operator
of generates an exponentially stable semigroup on X. The ideal technique is to reformulate the
system (2.1) into a distributed system. In fact, the above conditions on A, and G allow us to define
the following operators:

Di. =(Gkern—4,))  €L(LZ), B= (&@— A-1)D, € (UW X-1),

for A € p(A), respectively called Dirichlet and control operators where X_, is the extrapolation
space defined in the introductory section and A_; : X — X is the generator of the extrapolation
semigroup (T_1()):>0 on X_1, the extension of the semigroup (T(f));>0) to X-1. We mention that
the operator B is independent of 1, due to the resolvent equation. Now we can write

Am=A1+BG onZ.
