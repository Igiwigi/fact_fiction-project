Then consider a
prismatic element bounded by the two cones 8, 9+88, and by the two planes þ, þ+8<. The radial faces of this prism are acted on by bhe pressures and tangential stresses
communicated by the four contiguous prisms. But the tangential stresses on these
faces only arise from the fact that contiguous prisms are solicited by slightly different
forces, and therefore the action of the four prisms, surrounding the prism in question,
must be principally pressure. I therefore propose to consider that the prism resists
the tendency of the impressed forces to move tangentially along the surface of the
sphere, by means of hydrostatic pressures on its four radial faces, and by a tangential
sbress across its base. This approximation by which the whole of the tangential stress is thrown on to the
base, is clearly 8nch as slightly to accentuate, as it were, the distribution of the
tangential stresses on the surface of the sphere, by which the equilibrium of the layer
o is maintained.
