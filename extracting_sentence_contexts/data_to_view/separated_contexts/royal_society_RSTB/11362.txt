Yet, when translating these find-
ings to develop treatments for psychological disorders,
relatively little attention has been paid to specifying what
type of memory (i) can be modified and (ii) should be modified. We argue that rather than the traditional declarative versus non-
declarative memory system distinction, the clinical focus should
be on the intrusive nature of an aversive memory [68], which
could, in principle, stem from both systems. A clinical interven-
tion should thus seek to target the involuntary expressions of
the memory (both declarative and non-declarative), without


it intrusive memories of fragments knowledge of facts or trauma! 1

in general, clinically beneficial interventions should aim to target the maladaptive involuntary expression of trauma memories (e.g. intrusive memories), while
preserving its voluntary recall (e.g. ability to testify in court). (Online version in colour.)
