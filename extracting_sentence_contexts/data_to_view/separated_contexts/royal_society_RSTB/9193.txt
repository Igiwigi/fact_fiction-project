and analysed with cLamprir software. Leakage and capacitive arte-
facts were subtracted using a P/4 protocol. Na* current densities
were calculated by normalizing the peak Na* current to the cell
capacitance calculated from the integral of the charging curve for a
test potential of 20 mV after compensation of the electrode capaci-

of antibodies against NT-3. Similarly, as observed after a pre-
incubation with 10 nM K252a, a pre-incubation with antibodies
against NT-3 prevented the upregulation of the Na* current
density after 7 days in culture, suggesting that this antibody at
a concentration of 3g ml"! was efficient in neutralizing

tance.
