DEVELOPMENT OF ANTEDON (COMATULA, LAMK.) ROSACEUS. 683

LAMARCK'S name, therefore, and the general acceptance it has met with, I feel constrained
to follow the example of Dr. J. E. Gray, Mr. NoRMAN, and Professor WyviLLe THOMSON,
in reverting to the previous designation given by FREMINVILLE.
Although Lawanck clearly differentiated Comatula as a generic type from Asterias,
Iphiura, and Furyale, he was very far from apprehending its most essential peculiarities ;
his description of it is strangely incorrect as regards one of its most prominent,
tures, since he not only overlooked the true mouth, but described the anal funnel as

Yuble rapprocher les Comatules de certaines Mcdusaires.” (Op. cit. tom. ii. p. 932.)
THis mistake is the more remarkable, as he expresses surprise at not finding the mouth
(Where it actually is) at the point of conyergence of the furrows which pass from the rays
aÞng the ventral surface of the disk :—* Ce sillon, neanmoins, ne &approche point de la

& Astcries,” Te states, on the authority of PzroxN, that the Comatulz habitually cling
& Fuci or Zoophytes by their dorsal cirrhi, and spread out their rays in search of
cy ; and he goes on to affirm that they lay hold of this with their © grands rayons
pHncs,” and bring it to the mouth with their © rayons simples infcrieurs.” What he
