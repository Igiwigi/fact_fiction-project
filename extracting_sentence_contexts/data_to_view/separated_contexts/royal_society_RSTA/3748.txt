The average of these lengths in inner units (Lt) is presented in figure 2 on log-
log axes, where the lighter (grey) symbols are outside the inertial domain. Clearly, (Lt) increases
with distance from the wall. In the inertial region, the average length increases approximately as
(Lt) ~ (yt)0-382, In fact, the power-law exponent is curiously close to 1/: @*, as indicated by the
solid line in the figure. We note that the power law has a range that seems to extend beyond
y/5 =0.15. As an interesting aside, we note that the average lengths of u signal, both positive and negative,
have been investigated by Sreenivasan and co-workers (e.g. [21,22]).
