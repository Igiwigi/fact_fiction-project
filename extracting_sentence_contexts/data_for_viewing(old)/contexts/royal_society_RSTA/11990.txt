is clearly only this part whose tangential component must be continuous, when we
poss an interface into a region in which the distribution of the magnetic molecular

It is a check on the averaged form of the dynamical equations fora material mediu
that these six interfacial conditions regarding force and flux should be consistent wit!
the incompressibility of the ether ; and in fact the relations given above show th
only four of the six are independent. It is on this account, for example, that the
general requirements of the problem of physical optics are satisfied.

31. To secure a perfectly homogeneous specification of the electrodynamic field ir

a dynamical theory, there is no alternative but to reduce magnetism to molecul:
electric currents. As, however, our analytical equations for an extended mediun
involve (u, v, w), the current according to a volume specification, while the mole
currents are minute whirls not involving continuous flow in any direction, it i
necessary to determine the volume specification of currents that shall be their equi-
