Neither are these cells in any sense vagrant. Remaining from a very early period
securely anchored in a spot of known metameric orientation, their cell-processes,
i.e., nerve-fibres, radiate out into the rest of the metamere, whose various elements
they have to bring into relationship with themselves as central station. In fact, they
follow up the extension of the metamere, not by the process in virtue of which the
other tissue of the metamere extends—namely, by cell-division, but by individual
growth and increase of the length of the already existing cell-branches. This power
of comparatively unlimited increase in individual size by elongation of cell-processes,

enables the nerve-elements, with less metamorphosis and less spatial displacement of its
nutritional centre than occur in any other tissue, to meet the requirements of changed
surroundings, in short, to become adapted with relatively slight transfiguration and
dislocation.
