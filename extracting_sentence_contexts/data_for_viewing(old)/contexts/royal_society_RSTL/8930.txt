by instinet, as it were, upon the erroneous parts of my description, I yet hold, most tenaciously, to my old
view as to the homologies of tho parts; namely, that the © stapes” is a periotic, and the whole, complex * colu-
mella” a hyoidean element. The fact that the stapes is formed ont of the already chondrified periotic wall in
the © Urodela,” as is most plainly geen in young Axolotls 24 inches long, settles the stapedian homology;
that the columella of the Batrachia is the homologue of the hyomandibular of Proteus, T have not the shadow
of a doubt.


DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL IN THE BATRACHIA, 623

studies of the metamorphosing Tadpole (see © Frog's Skull,” plate vii. figs. 1-5, and
plate viii. figs. 1-4, ©.hm.,—* infra-hyomandibular,” the erroneous name I gave to it).
Even the fact that this tract was ossified by a bony plate (in the Common Frog and
Bull-frog), which I correctly designated as the © metapterygoid,” did not undeceive me.

In the third stage (fig. 3) the elbow of the mandibular pier is quite free from any
otic attachment ; but in larval forms of several kinds of Batrachia I have found two
distinct binders, attaching these two unrelated parts together. In Tadpoles of the Frog
an inch or more in length, and with hind legs apparent, there is a band which runs
from the elbow, and then becomes pedate, attaching itself to the edge of the tegmen in
front (+ Frog's Skull,” plates v. vi. vii., 8.km.). This part becomes detached as a small
trefoil of cartilage; it lies outside the © portio dura,” and becomes the © annulus tym-
panus.” The next attachment is by a much larger band, the © otic process” of the
mandibular pier (« Frog's Skull,” plate viii. figs. 3, 4, m.pg.); in a further stage (fig. 8)
it lies above m.pg. and 7.hm.
