ON THE ANATOMY OF FISHES, S09

P. totradaetylas are without: nir-bladders, while, ou the conteury. sueb organs are
tia FP. indicus awl P. plebejus. Such tacta certainly seem to indicate that
“total suppression may take place so rapidly de to have become completed within. the
relatively limited time that has elapsed since certain of these Hishes woquired their
present specific charicters, Without attoropting bo assign relative values to the
‘three causes which lave probably brought about the total atrophy of the air-bladder
jn these instances, the evidence seems xtrougly in favour of the view that, either
singly or conjointly, their operation is cilenlated to lend to the speedy and complete
ppression of a \seless air-bladder, and is distiuetly adverse fo the retention of
Bhat. ovgani, however vestigial may he the condition to which it has been redoved ;
Junce the persistence of a vestigial airbladder iy so many Siluridie, in spite of
“Buunes whieh, in most other Fishes, haye sufficed to secure its total atrophy, can hardly
8 explained by the suggestion previously made hy us. A The widespread persistency of a vestigial and useless air-bladder seems to be
uliar to the Ustariophysea ; in fact, we know of no species in any of the different
Fimilies of the pronp in which an air-bladder is entirely wanting. On the contrary, so
Hr as our knowledge extends, this faet is altogether without parallel in all the
Pimaining families of Teleostei, in which total suppression seems invariably to follow
“Bs9 OF function. There are, however, tivo points in connection with the air-bladder of the
Biluride abnormales that wre not without some significance, and may possibly furnish au
Explanation of this anomaly, The first has reference to the method by which the
Bedaetion of the bladder Las been effected.
