Fig. 9 is a typical curve of zeros which
shows that very few of the observations are as much as 0-003° C. off the mean curve. The discontinuity at 20° C. is due to the fact that, for convenience, the curve was plotted
in short sections (Section VI). A smooth curve would represent the facts better, but
any errors introduced only amount to one or two thousandths of a degree in an
individual thermometer. The broken line is the depression curve obtained when
allowance is made for the amount of distillation estimated to have taken place as a
result of observations of zeros after repeated steam points. In this way, taking a
mean of all thermometers, the depression of verre dur is estimated at 0-10,° C. for
