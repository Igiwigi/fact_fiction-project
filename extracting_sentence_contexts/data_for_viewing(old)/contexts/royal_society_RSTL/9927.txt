396 MESSRS. J. B. LAWES AND J. H. GILBERT ON THE RESULTS OP

The bottom line of Table XXIX. shows that (excluding the nitrate plot) there was
an average yield per acre of nearly 4000 lbs. more hay in 1869 than in 1870 ; and
without manure, and with purely mineral manure, the excess amounted to more than
the average produce of those plots.

In the preceding year, 1868, there had been, under most conditions of manuring, and
especially with high manuring, more than average firs crops, but considerably less
than average second crops. The very limited second growth is accounted for by the
fact that there had been a great deficiency of rain in May, June, and July, with a
considerable excess of temperature in each of those three months ; whilst the rainfall of
August and September, though in excess of the average, was still insufficient to restore
the balance or to compensate for the previous drought, and there were again, in those
two months, higher than average temperatures. Indeed, September 1868 ended an
extraordinarily warm period of nearly nine months' duration. October and November
were, throughout, with very few exceptions, colder than usual, both day and night,
whilst in October there was a deficiency of rain, and in November a very great,
deficiency. So far, then, the period preceding the enormous growth of 1869 was
unfavourable to luxuriant condition of the herbage.

From this time, however, throughout the three winter months of December, January,
and February, there was a considerable excess of rain, with temperatures ranging
