three dimensions. (6) Example result for plane longitudinal wave propagation in a single realization of Inconel with statistically
equiaxed grains, simulated with model N115200 using a centre frequency of 1 MHz for the transmitted toneburst. (/) The

(ii) The time-domain signals, highlighting the signals acquired at individual nodes and the coherent signals averaged over all
nodes on the respective surfaces. Taking the main pulses from the coherent signals before the vertical marks in panel (i/) and
transforming them into the frequency domain leads to the amplitude and phase spectra in (ii). (iv) The normalized attenuation
and phase velocity results calculated using the spectra in the highlighted frequency range in (ii/). The normalization factor a is

unaddressed so far. Still, the fact of high order scattering diagrams depending on multi-
point correlation functions [19,20] means that approximation exists due to the sole
consideration of the 1 = 2 statistic.

It is not yet known how these approximations affect the obtained solution, even for the scalar
case, due to the lack of exact solutions. Therefore, numerical simulations are the only alternative
at this point to evaluate the quality of the obtained solutions.

3. FEmethod

The three-dimensional FE method has been established recently to be powerful and accurate for
the simulation of wave propagation in polycrystals [27,28,34,35]. Here, we summarize our use of
