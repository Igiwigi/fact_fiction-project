these cases the denominators are equal within limits, but much larger than those for
m = 6 instead of being less, and the deviation is real since the difference is more
than 15 times the probable error for m = 7, and 1°5 times that for m = 6, which
latter has a very considerable probable error ‘5 as against ‘07.* The divergence for
m = 8 can be accounted for, as it is probable that there are two close lines here due
to different series, viz., that for this series m = 8 and the other for a parallel series
for which m = 5, and may therefore be stronger. As it throws some light on the
subject it may be well to say a few words about it here. Runce and PascHEN give
three lines at 6264'78, 6261°68, 6256°81, with separations 7°83, 12°43, and intensities
1, 3, 1, so that the centre is the strongest. There is a corresponding set at 5410°97,
5408°80, 5405°08, with the same separations within error limits and intensities 3, 4, 3,
again with the centre strongest. The strongest lines of these two triplets form a
series with the observed value of D’(8). They are of a diffuse type and in fact

* These are not to be confounded with K.R.’s possible errors. The possible errors are probably
larger.
