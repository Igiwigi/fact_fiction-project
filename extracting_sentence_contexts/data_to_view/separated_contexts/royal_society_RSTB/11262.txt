Ideally exact sniff measurements would have been taken

Further confirming the qualitative differences between Jahai
and Dutch verbal responses, we found that Jahai speakers
gave a single abstract term the majority of the time, and as

but this was not practical in the field, and more critically would such the average length of their response was much shorter
have disrupted facial expression coding. Separately, a trained than Dutch responses. Prior research has established that
FACS coder (Facial Action Coding System [33]) annotated the orthographic length correlates highly with phonetic length,
non-verbal facial responses to each odour. For the current purposes, even for languages with irregular spelling [36]; as such we
we focus on facial muscle movements (action units, AU), previously took orthographic length as a proxy for speech length. Argu-
identified as being relevant for ‘disgust’ or ‘pleasure’ [34,35], or ably a strictly phonemic representation of Dutch responses,

which were recurrent in the dataset (table 1).
