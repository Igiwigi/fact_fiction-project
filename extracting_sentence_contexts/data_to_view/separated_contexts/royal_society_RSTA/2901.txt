It was shown in §27 that the convergence of this
series is absolute, and, by an application of Drnt's theorem, it may be shown that the
convergence is also uniform in the square a=sSb, a=t=b. Hence, if (s),

x(s, t) of positive type and 4, ds, «+15 Any +++ are the corresponding singular values,

then the series ;

converges both absolutely and uniformly, and its sum-function is « (s, t). * Owing to the fact that A(A) has only positive roots. AND THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE THEORY OF INTEGRAL EQUATIONS. 445
