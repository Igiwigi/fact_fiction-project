This is the technique that can be seen in our sample. In this case, it appears that the
ultramarine was applied with a small brush over in a final step. As for the pigment itself, the elemental composition of the ultramarine layer obtained by SEM-—
EDS and the identification of wollastonite in the Raman spectrum were helpful in the assignment
of the mineral nature of the pigment, which is also in accordance with the fact that the polychromy
was manufactured in 1583. Lapis lazuli was a very expensive pigment obtained from lazurite, a
mineral whose best ores could be found in Afghanistan [19]. Early-modern Spanish art treatises
warned about the scarceness of this rich pigment, whereas commercial documents evidenced


that its trading started diminishing since the fifteenth century within the European milieu [28]. | 10 |
Francisco Pacheco would say that the lapis lazuli ‘was neither used in Spain, nor did the painters

have enough to use’, although there are some testimonies of trading practices through the city of “3
Venice [29].
