This is a compact model, consisting of the minimal term to
characterize variations in frequency response of combined increasing and decreasing monotonic


values. This model has been shown to be the natural solution of materials with mechanical | 10 |
properties modelled by combinations of Maxwell, Kelvin and Voigt elements [4,30]. This implies
also that the model structure and parameters may be suitable for detecting various degrees of 3
viscoelasticity. :

Looking at the model in (3.1) and considering the fact that the parameter a always has a
negative value, then it is possible to make some calculation to rearrange the model as

a+, at
Z(s) = Renee De â€”2<a,p <2, (3.2)

with D=1/C. Therefore, it is possible to note that for some materials the appropriate model
may have a pole in the origin and two other fractional-order derivative. However, doing an
electrical comparison, this impedance could correspond to a circuit which has one resistor and
two fractional-order capacitors, also known as constant phase elements.
