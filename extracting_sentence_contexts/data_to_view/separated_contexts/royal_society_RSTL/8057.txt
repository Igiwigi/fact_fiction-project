In Mr. Bixxer's Sigillaria vascutaris (Plate XXV. fig. 8) we
find the yascular part of the medullary axis retreating towards its periphery, but with an
undefined inner margin. In Diplozylon there is reason to believe that it had become
altogether peripheral, and had a sharply defined inner boundary line, though this latter
fact cannot be absolutely affirmed until a specimen is found with the whole of the
medullary tissues preserved. In the same two plants we find a corresponding adyance
in the thickness of the radiating woody cylinder and in the development of the medullary
rays. The other genera allied to Lepidodendron exhibit structures of the same type.
