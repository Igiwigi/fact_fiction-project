Appendix B

In this section, we show how to ensure a diagonal &’ matrix for the disconnected model when
evaluating conditional GCs in a multivariate system. We denote the target variable index as t.
First, we observe that each component of the matrix can written as

The Yule—-Walker-like terms can be set to zero using (2.9) if they correspond to an unconstrained
coupling coefficient and, at the same time, we can use the instantaneous matrix Ao’ to cancel the
last two terms in the equation. We note that, given the fact that X’ is a symmetric matrix, we need
only to force half of the elements to zero. In particular, we set Xj; =0 for j>i, i#t and at the
same time Z;, =0 for i> t. This choice ensures that all the off-diagonal elements are vanishing
and, at the same time, that the row index i is never equal to the target index r. This allows us to
simplify the last term in (B 1) using (2.9), knowing that for i#7 the coupling coefficients (Ax’)ia


are unconstrained. The two equations for the components of Y’ can now be written as
