The average static potential of the
ejected electron is zero. Hence on the distorted wave approximation the potential acting on the scattered
electron would be that of the ion formed. In fact, the potential must be much less. For in general the ejected
electron has much lower velocity than the scattered electron (Mott & Massey 1949) and thus it cannot move
far in the effective duration of the collision. The Born approximation in contrast assumes that the Coulomb
potential of the ion is completely screened.
