Table the letters V and H stand for the methods by which the total CO, was
determined, V meaning Van Slyke’s method, and H the constant pressure apparatus
described. by Haldane. In the figure, comparisons are only made between results in
which the same method was used both at Cerro de Pasco and at sea-level.

The comparison of the values of “pH.” at high and low altitudes shows that in no
case was the concentration of hydrogen-ions appreciably greater at Cerro than at the
sea-level. Usually the determinations at Cerro yielded a more alkaline figure, but
only more alkaline by a very trifling amount, on the average about 0°2 pH. In
making the calculations, there is the assumption that the constant pK, in Hasselbalch’s
formula has the same value in the case of the blood both at sea-level and at Cerro.
This, however, would not necessarily be the case if the corpuscular content were
markedly different, as in fact it was.
