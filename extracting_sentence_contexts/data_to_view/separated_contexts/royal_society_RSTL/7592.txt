CHAPTER TI,

) Beyorr T begin to describe the parts which form the subject of this communica-
Aion, and to show how some of them are merely modified portions or developments of
thers that belong to the medulla oblongata, it will be advisable to recur to those
Snorphological changes in the medulla, which I formerly pointed out as themselves
Arising from modifications of the spinal cord. And while in unrayelling structures s0
Sxtremely complex, such a course seems almost necessary to facilitate their compre-
Hension, and convey to the reader a just notion of their morphological changes, in rela-
Bon on the one hand, to the remaining parts of the encephalon, and on the other
Hand, to the spinal cord, it will afford me an opportunity of adding to this recapitula-
Yion some new facts that have been elicited by subsequent observation and a more ex-
Fended experience. 'Z It is gratifying to know that many of the results of my previous researches have been
Found to throw considerable light on certain diseases of the neryous system, especially
Dn some forms of paralysis; and my own pathological investigations, as well as a close
Study of neryous disorders, have not only enabled me to shape my present researches as
Snuch as possible in accordance with the requirements of the pathologist, but, by point-
"Ing to the probability of certain anatomical connexions suggested by morbid symptoms,
ZSbey have sometimes been the means of directing the course of my dissections in a yery
Fpeculiar way *. YZ Some of the results comprised in this communication were obtained by adopting the
yy of dissection which I 80 strongly recommended in my former Memoir on the
edulla Oblongata.
