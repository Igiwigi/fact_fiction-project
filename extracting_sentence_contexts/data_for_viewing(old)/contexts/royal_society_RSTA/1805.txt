Choosing the model to be of Lotkaâ€”Volterra type with linear, predator-prey functional
responses means that we can employ quantities from mass-balance models previously
constructed for the system on Bylot [39] to set the parameters in the low and peak summer. Using
this information, we can infer parameter values for the winter dynamics of our hybrid system
using the method described below.

(d) Unknown parameter guesses for multi-season model

We require a procedure to guess unknown parameter values from equation (2.5) (ie. vo,

, apie) to generate time-series for our multi-season model with which to study species
interactions. The difficulty lies in the fact that direct parameter estimates are only available for the

summer, but we also require estimates for the winter period as well as estimates for the intrinsic
(1) (2)

growth rates and intraspecific terms. Summer interaction strengths ai and cH

are fixed using


data estimates for consumption and production rates as well as diet proportions [39]. They can
be found by translating parameters from a mass-balance model following standard approaches
