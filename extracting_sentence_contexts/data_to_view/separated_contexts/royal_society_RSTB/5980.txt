The consequence of these events is that a yolk-sac placenta vascularised by the vitelline
vessels, cannot be formed at all and so, as a compensation, what seems to have happened
is that the development of the allantois was accelerated and at the same time abbreviated,
so as to enable it to vascularise the placental area of the chorion directly and at the earliest
possible moment (¢f, Hii, °19, p. 484). And I may here remark, when we understand
how developmental acceleration is brought about, we shall have advanced a long way
towards the solution of the problem of developmental adaptation. Lastly, in the present connection, it should be emphasised that, in face of all the facts
furnished by comparative embryology, the view of HusBrecuT to the effect that the
connecting stalk of Tarsius and the higher Primates represents a more primitive con-
dition than that of the free vesicular allantois of any of the other Amniotes, cannot for a

stalk of Tarsius and that of the higher Primates represent three stages in an evolutionary
series which is to be interpreted from the Lemur upwards and not in the contrary
direction as maintained by Husrecut, and the interest of the connecting stalk of Tarsius
lies in this, that it presents us in its development with just that intermediate or tran-
sitional stage between the generalised Lemuroid and the specialised Pithecoid con-
ditions which the conception of Primate phylogeny advocated in this lecture demands.
