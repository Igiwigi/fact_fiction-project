Since the first demonstrations of change blindness, several
experiments have shed more light on how it could be under-
stood. Brady et al. [27] showed that the phenomenon depends
on the amount of time allowed for encoding of each object. Other experiments suggest that objects in change blindness
tasks in fact are perceived yet cannot be retrieved for
comparison [28]. Block [2] has argued that the change blindness phenom-
enon is a good example of phenomenal consciousness
without access. Because, regardless of whether the phenom-
enon demonstrates limitations of encoding or retrieving, it
seems difficult to argue that the observer in the experiment

did not consciously see the first or the second object in, by
far, the most of these experiments.
