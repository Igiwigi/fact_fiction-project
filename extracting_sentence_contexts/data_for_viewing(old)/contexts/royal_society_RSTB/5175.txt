Miocene-Oligocene | Himalayan folding.

Pei-tai Lower Kainozoic\} Peneplanation of Tibet and Yunnan. Major
Cretaceous valleys trend W.-E.

The most important difference in this table from Prof. Barney W1111s’s conclusions
is the omission of his great late Pleistocene uplift. FRecu (1911, in von RicuTHoren,
vol. V, p. 242) had previously denied the great Quaternary uplift, from the paleontological
evidence ; and we consider that the physiographic evidence agrees with F'REcu’s view.

According to the above classification the main Himalayan line continued across Chinese
Tibet despite the meridional strike prevailing there. The Himalayan line may therefore
be expected to extend farther eastward beyond Indo-China. 'The essential major facts
in the structure of eastern China are the existence of two great Sinian blocks of pre-
Cambrian rocks, one to the N. and one to the S., of which the latter extends south-
westward into Cambodia and the Malay Peninsula. The nucleus of this South China
block consists of areas of gneiss; they were united by Paleozoic rocks and the whole
welded by Hercynian folding. The typical parts of China lie between these northern
and southern blocks; and the land near the southern block has been disturbed by
Kainozoic folding. A branch of the Himalayan fold-belt was bent backward, as the
Burmese arc, on the western margin of this Indo-Chinese mass ; and we consider, from
the evidence referred to on pp. 255-256, that the continuation of the Himalayan line
passes along the northern margin of that mass through Yunnan, 8... Szechuan and
through Kwei-chow, as the Nan Shan (7.e., Southern Mountains) of eastern China.
