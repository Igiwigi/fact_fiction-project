Secondly, the NDDE model (2.5)-(2.7) can be transformed into a partial differential Haus-type
equation [9] with the help of the multiple time-scale analysis, where a ‘spatial’ operator acting on
the fast time scale replaces the delay operator [29,36]. This can only be done by neglecting higher
order derivatives (beyond diffusion) along the longitudinal direction. This approximation results
in a discrepancy between the models for almost all parameter values.

Finally, the NDDE model (2.5)-(2.7) accounts for diffraction via a lumped exponential operator
exp(iq?) (in Fourier domain), whereas the Haus model [9] considers an additive operator iq’.
Therefore, these approaches might yield identical results only for long wavelength LSs, for which
the characteristic wavelength A< > 1 so that exp(iq’) * 1+ iq’. In our case, the typical FWHM
of the LBs in the transverse dimension is A, ~ 6 (cf. figure 8b), which is not particularly large
and can explain some of the differences between the two approaches. In our case, the qualitative
convergence between the two models stems from the fact that in the MF regime (Qo > 0, Gp >
0,« — 1) the LBs become wider in the transverse dimension.

After we have demonstrated the quantitative accuracy of the functional mapping (3.5), we
can use it to investigate the effect of large losses on the LB stability domain. Figure 10 illustrates
how the stability domain on the plane of two parameters, normalized unsaturated gain go, and
normalized unsaturated loss qq = Qo/— log «, changes with the decrease of the linear attenuation
