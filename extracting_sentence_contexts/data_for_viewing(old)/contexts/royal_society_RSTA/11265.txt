E turns away from the American coast toward the east beyond the meridian of
A Newfoundland and its banks to long. 40Â° W. . . . . From there it proceeds to
the north-east, diffuses nearly across the entire Atlantic, and surrounds the whole
of Europe, to the Arctic and the White Sea of Archangel, with a broad and permanent
watercourse . . . . The south-west winds receive their high temperature from
the Gulf Stream; and only through the Ocean, not by the winds, can warmth be
earried into latitudes as high as those of the European coasts are.

3. The Gulf Stream, as a whole, is as yet but little explored; we only know its
influence in some degree. How limited our knowledge of it is may be inferred, for
instance, from the fact that there are most contradictory statements of its velocity
and strength. A. G. Frypiay, one of the principal authorities on the Gulf Stream,

computed (1869) its velocity as requirmg one to two years to reach Europe from
Florida, while, according to my computation, two months would suffice. :

4. To conclude from the soundings, obtained so far, the Gulf Stream must be, up to
the Arctic Ocean, a deep and voluminous watercourse ; if it should not be so, the
