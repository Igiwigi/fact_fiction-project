In the rhombohedral 8ystem, Table R1 (Plate IV.), the first vertical column under
each mineral contains the angles between the face 111 and the observed direct faces in
the quadrant (111...10 0), and also the angles between the face 111 and some observed
inverse faces in the quadrant (111...211). Facts presented by these Tables —The most important of these are the horizontal ranges
of nearly equal angles, as shown in each system, and the general disagreement in the
symbols of the faces which make with some other face those nearly agreeing angles. With regard to these facts no difference of opinion can arise, unless the sources from
which they have been derived (some of the most recent works on mineralogy) are incorrect. And it is possible that from inaccurate transcription, or error in printing, some of the -
angles may not be correctly given, and hence perhaps may have arisen some of the
anomalies presented by the Tables. But differences of opinion may be entertained relative to the interpretation of these facts.
