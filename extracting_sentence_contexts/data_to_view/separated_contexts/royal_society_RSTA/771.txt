The turbulent nature of ocean circulation, manifest in a vigorous mesoscale eddy field, means that
pathways of ventilation, once thought to be quasi-laminar, are in fact highly chaotic. The chaotic
nature of ventilation pathways has been quantified by defining a non-dimensional ‘filamentation
number’, which estimates the reduction in filament width of a ventilated fluid parcel due to
mesoscale strain. In the subtropical North Atlantic of an eddy-permitting ocean model, the
filamentation number is large everywhere across two upper ocean density surfaces, increasing
with depth, implying highly chaotic ventilation pathways.
