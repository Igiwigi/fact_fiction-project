The calyx-teeth, which have meanwhile increased greatly in length, are situated just
at the upper surface of the disc, and when the polyp is retracted they radiate from
the opening of the cell (see fig. 189).

The foregoing account of the enclosure of the axial polyp will apply equally well
to the secondary polyps. On account of the continual appearance of young buds in
the angles between older ones, each of the latter is bordered by younger polyps on
each side. The latter gradually extend downwards, and finally meet behind the older
polyp which at the same time bends upwards, and thus becomes enclosed within the
disc. This is shown in fig. 188, where p‚Äù. and p!9. are already extending behind p},

As mentioned at p. 789, the ventral compartment of the polyp never has a calyx-
tooth, a fact which is rendered conspicuous when the polyps are retracted (see
fig. 189). When the polyp turns upwards and is enclosed in the disc, the ventral
chamber necessarily comes to be sitnated on the outer side of the polyp or away from
the centre of the group.

By the union of the Jateral lines of buds the outline of the disc is completed at
front, and the marginal buds now form an nnbroken series from one side to the other
behind the axial polyp. At the posterior part of the disc, however, the outline is
never completed and a permanent sinus remains in which the peduncle is attached.
This is due to the cessation of the formation of lateral buds in the posterior angle
after three or four buds have been formed (ee fig. 189).
