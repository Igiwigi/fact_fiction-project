i Tt will be gathered from these illustrations that the extent of the degeneration
Bilowing removal of a cerebral hemisphere depended upon the severity of the injury

Mhere the recovery of the paralysis on the right side was not good, there was exten-
five degeneration of the anterior and antero-lateral columnar fibres. But, as the
ey in these columns is only a measure of the severity of the wound, the
ost useful comparison is that between the condition of the wound and the
Symptoms. At repeated autopsies it was found that a limited suppuration not pro-
ducing pressure was quite compatible with rapid recovery of the paresis of the right
side. When the cavity became distended, however, the paretic symptoms rapidly
increased, as in Cat 5.
