The brown colour is precisely that of the spores of Prosthemium
betulinum, which latter plant I snspect to be an altered form of the Spheeria. In the first place, Spharia 8iparia and Prosthemium betulinum are almost always
as8ociated in growth. Whenever the one is found, a very slight Search will usnally

enable the observer to detect the other; and although the mere fact of their growing
\ together would hardly afford any ground for suspecting a relationship between the
two, it is a circumstance which, taken in connexion with others, must be allowed to
be of considerable weight. But besides their companionship, there is a very strong
external resemblance between the Sphzria and the Prosthemium, 80 much 8 that it is
frequently impossible, without a microscopical examination of the fruit, to decide whether
a particular specimen belongs to the one or the other. The perithecia of the Pros-
themium are large and depressed, with a central ostiolum, and, although not invariably,
are sometimes clothed with the dense wool which is one of the characteristics of the
â€”Spheria.
