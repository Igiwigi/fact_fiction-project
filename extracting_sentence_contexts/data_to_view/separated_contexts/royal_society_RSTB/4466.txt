A chart of
the stations* shows that they are well distributed throughout the North Atlantic
area. I may state at once, that the yield of larvee of the European eel amounted in
all to 120. This represents about one larva for every fourth or fifth station, a result
which must be considered satisfactory in view of the highly primitive equipment, the
short hauls, and the fact that a great number of the stations were in areas where eel
larvee do not occur. During the first two years (1911-12) the collections of material made were chiefly
from vessels sailing between the English Channel and the West Indies, but the
yield was generally poor, three larvee from one station being the highest. An
encouraging feature, however, was the finding of a larva only 34 mm. in length at
25° N., 51° W., both from the fact that the previous minimum record (41 mm.) was
thereby beaten, and also because the locality of the find suggested a place of origin
even more to the south and west than we had hitherto been warranted in imagining.
