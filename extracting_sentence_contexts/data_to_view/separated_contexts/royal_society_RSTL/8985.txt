When the nature of a chemical event has been thus defined 80 that we
clearly see what we have to do, the further inquiry lies before us of the theoretical
s0lution of the problem, namely, given a chemical event, how are we to determine the
events of which that event is compounded? This problem may in all cases be solyed,
The s0lution is effected by means of a peculiar theorem, which occupies in theoretical
chemistry a position analogous to that held in theoretical mechanics by the theorem
of the parallelogram of forces. Lastly, T shall give examples of the application of this
theorem, to actual events and things, when the chemist will have an opportunity of
estimating the bearing of this theory upon facts and its practical utility. * © Acoustics, Theoretical,” by W, F. Doxxixs. Oxford, 1870, Chapter III.
