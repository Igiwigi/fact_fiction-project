Figs. 28 and 29 show stages in the disappearance of the spindle. In such
a preparation as fig. 28 a definite spindle is still to be seen between the two segmen-
tation nuclei ; the spindle has no distinct periphery, but gradually passes over into the
ordinary reticulum ; the threads of the spindle can be distinctly traced into the
threads of the reticulum. Fig. 29 shows a little later stage in this process of
extinction of the spindle; the spindle in fact hardly exists as such, but is only to be
distinguished as a reticulum with small meshes ; this reticulum passes over directly
into the wider meshed general reticulum.

3 These observations agree completely with those of WrLson (21) on the cytoplasm
S in the egg of the Sea Urchin. Farmer and WILLIAMs (20) made similar observations
in the oogonia and oosphere of Fucus. Such observations as these militate strongly against the view of a special spindle
forming substance, either archoplasmic or kinoplasmic (cf.
