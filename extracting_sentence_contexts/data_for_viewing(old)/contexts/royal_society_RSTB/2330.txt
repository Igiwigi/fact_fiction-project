and liquid diffusion which have been hitherto unnoticed, and which appear to be of
considerable interest, not only in their physical aspects, but also from the explana-
tions they suggest of certain natural processes in plants (and perhaps also in animals)
in which the transference of gaseous or dissolved substances depends more or less on
diffusivity.

Tn the present communication, which is intended to be one of a series descriptive of
our researches, we shall, as far as possible, confine ourselves to the physical pheno-
mena, touching only on the physiological questions in so far as they are necessary.

That the entry of atmospheric carbon dioxide into an assimilating leaf takes place
by some process of dijusion has, as far as we know, never been seriously questioned ;
in fact, from what is known of the structure and function of the leaf, any other sup-
position, which would necessarily imply some form of mass movement of the inter-
changing gases, is quite inconceivable. The discussion may therefore be limited to a
consideration of whether the gaseous exchanges of assimilation and respiration are to
be accounted for by some form of osmosis through the cuticle and epidermis of the
leaf, or whether they are due in the first place to free diffusion through the open
stomata with which the vast majority of the green organs of plants are so richly
furnished,

With the exception of the work of Garreau, who had already indicated as early
as 1850* that there was some sort of relation between the distribution of stomata

and the evolution of carbon dioxide in the respiratory process, the experimental
