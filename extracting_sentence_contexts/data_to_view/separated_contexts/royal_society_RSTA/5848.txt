Introducing the increment field 5yu:= u(x + €) — u(x) and choosing the


test function ge — ¢ in (3.2) shows that
(0; + u- V)deu = —Vydep — dou. Vedeu + def (3.3)

holds in the sense of distributions. To obtain this we denote u! = u(x + 2) and u = u(x) and derive
a weak form of the ‘doubling variables’ identity

[9 vor—wenvedr= [Gen —0@s):Vodx
= [0-1 9: Vo —u edu: V9) Ax
= [0-@uivion — u ® dgu: Ve) dx
=: [seu ody [wasn veds

=f ur @ din -pax— | u @ dgu: Vo dx,

where we used the fact that u is distributionally divergence-free. This establishes that (3.3) holds
in the sense of distributions. Dotting the above equation with ¢, we find

(d + u- V)(Seu- L) = —L- Vydep — Set - Ve(Seut - L) + [Seul? + def. (3.4)

Integrating this balance over the torus, we have

[ |Seul? dx=-Ve - I deu(Seu - £) dx, (3.5)
1 1

where we used only periodicity of the solution fields.
