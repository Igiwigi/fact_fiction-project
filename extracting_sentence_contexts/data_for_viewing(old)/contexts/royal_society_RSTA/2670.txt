Currently, muon radiography is probably the only non-invasive technique that can be successfully
exploited to measure the three-dimensional density profile of large volumes of material, such
as portions of mountains or hills from tens to hundreds of metres deep, with a spatial/angular

resolution that enables cavities or dense bodies with a linear size of the order of metres to be :2
identified. The two different ways of exploiting the muon projectiles crossing a target volume, Dm
multiple scattering muon tomography (MSMT) and muon transmission radiography (MTR), are : =
suitable for investigating volumes of different size. MSMT is usually exploited for relatively : =
small objects, of the order of a few cubic metres at maximum, and provides three-dimensional -R
information on the observed volume. It is in fact based on the multiple scattering effect, which was : S
studied by means of two independent detectors located upstream and downstream of the target :3
volume. The incoming and outgoing muon tracks are reconstructed for a large set of muons and :8
exploited to determine the most likely density distribution inside the target volume, using custom : 3
iterative algorithms developed by the few research groups worldwide that are able to apply this : 8

technique and that have developed their own (not open source) code. Different from MSMT, MTR
is a two-dimensional technique. It is based on a single muon telescope that is used to compare the
muon flux downstream of a target volume with the flux measured in the absence of any target,
the so-called free sky (FS) flux. The information that usually comes from such a measurement is
a two-dimensional angular density profile of the target volume, i.e. an estimate of the average
density of matter encountered along a direction within the field of view of the instrument. In
many cases (e.g. [1,2]) with single muon radiography using the latter technique it is possible to
