Each aperture has its own

inclination and is determined by the extinction values of the two apertures. In making
these determinations the eye has to judge the brightness of very dissimilar sizes of area,
andit might be thought that this fact would present an almost insuperable difficulty in
making very accurate measures. As a matter of fact, it was not so; the greatest
difficulty was encountered in those cases when the light of the large aperture was so
diminished that it became colourless, whilst the other had very nearly its original tint. The red was perhaps the hardest to judge on that account; the other colours did not-pre-
sent any great difficulty. One of the curious phenomena encountered in these measures
at times was a distinct scintillation of the light emitted by the small aperture.
