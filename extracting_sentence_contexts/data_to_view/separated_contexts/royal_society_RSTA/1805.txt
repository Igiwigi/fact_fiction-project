However, depending on their genetic material, bacterial strains differ in their ability to degrade
DOM according to its composition. It implies the occurrence of different ecological niches in
which bacterial strains use the energy source to which they are the most adapted. Even though the environmental relevance of isolated strains remains an important issue, our
study underlines the fact that the isolated strains from the ice camp were overall representative
of the in situ bacterial community, especially in the sea ice bottom. We showed through a
biodegradation experiment a preference for the DOM degradation from the pelagic diatom
C. neogracilis among 40 different bacterial strains isolated from ice and several depths. Indeed,
most of the strains tested (78%) were able to grow on the exudate from the pelagic diatom
C. neogracilis, and 33% were able to use the exudate from the sea ice diatom F. cylindrus. 17.5%



of the strains were not able to grow with any exudate, while 27.5% of the strains were able
to use both types of exudates.
