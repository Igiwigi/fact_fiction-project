the side of the lesion, with the displacement most marked in the opposite eye, while
in the latter case the eyes are displaced to the side of the lesion, the displacement
being most marked in the eye on that side.

It is curious that the ocular displacements which result from section of the inferior
cerebellar peduncle should differ so widely from those which follow section of the
auditory nerve, after which lesion the eye on the same side rotates downwards and
inwards (towards the opposite side), or sometimes outwards (to the side of the lesion),
while the opposite eye, in which there is most displacement, and which rotates down-
ward and outward after section of the peduncle, in the case of the auditory nerve
turns inward, and, according to BecrrerEw,* also upward.

The fact that the direction of displacement of the globes which results from
section of one inferior peduncle of the cerebellum, is the same as that which results
from ablation of one lateral half of the cerebellum, opens up the question as to
whether the latter displacement is not also an indirect effect rather than one due to
the taking-off of a divect influence normally exerted on the ocular muscles by the
cerebellum.

With regard to nystagmus, nothing need be added here to what was said in
my former paper.t

The spasm which was so easily detected in the back and neck muscles on the side
of the lesion alone furnishes us with any satisfactory information with regard to the
possible control which the cerebellum may exert on the spinal centres, an action
