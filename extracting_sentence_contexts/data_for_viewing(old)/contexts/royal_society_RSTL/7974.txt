which have the distance from the centre for their abscisse, while the mean length of the
lines are the ordinates; both coordinates are given in inches. The curve W W' shows
the behaviour of all lines measured in one direction, the curve RR' that of those
meagured in the direction at right angles to the former, and, finally, M M' exhibits the
mean of both. The irregularity of the curve RR' is partly owing to the cireum-
stance that the number of observations on which it is founded is considerably less
than those at our disposal for the curve W W'; and it is our intention to repeat the
whole investigation under more fayourable circumstances. It is particularly our wish
to place the determination on a more correct basis by erecting at a considerable distance
from the photoheliograph a suitable scale of equal parts, which when repeatedly photo-
graphed in different positions, will in our opinion supply us with very correct constants
of distortion. A similar contrivance would be useful in ascertaining the optical distor-
tion of ordinary photographic lenses. In the meantime the following two facts may
be regarded as established ;—lst, that the image of any object photographically de-
picted is liable to a distortion, which varies at different distances from the centre of the
field, and the amount of which may be determined for every instrument by methods
similar to that employed by ourselves; 2nd, that in our case the image of an object is
larger when formed near the edge of the field than at the centre, and that the amount
of elongation of a unit, of length at the centre increases with its distance from the centre.
Taking the most trustworthy of our curves, W W', as a preliminary result, we find the
following values for the unit at the centre, when it passes to other positions in the field,
the latter being given in fractions of the radius :;—
