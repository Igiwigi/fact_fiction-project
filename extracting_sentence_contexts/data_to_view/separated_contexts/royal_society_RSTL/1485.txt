temperatures below 200?, the mercurial vacuum was a much
worse conductor than highly rarefied air: and when the
tube containing it was included in the exhausted receiver,
its temperature being about zo?, the spark passed through
a distance six times greater in the Boylean than in the mer-
curial vacuum. It is evident from these general results that the light (and

there can be na,demonstrative evidence.” It maybe assumed,

mercury or charcoal by'its agency ;—and when two surfaces
of highly fixed metal, such as platinum or iron are used, the
discharge will pass only: through a very small distance, and
cannot be permanently kept up. The circumstance, that the intensity of the electrical light
in the mercurial vacuum diminishes as it is cooled to a cer-
tain point, when the vapour must be of almost infinitely small
density, and is then stationary, seems strongly opposed to
the idea, that it is owing to any permanent vapour emitted

constantly by the mercury. The results with tin must be
regarded as more equivocal; because as this substance cannot
be boiled in vacuo, it may be always suspected to have
emitted a small quantity of the rare air or gas to which it
has been exposed; yet, supposing this circumstance, such gas
must be at least as highly expanded as the vapour from
cooled'mercury, and can hardly be supposed capable of afford-
ing the dense light, which the passage of the electricity of
the charged Leyden phial through the vacuum produces.
