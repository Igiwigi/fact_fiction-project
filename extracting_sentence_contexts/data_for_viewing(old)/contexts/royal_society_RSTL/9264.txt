5 questions which now apply to the marginal and polypite tissues in general to the

S it is that the contractile tissues are capable of two such very different kinds of response.

= By detonating ordinary cotton, we can never obtain an explosion ; and, similarly, unless
EY the general contractile tissues of these Medusz were in some way prepared to respond
EZ in a different manner to the different kinds of marginal or ganglionic discharge, we

5 * As tho polypite of Staurophora Taciniata is spread out over the radial tubes, it is not improbable that
& ganglionic elements may hero occur.

+ Tt may perhaps be thought that this is too strong a statement, Considering that, in the yarious species of
Tiqaropsis, spasmodic motions result when any part of the irritable tissues are stimulated, it may appear that
a zpasm differs from an ordinary contraction only in the degree of its intensity ; and therefore that, in
Staurophora, direct stimulation of the ganglia is followed by a spasxm only because a greater amount of
ordinary ganglionic influence is thus caused to be liberated than would be the case in a merely spontaneous
discharge. I think, however, that if this were tho explanation there ought not to be 80 immense a contrast as
{hero is between tho facility with which a spazm may be caused by stimulation of the margin and of the
| contractile tissue rezpectively, The slightest nip of the margin of Staurophora Taciniata, for instance, is suffi-
