Let there be also two other bodies, A and B,
of any magnitude, which are to each other in the proportion
of 2 to 1; suspended in such a position, that when perfectly
at rest they shall be in contact with the extremities of the
opposite pegs without pressing against them. Now if these
bodies were made to swing with motions 80 adapted that in
falling from heights in the proportion of 1 to 4 they might
strike at the same instant against the pegs opposite to them,
the ball of clay would not be moved from its place to either
side ; nevertheless the peg impelled by the smaller body B,
which has the double velocity, would be found to have pene-
trated twice as far as the peg impelled by A. It is unnecessary to make the experiment precisely as here
stated, since the results are admitted as facts by both parties;
but upon these facts they reason differently. One side obserying that the ball of clay remains unmoved,

considers the proof indisputable that the action of the body A
is.equal to that of B, and that their-forces are properly mea-
sured by their momenta, which are equal, because their
velocities are in the simple inverse ratio of the bodies. Their
opponents think it equally proved by the unequal depths to
which the pegs have penetrated, that the causes of these
effects are unequal, as they find to be the case in their esti-
mation of the forces by the squares of the velocities.
