Just behind the eyes is an oblong body in which a fine longitudinal arrangement
of fibres is visible; this may be the remains of the funnel: in the adjoining part of
the mantle the transverse fasciculi are, as in the other specimens, plainly discernible.
The left fin (e) is well preserved, and the contour of part of the right fin, as it seems
to me, is traceable, folded back upon the mantle. The left fin presents exactly the
same relative size and semi-oval contour of the free margin which is shown in Mr.
Prarr's specimen ; it has been slightly displaced, and advanced obliquely near the
anterior border of the mantle. A very compact shining dark-coloured substance at
the detached basal margin of this fin may be the charred remains of its supporting
cartilage. The right fin, the free border of which is bent inwards upon the mantle,
as is not unusually seen in ordinary naked Cephalopods, has preserved its true posi-
tion, rising a little above the visceral chamber of the phragmocone. The most im-
portant additional fact which we derive from the present specimen is the continuation
of the mantle over the sheath of the phragmocone, proving indisputably the internal
position of that part. The chambered division and thin calcareous and nacreous
structure of the crashed remains of the phragmocone are quite identical with those
of the phragmocones preserved with the spathose guard in the specimens from Mr.
Prarr's and Mr. Broperiy's cabinets.

In the present specimen about one inch of the apex of the phragmocone has been
Separated from the rest, but its impression is distinetly preseryed : in this we may
trace the longitudinal fold of the erushed capsule, and the impressions of the cham-
bers and septa to within a few lines of the apex. At the anterior part of the phrag-
mocone we have the depression in which the ink-bag with its indurated contents was
lodged. Remains of a thin horny plate are sitnated anterior to the ink-bag,
