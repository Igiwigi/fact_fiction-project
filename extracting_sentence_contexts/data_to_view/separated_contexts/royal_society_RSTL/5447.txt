The discussion, in the present section, of the different forms of the curve is not a very
full one, and a larger number of figures would be necessary in order to show completely
the transition from one form to another. The forms delineated in the four figures were
Selected as forms corresponding to imaginary values of the parameters by means of
which the equation of the curve is usually represented, 6. g. the equations in Section

XXXVII. It has been shown that for rays proceeding from a point and refracted at a circle, the
Secondary caustic is the Cartesian ; the caustic itself is therefore the evolute of the
Cartesian ; this affords a means of finding the tangential equation of the caustic, In
fact, the equation of the Cartesian is

(a*+3*—2)*+16A(z—m)=0;
and if we take for the equation of the normal

X:+Yn+Z=0,

equations which give
Z*Ys =Y(mZ7*— AX?)
—ZYy =Z*+X(mZ7*— AX?)

ZY(a? +5 —2z)=4AZXY?,
whence eliminating, we have
= {Z+X(mZ*— AX?)}*+Y(mZ*— AX*Y—Z*Y(Z+4AX)=0,

Swhere if, as before, c denotes the radius of the refracting circle, a the distance of the

Sadiant point from the centre, and the index of refraction, we have
