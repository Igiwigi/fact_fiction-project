This method of etching revealed the margins of the real
skeleton crystals. They have sharp edges, and occupy at least 99 per cent. of the
area, It is thus evident that the combs brought out by polishing or ignition, as seen
in fig. 1, are cores to the real skeletons of a, these latter being so closely packed that
it is only here and there that we can detect their boundaries. Thus, in spite of the
fact that the cores are somewhat richer in copper than the outside layers, we feel
justified in stating that the alloy solidified in one continuous process. Moreover, the
cavities between the real margins of the combs show that these combs, which so
nearly fill the field, are primary, that is to say, were formed during the process of
soliditication, the small cavities being caused by the presence of gas or by the

retirement of the mother-liquid during the contraction accompanying solidification. The coreing is evidently due to imperfect adjustment of the « to the liquid, a result
likely to occur during the solidification of a solid solution, and is a strong confirmation
of the view that the « crystals vary in composition.
