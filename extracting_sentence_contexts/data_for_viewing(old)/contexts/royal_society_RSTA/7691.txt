2. Denote by x andy the angles between a fixed direction and the radii con-
necting the ends of any given chord A. If A” denotes a point on a plane with
coordinates x and _y, then there will be a one to one correspondence between the
chords of the system (A) and the points A’ within the parallelogram (A’’) deter-
mined by the inequalities 0 << x = 2n,x = y= x-+ 7. The measure of the set of
chords A with their lengths exceeding B may be defined as being equal to the area of
that part of (A’’) where 2rsin $y > B.

Starting with this definition P {J > B} = 1 —2arc sin (B/2r) x.

It is seen that the two solutions differ, and it may be asked which of them is correct.
The answer is that both are correct but they correspond to different conditions of the
problem. In fact, the question “ what is the probability of a chord having its length
larger than B ” does not specify the problem entirely. This is only determined when
we define the measure appropriate to the set (A) and its subsets to be considered.
We may describe this also differently, using the terms “random experiments ” and
“ their results’’. We may say that to have the problem of probability determined,
it is necessary to define the method by which the randomness of an experiment is
attained. Describing the conditions of the problem concerning the length of a chord
leading to the solution (1), we could say that when selecting at random a chord A,
we first pick up at random the direction of a radius, all of them being equally
probable, and then, equally at random, we select the distance between the centre of
the circle and the chord, all values between zero and r being equally probable.
It is easy to see what would be the description in the same language of the random
experiment leading to the solution (2). We shall use sometimes this way of speaking,
