to the change of climate, the glaciers were no longer advancing, is it possible that ice-
barriers, 80 durable as to have lasted during the many ages required on this theory
for the formation of the © roads,” could have existed for that length of time?

The Cols.—On the hypothesis that the © parallel roads” were formed by the long
continued action of freshwater lakes in barred glens, it follows that rivers as large ab
least as the present Roy and Spean, must have flowed, during long successive periods,
over the cols at the head of Glen Roy, of Glen Glaster, and of Makoul. The late
Professor Nico, in 1869, was the first to draw attention to the consequences of this
assumption, and remarked* that in none of the cols © is there the slightest trace of an
ancient river,” such as there must have been, had * each of these passes been the exit
of a river of considerable size and flowing in a narrow valley for a long period,” This
important objection is confirmed by facts incidentally mentioned by other observers.

At the same time, Professor N1CoL 8ees in all the cols evidence of water action
compatible with what he considers might have been incidental to a narrow sea-straib,

In the Glen Gluoy Pass he found a line of stones on either side, but no indication of any
stream of water having ever run along it. Over the pass from Glen Roy to Glen Spey,
a considerable river, in all probability larger than the Roy at present, would have
flowed and left its impress.+ But no notch is cut there, or on the sloping deelivity down
to Loch Spey, nor has any delta been formed. On the contrary, the bottom of the
