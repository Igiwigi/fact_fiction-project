of modifying factors, so as to become recessive or, in other words, to exert no appreci-
able effect when heterozygous. That certain mutations must be of very ancient oc-
currence is indicated by mutations, which can be proved to be homologous,
occurring in nearly related species ; or more strikingly, perhaps, though the homo-
logy here cannot be experimentally proved, by the occurrence of such a mutation
as albinism in different orders of mammals. Therefore it is a fair presumption
that this harmful mutation has persisted in occurring throughout the history of
the entire class, if not for a longer period, and has been as persistently eliminated
by its injurious effects on the survival and reproduction of the affected individuals.
At the time the theory of the modification of dominance was first put forward, few
special facts could be adduced in its support, beyond the calculation that the
magnitude of the selective forces in operation was of an order likely to have been
effective. Several remarkable facts were, however, soon adduced by a number of
different geneticists which strongly confirmed the view that dominance had in
special cases, most notably, perhaps, in the polymorphic species, been modified so
as to allow the heterozygote to resemble the more advantageous of the two
homozygotes, and so to give dominance to the characters of the latter. This
evidence has been summarized elsewhere (FisHer, 1930, 1931).

The existence of a theory of the evolution of dominance naturally gave special
interest to the apparent exception exhibited by poultry. In 1929 the author put
forward the tentative suggestion that the contrast was not so absolute as had been
thought. The facts that, in addition to reputed dominants, poultry also
exhibited, like other species, complete recessives, such as silky feathers and recessive
white coloration ; and also lethals having a visible effect when heterozygous, such
