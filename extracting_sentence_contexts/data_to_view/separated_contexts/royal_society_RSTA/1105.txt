Equality (2.14) also guarantees that the GR energy-momentum tensor T}, coincides identically
with the SHTC energy-momentum T,? for arbitrary energy potential & even in the presence of
extra fields, e.g. the thermal impulse needed for the heat conduction formulation. In the end, we note that the proposed continuum theory does not rely on any specific
assumptions of GR, e.g. Einstein’s equivalence principle, and, in fact, it can be viewed as a
theory whose main feature is the causal description of dissipative phenomena, see §2d, ie. it is
compatible with the special relativity theory. Nevertheless, a side effect of using the configuration
gradient &", (the frame field) as the principal field is that the SHTC energy-momentum tensor 7,
is equivalent to the GR canonical matter energy-momentum tensor T;, for arbitrary background
Lorentzian metric gj. Moreover, due to their specific structure, the governing equations are also
generally covariant, e.g. [44] and equation (2.23) and (2.24) below, for the torsion-less space—times.


(c) Heat conduction

In this section, we give a variational formulation for the reversible part of the relativistic version
of the SHTC heat conduction equations [8,9].
