The re-establishment of the platinum thermometer proved to be a formidable task.
Fortunately, we had the advantage of the help and advice of the National Physical
Laboratory, so that some improvement in detail was achieved. The thermometer wire
was wound on a stiff brass tube. The wire was supported on mica, which was held by
saw cuts made in the brass in the ordinary way, so as to be thoroughly in contact with
the atmosphere in the balance. The resistances in the box were again of manganin,
and it was the adjustment of these coils that took so long a time, as special wire bridges
had to be made to enable proper comparisons by the Carey-Foster method to be carried

out. The wires employed in these bridges were also of manganin, and it is not easy to
get manganin wire in lengths of 1 or 2 metres of sufficient uniformity for our purpose.
The fact that the thermometer was built on a tube enabled us, in filling the balance
case, to circulate plenty of air; this proved to be an advantage. The final data of the
box are as follows :—

Largecoil ....... . . 85°3368 ohms.

hence the error is 0:0003 ohms,
or 1/400° C.)
