the Frog and Newt, immediately before and after impregnation, and to endeayour to
supply proof from actual experiments that the spermatozoa alone, in all cases of com-
munion of the sexes, are! the sole agents in impregnating the oyum ; and further, that
impregnation cannot be effected by the liquor seminis; and next to examine in what
way the agency of the spermatozoa is influenced, impeded, or exerted.

1. CHANGES IN 'THE OVUM WITHIN THE BODY.

The oyum of the Amphibia has so frequently been the subject of examination by
the best observers that a further detailed account of its development may at first ap-
pear to be useless, after what we already know of its changes through the labours, of
SWAMMERDAM, LEEWENHOEK, RoOESEL, SPALLANZANI, PREvosT and Dumas, Ruscox1,
Baxr, ReicugrT, Vocr, BELL and others. But apart from the fact already men-
tioned, that, the oyum of the Amphibia affords us the best means of actual experiment
on impregnation, there are questions which relate to its earlier conditions on which
the obseryers named are not agreed, but which are of importance with regard to the
physiology of reproduction in the whole of the yertebrata.

I shall state, therefore, what I bave myself observed with, regard to these questions
from the time when the ovarian oyum is approaching to maturity to that of its expul-
sion from the body, before entering on the subject of its impregnation.

As our means of comparing and testing the accuracy of all obseryations in natural
history, and of experimental results in physiology, depend mainly on; the correct
identification of the objects examined, I may here state,at once that the objects of
