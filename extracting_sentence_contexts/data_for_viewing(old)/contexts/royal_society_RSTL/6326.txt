group of natural objects, in which such ready comparison: of great numbers of individuals
can be made; and I am munch mistaken if there be a single specimen of Plant or Animal,
of which the range of variation has been studied by the collocation and comparison
under one $urvey of 80 large a number of specimens as have passed under the review of
Professor W1LLIAMSON, Messrs. PARKER and RUPERT JoxEs, and myself, in our studies of
the types to which we have respectively given our principal attention *,

236. The general fact which I desire to bring prominently forward as the result of
recent investigations into this group, is, that in all the types possessing a wide geogra-
phical distribution, which have been specially studied by myself or by others, the range of
variation has also been very wide; 80 that not only what would commonly be considered
as specific, but such as have been regarded as generic, and in s80me cases even as ordinal
differences, present themselves among organisms, which, from the intimacy of the
relationship that is evinced by the gradational character of those differences as well as
by the variations presented by the several parts of one and the same organism, must in
all probability have had a common origin. And it appears to me to be a justifiable
inference from this fact, that the wide range of forms which this group contains is more
likely to have come into existence as a result of modifications successively occurring in
the course of descent from a small number of original types, than by the vast number of
originally distinct creations which on the ordinary hypothesis would be required to
