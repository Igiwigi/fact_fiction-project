that half of the variance in disgust sensitivity in the sample
of Finnish twins was accounted for by unshared environ-

they are not social learning—strongly shape disgust sensi-

popular hypothesis—that disgust sensitivity is calibrated to
infectious disease, either experienced personally or present
in the broader ecology—in the next section.

4. Is disgust sensitivity shaped by infectious
disease?
