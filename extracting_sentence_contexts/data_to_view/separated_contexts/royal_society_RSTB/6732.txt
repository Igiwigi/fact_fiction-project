In this plant A+ X produces a reaction similar in character to that in-
duced by Y+X but of much less intensity. Such at least is true of the combinations
A+G, and A+ X*4; the combinations A+ X° and A+ X* are not to be distinguished
from uncomplicated infections of X° and X% respectively, fig. 44, Plate 25.

Mixtures of common aucuba and masked tobacco mosaic strains virus and those of the X virus

These reactions (fig. 39, Plate 24) which have been studied in close co-operation
with my colleague Dr Dennis, have brought to light new facts of importance. In-
fection with any of these mixtures on tobacco is heralded by the formation of local
lesions which do not occur as a result of simple infections with either X”, X°, X’ or any
of the three tobacco mosaics when operating alone. They appear in five days when
X% or X* are present with either of the three tobacco virus strains, and in 11-15 days
when any of the remaining X strains take their place.
