Of magnesia, and of phosphoric acid, there was, on the other hand,
rather more yielded up over both periods with the ammonia-salts than without it. Of lime, of potass, and of silica, indeed, the percentage in the dry substance of the
produce of the ammonia plot was abnormally low. That there should be actually less lime and potass taken up with the ammonia
than without manure is probably to be explained by the fact that, under the influence
of the purely nitrogenous manure, yarious species which commanded a more extended
range of oil than those which remained, had been displaced. Under the influence of
the ammonia-salts the total number of species found was greatly reduced ; the herbage
became more and more gramineous ; Festuca oving sometimes yielded more than half,
and Agrostis vulgaris more than a quarter of the total produce ; there was scarcely
any leguminous herbage ; and of miscellaneous species there were but few in number,
which contributed but a small proportion of the weight, excepting Rumer acetosa,
which was objectionably flourishing. Thus, the produce consisted chiefly of the poorer
grasses, which, moreover, showed very little tendency to form stem and seed, whilst
the stunted foliage was of a very dark green colour, indicating a very high percentage
of nitrogen in its dry substance, or rather a deficient assimilation of carbon in proportion
to the nitrogen taken up.
