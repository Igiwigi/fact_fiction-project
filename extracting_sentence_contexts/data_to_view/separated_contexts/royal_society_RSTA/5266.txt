Over the past decade, :8
a variety of approaches have been proposed to take advantage of the error-resiliency in : 3
several current and emerging classes of applications, in particular media/signal processing 1a

and recognition, mining and synthesis. These approaches advocate trading the accuracy of the
underlying hardware fabric in return for significant savings in the hardware resources used
such as energy, delay, area and/or yield and, therefore, lead to a reduced cost for computing. Dubbed inexact [2] or approximate computing, this work has now led to a subfield of active
research spanning methodologies that exploit the fact that, quite often, applications do not need
to have precise outputs. Taking advantage of various inexactness-inducing ‘knobs’ to vary the
hardware quality at different levels of hardware design abstraction, our own work has shown
that these inexact methodologies could result in significant resource savings in exchange for
entirely tolerable accuracy trade-offs. The feasibility of these resource—accuracy trade-offs has
been successfully demonstrated in several key resource-intensive arithmetics and digital signal
processing primitives [3,4].”

Several techniques at different levels of hardware design abstraction have been proposed to
realize inexact hardware.
