The Al
Sub-group 3 show decreasing decrements (Sc decreasing increments). O with 8 and
Se show decreasing increments. In fact, were it not for the very clear behaviour of
Zn, Cd, and Hg, the evidence would rather point to the conclusion that in each
group, the low melting-point sub-group show subtraction (« positive) and the high
melting-point addition (« negative). If this series depends on a formula sequence, it
is difficult to see how it can be any simple algebraic one—the mantissa would rather
seem to depend on a term similar to sin ma or tan ma. In the detailed discussion
above, however, it is seen how these changes of direction can be explained by lateral
displacements.
