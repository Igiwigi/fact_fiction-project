where we have used (2.7), setting A=0, and performed appropriately the integration by parts,
taking into account that fields and their first derivatives vanish at space-time infinity. We note that

2Using local field redefinition ambiguities [41,42,48,67-70], which do not affect the perturbative string scattering amplitudes
[71,72], one can extend the torsion interpretation of 1 to O(a’) effective actions, which include fourth-order derivative terms.


classically, in (3 + 1) dimensional space-times, the duality between Hyp and b(x) is provided by
the relation (corresponding to saddle points of the H path-integral) [48,65]

The ellipses ... in (2.8) denote subdominant, for our purposes, higher derivative terms (in fact
an infinity of them), but also other axions, arising from compactification in string theory [77],
which have been discussed in [44] but will not be the focus of our present study. The reader
should note the presence of anomalous CP-violating couplings of the KR axion to gravitational
anomalies in the action (2.8). These will play an important role in inducing an RVM inflation in
our string-inspired cosmology [43-46].

We note at this stage that had we kept gauge fields in our early-Universe cosmology as
external fields, and the KR axion field would also exhibit lagrangian couplings of the form «
b(x)Tr(F yn vF’’). Such terms would not contribute to the stress tensor, being topological. This needs
to be contrasted with the gravitational anomaly terms in (2.8), whose variation with respect to a
