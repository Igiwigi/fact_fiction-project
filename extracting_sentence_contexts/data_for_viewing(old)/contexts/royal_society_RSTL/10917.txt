GENERAL ACTION OF AMMONIUM SALTS.

From experiments with ammonium chloride, sulphate, phosphate, tartrate, benzoate,
and hippurate, FerTz and RITTER concluded that ammoniacal salts all had a similar
action, producing convulsions and coma, slowing of the pulse and lowering of the
temperature. They considered the action to be the same in kind, bub differing in
intensity. The convulsions produced by ammoniacal salts were shown by FUNK and
DxanxAa to be similar to the tetanus produced by strychnia, differing from it only in
the fact that a single convulsion instead of a series of conyulsions was produced by
the poisxon. The cause of this result they believed to be the rapid production of
paralysis of the motor nerves by the ammoniacal salt, which prevented the occurrence of
more than one tetanic convulsion.

As the action of chloride of ammonium has already been pretty thoroughly investi-
gated, it seemed to us unnecessary to make any more experiments upon its general
action, We have therefore restricted our researches to the action of the bromide,
iodide, sulphate and phosphate, and have experimented only on Frogs with the
bromide. The result of these experiments seems to be that ammonium chloride,
bromide and iodide form a series. At one end of it is ammonium chloride having
a stimulant action on the spinal cord, and, at the other, the iodide having a
paralyzing action upon motor nerves. Ammonia and ammonium chloride produce
