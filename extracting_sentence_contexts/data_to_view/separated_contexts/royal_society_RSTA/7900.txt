The resistances in the box were again of manganin,
and it was the adjustment of these coils that took so long a time, as special wire bridges
had to be made to enable proper comparisons by the Carey-Foster method to be carried

out. The wires employed in these bridges were also of manganin, and it is not easy to
get manganin wire in lengths of 1 or 2 metres of sufficient uniformity for our purpose. The fact that the thermometer was built on a tube enabled us, in filling the balance
case, to circulate plenty of air; this proved to be an advantage. The final data of the
box are as follows :—

Largecoil ....... . . 85°3368 ohms. Equal arm coils... .. . . 998815 ohms.
