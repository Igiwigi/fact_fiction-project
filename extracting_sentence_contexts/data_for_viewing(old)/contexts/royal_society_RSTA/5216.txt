few common features other than their possible utility in either removing carbon dioxide from
the atmosphere and sequestering it elsewhere (carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies) or
reflecting a small proportion of sunlight away from the Earth (solar radiation management (SRM)
technologies). CDR technologies include both the biological and chemical capture of carbon
dioxide, whereas SRM technologies could operate terrestrially (e.g. via more reflective crops,
clouds or infrastructure) or at a stratospheric level (e.g. through the deployment of reflective
aerosol particles).

At present, not a single one of the putative technologies that constitute the category
‘geoengineering’ have been developed or tested at the scale required to meaningfully establish
their effectiveness or feasibility. However, it is possible to anticipate and reflect on many of :
the social and ethical issues that the possibility of geoengineering the climate raises, in advance fa
of any particular geoengineering technology actually existing [3-7]. In fact, it is the social and iw
ethical concerns that geoengineering seems to present—questions around public consent for :
research or deployment, how technologies might be governed or the potential for geoengineering :3
to generate conflict, for example—that currently loom larger in policy debates than issues of :8
technical feasibility [8,9]. iad

There is now a small (but rapidly expanding) literature in philosophy and the social sciences
that has engaged with complex, inter-related questions around ethics, governance and public
engagement [5-7,10-13]. We do not seek to review this here (for an overview, see [11]). Rather, in
this paper, we focus on one of the most prominent ethical questions in science and policy debates:
whether the prospect of geoengineering will pose a ‘moral hazard’ that undermines political or
public support for existing climate policies.
