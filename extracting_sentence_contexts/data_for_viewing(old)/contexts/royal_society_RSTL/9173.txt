In this way sustained tetanus, or single contractile waves, or any intermediate phage,
may be instantly produced at pleasure. In such experiments, moreover, it is interesting
to observe that, no matter how long the strip may be, whateyer disturbances are et up at
one end are faithfully transmitted to the other. For instance, if an Aurelia be cut into
the longest possible strip with a remnant of the disk left attached at one end—as
represented by Plate 33 in my previous paper—then all the peculiar time relations
between successive contractions which are intentionally caused by the experimenter at
one end of the strip, are afterwards accurately reproduced at the other end of the strip
by the remainder of the disk. Now as this fact is observable however complex
these time relations may be, and however rapidly the 8nccessive stimuli are thrown in,
I think it is a point of some interest that these complicated relations among rapidly
succeeding stimuli do not become blended during their passage along the thirty or forty
inches of contractile tisxue, The fact, of course, shows that the rate, of transmission is
80 identical in the case of all the stimuli originated, that the sum of the effects of any
series of stimuli is delivered at the distal end of the strip with all its constituent parts
as distinct from one another as they were at starting from the proximal end of the strip.

IV. SECTION,

In this division I shall treat of all the evidence I have been able to collect regarding
the distribution of nerves and the physiological character of the contractile tissues in
the various species of Meduse which have this year fallen within my obseryation. By
the word © neryes” here I mean certain physiologically differentiated tracts of tissue
which either stimulation or section prove to perform the function of conveying impres-
sions to a distance ; and by * physiological character of the contractile tissues” I mean
