576 MR. PALMER ON THE MOTIONS OF SHINGLE BEACHES.

the additional extent of the beach on the east side occasioned by the heavy gales is
represented by the dotted lines.

The plan of Dover harbour, in the same plate, represents the state of the beach in
June 1833, after the wind had blown rather strong for a few days. (This is drawn
from a survey made by Mr. J. S. Tucker, of the Hydrographer's Office in the Ad-
miralty.) The dotted lines to the eastward of the piers represent the general out-
line of the addition to the former by the recent gales, which having formed a barrier
across the harbour's mouth, extended about seven hundred feet beyond it.

Many very interesting facts might be mentioned concerning the effects produced
by the continued gales at various places on the coast, but I find that the deseription
of them in sufficient detail to make them useful would extend this paper much he-
yond the limits assigned : I, however, trust that a reference to two of the most
remarkable cases will be found sufficient to illustrate the principles attempted to be
explained.

SECTION 7.

The only natural power by which the channels through the beach are retained, is
the returning force of the water, which on this coast is generally scanty. And it is
obvious, that however judiciously that force may be employed, it is but remedial in
principle, and necessarily implies a previous evil. So long, therefore, as the cause
