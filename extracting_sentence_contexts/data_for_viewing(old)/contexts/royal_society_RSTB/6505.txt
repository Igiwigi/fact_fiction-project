while intermediate flowers had petals 15 x 5-7 mm. One of the intermediate
plants had broad petals on the main stem, intermediate petals on one basal branch,
cruciate petals on two other basal branches, and a mixture of petal types on the fourth.
The other intermediate plant had both broad and intermediate petals on the main
stem, two side branches with intermediate petals, and three with cruciate petals.
This behaviour, with both parental types of petal appearing in different F, plants,
and even in the same plant, as well as intermediate petals, is in accord with earlier
studies by DE Vries (1902) of the inheritance of the cruciate condition. The
reciprocal, broad x cruciate, from the same two parental plants, gave only three
offspring, all with broad petals 11-12 x 14 mm.

One further cross was made, between two members of the cruciate strain from
Charny (71Â°34 x 47.33). This cross was made possible by the fact that many
plants from the 1933 culture only flowered in 1934. The seed parent had cruciate
and the pollen parent broad petals. It yielded 14 uniform plants having the bright
red midribs of the Charny strain, 5 of which had cruciate flowers, 5 had broad
petals, and 4 were intermediate. The broad petals were 13-14 mm. long. One of
the plants had on 6 August broad petals on its main stem, cruciate on 4 basal branches,
and broad on one basal branch. The same plants continued flowering and on
17 August had broad petals and one cruciate flower on the main stem, the side
branches having some cruciate and some intermediate flowers. Some of the broad-
petalled plants also showed later some intermediate flowers. No full explanation
of these phenomena need be attempted at the present time.
