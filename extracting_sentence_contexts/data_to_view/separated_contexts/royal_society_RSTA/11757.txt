A small amount of continuous
spectrum appears at the highest pressures, and is partly caused by the incandescent
poles being focussed upon the slit during a portion of the exposure, and partly also by
the spreading out of the wings of the strong lines as in the silver spectrum. Individual references to the lines on these plates will be found throughout the text.

5. Broadening of the Lines,—From the photographs we learn the following
facts :—

1. All lines broaden under pressure.

2. The broadening increases with the pressure, but different amounts of exposure
necessarily make it difficult to determine if the relation between the two quantities is
a linear one. :
