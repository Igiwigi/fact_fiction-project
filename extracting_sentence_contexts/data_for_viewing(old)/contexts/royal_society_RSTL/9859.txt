8ize some of the larger objects already described ; and I met with two similar ones,
fig. 38, quite equal in their dimensions to those seen in fig. 28. The exceedingly
small diameter of the hyphe in this example, compared with those in figs. 28, 29, and
30, suggest a distinction of 8pecies ; but we know too little of the effect of changed
gurroundings upon these simple organisms to make a multiplication of names desirable.
This latter form has been described and figured by Mr. Cas in a paper, © On the
Foxsil Fungi from the lower Coal-measures of Halifax,” read before the Yorkshire
Geological and Polytechnic in 1879. The specimen was discovered, along with others,
by Mr. Bixxs, of Halifax.

Mr. SurrH came to the conelusion that since the fossil Fungi which he described
possessed, as he believed, septate hypha and oogonia containing oospores, they must
be ranked with the Peronosporee. I confess that I cannot confirm the alleged facts nor
accept the inference drawn from them. That the plant is a Fungus seems most pro-
bable : equally s0 that its relations are with the Saprolegniee. The discovery of its
reproductive organs in a more perfect state will alone enable us to arrive at a ps
satisfactory conclusion on this point.

Along with the examples described are numerous single spheres about 0012 in
diameter. It was long doubtful whether or not these lapel to the supposed
Peronosporites, but T have now no doubt as to their doing 80, Their diameter is about
the same as that of the oogonia, of the branching specimens, and I found one in a_small
cluster of these objects which had developed into the state corresponding to that
represented by fig. 37.
