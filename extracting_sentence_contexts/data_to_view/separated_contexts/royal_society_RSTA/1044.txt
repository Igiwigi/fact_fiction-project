Readings of the barometer gauge and its associated thermometers are shown in the
section of Table XIX devoted to pressure measurements. The index correction has
already been referred to in Appendix I. The reduction to the standard temperature
of 0° C. was made in the usual manner, account being taken of the fact that the baro-
meter is a Kew Pattern instrument. The difference of level between the étalon system
and the cistern of the gauge barometer was 9 inches and a correction of — 0-021 mm.
was accordingly applied to the mean reading of the barometer. As the value of gravity
at the Laboratory is 981-195 cm.
