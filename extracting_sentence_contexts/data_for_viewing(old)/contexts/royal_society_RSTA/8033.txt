the changes are still perceptible even at ordinary temperatures, though in this case
the relaxation time required is of the order of months.

For the curves of fig. 11, each fibre was placed in the steam chamber while still at
an extension of 50% ; the uncertainty with regard to the effect measured lies therefore
in the fact that for a short time—the time required to contract in steam to zero extension.
which varies from about a minute after relaxation at 100° C. to a few seconds after
relaxation at 50° (.—the fibre suffers additional relaxation in steam whatever the
relaxation temperature under investigation. The uncertainty thus becomes less as
the relaxation temperature is lowered, but when the latter is at or near 100° C., the
curves show definitely that the minimum is raised by additional exposure of the fibre
to steam while still in the stretched state, because of the marked side-chain re-
combination that occurs at high temperatures (see below). Other experiments were
carried out in which the relaxed fibres were placed in the steam chamber only after
they had first been caused to contract to within a few per cent. of their initial lengths
by leaving them in water at the relaxation temperature. At 64° C. the time required
for this operation varied from about 15 seconds after a relaxation time of 15 minutes
to about 2 minutes after a relaxation time of 50 minutes, so that again there is a
