The sum is fixed
in this way but the orbital angular momenta of the individual photons are not, so the resulting
superposition is an angular-momentum entangled state [37]. This advance has provided a new
avenue for exploring entanglement in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces [38]. The high dimensionality of the orbital angular momentum state space contrasts with the fact
that there are only two orthogonal polarization or spin angular momentum states. This suggests
the use of orbital angular momentum for information processing and communication tasks. Padgett and co-workers demonstrated the use of orbital angular momentum as a key component
in a free-space communication link in which eight different orbital angular momentum beams
could co-propagate along the same optical path and then be separated by the receiver [39].
