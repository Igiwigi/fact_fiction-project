Normally upon
the lateral body wall there is a single large cutaneous vein underlying the lateral line and
opening into the subscapular sinus. This vessel in the late embryo, but apparently
not in the adult (Maver, 15, p. 324), may be represented by two parallel vessels, one
beneath the lateral line, the other situated somewhat lower down the body wall, and
both uniting before opening into the subscapular sinus. The position of the vessel that in Lamna I have called the lateral cutaneous vein,
beneath the lateral canal, suggests that it is homologous with the lateral cutaneous of
other sharks, in spite of the fact that it is connected with the jugular system and not, as
it should be, if normal, with the subscapular sinus. For it seems more likely that any

change that has occurred should be in the mode of connection of the vessel with the
central part of the venous system than in its general position upon the body and in its
territory of distribution. 246 MR. R. H. BURNE ON SOME PECULIARITIES OF THE
