The rectum is separated from the cloaca by a
very distinct circular inner sphincter, re, fig. 25. The genital ducts and the ureters
open separately into a wide urino-genital sinus, which through a wide neck leads into
the large ventral urinary bladder ; on the other hand it stands in communication with
the cloaca by a large aperture. This aperture is surrounded by a partly transverse,
but chiefly longitudinal, horizontal fold, the right and left halves of which can by
approaching each other completely close the urino-genital sinus, and in fact do so firmly
in the living animal. The walls in the recessus recto-vesicalis project over the opening
of the sinus, as shown in figs. 10,11, 25, and 26. In the female they generally do not
extend far enough towards the tail to reach the root of the clitoris, because this organ
is, when very small like in Chelys, very far removed from the sinus.
