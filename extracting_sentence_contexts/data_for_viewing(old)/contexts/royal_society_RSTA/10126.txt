words, the hour of maximum for P is much the earlier.

§ 31. In the case of the 12-hour term the differences between the annual variations
in the amplitudes for B and P are comparatively small. These variations are
illustrated by the dotted curves in fig. 3.

The phase angles « in Table XVIII. show fairly similar characteristics to those
exhibited in Table V. In both cases the seasonal variation is comparatively small.
‘The P phase angle is invariably the larger, 7.e., the maxima in the 12-hour curve are
again earlier for P than for B; the difference in time is however on the average only
slightly over an hour, though greater in summer than in winter.

The 8-hour term in B is unusually large. In winter ¢, is in fact much in excess of ¢,.

The annual variation of ¢, is regular and strongly developed, but is of a very unusual
character. The winter and summer values of a; in Table XVIII. are nearly opposite
in phase. There is also a considerable difference between the winter and summer
values of a; in Table V., but the difference is twice as big for B as for P and is exactly
in the opposite direction.

In the case of the 6-hour term the phase angles in Band P vary somewhat similarly
with the season, and the difference in the case of the mean diurnal inequalities for
