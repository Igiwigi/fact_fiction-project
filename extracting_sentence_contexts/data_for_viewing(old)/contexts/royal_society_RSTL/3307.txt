52 MR. DARWIN ON THE PARALLEL ROADS OF GLEN ROY,

detritus has the character of matter accumulated in shoal water, and the beds abut
abruptly against the bases of the mountains, instead of blending with the alluvium
on their surface, as would necessarily have happened had the whole been deposited
at the same time at the bottom of one basin.

The conclusion, that these valleys have been occupied by a sheet of subsiding water,
follows more plainly from a somewhat different class of facts. I have before re-
marked, that where a streamlet crosses a shelf, especially if it be the lower one, an
obliquely truncated buttress, the form of which was represented by dotted lines in
the wood-cut No. 1, projects from the side of the hill. It is quite evident that these
were accumulated when the sbelf existed as a beach, and the streamlet at present
only acts in removing those portions with which it comes in contact. Now in 8ome
points where the buttresses have been somewhat largely developed, smaller ones at a
lower level, composed of the same irregularly stratified waterworn materials, having
nearly the same outline, although unconnected with any sbelf, may be obseryed ad-
hering to the slope of the hill. Instances of this structure occur on the east side of
Glen Roy; on the south side of the Spean, and between Loch Treig and the bridge
of Roy, the accumulation of perfectly rounded shingle, like that on a sea-beach,
was enormous. The internal structure in this instance corresponded to the externa;
