In Dr. TurNeER’s ‘Chemistry’ its
constitution is thus defined: 1, or one equivalent of hydrogen, + 8, or one equivalent
of oxygen, = 9 the equivalent of water; and, by volume, 100 of hydrogen combines
with 50 of oxygen to form 100 of steam. If we take 16 as the equivalent of oxygen,
which corresponds with its specific gravity, then HO, expresses distinctly the consti-
tution of steam both by weight and volume. Another objectionable point may some-
times be remarked though it has now almost disappeared, the combining ratio by
volume is inserted before any determination of the fact has been made: thus

Dr. Turner defines the peroxide of hydrogen, 100 volumes, to consist of 100 oxygen
+ 100 hydrogen, whereas, since the vapour has never been weighed, it is just as
likely to consist of 50 volumes of each; both gases unite with others in several
instances in half volumes, so that, until the experiment has been made, all that can
be stated is that 17 by weight of the peroxide consists of 1 hydrogen + 16 oxygen.

combining weights alone. In this Table the specific gravity of a simple gas in terms of hydrogen unity is
taken as the value of its symbol (Col. 3, Part I.), and when this is inserted in
parentheses (as from Nos. 10 to 20), it represents the value that has been assigned to
the symbolical letter of the element in the compounds that follow, and indicates that
it has not as yet been weighed in the simple vapour.
