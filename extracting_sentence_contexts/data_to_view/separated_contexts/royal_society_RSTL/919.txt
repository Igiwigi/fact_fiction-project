viewing the specimen, I found it was split and broken in the
inside, s0 as to be lamellated in directions parallel, or nearly
80, to the'sides; 'on these plates there were colours in the day
time by the light of the clouds : and it is evident that it was
these fractures which caused the irregular images G and F, for
other specimens shewed no such appearance. I would there-
fore conclude; that Iceland crystal separates- the rays of light
into two equal and similar beams by refraction, and no more.*

As to the cause of the separation, I would hope that some
information may be obtained from the experiments I have re-
lated: for from them it appears, that this singular property ex-
tends no farther than to the action of the particles of Iceland
erystal onthe particles of light- in their passage through the
body; and from Obs. 4. it is farther evident, that it is not ow-
ing to the different properties which'Sir Isaxc NewToN con-
jectures'the different sides of rays to have; for if this were the
cause, when the rays pass between two pieces of crystal, an
uncommon flexion would take place. Lastly, another fact
(mis-stated by BarToLIN+ and RoME' vt LISLE) | shews, that
the unusual refraction takes place within the body, while the

+ Mentioning this account of Max Tin's mistake to Professor Rog150N, of this
university, I was pleased to find a full confirmation of it. It was that excellent phi-
losopher who $shewed the appearance to MarTrir ; but he not understanding it, took
the liberty of publishing the observation as his own, after first mangling it in such a
way as to give him, indeed, some pretext for the appropriation. The Professor merely
mentioned his haying communicated it to Mr, MazTin ; how the latter used it we
have shewn in the text : the theory of the appearance is s0mewhat more complex than
appears by my observations.
