which temperature the remainder of the product, which was considerable, and consisted
of pure zincethy], distilled over. No evidence whatever was obtained of the existence
of an intermediate compound containing both ethyl and methyl.

VI. Zinemethyl.

The experiments detailed in the foregoing pages requiring the use of considerable
quantities of zincmethyl, my attention was directed to the preparation of this body in
much larger quantities than could be obtained by the operations in sealed glass tubes,
described in my previous papers on this compound. I found that the preparation of a
strong ethereal solution of zincmethy] succeeded most satisfactorily in the copper
digester® used for the production of large quantities of the corresponding ethyl com-
pound; in fact, the decomposition by zinc of an ethereal solution of iodide of methyl is
much more quickly and perfectly effected than that of a similar solution of iodide of
ethyl. Heated to 100” in the copper digester, three ounces by measure of iodide of
methyl mixed with two ounces of anhydrous ether were perfectly decomposed in six
hours.. On opening the digester, a very small quantity only of gas escaped,—the whole
of the iodide having been transformed into zincmethyl. On heating the apparatus in
an oil-bath, the distillation began at 90®, and was complete before the thermometer
reached 140” C. Compared with an operation for zincethyl with the same amount of
materials, a very large product was obtained. Rectified, it began to boil at 35*; the
thermometer gradually rose to 48?, between which point and 51* nearly the whole of
the remaining and larger portion of the liquid came over. The product obtained
between the two latter temperatures possessed the intolerable odour of zincmethyl, was
spontaneously inflammable to the last degree, and, in short, had all the properties of
