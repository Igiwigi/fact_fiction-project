- not repeat, that both these functions are probably dependent on the same tissue-elements,

And, in any case, the fact that the essentially nervous function of maintaining excita-
tional continuity is able to persist in these primitive neryous tissues after they have been
submitted to the severest possible forms of section, is a fact the significance of which, it
seems to me, can scarcely be overrated. "The fact itself cannot be explained by Kupx-
ENBERG's theory of double-function cells ; for sometimes contractile waves will become
o blocked by section before the tentacular waves, and sometimes vice vers4. We seem,
therefore, driven upon the theory of a nerve-plexus whose constituent elements are
capable of yicarious action in almost any degree. 'This theory is 8upported by the results
of explorations with graduated stimuli, and also by the consideration that in Sears,
which is a more highly integrated form than Aurelia, the supposed plexus is 80 far dit-
ferentiated that vicarious action on the part of its constituent elements is usually possible
in but a low degree. Again, Tiaropsis appears to stand midway between Sarsia and
