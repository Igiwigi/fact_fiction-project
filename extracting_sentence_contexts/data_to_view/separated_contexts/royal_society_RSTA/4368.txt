The system is a complete system; hence it possesses four functionally independent
solutions. Writing

9 = gin — 89112 + 3922 — Je22»
these four solutions can be expressed in the form
z,e+y,
L—m— (y+ 2)(9n — 2912 + G22) — N+ Io»

and another involving v, which would require either the arbitrary constant or the
arbitrary functional form to which the third would be equated. (The fourth is, in fact,
a primitive of the compatible equation under discussion, though it is not necessarily
the common primitive of the three simultaneous equations.) We thus infer that

L—m— (y +2) (gn — 2912 + 922) — $+ In = W (w+ 4,2)

is an intermediary of the second of the equations.
