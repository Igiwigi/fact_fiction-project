A framework modelling dependencies in the form of trees and clusters was proposed by Bach &

Jordan [60]. A related approach was proposed by Zoran & Weiss [61]. 13

A recent trend in machine learning is ‘deep learning’, which means learning multi-layer : =
models, where each ‘layer’ is a linear transformation followed by a nonlinear function taken : ca
separately of each linear component, like in a neural network [62-64]. In fact, many such models : go
can be considered to be related to ICA: ICA essentially estimates one layer of such a ae
representation. This may lead to the idea that we might just estimate ICA many times, i.e. : Ss
model the independent components by another ICA, and repeat the procedure. However, this : 8
is meaningless because a linear transform of a linear transform is still a linear transform, and : S
thus no new information can be obtained (after the first ICA, any subsequent ICA would just if

return exactly the same components).
