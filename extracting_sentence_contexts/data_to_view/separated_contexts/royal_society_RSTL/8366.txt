Want of success in attempts to establish a
difference between the effects of the explosion of mercuric fulminate and nitroglycerine
upon the series of flames was ascribed by the experimenters to the limited range of the
8erics (or of the analyser of vibrations) ; but they regard their results as having demon-
strated that a marked difference exists between the character of vibrations developed by
the explosion of iodide of nitrogen and mercuric fulminate, and that the kinds of
vibrations deyeloped by a particular explosive substance are modified by an augmenta-
tion of the quantity of material exploded, s0 that a definite relation should be observed
between the susceptibility to explosion of the substance (ï¬†uch as gun-cotton or nitro-
glycerine) operated upon and the quantity of explosive substance required to produce
the initiative detonation. The results described by MM. Cramerox and PELLET have certainly demonstrated that
different explosive agents, detonated under the same conditions, may differ importantly
in regard to the character of vibrations which they develop; and their experiments with
iodide of nitrogen afford some 8upport to the hypothesis that a particular explosive
agent is peculiarly susceptible to the disturbing influences of the class of vibrations
which its explosion develops moxt readily, if not altogether to the exclusion of others. The observation made by them, that iodide of nitrogen, if employed in increased quan-
tities, will develop eventually those vibrations obtained with small quantities of mercuric
fulminate, which are not obtained with it when it is employed under the same con-
ditions as the fulminate, is in complete accordance with the facts pointed out by me,
that the chloride and iodide of nitrogen will only detonate gun-cotton when employed
in very much larger quantities than the requisite amount of fulminate. It still remains,
however, to be demonstrated why nitroglycerine, which is 80 readily detonated by a
much smaller quantity of fulminate than has to be used with gun-cotton, and is also
susceptible of detonation by small quantities of the latter material, is incapable of
detonating gun-cotton, even when employed in comparatively overwhelming quantities. * Comptes Rendus, t. Lxxy.
