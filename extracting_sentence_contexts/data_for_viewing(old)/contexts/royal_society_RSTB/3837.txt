primordium in the vicinity of the apex. It appears possible, therefore, to regard
these developmental stages as quite normal, since it is probable that most of the
younger stages come to maturity. Thus Pearson (1908) gives the number of
functional flowers as 60 (7.e., 15 in a row), and says that the end ones remain small
and attached as relics to the axis, after the shedding of the cone-scales and seeds.
Hooker (1864) figures old red cones with stylar tubes protruding from 20 to 22 scales
in each row up from the base. The cone figured shows 16 recognisable in one row,
total 64, with archesporial cells to the lowest stage (figs. 2, 5). No growth-change
takes places as the cones become functional, the scales remaining closely adpressed,
and there is no internodal extension in the axis. The protrusion of the “stylar
tube” does no more than lift the extreme edge of the subtending bract of each
flower, so that there is nothing that can be classed as mechanism in the cone-
structure. Hooker(1864) was so struck by this fact that he assumed that pollination
must take place when the cones were very small, no bigger than the staminate ones ;
the case of Pinus probably affording the suggestion.

From the analogy of other cone-mechanisms this retention of a closed condition in
the functional stage must be regarded as secondary, and due to the elimination of an
opening mechanism : since it is obvious that, as in other Gymnosperms, the pollen
grains once fell directly on the nucellus or in its immediate vicinity. That such
failure to open is the expression of xerophytic adaptation will be freely granted ; and
it may be noted that the essential parts of the ovule (embryo sac and nucellus apex)
