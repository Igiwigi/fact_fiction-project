cannot tell us whether the same difference obtains or not, and we must use other and
less direct means of finding out what takes place.

Let me direct attention to the experiments described in paragraphs 128 & 144.
Here red-hot copper was seen to repel the black surface with violence, and the white
surface only moderately. As the copper-ball cooled, the repulsion on each surface
became more nearly equal. At 400* C. the differential action was decided, though
faint. At 300*C. the black surface was still repelled Slightly more than the white
surface, but at 250* C. down to 100* C. the repellent action of the radiant heat was
the same on the white as on the black surface. The two surfaces were then thermi-
cally of the ame colour.

The fact that the work done on each 8urface was equal, is, I think, proof that the
absorption of the incident rays was equal.

172. Let me now carry the reasoning a step further. Experiments described in
pars. 159 to 168 show that when heat of low refrangibility—from the body (159), the
breath (160), hot air, or a warm glass shade (161, 165, 168)—falls on the white and

black surfaces, the white is repelled more than the black, rotation of the radiometer
taking place in the negative direction. 'The same rays falling on the two surfaces do
more work on the white than on the black ; and this, to my mind, appears sufficient to
