HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES,

We can now use this series to test the question as to the existence of parallel
series depending on (+2é,) D(). This does not mean that the sequences must be the
same in each. In fact it is to be expected that there may be a concomitant change
in them also, but they can only differ by a few multiples of the oun. The important
point to notice is that for large values of m, the effects of such differences become
negligible and the observed separations from the standard D should approximate to
+21°25, which is that due to 26, on the limit. It will not be necessary to go into
such a full discussion as in the standard series with D (0), except for the first three
sets, where the evidence for changed sequence terms with displaced limits is conclusive
and important.
