With some specimens of the wood of Abies pectinata the same thing
occurs. Bar wood also gives in the dark a picture in which apparently a large number
of cracks are represented ; these are not visible in the wood. That the picture produced
in the dark is perfectly definite and constant is shown by the fact that if successive
sections of the same branch be used the same picture is always produced. The botanist
may be able to throw some light on this curious fact. The true bark, the outside layer of a tree, appears to be in almost all cases quite
devoid of activity, but the layer within it, often of a brownish colour, is very active,
even more so than any other part of the wood.
