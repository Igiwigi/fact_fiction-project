with increasing order for m= 2,3,4. They are 94, 800 and 1380, and by no
stretching to the extreme possible errors can the two last be made equal. The
inequality is certain. Moreover, the observed differences are very close to multiples
of 6. If the first satellite position be calculated from D,, its difference is 110, the
observed is 94 and 43 = 106, 94 can be 106 within limits. D,, gives in the same way
800 for m = 8, the same as observed and 1468 for m = 4 instead of 1380. The last
may be the same as the observed within limits, but as 52) = 1381°6 and 55d = 1462,

it is possible there may be this difference and VD,, (4) is not VD,, (4) as in the typical
cases. The real difference may be any multiple between 52d and 55d. In fact 0 is so
small that there is not absolute certainty.

AID has proved itself the most intractable series to bring into any simple formula
of the ordinary kind. It was, in fact, the difficulty with this element which first led
me to seek another solution—on the lines now being considered.

It will be seen that it lends strong support to the theory suggested. The table is
arranged with ¢= 2°66. The exactness of the relations there shown is very
remarkable, and when it is remembered that A is a large number like 1754, the
practically exact multiples referring to the first five lines must carry very great
weight in the argument that AID at least is subject to a modification of successive
