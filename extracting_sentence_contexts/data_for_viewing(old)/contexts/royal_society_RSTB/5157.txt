This larger tubercle, ¢., corresponds to the primary tubercle found in all the other
inter-ambulacral plates (fig. 2).

All the unpaired inter-ambulacral plates are, at this early stage, similar in shape
and almost equal in size (¢f. fig. 5). Plates 2a and 2b in each area are now considerably
larger than in the imago, but those in the unpaired inter-ambulacrum (5) are slightly
in advance of the others. The peristome, although certainly nearer the anterior than the
posterior end of the body, is not so excentric as fig. 16 appears to indicate. This is owing
to the fact that, in whole mounts, the fasciolar spines and the long posterior primary
ones tend to raise the posterior end of the test.

When the test has increased to 0-95 mm. in length, all the peristomial plates in the
ambulacral series Ia, Ila, 1b, IVa, Vb are biporous, while in some areas a small pore

is also present in the second plate of the series Ib, IIb, IIa, IVb, Va. But the most
marked changes have taken place in the peristomial or buccal membrane (fig. 18). The
margin of the corona is no longer circular, but sub-pentagonal. Many more buccal plates
have been laid down, but the arrangement of these is irregular. Those next the corona
