First, both versions of the framework were
capable of providing a local interpretation for a given ECG signal classified by the network,
by suggesting which ECG wave was involved in the decision. Depending on the class-wise
recognition accuracy (recall) achieved and the ECG wave highlighted by the framework, our
understanding of the decision process in place by the network may change. In fact, when the

recall is low and the framework points to the right ECG wave for the diagnosis of the cardiac â€˜=
abnormality, the network is likely confounding its decisions with other abnormalities involving : =
the same wave. For example, high RV values regarding the T-wave may mean that the network :B
did not learn the correct pattern to distinguish between T-wave abnormality or T-wave inversion, : =
but was understood to focus on the correct wave. On the other hand, when the recall is high :g
and the RV value is low, the network might be overfitting on the given dataset, or the cardiac 3
abnormality is not uniquely related to a specific ECG wave (e.g.
