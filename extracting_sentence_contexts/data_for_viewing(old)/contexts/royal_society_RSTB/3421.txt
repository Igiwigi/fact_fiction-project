illegitimate M. among whites at the time of lowest birth-rate are not the highest
obtainable for this class, and the figures for illegitimate F. among coloured during
the months of highest birth-rate are not actually the highest obtainable for this class.

Tt will be recollected it has been claimed that the results obtained from records of



PRODUCED BY WHITES AND COLOURED PEOPLES IN CUBA. 305

illegitimate births should be more strictly in accordance with natural forces than is
the case when marriage is concerned in the calculation. The iriterest attaching
to the foregoing facts is due to the strong evidence it brings forward to show that
the forces which act on whites in favour of the production of M. is cumulative, while
those forces which favour the production of F. are short-lived ; whereas for coloured
peoples the reverse is the case: the inducements given to produce M. are short-lived,
while those exerted in favour of F. are cumulative.

Thus we have additional proof that the tendency of whites in Cuba to produce a
large proportion of M. and of coloured to produce a high proportion of F. is due to
the action of natural forces which have a different effect on the two races.

This difference of effect is no doubt due to hereditary qualifications, but the result
is equally surely brought about by extraneous physical conditions.
