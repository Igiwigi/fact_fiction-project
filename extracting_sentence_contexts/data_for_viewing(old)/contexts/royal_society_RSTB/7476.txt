diffuses through the tissues of the apex. Whether it moves by simple diffusion or by some
more complex process it is impossible to say, but is is clear that it must move upwards as
well as transversely, since the four youngest leaves can all exert inhibitions on the new
leaf arising at the apex. The results indicate also that in Rhoeo the central region of a leaf
is the main source of inhibition, since on that basis it has been found possible to explain
them consistently. They also suggest that the central conducting strand is the most effective
part of that central region. For in three experiments, nos. 8, 9 and 10, in which P, re-
generated a new central strand, the centre of J, was almost opposite to the new central
strand, and so appeared to have been inhibited by the new strand. But this inhibition
seems to have faded sooner than that from a normal leaf centre, since J, arose with its
centre close to the new central strand of P,. This rapid fading may be correlated with the
absence of a bud from the axil of the new centre of P,, which seems accordingly to have
been imperfect in some way. On the other hand, the fact that in four other experiments,
for instance, no. 4, figure 3, a bud did arise in the axil of a P, with its centre removed,
may be explained by its having been already determined.

Finally, the problem of leaf asymmetry remains to be considered. As stated in the
introduction, Schumann at first considered leaf asymmetry to be the determining factor of
the phyllotaxis, but later abandoned this view. In Hirmerâ€™s opinion (1922) the asymmetry
and the phyllotaxis both result from the insertion of a sector in the apex, but reasons have
been given for considering it improbable that such a process takes place, and in any case
