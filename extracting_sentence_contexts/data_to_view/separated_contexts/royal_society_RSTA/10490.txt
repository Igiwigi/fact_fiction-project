The first extension consists in the substitution of aqueous for gelatine solutions
of the salt to be measured. By this means many salts which will not form solid
jellies with gelatine may be investigated. The second depends on the fact that it
has been found possible to observe the boundary between two colourless solutions,
on account of their difference in refractive index, thus rendering the use of the
coloured indicator solutions unnecessary. The method compares the velocity of the anion and cation, and therefore determines
