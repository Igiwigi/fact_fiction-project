Tn the case of the sun, @ is the solar constant. One of the mistakes made by the
older experimenters was that of assuming the quantity b to be really a constant,
which it is not. It is, in fact, a function of two variables, viz., the wave-length of
the radiation, and ¢, the thickness of atmosphere traversed by the radiation. (LANGLEY, in commenting on this fact, seems to have overlooked Rosrri’s work, in
which the increase of b with ¢ is clearly and quantitatively stated.) From the results of his work, LANGLEY obtains 41 per cent.
