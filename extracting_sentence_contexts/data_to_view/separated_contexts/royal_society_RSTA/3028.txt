When using a linear model to explain the drivers of the DMS(P) concentration, DMS(P)t
and DMSPp were best explained by POC, then by the haptophyte pigment Hex-Fuco and thirdly
by the oxygen concentration. The DMS(P)d pool was best explained by the nitrate concentration,
then POC and another haptophyte pigment, Hex-kFuco (table 3). The fact that POC explains DMSPp better than the total phytoplankton biomass expressed as
Chl a or the haptophyte contribution to the community is intriguing and was examined further. A
potential contributor to high POC loading of the water column is sea-ice melt. Upon ice melt, ice
algae that contain DMSP are released to the upper water column.
