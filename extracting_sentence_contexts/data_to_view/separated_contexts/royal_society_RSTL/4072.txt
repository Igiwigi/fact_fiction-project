Z 17. Platythliptic Coefficients are negative. =

It may be observed as a matter of fact, that in consequence of the largeness of
-2 the Euthytatic Coefficients (z*), (Þ*), (4), as compared with the other Tasinomic
Coefficients, the Platythliptic Coefficients (bc), (ca), (ab) are generally, if not always,
S negative. ZZ To illustrate this, the case of Pantatic Isotropy may be taken, for which the two
E matrices have the following forms ;—
