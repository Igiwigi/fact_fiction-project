FROM SELECTED DAYS DURING THE SEVEN YEARS 1898 TO 1904. 317

§ 13. It will be convenient to discuss the two tables together, and it must be
remembered that amplitude now means the ratio borne by the actual amplitude of
the periodic term to the mean value of the element during the day.

Comparing corresponding results from the Bureau Central and the Eiffel Tower, we
infer that the amplitude of the 24-hour term varies but little, if at all, with moderate
changes of height above the ground. Its value, however, at both places was much
lower in the later series of years than in 1893, CHAUVEAU seems disposed to
attribute this diminution to the fact that the efflux tube had been shortened, the
reduction in the amplitude representing the increased disturbing influence of the
building and other surroundings. A similar phenomenon, however, is seen at Kew in
comparing the older and more recent data, and in an enhanced degree especially in
winter and autumn, and at Kew the efflux tube was a foot longer in the later period
than in the earlier. The phase angles in the 24-hour term at Kew and the Bureau
Central both vary largely with the season, but are fairly similar at corresponding
seasons, and the values from the earlier and later series of years are in fairly close
agreement, notwithstanding the great differences in the amplitudes. On the other
hand, the similarity in amplitude at the Bureau Central and the Eiffel Tower is
accompanied by a large difference in phase, at least in summer. CHAUVEAU infers,
from the similarity of the summer and autumn values of «, at the Eiffel Tower to the
winter value at the Bureau Central, that the large seasonal change in a, at the
