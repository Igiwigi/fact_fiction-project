Tf T is negative these pairs aro both real, Tf
T is poxitive they are both imaginary. When J is zero there are no longer two pairs, but a single triad of equal
roots. This perfectly explains what at first sight has the air of a paradox, viz. that the discrimination between
the two kinds of double equality of an apparently equal order of generality that may subsisb between the roots
of an equation, depends on the fulfilment or failure of an algebraical equality, The fact is, as shown above,
that there are not, as commonly supposed, two, but three kinds of double equality, according as there arc two
pairs of real, two pairs of imaginary, or one triad of equal roots ; and the last is a sort of transition case between
the other two. MDCCCLAIV. 4R

planar regions on oppoxite sides of the line AOA; and again this line into two linear
regions on either side of the origin O, which last corresponds to the case of three equal
Toots, and constitutes a region or microcosm in itself.

(68) Tt may as well be noticed here that the ambiguity of character in the points
representing the different families of biquadratic forms when # and D are taken as the
coordinates (and the same would be true if s and D were employed), which preyails
when these points lie above the line D=0, equally obtains along this line itself. For
the reduced form, when D=0, is aa*+4ba%+6ca*%.
