the hyperfine structure and pressure shift plates) Ilford ‘“* Monarch” plates were
used as these are more rapid to the violet than the hypersensitive plates.

The light source was placed about 8 feet away from the interferometer and the
light was condensed on the étalon (or the collimator slit) by a quartz objective of
6-in aperture and 15-in focus.

All the photographs were taken by the method of alternate exposure, ¢.g.,
Cd 2 min, Kr 2 min, Cd 2 min, . . ., and before and after each comparison a
short exposure of krypton was taken on a different part of the plate, for detecting
any change that might occur in the optical length of the étalon during the comparison.
The change was rarely found (even with the longest étalon) to exceed a few
thousandths of a fringe during a comparison ; in fact, it was nearly always less than
the setting errors on the fringes. For example, in a series of comparisons using the
10 cm étalon, the value of e for the cadmium line was found to be 0-424, 0-416, and
0-408, although a period of about halfan hour elapsed between successive exposures.
The change during the exposure must have been considerably less than this, probably
of the order of 0-003 of a fringe, which is slightly more than 1 in 100,000,000. This
constancy in the optical length of the étalons is due to the efficiency of the temperature
control in the Equable Temperature Room of the Imperial College, and of the heat
installation of the cadmium furnace. All the controlling rheostats were outside the
Equable Temperature Room, and any effect of the radiation from the furnace was
