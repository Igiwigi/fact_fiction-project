The value of b/a for cy is also largest in winter, but in the case of H the summer
value appears also in excess of the equinoctial. At Kew, the values of b/a for ey
are with one exception decidedly smaller than the corresponding value for ¢, ; in like
manner the values for cs are generally less than those for ¢,, and the values for ¢, less

x than those of ¢,. In fact, in summer we have negative values for b/a in ¢, for D, H
S and N. This may be accidental, as the numerical values appear very small, but we
§ may at least conclude that sun-spot frequency exerts but a trifling influence on the
& value of c, at Kew.
s The reduction in the value of b/a as we pass from cy to cs, and from ey to ¢,, is also
© % well shown at Wilhelmshaven, though not quite so prominently as at Kew. Where
g "z the Wilhelmshaven data differ most notably from those at Kew, is in giving a larger
Value of b/a for ce, than for c,, in both H and N.
5 The values of b/a found for ¢, at Kew appear decidedly larger than those found in
‘2 Table XLI. for the range, or even as a rule than those found for the sum of the
3 24 hourly differences.
