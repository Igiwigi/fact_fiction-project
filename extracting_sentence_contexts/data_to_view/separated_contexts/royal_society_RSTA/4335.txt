Owing
to the greater increment of the expansion along the direction of the axis c, the pre-
ponderance of the expansion along the axis a diminishes, until at 50° the amounts of
expansion along these two axial directions become equal. That is to say, in the
neighbourhood of 50° the crystals of rubidium sulphate simulate uniaxial symmetry
as regards their thermal behaviour. This is.rendered the more interesting by the fact
that. about this temperature the crystals of this salt also exhibit uniaxial optical
propérties:. OWwiiig to the extrémely feeble double ‘péfractiony it* was’ sliown (Joe. cit,
