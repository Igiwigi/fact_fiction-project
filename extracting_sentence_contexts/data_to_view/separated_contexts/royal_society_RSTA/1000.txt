Figure 2 shows the analytical solution of the Cauchy problem (B 1)-(B 3) for the determination
of a transient behaviour of the relative temperature n (or u) and polymerization degree Â¢ (or w). It is easily seen that the dimensionless temperature increases with time. This is due to the fact
that the metastability degree reduces with time as a result of the release of latent heat by the
growing crystals, which in part compensates for the supercooling. The polymerization degree
initially increases because the polymerization rate exceeds the withdrawal rate of melt at small
