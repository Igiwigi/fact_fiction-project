which agree with the empirical formula C,, H,; O,, our substance being accordingly
is0meric with camphor, to which, however, it has no further resemblance. This composition varies also widely from that of the crystalline substances procured
from analogous sources, and which have a. great resemblance to our substance ; for
instance, the crystalline resins on the one hand, Chinese wax and waxes generally on
the other. We have mentioned aboye, in speaking of the action of various reagents on our new
substance, the occurrence of acetic acid under two different circumstances; we did not
attach much importance to this fact at the time, because this acid occurs 80 frequently
among the products resulting from the breaking up of organic substances ; we never-
theless repeated subsequently these experiments on a somewhat larger scale, with the
view, however, chiefly of studying the other products of decomposition which are formed. Tn order to eliminate as much as possible the effect of temperature, we made use of that
