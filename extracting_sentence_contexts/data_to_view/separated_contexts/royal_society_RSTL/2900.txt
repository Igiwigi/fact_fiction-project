When the temperature of the atmosphere has risen very
suddenly, I have found it exceed that of the hive by one or two degrees, as in Table XY1. No. 173, provided the bees continue in a state of entire rest ; but if, on the contrary,
the temperature of the atmosphere be suddenly diminished, that of the hive will 8ub-
side also, but with much less rapidity. These facts are shown in the observations,
Table XIV. Nos. 85 and 86, and also in all the observations on the tables which were
made after one o'clock at noon on each day during the winter. Sometimes the ther-
mometers became exactly equal to each other, as in No. 124.
