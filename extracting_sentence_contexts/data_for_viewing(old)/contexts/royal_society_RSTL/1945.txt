The same facts enable us to understand how a perfect action of the sphincters
is compatible with paralysis of the limbs from disease of the cerebrum, and even
of the higher parts of the medulla spinalis; whilst paralysis of the sphincters is
usually conjoined with paralysis of the limbs, arising from disease of the lower
part of the spinal marrow. The first intercepts the principle of voluntary mo-
tion; the second affects the very seat of the reflex function which presides over
the action of the sphincters.

IV. Inferences.

T $hall now briefly enumerate the inferences which flow from the preceding
facts and experiments.
Physiologists have hitherto enumerated only Zhree sources or principles of
muscular action, â€”yolition, the motive influence of respiration, and irritability.
'There is, however, a fourth source of muscular motion distinct from any of

designation of the reflev.

Volition and the motive influence of respiration are direct in their course,
