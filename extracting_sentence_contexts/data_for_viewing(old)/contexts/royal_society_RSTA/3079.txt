of our analysis pertains entirely to climatic risk transmission and the manner in which it plays
out in various ways across the globe.

In the two classes described above, we distinguish mechanisms where climate is, and is not,
the principal generation mechanism for climatic risk transmission. For any one impact there will
probably be a mixture of transmission mechanisms. Figure 2 summarizes the two transmission
mechanisms and their linkages. To illustrate with an example: food security in a given location
is affected by the systematic teleconnections such as ENSO (upper left of figure), which disrupt
economic activity and affect markets for food and other commodities (upper centre of figure).
The result is a systematic pattern of impacts on food availability and/or price across multiple
regions (upper right of figure). This is climatic amplification of food security risk. By contrast, the
resource-generated amplification of risk is shown along the bottom of figure 2. Here, perceived
risks play a key role. The various linkages between these pathways illustrate the fact that they do
not act in isolation.

A key difference between the two mechanisms is that, in resource-generated transmission,
climate triggers perceived risks that may or may not exist in reality; whereas in climatically
generated risk transmission, climate acts as a real systematic pattern across time and/or space,
which may or may not be measured, or even detectable. One mechanism is rooted in perception
(social risk) and the other is rooted in the climate system.
