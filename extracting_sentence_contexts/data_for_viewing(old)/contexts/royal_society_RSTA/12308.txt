which gives very approximately

There is, therefore, always a lag of phase caused by the motion, which canne
made negative, or even zero, but which is a minimum when the motion is across”
line of light, and a maximum when along it ; being, indeed, twice as great for mo
along as it is for motion across. Supplementary angles give the same effect.

One may express the fact by saying that the virtual distance the light has tt
is §,Q,, or S,Q,, instead of SQ.

Case when the Mirror Moves too.

60. It is observed that in this investigation the mirror has been supposed stationary
ith respect to the medium, it is therefore possible, if the mirror is moving at the
ne rate as the source, e.g., if they were both fixed and the medium streaming
+ both, that the circumstances may be a little different ; because since the whole of
wave-front does not strike quite simultaneously, there may be time for some effect
