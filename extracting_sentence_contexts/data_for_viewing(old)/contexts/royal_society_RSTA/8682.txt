checking the validity of Drupr’s formula, and has been used extensively in recent years
as a convenient test for this purpose (Lowry and Dickson, * Trans. Chem. Soc.,’ 1913,
vol. 103, p. 1075; Lowry and Asram, ‘ Trans. Faraday Soc.,’ 1914, vol. 10, p. 104;
compare also FRANKLAND and Garner, ‘ Trans. Chem. Soc.,’ 1919, vol. 15, p. ‘640,
footnote, and Rupe and AkERMANN, ‘ Ann. der Chem.,’ 1920, vol. 420, p. 12). The
mere plotting out on Bior’s original plan of a series of accurate experimental data
would therefore have disclosed to him both the existence and the magnitude of Drupr’s
correction. 4

Tn the absence of Bror’s mathematical genius, however, nearly all the work on rotatory
dispersion during the next half-century became semi-qualitative in character, the data
being represented by curves of unknown form, instead of by mathematical equations.
This fact affords an explanation of the exaggerated importance which was attached to
the more conspicuous anomalies, as well as of the utter confusion into which all attempts
to classify rotatory dispersion fell. Thus, in the absence of any precise knowledge of
the real form of the dispersion curves, KrECKE seized upon “ the anomaly that, in con-
centrated solutions of tartaric acid, the green rays are turned more than the red and
violet rays ” (‘ Arch. Néerlandaises,’ 1872, vol. 7, p. 114). Lanpour in 1877 recognised
two anomalies, namely, (i.) that in aqueous solutions of tartaric acid “ if one increases
the concentration, the maximum rotation wanders [from the violet] towards the red
end of the spectrum, and in solutions containing 50 per cent. tartaric acid, the green
rays are most strongly deflected,” (ii) “ that tartaric acid in the anhydrous state must
deflect the rays C D E to the right, b F e to the left, and that for a certain kind of light,
whose wave-length lies between the lines E and C, there can be no rotation at all”
(‘ Liebig’s Ann. der Chem.,’ 1877, vol. 189, p. 274).
