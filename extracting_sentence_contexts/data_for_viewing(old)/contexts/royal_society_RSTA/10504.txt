any disturbing causes, such as faint companion lines or shadings. But this degree of
accuracy seems actually to have been attained in a large proportion of the iron and
titanium and other well-identified lines (see Table I., p. 478).

The mean values for the hydrogen lines, given separately in Table IL, agree very
closely indeed with the computed values. Thus in nineteen lines, in a total of
twenty-eight, the differences do not exceed ‘04 tenth-metre, and in four lines only the
differences reach ‘1 tenth-metre, three of these being the lines y, § and e, which are
difficult to bisect on account of their great width. This result will, perhaps, best
indicate the general accuracy of the wave-length work.

No corrections of any kind have been applied to the results, and it may be well to
emphasise here the fact that no corrections are needed for apparent displacements
due to the different altitudes to which the various gases ascend in the chromosphere.
In making the measures, the settings were made at the position of maximum density
in the case of the broad over-exposed hydrogen lines, the finer lines being simply
bisected without reference to the apparent edge of the moon’s limb.

It is probable that the positions of maximum density of the images of the stronger
lines correspond to radiations coming from a region within 2” of the photosphere,
whilst in the fainter ultra-violet hydrogen series the radiations are almost confined
to the flash spectrum layer, the emission from the upper chromosphere being almost
insensible for these lines.

Assuming that all the settings were made on ares radiated from a region within
