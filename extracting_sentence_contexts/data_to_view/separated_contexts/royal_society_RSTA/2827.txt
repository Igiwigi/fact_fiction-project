The number of lines, however, coming within this cycle is very large,
but a complete discussion would involve the consideration of the new kinds of
relationships referred to under barium, and cannot therefore be undertaken here. It
will be sufficient to deal only with some generalities, specially bearing on the series
proper, which will also give some further light on the general D series. There are a large number of triplets with separations in the neighbourhood of 692
and 482, which are roughly in the proper ratio 5: 3, allowing for the fact that the
actual separations must be larger. Those in the table of F lines above are roughly
parallel to the BaF, and give a limit somewhere about 24520. VD,,(2) would
therefore be about this, and VD,,;(2) more than 692+4382 = 1124 larger.
