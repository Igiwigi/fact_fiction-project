alternative respiration can be an important valve to dissipate
cellular energy because it contributes to 50% of mitochondrial
respiration [21].

The impact of respiratory activity on the energy balance
of microalgae depends on their metabolic activity. Thus,
respiration is different in slow- or fast-growing cells [36]
and in response to changed environmental conditions, like
temperature [38], nutrient status [1] or day length [39,40].
The metabolic activity of microalgae is also influenced by
their macromolecular stoichiometry and the degree of
reduction in cellular macromolecules. This is explained by
the fact that the synthesis of carbohydrates requires four elec-
trons per carbon, whereas the synthesis of lipids and protein
strongly increases the electron requirement to a value of
greater than 6 [41]. The metabolic energy for biosynthesis
of macromolecules is delivered by both respiration and
photosynthesis. Therefore, depending on the relative frac-
tions of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins in the biomass,
the photosynthetic quotient (net Oz evolution rate/net CO2
consumption rate) may vary in diatoms between 1.1 and
1.8 ({1]; W Su et al. 2012, unpublished data for S. costatum
and Cyclotella meneghiniana).
