we find that the enumeration is identical with that of the permutations which are
such that the quantity x, occurs s,, times in places originally occupied by the
quantity «,, when g > p, and, as before, we take the coefficient of

Hence, an arithmetical correspondence, and, also, the fact that the true generating
function for the enumeration of these permutations is

The above example is only a solitary one of a large number that might be furnished.
