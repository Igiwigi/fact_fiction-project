And it is clear that the points &', 0', c\, .. correspond homographi-
cally with the planes A, B, C,.. . This gives immediately the construction for the
case where the two directrix lines come to coincide. In fact, on the twofold directrix
line 1=1' take the series of points a, 6, c.., and through the same line, corresponding
homographically to these points, the series of planes A, B, C,..; the generating
lines through the point @ are the lines through this point, in the plane A, to the
points in which this plane meets the curve m; and s0 for the entire series of points
b,c,.. of the line1=1/; the resulting scroll, which I will designate as the scroll S (1, 1, m),
remains of the order =2m. If there is given a point of the curye m, then the plane
through this point and the directrix line is the plane A; and the point &@ is then also
given by the homographic correspondence of the series of planes and points, and the
generating line through the given point on the curye mz is the line joining this point

-with the point a.

13. We may say that, in regard to any point @ of the line 1, the corresponding plane
A is the plane of approach of the coincident line 1'; and that in regard to the same
point @ and to any plane through it, the trace on that plane of the plane of approach is
the line of approach of 1'; that is, we may consider that the coincident directrix line 1'
meets the plane through @ in a consecutiye point on the line of approach.
