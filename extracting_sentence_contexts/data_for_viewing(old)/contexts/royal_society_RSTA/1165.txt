In many cases, stability results for Co-semigroups or their individual orbits are consequences
of general Tauberian theorems for Laplace transforms. The latter often serve as an inspiration
for the former, and in modern treatments both are recognized as being two sides of the same
coin. Nowadays, the role of Tauberian theory in the theory of Co-semigroups is well understood.
The relevant theory was developed in a number of papers, arguably starting with the seminal
paper [64]. Later, in [65], a finer distributional approach was developed, which has recently been
extended to include quantitative aspects; see [66-69]. A good introduction to modern Tauberian
theory may be found in [70], while applications to operator semigroups are discussed thoroughly
in [1].

The following result is usually attributed to Ingham [71] and Karamata [72], although a version
was in fact first discovered by Riesz [73, Satz II]. It is a classical Tauberian theorem which
underpins just about all of what follows here; we refer to [53] for a short proof.

Theorem 3.1. Let X be a Banach space and let f : Ry â€” X be a bounded and uniformly continuous
function whose Laplace transform f admits a holomorphic extension to each point of iR. Then

Theorem 3.1 is the starting point for numerous results in the asymptotic theory of Co-
semigroups, and it has been generalized in various directions. It is natural in analysis, and also in
Tauberian theory, to equip a convergence result with a rate whenever this is possible. In the case of
Theorem 3.1, this can be done in a way which has a number of interesting consequences, not least
for operator semigroups. Observe, however, that Theorem 3.1 is best possible in the sense that
one cannot expect any rate of decay for f if no further assumptions are imposed on the growth
