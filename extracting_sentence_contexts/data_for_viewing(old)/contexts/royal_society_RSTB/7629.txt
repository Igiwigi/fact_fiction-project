It is at once apparent that these pollen spectra stand quite apart from those hitherto
considered. Species characteristic of the Late-Glacial are lacking (with the exception of
Selaginella, Botrychium and Lycopodium), all pollen is sparse, and it includes types such as
Abies, Tilia, Quercus, Ulmus and Corylus which cannot be other than derived, most probably
from Inter-Glacial sources. In addition, it should be noted that much of the Pinus pollen
is of the type Haploxylon described by Rudolph (1935) from the Tertiary of Bohemia,
and later reported as derivative in glacial clays by Iversen (1936). The most probable
source of this pollen is the local London clay, and doubtless from the same source come
grains of Juglans not recognized when the initial counts were made.

These analyses as a whole indicate little beyond the fact that local pollen must have
been very sparse during deposition of the mere muds, and local vegetation may have
been so too.
