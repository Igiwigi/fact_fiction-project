1161. THE science of electricity is in that state in which every part of it requires
experimental investigation ; not merely for the discovery of new effects, but, what is
Just now of far more importance, the development of the means by which the old
effects are produced, and the consequent more accurate determination of the first
principles of action of the most extraordinary and universal power in nature :—and to
those philosophers who pursue the inquiry zealously yet cautiously, combining expe-
riment with analogy, suspicious of their preconceived notions, paying more respect
to a fact than a theory, not too hasty to generalize, and above all things, willing at
every step to cross-examine their own opinions, both by reasoning and experiment,
no branch of knowledge can afford s0 fine and ready a field for discovery as this.
Such is most abundantly shown to be the case by the progress which electricity has
made in the last thirty years : Chemistry and Magnetism have successively acknow-
ledged its over-ruling influence; and it is probable that every effect depending upon
the powers of inorganic matter, and perhaps most of those related to vegetable and
animal life, will ultimately be found subordinate to it.

1162. Amongst the actions of different kinds into which electricity has conven-
tionally been subdivided, there is, I think, none which excels, or even equals in im-
portance that called Induction. It is of the most general influence in electrical phe-
nomena, appearing to be concerned in every one of them, and has in reality the
