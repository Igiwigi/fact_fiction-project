They are the most sophisticated general-
purpose particle physics experiments ever built. They were rapidly commissioned and started
producing publishable physics results within a few months of recording the first proton—proton
collisions. In order to discover the new phenomena mentioned above, protons have to collide head on; in
fact, the partons inside the protons (quarks and gluons) have to collide head-on, in what is termed
a ‘hard interaction’ (figure 4), as opposed to a glancing collision where less energy is involved in
the physics of the interaction. Any new particles produced as a result of these collisions will
manifest themselves through disintegration into the well-known particles of the SM mentioned
above. The photons, electrons and muons can emerge into the detectors directly from the hard
interaction, whereas quarks and gluons, never visible as free particles, appear in the detectors as
collimated bunches of stable or quasi-stable particles labelled ‘jets’.
