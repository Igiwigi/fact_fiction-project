importance is to be given to the comparative and developmental study of the spore-
producing members over the vegetative, and similarly of the sexual organs over the
vegetative conformation of the prothallus.

The form of the stem is clearly an uncertain basis for comparison ; it varies quite
independently of the sorus, so that differences of axis may be found within near limits
of affinity. For instance, in such closely allied species as Onoclea sensibilis, L., and
Onoclea struthiopteris, Sw., the one has a creeping, the other an upright stock. But
though many instances might be quoted as showing the instability of the characters
of the axis, even within the limits of the genus, still in certain tribes there is a
constancy which cannot be ignored. The creeping axis is characteristic of the
Gleicheniacese, Lygodium, Matonia, Loxsoma, most Hymenophyllacee, Dennstedtia,
Microlepia, and Davallia ; in fact, it is the prevalent form in those Ferns which
illustrate the probable transition from Simplices to Gradatze and Mixte. It has been
suggested to me that, under circumstances of stress, the creeping stem would be more
likely to survive than the upright, or arborescent. The Lycopodinez are a good
example of this; the aborescent forms are extinct, and the creeping or epiphytic
species of Lycopodium and Selaginella survive. Similarly with Hquisetum as compared
with the fossil Calamariese. Thus we may see in the creeping habit of such important
connecting links as Matonia and Loxsoma, and other Ferns above quoted, one of the
factors which may have led to their survival.

Again, it may be shown that the form and texture of the leaf vary independently
of the characters of the sorus. It suffices to mention that simple-leaved species exist
in such genera as Danea, Cyathea, Trichomanes, Adiantum, and Asplenium, &e.,
