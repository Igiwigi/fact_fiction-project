brain. I have to admit however that I am not yet able to determine the homologies
of that artery which supplies the hippocampus in the crocodile. We are now in a
position to describe the posterior cerebral artery in Echidna.

The posterior cerebral artery in Echidna is shown in figs. 18 and 19. For the purposes
of description it can be divided into three parts. The first part is formed by the division
of the basilar artery at the cranial border of the pons. It passes slightly forwards and
outwards, hooks round the third nerve and then comes to lie hidden in the groove
between the subthalamic region and the overhanging medial portion of the cerebrum.
The first part ends by dividing into two branches the posterior communicating artery
and the second part of the posterior cerebral. The branches of the first part of the
posterior cerebral artery were difficult to follow to their termination on account of the
facts that the arteries were not injected, that the deep cleft between the cerebellum and
the overhanging cerebrum made their observation with the binocular microscope
difficult, and that only one of the nine brains examined was open for dissection. I was
able to ascertain however that branches, arranged in parallel series, were distributed
to the two corpora quadrigemina, and to the sides of the mid-brain. On removing the
thalamic region of the brain to see the deep course of the posterior cerebral artery these
vessels were severed and their severed ends are clearly shown in fig. 19. These observa-
tions were made in Hong Kong and the conclusion was arrived at that these branches
had definite metameric value. This opinion was amply confirmed when I was able to
investigate a large series of brains at University College, of which the brain of Myrme-
