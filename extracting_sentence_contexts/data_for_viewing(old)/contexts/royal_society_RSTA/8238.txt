—that is to say, the steady motion is stable for the type of disturbance considered :
if it can increase continually, we shall be justified in asserting that the steady motion is
unstable.

REYNOLDs does not seem to have applied his method to the problem which we are
discussing here ; but for other types of steady motion,* by taking arbitrarily chosen
types of disturbance which satisfy the boundary conditions, he was able to deduce a
limiting velocity which must be exceeded if the kinetic energy integral is not to decrease,
The criterion is expressed as a limiting value of a non-dimensional quantity akin to
the quantity Vd/v which we have taken as the “* ReyNoups’ number ” of our problem.
Numbers of this kind are known from experiment to be criteria of critical velocity in
all cases where instability has been found to oceur; and ReyNoups seems to have
concluded from this fact that his calculations had some bearing on the basic question
of stability.

The application of ReyNotps’ method to our problem was made by H. A. Lorentz,
who obtained the limiting figure 288 for Vd/v, taking as his assumed disturbance
a species of “ elliptic whirls.”

11. But if the type is chosen arbitrarily (as in these investigations), the rate at which
the integral is found to increase will as a matter of fact afford no indication of stability
or instability. As remarked by G. I. Tayuor§: “It does not determine an upper
limit to the speed of flow which must be stable, because some other type of disturbance
might exist which would increase initially at a lower speed of the fluid. Neither does it
determine a lower limit to the speeds at which the flow must be unstable, because the
