These two criteria, denoted D/L and A/C, will afford a
measure of the applicability of hydrodynamics in the sense above indicated. After these preliminary investigations, we have to consider what kind of meeting
of two meteorites will amount to an “ encounter” within the meaning of the kinetic
theory. Is it possible, in fact, that two meteorites can considerably bend their paths
under the influence of gravitation when they pass near one another? This question
is answered in § 8, where a formula is found for the deflection of the path of each of a
pair of meteorites, when, moving with their mean relative velocity, they graze past
one another without striking. It appears from the formula that, unless they have the
dimensions of small planets, the mutual gravitational influence is practically insensible.
