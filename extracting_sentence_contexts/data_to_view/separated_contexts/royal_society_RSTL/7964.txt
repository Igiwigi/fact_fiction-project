If this be established, and the large cup- and star-corals
(Zoantharia rugosa) and the massive Millepores (Z. tabulata) be, as a whole, distinet
in structure from the star-corals and Madrepores of the Secondary and Tertiary rocks
and of existing coral-reefs, we gain a new fact in the history of animal life upon the
globe, which is in harmony with results obtained by the study of the Crustacea, Mol-
lusca, and Fish of the older epochs” (+ Siluria,” 4th edition, 1867, p. 217). Moreover,
in a note to page 220 of the same work, the restriction of the non-rugose corals to the
Mesozoic and Cainozoic periods is inferred. Although the Zoantharia tabulata are as numerous in the existing coral-faunas as
they were in the Paleozoic (and some of the genera are closely allied), the presumed
fact of the restriction of the Rugosa to the Palzozoic formations tempted many to come
to the erroneous conclusion respecting the break in the continuity of coral life at the
end of the Permian age. The characteristic nature of the Paleozoic coral-fauna was, moreover, strengthened in
the minds of some by the able manner in which MM. Mi1xe-Epwarns and Jules Hang
overthrew the old classification of the corals of 'the Muschelkalk and St.
