difference, D, between the two percentages hatched.

A convenient measure of the violence of such fluctuations is the root-mean-square
(R.M.S.) of the differences between each individual D and the mean of all the values of
D in the series, and this quantity is given in Table XII. for both sets of experiments
on cooling. The only other data for which it can be satisfactorily calculated are those

for turning of the eggs, and its values in this case are also given for comparison.
An increase in the number of eggs per hatch should, of course, reduce the R.M.S.,
and in both the cooling and the turning figures there is, in fact, a drop shown of about
the same amount in each, when we pass from the small to the large numbers of eggs.

The drop is, however, only from 10-3 to 8-3, or 24 per cent. in the case of the
cooling experiments, and from 6-7 to 5-2, or 29 per cent., for those on turning ; while,
as the corresponding changes in the numbers of eggs are respectively seven- and nine-fold,
much larger reductions in the R.M.S. might have been expected. That these did not
oceur may have been for the following reason.

So long as the R.M.S. only measures fluctuations which have their origin in the eggs
themselves its value must fall as the number of eggs per hatch increases, but if it
includes effects due to the imperfect elimination of fluctuations in the incubation
conditions it will be to that extent less affected by a given increase in the number of
