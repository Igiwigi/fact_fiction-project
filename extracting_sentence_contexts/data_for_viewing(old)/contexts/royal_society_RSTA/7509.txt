It follows that both dx/df and dy/df vanish at the limit line, and that at least one of them
changes sign (except where the limit line is itself cusped). It can be proved similarly that the
limit line is an envelope of the minus Mach lines. By (8), the velocity gradient is infinite and
perpendicular to the minus Mach lines.

On one side (we shall call this side IL) of the minus Mach line DAC the parameter h,
vanishes at A; for definiteness let h,>0 on DA, and h,<0 on AC. Since hy is discontinuous
across DAC, h,--0 on the other side (side I) at A, and, by lemma 1, we may take C and D
sufficiently close to A so that h,+0 between C and D on side I. Let us assume that h,>0 on

side I of the Mach line DAC; it will appear immediately that 4; must, in fact, in the case
shown in figure 7, have the same sign on side I as on side II of the segment DA. It
follows from (5), (10) and (8) that the curvatures of the plus Mach lines and streamlines,
respectively, and the component in the plus Mach direction of the velocity gradient are dis-
continuous across the Mach-line segment DA; they are finite on both sides, and none of them
changes sign. ‘Across’* the segment AC they are all discontinuous; they are finite on both
sides, and change sign. On the streamlines, dx/df and dy/df also change sign ‘across’ AC, by
(33), but @ is continuous; the streamlines show the same behaviour as at a limit line, except
that the curvature is finite. The same is true for the plus Mach lines. The Mach-line segment
AC is therefore an edge of regression of the transformation, but not a limit line in the strict
sense. The streamline (and, similarly, the plus Mach line) through 4 has finite curvature on
side I, and infinite curvature on the other side; it is not cusped.
