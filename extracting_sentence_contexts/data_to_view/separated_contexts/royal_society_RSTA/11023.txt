In a gas exposed to Réntgen rays a steady
supply of ions is supposed to be generated and the resulting concentration of ions is
then determined by the fact that the rate at which they combine is proportional to
the square of the number present, assuming equal numbers of positive and negative
ions to be distributed throughout the gas. In a flame containing salt vapour it may
be supposed that a steady supply of ionising salt is carried up between the electrodes,
so that the conditions would be, to this extent, analogous in the two cases. In applying the formula to our results we have had to recognise a feature dis-
tinguishing the behaviour of salt vapours from that of Réntgenised gases, namely, the
fact that the current strength continues to rise slowly even at high E.M.F.s. The
explanation of this difference does not seem to be difficult.* It would be accounted
for by the increased electrostatic field either bringing in ions from the neighbourhood
of the electrodes or increasing the rate of ionisation between them. We have now to consider our results in reference to the question of the state in
which the salts exist in the flame, and give rise to the conductivity.
