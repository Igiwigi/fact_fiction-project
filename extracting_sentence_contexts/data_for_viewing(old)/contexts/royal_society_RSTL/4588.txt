'The results of the above experiments are highly interesting, as they not only con-
firm those previously made, but they indicate a progressive increase of strength, not-
withstanding the reduced sectional area of the bars. These interesting facts are of
considerable value, as they show that a severe tensile strain is not injurious to the
bearing powers of wrought iron even when repeated to the extent of four times. In
practice it may not be prudent to test bars and chains to their utmost limit of resist-
ance; it is however satisfactory to know that in cages of emergency those limits may
be approached without incurring serious risk of injury to the ultimate strength of
the material,

It is further important to observe, that the elongations are not in proportion to the
forces of extension ; thus in the bar F, experiment 2, the elongation of a bar 54 inches
long with 3325 tons, is 10'5 inches, giving an elongation per unit of weight and

length=33322+;=-0058; whereas an additional weight of 2:25 tons produces an
