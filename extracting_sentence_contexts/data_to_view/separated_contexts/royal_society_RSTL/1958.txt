This 8light retentive property of the soft iron for magnetism, after a rupture,
I conceive not properly to belong to the iron itself, but to be caused by the

iron being mixed more or less with steel. The fact of iron retaining a trifling
portion of magnetism has long been known to those engaged in the science of
electro-magnetism, as also its capriciousness in developing magnetic energies. Among those who, I know, have particularly noticed these facts, I ought to
mention my friends, Dr. Dausexy, Mr. Marsn, and Mr. STURGEoN.

27. When I first undertook to perform the series of experiments, the results
of which haye been briefly detailed, I had in view a different object from that
I have since obtained ; for I thought the soft iron with its keeper resembled
in a manner a closed voltaic circuit.
