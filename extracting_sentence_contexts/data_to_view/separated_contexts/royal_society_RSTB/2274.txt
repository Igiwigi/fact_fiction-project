During the years that the animal lived after the first operation, the brain
would naturally fill up the vacant space rather than stimulate the expansion of the
skull, and the undeveloped anterior extremities of the visuo-sensory cortex would
gradually mature, the sight of the animal being apparently normal but. really
relatively defective. It may be added that these considerations are only brought
forward as a possible explanation of the facts and as an alternative to what I consider
the less probable one of Virzov.


OF THE VISUAL AREA OF THE HUMAN CEREBRAL CORTEX. 177

The immense quantity of literature which has, been published on the clinico-
pathological aspect of this subject renders it impossible to give even a brief résumé of
all the facts adduced, but fortunately a considerable amount is relatively useless,
owing to absence of precision, or only valuable as supporting statements previously
advanced. The earliest recorded case bearing on the subject was published by
Crarixov (10) in 1863.
