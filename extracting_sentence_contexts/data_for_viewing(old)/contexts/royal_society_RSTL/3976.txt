representations of these minute creatures.

4. M. DvuJanpin, like his great predecessor, included the RoTirera, by the name of
Systolides, among the InrUsoR14, in his work on the subject published in 1841. In
many particulars his observations, which were largely polemical, haye advanced our
knowledge of the subject ; but in some respects they are a retrogression. His per-
sonal acquaintance with species was greatly inferior to that of the Prussian zoologist,
and insufficient for satisfactory generalisation,

5. Since then, I am not aware that any naturalist has attempted, from personal
observation, a revision of the class, or eyen of any considerable number of species;
and the science has adyanced, chiefly, by isolated papers on individual species, and
by critical examinations of the facts already accumulated. These menoirs I shall
enumerate in chronological order.

6. In 1843, Dr. K6rrkER published a memoir * on Megalotrocha, confining him-
self to the 8egmentation of the egg, and the (s0-called) seminal threads, Dr. OsKan
ScuMIDT, in 1846, gave a r6sum6 of what was then known of the organization of the
Rorirera generally. In the same year, the late Dr. MaxTE:.L, in his © Thoughts on
Animalcules,” though chiefly founded on EurenBeRs, added some information of
interest and value on the development of the young in Stephanoceros and Melicerta.
In the © Annals of Natural History* for 1848, Dr. Dots descrihed with minuteness
two new species of Floscularia; and Mr. BrrcnuTweLL recorded his important disco-
very of the dicecious character of a RoTiFERON which I have since named Asplanchna.
The same species formed the subject of a valuable memoir by Mr. Daraymers }, read
