would account for the relations in the periods, but would give no reason for the whole
number factors in other relations. An electronic explanation, on the other hand, does
not suffer from this disadvantage, since the electrons in different atoms are in different
energy states.

It may be noted that, since this work was finished, a paper has appeared by Linpg,t
in which it is shown that with silver as solvent, the increase in electrical resistance
caused by 1 atomic % of cadmium, indium . . ., ete., in solid solution is proportional
to (v — 1)*, where » is the valency of the solute, thus giving further evidence for the
existence of simple valency relations in this type of alloy.

* We would emphasize here that the application of the older thermodynamical equations to metallic
equilibria is much more complicated than is assumed by many writers. Apart from the fact that the
electrons will form a degenerate system, the existence of contact potentials between different phases may
require the introduction of terms for electrical work done in the various cycles which are assumed.
