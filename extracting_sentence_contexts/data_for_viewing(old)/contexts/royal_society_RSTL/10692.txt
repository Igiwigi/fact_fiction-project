that the determinant and all its firs minors vanish ; but the work is too long to be
reproduced here.

Expressing the fact that two lines remain fixed during any displacement in kine-
matical language we learn that any displacement whatever of a rigid body may be
produced by two rotations, about two lines which are conjugate to each other with
reference to the absolute. Instead of rotations we might have said translations ; or,
expressing one of the rotations as a translation along the polar line of its axis, we
learn that any displacement of a rigid body may be effected by a rotation about a line

d a simultaneous translation along it. Instead of the line we might equally well
have used its polar. ;
