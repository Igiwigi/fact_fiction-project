more philosophical, and more directly expressive of the facts, to speak of a
decomposing body, in relation to the current passing through it, rather than
to the poles, as they are usually called, in contact with it ; and say that whilst
under decomposition, oxygen, chlorine, iodine, acids, &c., are rendered at the

negative extremity, and combustibles, metals, alkalies, bases, &e., at. the positive
extremity of the decomposing substance (467.). I do not believe that a 8wh-
stance can be transferred in the electric current beyond the point where it ceases
to find particles with which it can combine; and I may refer to the experiments
made in air (465.), and in water (495.), already quoted, for facts illustrating
these views in the first instance ; to which I will now add others.

525. In order to show the dependence of the decomposition and transfer of
elements upon the chemical affinity of the substances present, experiments
were made upon sulphuric acid in the following manner. Dilute sulphuric
acid was prepared: its specific gravity was 1021'2. A solution of sulphate of
soda was also prepared, of snch strength that a measure of it contained exactly
as much sulphuric acid as an equal measure of the diluted acid just referred to.
A s0lution of pure soda, and another of pure ammonia, were likewise prepared,
of such strengths that a measure of either should be exactly neutralized by a
measure of the prepared sulphuric acid,
