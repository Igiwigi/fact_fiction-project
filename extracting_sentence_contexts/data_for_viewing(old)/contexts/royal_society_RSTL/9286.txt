11. Azorella Selago, 7ook. f. Fl. Antarct. 284, t. 99.

Very abundant throughout the island. (Marion and Heard TIslands, Moseley ;
Crozets, Kidder; Fuegia ; Mac Quarrie Island.)

Kidder remarks that the flowers are greenish yellow, not pale pink as T found
them to he in winter. Als0, that the leaves have not the bristles on the faces of
the lobes as figured in the Flora Antarctica, T find them on specimens from all
localities.

Moxeley observes, in reference to this plant at Marion Tsland, that the mounds it
forms evidently retain and store up a considerable amount of sun's heat, and that
this fact probably explains its peculiar mode and form of growth, and that of many
otherwise widely different Antarctic plants, Te fonnd that a thermometer plunged
into the heart of a hummock rose to 50®, when the temperature of the air was 45®.

12. Galium antarcticum, Hook f. Ft. Antaret. 308 bis.

Common, but not found at Christmas Tſarbour. (Crozets, Kidder ; Fuegia and
Falkland Islands.)

Kidder remarks that the flowers are distinetly pedicelled, and as often 4- as 3-
merous, and eyen 5-merous ones occur. Raton's specimens confirm this.
