Bixxgy and Mr. CanrvTunss,
have endeayoured to infer the structure of Calamites from the appearances presented by
specimens from which all structure has disappeared. A comparison of their inferences
with what are now positively ascertained facts, demonstrates the danger of this mode of
procedure, and confirms an opinion I haye elsewhere expressed, that no determinations
respecting fossil plants can have much absolute value savye such as rest, upon internal
organization ; that is the basis upon which all scientific recent botany rests, and no mere
external appearances can outweigh the positive testimony of organization in fossil types. But whilst thus insisting upon the supreme value of structure as a guide, T am not blind
to the importance of a mass of evidence that has been deriyed from the study of external
forms, and especially that for which we are indebted to my two friends, Dr. Dawso0x, of
Montreal, and M.
