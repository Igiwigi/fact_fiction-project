Macxxen's notice, it is due to
him to state that he not only determined the loci (A) of the origins of ellipsoid-pedals of equal volume, but also
succeeded in giving to P a yery interesting and symmetrical form, by introducing the partial differential coeffi-
cients of the well-known double integral to which Jacozr, in 1833 (CrzLLe's Journal, yol, x.), reduced the
quadrature of the reciprocal of the primitive ellipsoid,

'The elliptic functions E and F thus become transformed into the complete ones
