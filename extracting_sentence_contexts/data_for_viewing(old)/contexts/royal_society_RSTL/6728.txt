The tendency to form this double salt is perhaps the reason why the oxidating
* influence of the nitric acid only affects the alcohol and does not extend to the lactic acid,

Ammoniacal Compounds of some Glyoxylates.
a. Glyoxylate of Lime and Ammonia.

Pure and well-crystallized glyoxylate of ammonia was dissolved in the least possible
quantity of hot water, and the solution thus obtained was divided into two equal parts.
One part, on being mixed with chloride of calcium, assumed the appearance of a transpa-
rent jelly, which resembled silicic acid when precipitated by hydrochloric acid from a con-
centrated solution of silicate of potash ; the vessel, in fact, could be inverted without any
portion of its contents being lost ; after the lapse of a few hours white opaque points
were obseryed in the jelly, which gradually increased in number and magnitude, until
at last, the whole of the jelly-like substance was converted into a fine crop of prismatic
crystals ; these were found to agree in form and other properties with glyoxylate of lime.

'To the other part of the solution of glyoxylate of ammonia a mixture of chloride of
calcium and acetate of ammonia was added. In this instance no immediate change
took place, but in the course of twenty-four hours a white precipitate, a compound of
glyoxylate of lime and ammonia, made its appearance; the precipitate was collected on
a filter, washed with cold water, and dried over sulphuric acid.
