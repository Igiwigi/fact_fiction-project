Critiques

Finally, let us comment on weaknesses of the above arguments. Regardless of the form in which
the ‘bootstrap’ argument is phrased, it inevitably relies on the fact that thermalized regions exhibit
some chaotic behaviour towards the distant LIOMs that are coupled to it. In the present §4, this
was apparent in the fact that matrix elements were computed by a random matrix ansatz. One
can certainly imagine scenarios in which the coupling of the first LIOMs would ‘kill’ the bath,
so that it would become unable to thermalize more LIOMs. Such scenarios go under the name
‘proximity effects’ (see [32,33], also explored in [34]).
