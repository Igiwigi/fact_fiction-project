In the specific context of climate modelling, there are also several avenues for future work.
The work presented here is an initial step in the analysis of the effects of state dependence
on ENSO. For simplicity, we have taken the state dependence of the delay to be linear. An
interesting question from the modelling perspective is whether state-dependent delays can be
derived explicitly from more complicated ENSO models of an intermediate complexity and, in
particular, what mathematical form would they have. This paper might provide motivation for
such a more quantitative analysis. One of the tools that can be used in this context is the Mori-
Zwanzig formalism [88-90], which is a formal model reduction technique. Another focus for
future work will be to study other physical mechanisms that may lead to state-dependent delays

in the ENSO system. For example, a contributing factor to the delay times of the DAO paradigm : =
is the position of the zone of ocean-atmosphere coupling in the central Pacific Ocean, which is : =
closely associated with the western Pacific warm-pool. In fact, a state-dependent DDE for the 1B
position of the western Pacific warm-pool has already been suggested in [91], but has not yet been :2
analysed in much detail. Finally, it will be of practical relevance to study the effect of atmospheric 8
noise on the ENSO behaviour in DDE models with state-dependent delay. : o
