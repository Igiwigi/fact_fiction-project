the step is considerably more proximal than in the two which precede it.

That these ribs are sacrals is quite certain. The sacral vertebre are definitely
determined by their position between the dorsals and caudals in a naturally articulated
column. The articular surfaces of the sacral ribs agree exactly with those on the sacral
vertebree and differ entirely from those of any of the dorsal and caudal vertebree. Thus,
in this specimen, and from the less complete evidence of D.M.S.W. 32 in Hogyrinus,
we have a sacral arrangement which differs from that in any other known Tetrapod in
that the ribs are elongated and double-headed, extremely resembling dorsal ribs. It is
certain that these remarkable sacral ribs did not articulate with the inner surface of the
ilium, but that that bone lay on their outer surface, its upper edge being, perhaps, received
in the step which exists in their upper borders, and the bones being attached to one
another by muscles. The relation of the pelvis to the sacral ribs must, in fact, have
been very similar to that of the scapula to the pectoral ribs.

Consideration of the structure of the Embolomer pelves, described later in this paper,
will render the possibility of this arrangement obvious.

The shoulder girdle of an Embolomerous Amphibian is represented in Newcastle by an
excellently preserved and well exposed, but isolated example, D.M.S.W. 34, part of
which was figured by Hancock and ArrHEy as Pteroplax. Their interpretation is,
however, quite incorrect and their figure very poor and incomplete. The specimen is â€”
contained in two slabs of shale which just touch at a spot in the middle of the right
scapula, their relative position being obvious from the direction of the striz on this
bone and the anterior edge of the right clavicle. In this specimen the interclavicle is
