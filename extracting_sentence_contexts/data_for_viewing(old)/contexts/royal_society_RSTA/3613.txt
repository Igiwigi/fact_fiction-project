or vice versa) allows the calculation of the sBR sensitivity (sBRS) as the average slope of the
linear regression computed in the (DAP,MSNA) plane over the sBR sequences and the percentage
of sBR sequences with respect to the overall amount of sequences [9]. Similarly to the cBR
characterization, the level of sBR solicitation might be estimated through the computation of the
percentage of sBR sequences with respect to the overall amount of positive and negative DAP
ramps and the strength of the causal relation from DAP to MSNA burst rate variability assessed
via a Granger—Wiener causality approach.

Respiration is a confounding factor for both HP-SAP and MSNA-DAP dynamical relations.
Indeed, HP variations at the respiratory rate, usually referred to as respiratory sinus
arrhythmia [10], might occur even in absence of synchronous modifications of SAP as a result
of the modulation of the motoneuron vagal responsiveness by respiratory centres [11]. As
a matter of fact, disambiguating direct influences of respiration on HP is mandatory for a
reliable assessment of cBR in both animals [12] and humans [13]. Similarly, MSNA burst rate
modulations at the respiratory rate might be present in absence of respiratory-related DAP
fluctuations. Indeed, the magnitude of the respiratory-related MSNA burst rate modulations
is usually considerable [14], while synchronous modifications of DAP are negligible [15]. In
addition, it was observed that a MSNA burst is more likely to be found during expiration
than during inspiration even in absence of respiratory-related modifications of DAP [16] and
this phenomenon is potentiated during deep, low frequency breathing regardless of the DAP
levels [17].


The aim of this study is to compute the strength of both cBR and sBR via a Granger—
Wiener causality approach during an incremental postural challenge and to correlate it with more
