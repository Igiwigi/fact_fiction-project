3° Nerve e9 {Plate No 1}

5 Diagrammatic representation of a small portion of the vertebral column. The nerve shown is the one
& piercing the pelvic girdle. ‘ Whole vertebre” are left plain, whilst “half vertebra” are shaded.
= Hence the supposition of excalation of vertebree in front of the girdle leads also to
the necessary corollary that a vast amount of both inter- and excalation must go on
Bat another spot.
2 But after all the crucial point is the serial number of the spinal nerves which supply
Sthe girdles, and this is, of course, absolutely independent of the number of vertebral
Scentra. This important truth helps us to understand or see our way through the
& following difficulties. Firstly, the fact that a nerve may partly pass through the
= girdle and partly not (fig. 3, and fig. 2, Nos. 4 (1.), 31 (r.), 36 (1), 37 (v.) ) does not show
& that rigidity of the girdle-piercing nerve, which is one of the points that the
"g acceptance of the excalation theory would lead one to maintain. Secondly, the
'B girdle nerve may vary on the two sides of the same individual (fig. 2, Nos. 5 and 6).
On the excalation theory we should expect to find half a vertebra somewhere or other
& striving to connect the two halves of the animal together. Such a case was not found.
Though the evidence against the excalation theory may not amount to very much,
yet it must be remembered that the evidence for it is also slender, and such being the
case it seems best to turn to a theory which offers an explanation of all the facts, and
to attribute these various phenomena to the migration of the limb. We must suppose
that the whole limb has secondarily wandered forward, and that simultaneously
with this process a formation of half vertebree from whole vertebre has occurred,
