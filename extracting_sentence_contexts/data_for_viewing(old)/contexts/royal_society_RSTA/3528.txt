(i) FO is a posterior distribution corresponding to the vacuous prior FE (5.1) with concentration DA
parameter s and observations x1:n; [Ww
(ii) FO is a consistent estimator that converges to Fy as n — ov. DN

Proof. (i) The limiting distributions of the vacuous prior FS are improper, with no probability : 8
mass outside the points x, and xp. Formally, use of these priors prevents learning [10], but we .
consider them as envelopes for a dense set of proper priors. The posterior distribution F;: is
itself the envelope of the posterior distributions corresponding to the family of proper priors with
weight s. The derivation is contained in the electronic supplementary material, section S4. (ii)
Consistency follows from the fact that limy— 4. Fe) = limnoo E, n = FY and limy—o0 Un+s = Idjo,1],
thus limy—oo Fp = Fy. a

Remark 5.3. In the limits | 0 the upper and lower distributions coalesce into the single random

This is the Bayesian Bootstrap method introduced by Rubin [7] as a Bayesian analogue of the
bootstrap method. It assigns a (random) probability mass only to observed values +j.;, So it has
no ability to extrapolate beyond the lowest and highest observed values, and the posterior is
always discrete.

Remark 5.4. Conceptually, the s-robust posterior distribution is closely related to the Robust
