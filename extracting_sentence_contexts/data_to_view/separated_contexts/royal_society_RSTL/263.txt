71 and 74 the nebulosity is likewise attached tothe stars, but
their nebulosity is more irregularly and extensively expanded,
$0 as to resemble the general mass of nebulous matter. What has been said of the gradual condensation, of the ne-
bulous matter in the case of extended nebulz, is supported by
a much greater number of nebulosities of a spherical form. The different gradations of their condensation are pointed out
in the same paper from page go1 to go8; and contain g22
cages in which the fact of the gradual condensation is rendered
S0 evident as not to admit of a doubt. Then, if instead of the
last 1g globular nebulz, page gog, each of which has a nu»

it will evidently point out the high probability, or rather-the
certainty, that nebulous stars only differ from. round _nebulze
