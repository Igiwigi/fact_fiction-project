they are found, thus supporting the conclusions reached with more scanty evidence
by Hooker and BINNEY.

The subject of the coal balls and their structure was discussed at the York
Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, 1906, when
Professor Werss (:06) contributed a paper dealing with the past work on the subject,
which was followed by one (Stores, :06) giving an account of the work which was
being done at the time. The facts then stated, and the conclusions drawn being
similar to, but less complete than those presented in this paper, no reference to the
York communication is needed here.

Scope of Present Paper.

In the course of the present paper we present the work done during the last three
years, largely in the field and in mines where the “coal balls” occur, but also in the
laboratory. The facts here described illustrate :—The internal structure of the
“coal balls,” and their relation to the coal in which they oceur, their size and
position in the seams, their chemical composition, and their relation to the “ roof
nodules” above them. Many of these facts give support to the view of the origin
in situ of the calcareous “coal balls.”* We also present facts in support of the
