"These large canals at the roots of the arms are continuous with those of the spirals, and
terminate in blind sacs, one at each side of the cesophagus, close to the mouth. On
making a transverse section of this part of the arm", the enlarged terminal portion of the
brachial canal is seen connected with the external edges of the dorsal and ventral
members of the loop; and the pallial lobule, stretching between the inner edges, forms
a sort of flattened inner tube. This inner tube opens widely into the perivisceral
chamber, is in fact a prolongation of this chamber, and terminates at the anterior
extremity of the lateral portion of the loop, forming what may be designated the bra-
chial pouches. Z At the proximal extremity of the arms the semi-cartilaginous grooved ridge is continued
Qacross the median line?. The cirri are inserted into an elevated base behind the groove,
a in front of the latter there is a stiffish membranous fold, which runs along with it
Sand the cirri to the distal extremity.
