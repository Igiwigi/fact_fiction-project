The classic model of Bonabeau eft al. [64] can be extended
in various ways by incorporating features observed in real
colonies. First, the assumption of the constant shift of F; per
interaction can be modified to reflect the empirical obser-
vations that the memory of losing is better retained than
that of winning [63,65-67]. Incorporating this fact might con-
tribute to better stability of the dominance hierarchy. Second,
F; and 6 can change intrinsically depending on an individ-
ual’s age. This modification could explain how an
individual’s age is often associated with her ranking in the
dominance hierarchy in eusocial Hymenoptera [20,31,34,35].
