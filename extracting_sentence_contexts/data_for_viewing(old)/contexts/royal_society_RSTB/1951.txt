of a plentiful supply of mucilage. The latter, however, becomes extremely abundant
when the period of maturity arrives.

On the other hand, the tissues of old receptacles are found to be destitute of

A mucilage (which has all been long ago squeezed out) ; and although examination of the
conceptacles may shew them to be full of ripe sexual cells, no extrusion takes place
under these circumstances.

Again, if receptacles which have begun to extrude are placed in sea-water, it can
be seen that the expelled products are pushed away from behind as the additional
ones are squeezed out from the interior of the conceptacles, and that the pressure
thus exerted is considerable is shewn by the fact that, in Halidrys esp√©cially, small
pieces of the eggs may be pinched off at the ostiole. The sterile conceptacular hairs

also doubtless share in the process of expulsion ; for if sections of Pelvetia be examined
in water, these hairs are seen to swell up, and even almost to resemble the oogonia
save in their poverty as regards protoplasmic contents. Anyway, it is probable
that these paraphyses may serve to guide the loosened sexual cells towards the
