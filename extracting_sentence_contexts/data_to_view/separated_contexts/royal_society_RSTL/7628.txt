Zool. Soc. iv. p. 196) as to the * inner or longest calcaneal
process‚Äù in Pezophaps being considerably less developed than in Didus. This process,
now regarded* as the head of the third (anchylosed) metatarsal, does not project poste-
riorly (it is true) 80 much as in Didus; but this fact appears to us to be in consequence
of the heads of the second and fourth (anchylosed) metatarsals being expanded laterally
rather than antero-posteriorly. In like manner, and for the same reason, we are unable
Sto confirm STRICKLAND's generalization as to the three trochlew at the lower extre-
Amity being placed more nearly in the same yertical Plane in Didus than in Pezophaps ; for
Sin this last the large series of examples shows that the angle formed by joining the
wTcentres of the three trochlew (of course the only mode of accurately testing the obser-
ation) is much more obtuse in the smaller (female?) specimens than in the larger
{male ?). In this case, if any stress is to be laid on STRICKLAND's inference (ut $vpre ct),
St would follow that the larger (male?) examples of Pezophaps did not run 80 quickly as
Drdinary examples of Didus, while the smaller (female ?) attained a greater speed.
