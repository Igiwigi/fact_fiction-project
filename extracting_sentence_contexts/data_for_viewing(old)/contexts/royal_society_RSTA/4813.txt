(e.g. the Menger Sponge) and, secondly, by considering restrictions on base-N rather than base-3
numbers, where N > 3. In this way, for large enough N it is possible to construct multidimensional
fractals which, while still measure zero in their embedding space, do not ‘appear’ at all gappy (or
lacunar [12]). These are relevant in the discussion below. It should also be noted that a Cantor set
is an example of what, mathematically, is referred to as a ‘perfect set’. That is to say, given any
point of the Cantor set and any neighbourhood of this point in the embedding space contains
another point of the Cantor set—i.e. the Cantor set has no isolated points. This is relevant in the
discussion about ‘superdeterminism’ below.

There is an important technique for reconstructing an attracting invariant set using data froma
(low-dimensional) dynamical system. It is based on the notion that the dynamics in the full-state
space can be reconstructed from measurements of just a single component of the state space [13]:
the Takens Embedding theorem. The method is based on time delays. This fact has important
conceptual implications discussed later.

We apply these concepts to fundamental physics through the Cosmological Invariant Set
Postulate [11]: states of physical reality lie precisely on a fractal attracting invariant set Ij
of measure zero in the state space of the universe U, considered as a dynamical system. A
crucial question to ask is: what fundamental physical process could account for the attraction
of neighbouring state-space trajectories onto I? Here we appeal to ideas put forward by Roger
Penrose (e.g. [14]) that the black-hole no-hair theorem (and consequent quantum black-hole
information loss) should imply the existence of regions of state-space trajectory convergence.
The idea is illustrated schematically in figure 2, which shows the trajectory of the universe
