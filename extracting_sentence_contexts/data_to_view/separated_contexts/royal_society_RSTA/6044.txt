For
example, in the evolution of RNA molecules that encode an enzymatic activity [3], functional
information is correlated to both activity and structural complexity. In the evolution of HIV
protease [4], functional information can be seen to decrease when anti-viral drugs are given
(reflecting the reduced activity of the protease), then to increase again as anti-viral resistance
emerges. In fact, functional information defined in this manner turns out to be just the coarse-
grained Shannon information content of the sequences [5]. A shortcoming of this measure is that only large groups of sequences can be characterized
in this manner, because accurately estimating the fraction F(E > 6) necessitates large ensembles
of functional sequences. Here we develop an approach that allows us to attach a score
to every individual sequence in an ensemble, which then allows us to predict the level of
functionality of individual sequences not in the ensemble.
