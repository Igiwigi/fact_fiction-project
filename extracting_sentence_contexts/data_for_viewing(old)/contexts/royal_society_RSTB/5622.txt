The carbon balance sheets for these six species are given in Table XII.

The general type of balance sheet in this group is so similar to that of the A. flavus-
oryz@ group (Group 11) that observations on both the groups will be given in the A.
flavus-oryze group. The A. ochraceus group is, however, distinguished biochemically
from the A. flavus-oryze group by the fact that none of the species in our possession
which are placed in the A. ochraceus group gives rise to kojic acid, and, as indicated in
Part VI, we regard the production of kojic acid as being diagnostic for members of the
A. flavus-oryze group.

Group 11.—The yellow-green Aspergilli, A. flavus-oryze.

The following species are included in this group :—
