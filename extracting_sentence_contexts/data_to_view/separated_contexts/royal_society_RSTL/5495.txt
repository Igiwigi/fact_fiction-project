Some are much distended with blood-corpuscles, and
others have their coats 80 attenuated as not to be distinctly visible. This condition of the
vessels is best, 8een in muscles 80 small as to allow of microscopic examination without
the necessity of mechanically separating their fibres, as in the muscles moving the eye-
ball, especially near the part where the muscular fibres are connected with the tendon. Although the presence of these abnormal particles of an ambiguous character in the
interior of the primary fasciculi, and that of minute molecules in the blood-vessels and
their capillaries, with the attenuation of their coats, may not fully answer the question
proposed as to the precise manner in which the first forms of Cysticerci find their way
into the muscular fibres, still I think these facts render it highly probable that such forms
of the entozoa as are represented in Plate X. fig. 11, existed at first as those minute
particles which I have described in the muscular fibres, and that these had found their
way to the muscular fibres through the medium of the blood. Without urging any opinion as to the source whence these entozoa are derived, I may
here state, that from certain data which I have collected, and which I will now briefly
mention, I believe it possible to institute a course of experiments which might throw
some light upon this question. Through the kindness of Mr. Fisnus, Inspector of Newgate Market, and some other
persons employed there as salesmen, I have been enabled to examine specimens of
measly pork taken from at least fifty different pigs.
