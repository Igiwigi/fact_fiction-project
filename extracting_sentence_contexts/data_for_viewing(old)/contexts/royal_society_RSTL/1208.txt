the Wight, at the same time filling up Portsmouth Harbour,
Southampton River, 8&c. &c. when the tide is falling every
where in the English channel.

This circumstance arises from the same cause which
occasions the tides to rise and fall in the Straits of Dover ;
with this difference, that it is high water by the ground, at
the last mentioned place when the food tide has run three hours
and a quarter from the westward ; but it is high water by the
ground at the former, when the ebb tide has run about the same
time from the eastward. It might therefore as well be asserted
that the tides meet at St. Helens, Portsmouth Harbour, or
Hurst Castle, as at Dungeness ; but the fact is, that the pha-
nomena which appear at these different places, are produced
by the same cause producing similar effects, with only the dif-
ference occasioned by local circumstances in the time and man-
ner; and this cause is the accumulation of the water brought
forward by the tide ; an accumulation which is occasioned by
there not being a sufficient space for its discharge, in conse-
quence of the contraction of the channel at the particular
places where these phznomena are exhibited.

There is in fact a meeting of the tides, on a small scale,
within the Wight; for the tide of ebb from Southampton River
meets the tide of flood from the Needles, at the sand called
