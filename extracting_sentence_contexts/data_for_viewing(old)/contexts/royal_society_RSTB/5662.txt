in Table IV, show the following characteristics :—

(i) Moderate amounts of titratable acidity and “ carbon in non-volatile acids.”

(ti) Negligible amounts of “carbon in volatile neutral compounds ” and hence low
respiration coefficients.

(iii) Considerable amounts of “ carbon unaccounted for.”

Ad. 42 thus gives a very similar carbon balance sheet to Ad. 23 and it has also been
shown to have very similar physiological properties, but Ad. 23 (P. citrinwm TxomM) is
distinguished from Ad. 42, and indeed from all other species examined, either of
Penicillium or of any other genus, by the fact that it and two other strains of
P. citrinum (Ad. 95 and Ad. 114) have been shown to produce a specific biochemical
product, to which the name citrinin has been given (see Parts XIV and XY).

Group V.

Division II.—Asymmetrica.
Section I, Velutina.

Subsection 3. Radiata (P. chrysogenum series).

Included in this group are six species (Ad. 11, Ad. 24, Ad. 56, Ad. 14, Ad. 35 and Ad. 53)
which are all closely related morphologically, biochemically and physiologically. The
