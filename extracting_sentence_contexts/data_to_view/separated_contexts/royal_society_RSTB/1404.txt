: sporangiophore is an axial structure, z.¢., a branch, does not seem to us
_ We have seen that the vascular tissue of each pair of sporangiophores is
from the bundle of a bract, and-has no direct relation to the vascular
the axis. Further, the bundle of the sporangiophore is to all appearance a
al one, a fact which would ill accord with a stem-structure.

h sporangiophore represents an independent leaf, is a forced, though not
an impossible view. We should, on this hypothesis, have to imagine a
n of alternating sterile and fertile whorls, the latter having twice as many
as the former; and we must further suppose every alternate internode
been shortened until each fertile verticil came to be adherent to the sterile
snext below. In the absence of any developmental data such speculations

giosperms.
