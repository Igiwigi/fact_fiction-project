The establishment of the fact of dextral dominance necessitates some modification
of these views. In particular the interpretation previously offered of dextral break-
throughs and with them of E broods falls to the ground. The simplest way of regarding
dextral break-throughs is as reverse mutations. Our previous view that F broods are
* suppressed” or converted sinistral broods still holds, but it seems probable that
they are only special cases of dextral break-throughs. The tendency to give E broods
is now definitely known to be inherited and strains showing this tendency in a high
degree can be extracted from sinistral stocks by selective line breeding. There is no
evidence that E broods are due to extra-nuclear (7.e., cytoplasmic) factors and broadly
speaking our results are compatible with the idea that they are caused by nuclear
factors or genes, though some non-factorial unknown is not excluded.

The majority of these discrepant facts can be brought under one heading by saying
that there is a general tendency for dextrals—some genotypic, some only phenotypic
—to appear where sinistrals are expected. The reverse does occasionally occur, but in
our material at any rate it is relatively very rare.

I. Cross- anp Se.r-FERTILISATION.

The greater part of our work has been done with single snails, isolated when quite
small and breeding by self-fertilisation : it is to be assumed that this procedure has
been followed unless pairing is specified.

Tt has been abundantly proved by others (see 1925, p. 123) and by our own expe-
rience that self-fertilisation occurs quite readily in L. peregra and some other herma-
