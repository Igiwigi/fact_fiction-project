It is to VarenTIN and Scawann that we are indebted for the observation, that
the muscle-cylinder is formed of nucleated cells. But the other facts now men-
tioned+; I believe are new; namely, the more or less blood-red colour of the original
cells (fig. 135.), the presence of discs in their interior, the derivation of these discs
from the nucleus, the existence of an orifice at a certain part of the nuclens, and a
continuation of these appearances in the muscle-cylinder, or * secondary#” cell. We
may hereafter see reason for thinking it not unimportant, that the contents of the
© primitive” cell, and those of the © secondary” cylinder, should have their origin in
the nucleus; as well as to connect this fact with the existence of the orifice in ques-
tion. The muscle-cylinder thus contains centres such as we havye seen elsewhereF
(pars. 130, 152, 178.).

163. The dises filling the muscle-cylinder, are the seat of elaborate changes ; as is
to be inferred, I think, from the very remarkable appearances they afterwards present.
