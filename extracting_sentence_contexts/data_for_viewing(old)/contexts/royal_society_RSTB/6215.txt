either of water or of some solid material. At 30°C a similar difference can be
observed, the fed flies resisting starvation for about twice as long as the unfed, at
lower humidities, Table III. A partial study has also been made of the difference
in chemical composition between the unfed and fed flies. The matter is extremely
complex owing to rapidity of feeding and excretion, and size of meals. It goes
without saying that a well-nourished fly is much heavier than a freshly-emerged
unfed individual ; its dry weight is also greater ; but during starvation, a fed fly
may survive after its weight is lower than that of one which has never been fed. We
cannot, therefore, use the weight of wild flies to separate unfed newly-emerged
individuals from the others. So far as present knowledge goes, the differences in
chemical composition between newly-emerged and well-nourished flies are not very
great. In both the mean proportion of dry matter is just over 30°, and in spite of
the fact that these insects frequently take their own weight of blood at a meal, the
proportion of dry matter to wet is adjusted in less than four hours after feeding (p. 204).
The weight of “ fat’? —ether-soluble material —is about 1 mg in newly-emerged
flies, and after they have fed several times, it rises to between 1-2 and 1-7 mg,
Table XV. A similar rise has been observed in Glossina submorsitans.

The greater part of the work was carried out with Glossina tachinoides, but many
of the experiments were repeated on submorsitans. As far as is known, the
physiological differences between the two are not very great. The thermal death
points are very similar, and both species can survive a rather higher temperature
in drier air than in moister (p. 180). In the starvation tests, comparable data only
exist for unfed individuals at 30°C. The following figures have been extracted
from Table III :—
