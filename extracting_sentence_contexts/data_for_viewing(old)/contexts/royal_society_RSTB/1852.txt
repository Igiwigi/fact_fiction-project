GENERAL ComMPARISON OF ResuLts ror Sort or Living Mararriaces,

In the above pages details have been given of the development and mature
structure of the sorus in each of the four living genera of the Marattiacese. Ferns
allied to these constituted a prominent feature in the early fossil Flora. It will be
our duty presently to compare these with our living genera as regards their fructi-
fications. But as the fossils are only known to us imperfectly, and in the mature
state, while we have the advantage of being able to study the living forms develop-
mentally, it would seem most satisfactory first to consider these more completely
known modern survivors.

On comparing the mature structure of the sorus as a whole, and that of the
constituent sporangia, and taking in also the facts of development, it will be apparent
that the four living genera follow one type, and that they form, notwithstanding
certain external differences, a very natural family. The genus which appears
externally to be most aberrant is Kawlfussiw; but a comparison of the sorus, and
especially its development, shows that in all essential features the sporangium and
sorus are of the same type as in the other genera ; the apparent peculiarity depends
on the outline of the leaf, which is not a dependable character.

The sorus in all the living genera shows the sporangia disposed in a peripheral
series, each sporangium being developed with reference to a radial plane, which at
maturity coincides with its more or less elongated fissure of dehiscence. As this
type of sorus is not found exciusively in the Marattiaces, and seems an important
one from a theoretical point of view, I propose to designate it by a definite term,
