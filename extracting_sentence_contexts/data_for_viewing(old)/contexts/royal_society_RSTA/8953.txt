examples where small changes (errors or displacements) in lines make all the allied
links take their practically exact values, and so give evidence for the reality of each.
Thus, —1°2 on al give ¢, vs; —1°5 on a2 give u, v, and the mean of »,, v;.(or the line
(—4,) F, or (d,) F, = F.,, say); —*5 (dA = °08) on ¢4* gives c, 1; —1°5 on ¢5 gives d,
v4, ¥ These new sets give us representatives of all the lines missing from the direct
normal lines. It is noticeable how the f, sequent persists.

Certain displaced sets are given in the tables. If 23418 is ‘5 less (dA = 08) the
¥», vs become exact and it is F,(3)(4A’,). The numerical proofs of these allocations are
not given, as these displacements have no importance at present beyond the fact that
they exist.

m= 4. Direct lines are found for F,, n = 1, 2, 4, 6, whilst 5 appears displaced
+5°01 = 2x 2°50, to observed lines 26265, 26275. There is also a line 26067 ahead of
26065 by 2°51. If this 2°50 be due to some displacement it is probably 2d, on the
limit and some ouns on the sequence, or all by ouns on the sequence. The order is so
high (m = 4) that it is not possible to decide, and it is shown in the tables as a
difference # = 2°50. Linked lines are shown in the map (Plate 5). Again note that
2°5 on F, makes the v, « links exact, and that here again the x appears. Symmetry
would seem to indicate that the true F,(4) or 26057 should be about @ less. This
would diminish the calculated limit of the series to a value nearer that given by the
calculated S ().
