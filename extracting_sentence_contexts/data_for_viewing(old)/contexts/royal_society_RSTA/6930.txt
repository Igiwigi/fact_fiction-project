the motion of the liquid in its neighbourhood from that envisaged in the theoretical analysis,
particularly if the diameter of the hole was comparable with the cup separation. In order
to investigate this, measurements of the normal stresses were made using 4:9 and 2%
solutions of grade B120 polyisobutylene in o-dichlorobenzene. Cup no. 2 was used and the
distance / between the bases of the inner and outer cups was 1-9 mm. All the holes except
3 and 7 had diameters of 1:7 mm, while holes 3 and 7 had diameters of 1 mm. The latter
were then enlarged to 26mm and the measurements repeated. It was found that no
appreciable change in the measured normal stresses occurred.

Again, we might anticipate that the presence of hole at one point of the base of the inner
cup would give rise to a wake which would, in turn, contribute to the surface traction at
another point of the base and hence introduce an error into the measurement of the normal
stress at that point. In order to test whether this did, in fact, occur, measurements were
made of the heights of rise in the manometers resulting from rotation of the outer cup with
various combinations of holes sealed to leave a smooth plane surface. Again, no changes
were observed in the measured normal stresses.

It was therefore considered that the presence of holes of finite size in the base of the inner
cup did not influence the normal stresses significantly.

The effect of tilting the apparatus as a whole was also examined, and it was found that
although appreciable changes of the normal stress distribution could occur for sufficiently
high degrees of tilt, careful levelling of the apparatus was adequate to reduce such errors to
negligible magnitude.
