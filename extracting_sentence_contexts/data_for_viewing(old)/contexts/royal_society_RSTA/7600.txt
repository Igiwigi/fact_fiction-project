of nitrogen makes possible a simultaneous solution for Cy, and Cy.9. On the other hand,
the three series can be taken together and their heat capacity equations solved simul-
taneously for Cy,, Cy,o and Cy,.

Mixtures $90 and $91 of Table X represent the first series and S 92 and 8 93 of the
same table the second. Of these S 93 is under suspicion owing to the occurrence of slight
“knock”. This in itselfis interesting, for here is a case in which the substitution of water

vapour for hydrogen in a hydrogen-nitrous oxide mixture scems to give rise to some
departure from the normal progressive combustion, despite the fact that the lower
initial pressure and explosion temperature of $93 (Table X) compared with S82
(Table IX) should have the reverse effect.

As to the results obtained from these series, the simultaneous solution of the heat
capacity equations for $79 (Table IX) and $90 and 92 (Table X) gives the following
values of the mean molecular heats over the temperature range 373-2759" C (abs.):
Cy, = 5-93, Cyo = 9-40 and Cy, = 6-32. The value of Cy, is considerably higher
than that obtained from the curve of fig. 13, namely 6-25, and as gradient corrections
have not been computed for the mixtures under consideration it is not possible to say
how much of the discrepancy is attributable to this. In the circumstances it seems to be
preferable to solve the equations in pairs and substitute 6-25 for Cy, where that is
necessary. Working on these lines $79 and $90 give Cy, = 5-93, a value which is
