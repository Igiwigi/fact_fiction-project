The apex is presumably
fertile in some fronds, represented by rudimentary structure in others, and completely
suppressed in yet others. 7. An examination of Telangium bifidum in the light of these new facts shows that
very probably the fructification rachis was attached to the frorid bearing the foliage
pinnules in the angle of the main fork of the rachis ; and that possibly in many Lower
Carboniferous fronds, in which the main rachis apparently dichotomises, the frond is in
reality pinnate in structure, this ‘ dichotomy ” being produced, as in Sphenopteris
Teiliana, by the abscission of the fertile apex, or by its abortion or suppression. My thanks are due to Mr. J. Wiirrip Jackson, of the Manchester Museum, and
Mr. W. Kuve, of the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge, for kindly facilitating the work of
examining the specimens in their charge, and to the Royal Society for a grant to meet the
expense of excavations which have yielded several of the specimens described in the
above account. BIBLIOGRAPHY.
