Haversian canals, with the canaliculi of contiguous lacunze advancing into them,
while the nuclei of the adherent cells are assuming the form of lacunz and throwing
out canaliculi.

Again, in the substance of the bone, the outline of the formative cells, similar in
size and $shape to the loose ones, may be in places recognized, having lacune and
canaliculi as their centres. The recognition of these ossified cells in their isolated
state will be followed by the observation of similar cells occupying the Haversian
canals and cancellar spaces in the majority of microscopic preparations of adult bone
(Plate VI. fig. 5 a) ; and the same may sometimes be seen on the outer surface of bone
(Plate VII. fig. 18). The appearance of the cells is, however, liable to be modified by
the various cireumstances which operate upon growing bone, such as the presence
of a tendon, or of a large pulsating vessel, or in fact, by pressure from any cause.
Thus if situated in the immediate neighbourbood of a tendon, they assume an elon-
gated form ; while on the other hand they may be flattened by pressure.

It has been thought desirable to describe the ossified lacunal cells at this place, on
account, of their frequent occurrence in adult bone (Plate VI. fig. 5 a, and Plate VII.
figs. 16 and 18).

Bone Tissve —Hitherto we have confined our description to the forms in which
the bone substance is arranged, as into laminz, Haversian systems, &. We have
now to consider the ultimate structure of the tissue itself. But little has been said
upon this point until within the last ten years. In the © Physiological Anatomy * of
Dr. Topy and Mr. Bowmax®, it is stated that bone is made up of an aggregation of
