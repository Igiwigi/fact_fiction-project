not eyen when a minute portion of integument was removed, or when one of
the wires was placed in contact with a fasciculus of the electrical nervyes.
Even after apparent death many of the parts decidedly muscular continued to
contract under this stimulus, especially the muscles of the flank and the cross
muscles of the inferior surface of the thorax and the heart ; indeed this latter
organ, two hours after it had been removed from the body, and had ceased to
contract spontaneously, renewed its contractions under the galyanic influence.
Other stimulants have been applied to the electrical organs, and with the same
negative result. Even when punctured and incised, (a portion of their skin
having been removed, which appears to be very sensitive,) no indications what-
ever were witnessed of their substance being either sensitive or contractile.

Reflecting on the facts and observations which I have just detailed, it appears
to me yery difficult to resist the conclusion, that the electrical organs of the
torpedo are not muscular, but columns formed of tendinous and nervous
fibres distended by a thin gelatinous fluid. Their situation too, surrounded
by and exposed to the pressure of powerful muscles, shows that if condensation
is required for the exercise of the electrical function, they may experience it
without possessing any muscular fibres in their own substance. The arrange-
ment of the muscles of the back and of the fins, and of the very powerful cross
muscles situated between the under surfaces of the electrical organs, is admi-
rably adapted to compress them. Without entering into any minute anato-
mical examination of these muscles and their uses, it is only necessary to com-
pare them in the torpedo and in any other species of Ray, to be convinced that
they are adequate to and designed for the effect mentioned.
