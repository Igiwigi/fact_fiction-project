The explanation of the variations found in experiments 9, 11, 12 we take to be that
the pilocarpin did not bring about the normal increase in the blood flow through the
gland. In the absence of direct observations on the blood flow in these cases, we
cannot, of course, positively assert that the explanation we give is the true one, but
there are certain facts somewhat in favour of it.

In Experiment 11, the rate of secretion of organic substance is rather faster in
