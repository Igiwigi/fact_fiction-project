The stomachs of this tribe of animals are therefore intro-
duced here, as bemg next in order witly respect to the com-
plexity of parts, and having by the division of them Ted me to
the present investigation, although it" is by no means their
proper place, with respect to their mode of digestion,

The animals, nearest allied to the ruminants in their mode
of digestion, are those which; like them, retain a portion of
food in the cardiac extremity of the stomach, that it may un-
dergo' a change, before it is submitted tothe action of the
Solvent liquor ; and when 80 hard as' to render it' neces-
ary, return it again into the mouth, to'be masticated a
Second time. The hare and rabbit are of this kind; the cardiac portion
of the stomach is never completely emptied, and: they occa-

sionally ruminate. In/proof of both these facts, a rabbit, which
had been-seven days without food, died; and the cardiac portion
of the stomach, was found, to-contain- more than half of its
usual quantity of contents :\ they were:rather softer than com-
mon, and a number,;amounting- to-50'cr 60 of distinctly for-
med pellets the-size of -shot, were‚Äù collected - together in the
cardiac extremity, immediately below the cesophagus: These
could not have been formed at the time of eating, since in
seven days, the action of the.stomach would have destroyed
their shape. They must-therefore- have acquired it by- the
animal chewing the- cud;

_. This second class of ruminants have no cuticular lining to
their stomachs, which may arise from their being more cautious
feeders than the others, s0 that they are not liable to receive
into the stomach any.thing which can imjure its internal mem-
brane.
