* Somewhat similar differences appear in the case of the homologous structure in Tornaria, viz., the
pericardium. Although Bourne (7, figs. 6-10) and Spencer (88, p. 418) have stated that this cavity
arises from epiblast, it seems more likely on comparative grounds that Bateson (3, p. 525) and MORGAN
(68, p. 411) are right in assigning to it a mesenchymatous origin. But Davrporr’s (14) experiments

and Cribrella agree in having yolky eggs and an abbreviated development. In all three the sac is
described as having only the briefest connection with the parent coelom. The right-sided origin of the
sac in the first and third will be due to “ hastening” on the part of the sac to assume its adult position
on the aboral side of the disc, and will be comparable with the fact that, at any rate, in the last two
of them the hydroporic opening is from the first to the right of the middle line.

Even in the case of larve with indirect development, the appearances which have been interpreted as
indicating very early juxtaposition or even direct connection between dorsal sac and pore canal or left
calom (p. 246 above ; FIELD, 23, fig. 27 ; Goro, 33, p. 255; METSCHNIKOFrY, 64, p. 63) are no doubt to be
explained in terms of similar developmental hastening.

MacBrinr (55, 56, 57) identified the dorsal sac with a right hydroccelic rudiment in Asterina and other
echinoderms, assigning a right coelomic origin to the sac. This view, which has been fruitful in
stimulating exact comparisons between the structures of right and left larval origin, was put forward on
comparative grounds and seemed to be established hy the circumstance that no dorsal sac could be
detected in his double-hydroceele larve of Asterina. However, I had the opportunity of showing
