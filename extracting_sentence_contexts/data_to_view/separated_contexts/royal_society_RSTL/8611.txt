Cells or corpuscles which subsequently appear and take part in the for-
mation of the tisses may then be ascribed to the retention of individuality and
protoplasmie properties by the cells proliferated from the inner capsular membrane. I
believe, however, that corpuscles which have undergone the changes above described
and indicated in the Plates (Plate 12. figs. 23 & 24) will be considered by most persons,
as by myself, to haye passed irretrievably from the living condition to that of a meta-
morphic product. Strangely enough, however, as though to prevent our feeling any
assurance that the suryival of such cells in an egg-mixture is rendered quite improbable
by the facts obseryed in Sepia and Zoligo, we find, both in the fully formed and the
immature ovarian eggs of Sepia, here and there scattered in the yelk, nucleated cells,
