gress of the fringes of streamers not having been then ascertained, those cireum-
stances under which alone it now appears that the magnetic needle is disturbed,
were for a time overlooked; and results apparently the most opposite were
announced by different observers of distinguished skill and reputation.


OF THE AURORA BOREALIS ON THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE. 105

A proper value will now be put on the results obtained by Captain Franxzon
and Lieutenant Hoop, chiefly at Fort Enterprise. They observed a remark-
able disturbance of the needle when the Aurora passed the zenith ; that is,
when the fringes came into the plane of the dip, which is there 86* 59\. But
the full admission of this fact does not invalidate the results of an apparently
opposite nature obtained by others, or their importance. The observations I
made on the 21st, 22nd, and 26th of September, 1st, 3rd, 11th, and 25th of
October, and the 17th, 18th, and 19th of November last, and now of the 20th
December, show, that with very brilliant Aurora, there is no disturbance of the
needle, if the fringes do not come into the plane of the dip.

It is evident, that as the needle is affected in those places only where the
fringes are in that plane, observers in different latitudes may obtain very dis-
cordant results on the same evening. The numerous observations collected by
Mr. Darrox, of the appearances of Aurora on the 29th March, 1826, (Phil.
Trans. 1828,) prove that many fringes of streamers may be parallel to each
other at remote distances ; and the observation, by the President of the Royal
