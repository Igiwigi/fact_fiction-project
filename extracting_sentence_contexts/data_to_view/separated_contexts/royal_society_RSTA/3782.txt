For example, a pseudoscalar
changes sign under a parity inversion, whereas a scalar does not; a pseudovector does not change sign under a parity
inversion, whereas a vector does [2]. B

Figure 3. The conservation of spin, a manifestly intrinsic angular momentum distinct from helicity, is associated with the fact
that the electric and magnetic field vectors can be rotated about any direction in space (provided this is done in a manner that
leaves them perpendicular to the direction of propagation and each other, of course). (Online version in colour.)

the integrand of H, we identify a helicity density
h=3(A+-B—C*-B), (2.3)

which has interesting properties, not least the fact that it is time-independent for monochromatic
light. The more familiar spin [50,57]
