following set I was desirous of knowing what difference would result from the fluid
being applied more sparingly, or but for a very short space of time. SPALLANZANI
had made experiments with a similar view, but his appeared to be open to some ob-
Jections, as he had not noted some important circumstances which greatly affect
the result, as the temperature of the medium, the length of time the fluid employed

had been obtained, &c, In the experiments now made, these circumstances were

attended to, and I noticed a curious fact which I first remarked in experiments in
1849. - It is what I may designate partial impregnation, and is indicated by a por-
tion only of the yelk becoming segmented. This frequently happens with ova that
bave been brought into contact with only very small quantities of seminal fluid, and
but for short spaces of time, as in some of the following experiments. These ova,
80 far as I have observed, never produce embryos. Segmentation is arrested in 8ome
at the very commencement (Plate XIV. fig. 11), in others it goes on to the second or
crucial fissure, and in a very few cases may proceed somewhat further (fig. 12), but is
never completed to granulation of the yelk. This, I think, is a fact which deserves
some consideration with reference to the formation of the embryo.
