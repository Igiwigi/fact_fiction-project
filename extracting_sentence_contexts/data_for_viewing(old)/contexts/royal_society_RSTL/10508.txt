Z It has to be determined from the fact that e is uniform along the boundary, 4.e.,
Syhen k=k1(1+a, cos nv+y, 8in 1v), &c., and that the whole circulation remains
-Amchanged.

2 If U denote the velocity along u, at a point of the boundary; V the velocity along

S as determined by y alone, and 0 the inclination of the boundary to u (and therefore

BD 8mall angle) ; then the circulation is
