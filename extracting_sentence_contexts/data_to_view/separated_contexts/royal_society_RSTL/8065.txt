Strontic Fluoride was the most stable of all ; it would not fuse, gave no coloration to
the flame, and obstinately retained its fluorine to the last, as was shown by the mass
giving the usual reaction of fluorine when treated on a glass plate with sulphuric acid. CONCLUSION... These facts justify us in coming to the conclusion that the similarity of the spectra
observed under the conditions in question is due to the fact that the spectram observed
18 that of the oxide; for whereas in the first instance there is a differentiation between
Sthe various spectra, after the action of the flame has been continued for some little time
© the spectra observed are the same.

= GENERAL DISCUSSION OF SPECTRA.

2 In what has been said before, both in this communication and in my former paper
Z on the spectra of chemical compounds, I have only referred to the lines of the metals.
2 IT now propoxe to discuss the spectra generally.

[= Some of the earliest observations of this nature (1860) have been described by
'Z Kincunoee and BuxseN®*. They remark, © We have compared the spectra represented
® on the Platef, which we have obtained from the pure chlorides, with those produced
> when the bromides, iodides, hydrated oxides, sulphates, and carbonates of the several
SE metals are brought into the following flames :—

z <« Into the flame of sulphur.

= By uy bisulphide of carbon.
£ 5E 8 aqueous alcohol.

2 Into the non-luminous flame of coal-gas.
