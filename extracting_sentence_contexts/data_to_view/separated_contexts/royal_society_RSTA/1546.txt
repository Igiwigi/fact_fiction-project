This equation is satisfied identically if, for suitable values of a variable e, whose
imaginary part does not exceed unity, and whose real part is less than 2q, we can select
coefficients @, in accordance with

E day Yan (e) = [ en se a dx (57) Jo sinh 2qu &
where each side is an odd function of ». The use of this apparently simple artifice
yields a definition of the coefficients which can in fact lead directly to a solution. The
value of the integral can be deduced from that of an integral due to Potsson, namely,
