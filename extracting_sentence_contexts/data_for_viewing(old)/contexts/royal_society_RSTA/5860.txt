In this section, we analyse some of the properties of the Boltzmann system (2.7). First, let us
consider the reproducing ratio in the presence of knowledge.

By integrating system (2.7) against x, and considering only the compartments of individuals
that may disseminate the fake news, we have

wo =| K(x, b)fs(x, t) dx — | 5(x)fe(x, t) dx,
ac x x (2.8)
and “ =| 5(x)(1 — n(x))fe(x, t) dx -| y (x)fi(x, t) dx.
x x

In the above derivation, we used the fact that the Boltzmann interaction terms describing
knowledge evolution among agents preserve the total number of individuals and therefore
vanish. Following the analysis in [36], and omitting the details for brevity, we obtain a
reproduction number generalizing the classical one

Sx K(x, bfs(x, #) dx

RolO = Tye Dd”

(2.9)


Finally, following the analysis in [30], it can be proved the uniqueness of the solution of (2.7)
