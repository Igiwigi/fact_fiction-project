This is the same
phenomenon that makes it possible for reckless drivers on a motorway to be safe, by relying on
the restraint and extra care exercised by the majority of more careful drivers. The outcome is a
promotion of a few cases of irresponsibility counterbalanced by many cases of extra cautiousness. This first challenge is due to the fact that the resilience of the network and its ability to improve
its performance is not based on all agents in the network sharing an equal degree of risk aversion. As long as the network improves its output, the mechanism of back propagation of faultless
responsibility makes it irrelevant whether some agents contribute more or less to the performance. This is in itself a problem of fair distribution of pressure: some agents will feel more in need to
improve the overall outcome than others.
