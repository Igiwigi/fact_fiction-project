not indicate the real difference in their absorptive power ; and as in all his experiments on liquids he employed
a yessel with flint-glass sides to hold them, his conclusions are vitiated by the same error which affected my
own earlier inquiries on the 8ubject.

absorptive effect upon the chemical rays, preserve their absorptive power with greater or
less intensity both in the liquid and the gaseous state (21).

Whether the compound be dissolved in water or be liquefied by heat, these conclur
sions are equally true as regards liquids. Water is perfectly permeable to the chemical
rays; and this circumstance, conjoined with the fact that in no instance does the process
of solution seem to interfere with the special action of the substance dissolved upon the
incident rays, renders it practicable to submit to trial a great number of bodies which
it would otherwise be impossible to subject to experiments of this nature, owing to the
extreme difficulty of obtaining them in crystals of sufficient size and limpidity,
