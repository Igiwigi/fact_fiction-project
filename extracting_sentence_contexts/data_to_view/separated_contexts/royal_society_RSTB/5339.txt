I have, therefore, no reason to doubt that the carotid artery and carotid foramen are
in every way identical with the similarly named structures in other vertebrates, and
that the alicochlear is the trabecula. In passing, | may mention that the courses
of the carotid and abducens in Lepus as described by Vorr (1909) are quite typical as
regards their morphological relations : the artery rises up passing median to the nerve. The fact that the carotid artery enters to the outside of the nerve, and yet runs in
beneath it to rise up on its inner side, and thus preserve the typical relations, is additional
proof that the carotid of Lepus is the true carotid, which has undergone a slight topo-
graphical displacement. That the trabecula (alicochlear commissure), or rather its
lateral portion, should come to form the floor of an extra-cranial space (cavum epipteri-
cum) is easy to understand. â€˜The cavum epiptericum itself is developed as an expanded
space accommodating the large trigeminal ganglion. In its expansion, this space has
extended laterally as far as the ala temporalis would allow, and since the skull-wall is
membranous in this region, it has bulged medially as well.
