480 MR. S. CHAPMAN ON THE KINETIC THEORY OF A GAS

As in the case of the coefficient of viscosity, we proceed to give the values of the
molecular radii (according to the two theories of elastic spherical molecules, with and
without attraction) calculated from the coefficient of diffusion. From the latter we
get c+’, the sum of the radii of molecules of each kind considered. By taking three
pairs of the same three gases, like O-H, N-H, H—N, we can derive the actual values
of ¢ in each case, which may then be compared with the values obtained from the
coeflicient of viscosity. I have thought it preferable, however, to compare the values
of «+e’ obtained from diffusion with the sums ¢+o’ of the values obtained from
