ambulacra I and V. ‘The oral plates which surround the “ buccal” tube-feet have
become slightly specialised, while the subsequent plates (up to the commencement
of the petals) are of the primitive “ Bothriocidaroid” type. In the petals the
plates also remain relatively simple, but the pores are double and well developed.
This is, of course, correlated with the functional importance of the respiratory
tube-feet.

The rapid production of plates in the modified anterior “ petal” forms a striking
contrast to the relative paucity of coronal plates. There can be no doubt that this is a
secondary complexity associated with the prehensile function of the tube-feet in this
region (MacBripr, ‘Cambridge Natural History,’ vol. 1, “ Echinodermata,” p. 552).
In many Spatangoids (e.g., Spatangus) the anterior “ petal’’ is “ morphologically and
functionally degenerate ” (HawxKuns, 1920, p. 417), owing to the fact that the tube-feet
in this region have lost their respiratory function. In a young Hchinocardium cordatum
(fig. 14) the anterior “ petal ” is relatively simple, and recalls that of Spatangus purpureus.
Later on the plating becomes complex, but there is no hint of combination into, e.g.,
triads. It is interesting to note that the plating is almost an exact copy of that found
in such Paleozoic Echinoids as Lovenechinus (see HAWKINS, 1920, Plate 63, figs. 10
and 11, Plate 69, fig. 5). Regarding this point Hawxrs (1920, p. 384) says that it
“seems to imply that reversionary tendency in racial old age (Zchinocardium being
one of the most recent of the Spatangoids) that has been aptly termed ‘ second-
childhood.’ ”

To quote again from the same author: “The character of ambulacral plating is
intimately connected with, and indeed determined by, the growth of the water-vascular
