It has been pointed out that there are features
which render it possible, or even probable, that the tip of the spine was in some way of a
glandular nature. If this were so, we should be dealing with an axis clothed with secretory
emergences. The facts given in the body of the paper do not amount to a demonstra-
tion of this presumption, but they all appear consistent with it, and it is difficult other-
wise to account for the occurrence of spines with open tubular tips, not due to accidental
fracture. Whatever the ultimate decision as to the physiological nature of these
structures may be, the objective features shown by the tips of the spines, such as
dilation at or just behind the actual tip, presence of dark resistant material within the
tip, opening of the tip, and the presence of a clear, empty, cuticular or epidermal tube
in this region, are highly peculiar and characteristic. They afford definite points for
comparison with other remains, where these are sufficiently known.
