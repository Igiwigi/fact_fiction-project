is being given to the eddy system, and is proportional to the density of the fluid and to
the square of the velocity ‚Äù (Grsson, loc. cit.). Among fishes it is noticeable that the scales are reduced in those forms that live in
swift currents ; ANNANDALE and I (1920, pp. 154, 155) directed attention to this in the
case of the fish of Seistan. In fact, all Cyprinoid fishes, the Schizothoracine and the
Cobitide, that inhabit the Highlands of Central Asia, are characterized by small scales
or by the total absence of them. There is no doubt that these fishes have been derived
from normal Cyprinoid fishes with large scales. Similarly in the Andes at great
altitudes the Loricariidee are represented by Arges (p. 239) in which the body is naked.
