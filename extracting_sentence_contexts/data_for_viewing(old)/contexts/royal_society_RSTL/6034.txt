rately. The proportions by mixing powders are very different to those required by rotation to produce the
ame hue ; and eyen when this has been tolerably arrived at, the quality of the pigments has much influence
on the appearance of the match.


MR. W. POLE ON COLOUR-BLINDNESS. 329

Now if I follow the Chevreul circle, starting from red, and going round, in the direction
ofa watch-hand, towards blue, in every division which I pass, the sensation of yellow
becomes fainter and fainter, and at the same time the darkening shade becomes more
and more powerful, until very s0on the yellow disappears altogether, and nothing but a
dark grey or perfectly colourless hue remains. 'This point is still within the limit of
what may be called red; and thus I arrive at the fact that there is a hue of red which,
to me, is, as a colour, absolutely invisible. It is a well-defined crimson, not much
differing from crimson-lake ; and its place on the circle is very near the division called
* red-yiolet,‚Äù probably the one marked 5 immediately beyond it; and it is perfectly
* matched to my eye by the division 17 on the gamme of neutral grey. I can also imitate
A it by mixing about 34 or 4 parts of carmine powder with 1 of ultramarine; or on the
Qeolour-top, 86 parts of carmine combined with 14 of ultramarine will about match a
Sgrey compound of 7 white and 93 black.
i This, to me, neutral hue of red is not contained in the spectrum, but lies among the
= hues which are wanting to connect the red and violet ends together, and make the image
Hre-entrant. The red end conveys to me a decided sensation of yellow, and the violet end
Sa decided sensation of blue.
.S 13, I can now easily fill up my description of that portion of the circular diagram
