incentive for cylinder cell division ; but these cells may form many congested layers,
and cornification, having once started, seems to gain speed in passing downwards.
Hence the accumulation of blood sometimes occurring at the top of the withdrawing
pulp can have little effect on the outermost cylinder cells.

The withdrawn pulp is absorbed by the dermis, and no trace of its previous
extension within the developing feather exists, except for a small papilla projecting
within the inferior umbilicus. Immediately before the moulting of a feather,
however, the quiescent pulp recommences growth and keeps pace with the
developing intermediate cells up to the mouth of the follicle.

The pulp has been considered (Litt and Jun, 1932) to be constantly growing
at its base, and constantly dying off and being resorbed at its apex. From the fact
that both in longitudinal and transverse sections the pulp may be seen to be actually
torn away, first from the barbs as they move upwards, and secondly from the feather
caps in process of formation, fig. 37, Plate 22, it would seem more probable that
the pulp actually withdraws and is resorbed at the base, as earlier authors (Davies,


THE EPIDERMAL STRUCTURES OF BIRDS 165

1889 and Srrone, 1902a) have observed. This is confirmed by the fact that growth
of the pulp is no longer necessary at this time, as when pulp withdrawal takes place,
the whole of the feather (except the calamus) has been formed, and only cornification
is to be completed.
