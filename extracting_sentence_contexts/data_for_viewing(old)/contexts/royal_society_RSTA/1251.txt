as the water condenses. Above the water cloud, ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can
combine to form an ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) cloud, substantially depleting whichever
gas phase species is less abundant. Observations of both Uranus and Neptune suggest that HS
is more abundant than NH3 [23-28]. The remaining H2S then forms an H2S ice cloud at the
several-bar level, and methane (CH4) then condenses as an ice cloud near the approximately
1-bar level. Various optically thin hazes from disequilibrium species and photochemical products
reside above the CH, cloud. Below the water cloud, other equilibrium cloud layers are predicted
to form [29,30], depleting the atmosphere in refractory elements above their condensation regions.
In fact, of all the equilibrium species predicted to be present in the atmospheres of Uranus and
Neptune, only Hz, He, CH4 and HS are directly detected spectroscopically, while everything else
that has been observed is believed to be produced from disequilibrium chemical processes.

The atmospheric constituents observed during the Voyager 2 era and earlier are discussed in
several reviews [15-19]. Since that time, H2S has been definitively detected in the troposphere of
Uranus and tentatively on Neptune [26,27], several new disequilibrium products and exogenic
species have been detected throughout the atmosphere [31-42], and refinements to previous
abundance measurements have been reported [28,43-83]. Some spatially resolved information
on species abundances has also become available in recent years [26-28,44,45,50,77,79,83-91].
Tables 1 and 2 summarize the observed abundance of tropospheric and stratospheric constituents
on the Ice Giants. Values in these tables have been chosen from a single reference observation per
planet; for additional observations and more in-depth discussions of uncertainties, see the full
