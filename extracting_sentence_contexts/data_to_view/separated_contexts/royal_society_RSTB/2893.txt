The non-ciliated interval between the latero-frontal and the lateral cilia appears
to be wanting in Solenomya (fig. 7 E, p. 192). The specimens examined in the
course of this investigation were not sufficiently well preserved to enable one to deny
its presence with any degree of confidence, although the cilia certainly seemed to be
continuous ; but it is a significant fact that in the figures given by Perseneer (71,
fig. 28), Kennoae (42, fig. 77), and Srempett (97, fig. 20) it is not shown. If this
be a correct conclusion, Solenomya stands alone as the sole example of a Lamelli-
branch with the frontal and lateral cilia continuous. Haren-Norman, it is true,
shows some small cilia occupying the interval between the lateral and the latero-
8 frontal cilia in Cardium ciliatum and Astarte sulcata (31, figs.
