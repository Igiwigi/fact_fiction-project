its probability distribution associated with the preparation P and &(k|A, M) the response function
associated with the outcome k for a given measurement M and value of the hidden variable 4.
In order to test ‘the same property’ in ‘different contexts’, we need to identify ‘the
same effect’ in ‘different measurements’. Given the above definition of contexts and that the
operations considered are simply preparations and measurements,! it seems that the only way
to operationally identify effects in different contexts is through statistical identification, namely
two effects are identical if the provide the same statistics with respect to all preparations.” This
is the notion of measurement contextuality proposed in [21] (see also [24]). We will say that the kth
effect of the measurement M is identified with the k’th effect of the measurement M’ if

p(kiP, M) =p(k|P,M’) VP. (3.2)

Intuitively, this condition reflects the fact that the same physical property of a system (e.g. the
x-component of the spin of a particle is ‘up’) can be measured with many seemingly different
experimental procedures, or experimental contexts according to Spekken’s terminology [21].

The condition of measurement non-contextuality for the hidden variable model is then defined
as follows:

&(k|A, M) =E(K'|A, M') VA if p(kI/P, M) = p(k |P, M') YP. (3.3)

Using the above statistical identification, we are able to identify, e.g. the effect |i)(i| in the KS
theorem, independently of which basis containing |i) we are measuring in. In particular, in the
1We are not considering, here, the possibility of applying transformations to the system.
