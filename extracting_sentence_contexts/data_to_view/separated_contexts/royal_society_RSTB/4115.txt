Here the presence of
numerous ensheathing bracts presents a point of difference, though the bracts in
W. scutica were morphologically similar to those here described.{ There seems to
be no trustworthy evidence that the flowers of Williamsonia were bisexual, and in
this we have an important point of difference. ; The male flowers of Williamsonia were very much larger and had a much greater
pollen output than the present flower, a fact which may, perhaps, be correlated with
the unisexual nature of that plant. We may, following Prof. NarHorst,§ arrange
the male sporophylls in a series with the pinnate sporophylls of W. spectabilis at one
end, followed by the large synangiate form of Cycadocephalus, the smaller synangiate
types of Weltrichia and Williamsonia whitbiensis; the sporophylls of the present

d * We may notice that the outer epidermis of the “ Palisadenring ” was somewhat strongly cuticularised,
which points to its being composed of fused sporophylls rather than of fused sporangia, but apparently
stomata were absent, as would be expected in a structure so reduced.
