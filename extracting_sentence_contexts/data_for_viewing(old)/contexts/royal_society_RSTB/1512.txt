rays. In both cases the changes initiated during the exposure continued and
increased after the light had ceased to act. The effect of the light consequently is
to set up changes of a physical or chemical character in the enzyme or its antecedent,
which, when once started, can be maintained without further light influence.

Biological Application of these Influences of Light.

Several considerations of importance in the metabolism of the plant may now be
discussed.

The influence of the beneficial rays has been shown to increase the amount of
diastase in an extract of malt or in freshly-secreted saliva, or in saliva that has been
preserved from decomposition by antiseptics, The fact that the infra-red rays have
a definite power in this direction recalls at once the fact that has been established in

animal physiology that moderate warmth converts many zymogens into enzymes.
This has especially been noted in connection with the secretion of the pancreas.
Though the existence of zymogens in the cells of plants has not been at all widely
established, yet it. has been proved more or less certainly in several cases. The
zymogen of human saliva bas not hitherto been satisfactorily extracted, either from
the secretion or from the salivary gland, but all analogy points to its existence.*
The following experiments appear to demonstrate the vecurrence of zymogen in the
