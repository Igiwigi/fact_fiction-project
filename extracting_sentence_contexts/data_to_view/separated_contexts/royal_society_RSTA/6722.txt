We observe that all row-sums of A”
are zero, except the last, which is equal to —A,,. The solution of (1-11) with the appropriate initial conditions .Y(0) = 7” can be written

down in the form ‘ etn) f \

We shall now show that /}/?(¢) >0 when ¢>0. In fact, let
gq = max (Ap, Ay FAs «+05 Ay Mp)

Then M = tq1 + tam

is a matrix all of whose elements are non-negative. From the definition as a power series
it is clear that the elements of exp M are likewise non-negative. Hence so also are the

elements of exp (tA) = exp (—tq1™) exp M,

since exp (—/q J) = exp (—tq) I.
