From this experiment it is obvious that iron at a red heat conducts
the magnetic influence better than when cold. Though this experiment bears
some resemblance to those of Mr. BarLow, yet, as far as I know, the fact has
not been previously obseryed; and it affords us another striking analogy
between the electric and magnetic influences.
