Its adequacy for the informal notion of proof as
used in mathematics, however, is far from being uncontroversial. Thus, the first group of papers
in this special issues addresses more general questions concerning the notion of mathematical
proof.

(i) Metaphor of proof

NIKOLAI VAVILOV questions, indeed, the adequacy of formal proof to represent mathematical
proof in his contribution Reshaping the metaphor of proof [46]. He goes even a step further and
puts up to discussion the thesis that ‘a mathematical proof considered as a text proves nothing
except the fact of existence of proofs.’

(ii) Explanation

Alison Pease, Andrew Aberdein & Ursula Martin, in their paper Explanation in mathematical
conversations: an empirical investigation [47], confront simplicity with the objectives of a ‘good
proof’. With empirical data, they discuss six conjectures about mathematical explanation. As a
result, their empirical methodology is suggested as a new and fruitful tool to investigate informal
notions such as the simplicity of proof.

(iii) Spatial thinking

Alan Cain, in Visual thinking and simplicity of proof [48], draws the attention to ‘how spatial
thinking interacts with simplicity in [informal] proof’ by analysing some concrete examples of


spatial proofs in mathematics in comparsion with non-spatial ones.
