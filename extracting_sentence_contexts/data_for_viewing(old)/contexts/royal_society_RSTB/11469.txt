these emotions can function as concepts: they can be predi-
cated of things. The anger elicited by a polluter is a kind of
construal that presents the polluter in a certain way, e.g. as
someone to be confronted. Here, cause (polluter) and effect
(anger) get bound into a cohesive psychological state (anger
towards the polluter) that has meaning (polluter is bad).

This analysis reveals an interesting feature of moral con-
cepts already noted by Hume [21]. Unlike some concepts
that merely represent how the world is, moral concepts tell
us how the world should be, and, as such they have behav-
ioural pull. We can observe that an object is green and be
indifferent to that fact, but if we observe that an object is
litter, we are not indifferent. That observation motivates us
to change it. The felt badness of something tells us both
how it is (bad) and that something must be done to rectify
it. This is an advantage of the embodied approach to
grounded cognition. An amodal theory, or even a grounded
theory that ignores emotions, does not predict that moral con-
ceptualization is intrinsically motivating. This suggests that
moral concepts not only can be grounded in emotions but
also must be.

Theories of this kind face some objections, which we
cannot fully review here [41], but we will mention two.
