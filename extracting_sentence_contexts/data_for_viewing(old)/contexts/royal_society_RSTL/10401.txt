The throws throughout are very nearly equal; the time of swing, it is true, has
increased by 009”, but this change cannot be due to an alteration in the magnetic
moment of the needle, for if the current passed in the one direction had decreased the
magnetic moment and 80 increased the time of swing, that passed in the other direction
in the second series would have increased the magnetic moment and 80 decreased the
time of swing. The alteration in T then we must rather ascribe to a variation in the
value of the horizontal intensity. This has been allowed for in the experiments by
the repeated observations which were made of T. As regards the temporary effect of
the induced magnetisgm produced by the current while it lasts, we notice that its
direction would at each instant be perpendicular to the plane of the coils, 80 that
the force between the magnet thus formed by the current and the current forming it
would be along the axis of the temporary magnet and have no tendency to cause it
to move, In fact, the field of force produced by the coils being uniform, the actual
force on the induced magnetism will be zero,

A mumber of observations were also made to see if the time taken by the battery
current to become steady after a reversal was appreciable. The galvanometer circuit
being open the battery circuit was reversed, and then the galvanometer circuit closed
at an interval of from 25” to *3” after:

If after this interval the battery current had still been varying an induction current
would have shown itself in the galvanometer, but though the reversals were made
in three separate experiments, 13, 7, and 10 times respectively, in time with the
period of the galvanometer, no effect was produced.
