for steady flow with f in the case of intermittent flow. If it is ascertained that the
eddy-motion has entirely disappeared over the regions where the temperatures are
measured, f and f are steadily converted into heat given up to the gas and are then
included in the terms of (57) depending on @ and 6’; the same remark applies to the
parts of Ff and f representing thermal energy given up to the diaphone piston.
The practical realization of this condition would be to place the resonator-thermometer
sufficiently far from the piston that the escaping air is free from eddies. The -
objection to this procedure lies in the fact that losses of heat into the material of the
trumpet are liable to be involved, and also that owing to possible propagation losses
the acoustic output is no longer measured at the source of the sound-waves, but
becomes a function of the dimensions, shape, &c., of the resonator. It is evident that
unless f” can be identified with A the value of w# calculated from (57) will be an over-
estimate (the case f <fis hardly probable).

The temperature differences calculated from the readings of the resistance ther-
mometers, denoted by 6, and 6’,, differ from the true temperature differences @ and 6’
by amounts 36 and 46’ respectively, arising from the effect of kinetic heating already
mentioned. Although this effect is diminished owing to the fact that differential
readings of temperature are taken, the resonator thermometer registered an excess
of temperature over the valve thermometer owing to the fact that the former was
