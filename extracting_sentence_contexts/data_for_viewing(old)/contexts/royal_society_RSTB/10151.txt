Although current evidence supports the tempo of the emer-
gence of the Acheulean being at least 1.75 Ma, the mode of
this transition is less clear. If the early age of KNM-ER 1813
is accepted, it could then be assumed that H. erectus emerged
slightly before the Acheulean, hence providing a biological
precursor framework for this technocomplex. However, the
archaeological record is in itself almost impenetrable as far as
technological precursors of this transition are concerned: in
Koobi Fora, the KBS assemblages are plainly Oldowan, and
although the Karari Industry has on occasion been proposed
as a potentially transitional technology, its age which is
younger than the earliest Acheulean assemblages in Konso
and West Turkana, along with the fact that no early LCTs are
found across the Koobi Fora deposits, somehow make the pro-
posal less likely. Core-and-flake 1.75 Myr sites from Konso are
reported as Oldowan [59], and in Gona it is explicitly stated
that no transitional features linked to the Acheulean are
observed in the earlier Oldowan assemblages [96].

In Olduvai Gorge, Mary Leakey [42] observed an evo-
lution of the classic Oldowan into the Developed Oldowan
A (DOA), yet she ruled out the possibility that this DOA
was a precursor of the Acheulean, and instead proposed
that the latter technology arrived in Olduvai from somewhere
else. Furthermore, DOA sites are positioned after 1.66 Myr
