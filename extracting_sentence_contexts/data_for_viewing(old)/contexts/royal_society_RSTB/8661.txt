IX, clinical experience, translation validated targets, response to these therapies is fleeting and commonly results

in the emergence of highly resistant cancers [1]. Hence, alternative therapeutic
targets are needed, including ion transport mechanisms. One explanation for
the lack of attention paid to ion transport is that cancer is canonically viewed

that there are few mutations in ion transporters, and thus ion transport can
be viewed as too fundamental a process to be a therapeutic target. Indeed,
