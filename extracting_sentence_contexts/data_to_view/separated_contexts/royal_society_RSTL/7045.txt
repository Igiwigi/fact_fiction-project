It was found that
a unit in the fourth decimal place of the specific gravity of sea-water, measured by the hydrometer, is equal to
Lo5ooy of chlorine, the minimum being 66, the maximum 76. To find what quantity of salt corresponds to
the specific gravity of the surface-water, as determined by Sir Jaxes Ross to be 10274, we must multiply 27
by 71, which gives 19-454 chlorine in the sea-water, and that number being multiplied by the general coeffi-
cient 1-812, gives 35-251 per 1000 &alt for the water from the surface. According to the same computation the
sea-water from 150 fathoms contained 34-993 per 1000 salt, and that from 450 fathoms 34-478 per 1000 alt.

59 N. lat. and 5? 8. lat. with those between 5* and 20? to the North and of 5* to 30® to
the South, we find the interesting fact that the water flowing in the vicinity of the
Equator contains less salt than that which flows both to the north and to the south of
it. For the equatorial region (5* S. to 5* N.) the mean. of six obseryations is 35-575,
per 1000; or if we leave out a sample from Sir Janes Ross, from 150 fathoms' depth
(that from the swrface is wanting), it is 35:520. From 5* to 20® N. the mean of eight
analyses is 36-279, and from 5? to 30* S. the mean of six analyses is 36-631 per 1000.
