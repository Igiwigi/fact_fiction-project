typically metaluminous (0.9 < A/CNK < 1.05). It is notable that occasionally some ACP granites
qualify as S-type granites with muscovite and/or cordierite and/or garnet, and A/CNK of up to
1.3. Assuming these originated, similar to modern S-types [72] by melting of sediments, such
Archaean S-types represent the extreme endmember scenario of a crustal reworking process.
Unravelling the melting conditions of the source of ACP granites is not straightforward. Archaean
granitoids define a continuous range of composition from TTG over transitional TTG to ACP
granites (elsewhere referred to as high-K or biotite-granites [37]). The continuous nature of the
range of compositions suggests either that all possible sources, from more mafic to more felsic,
were tapped to form these granitoids, or that the sources were mixtures, in all proportions, of
mafic and felsic (or older TTG) components. The latter is our preferred scenario based on trace
element systematics: if their source included (or was even dominated by) a TTG component,
reworked ACP granites inherited the high-pressure signature of their precursor TTG. The mild
Eu (and Sr) anomalies are consistent with melting in the presence of plagioclase, and the fact that
REE patterns are not much more fractionated than those of TTG suggests that garnet was not an
abundant or dominating residual mineral.

Granitoids with a mantle component, or sanukitoids, cover a very diverse group with no
clear chemical definition [37] and may have formed by a range of petrogenetic processes that
