On some occasions,
Shen one of the films has been entirely black, the lower liquid ring has disappeared. Fhis phenomenon is accompanied by a slight ehift in the position of equilibrium,
in, if the starb is too short the films are too similar to make the comparison of
Such use ; if it is too long the thin film is apt to break before the thick one is ready
&r observation. These difficulties are increased by the fact that it is nob safe to
Eave the films in communication while one of them is being thickened. A black film
almosb certain to break if subject to a disturbance which may alter its diameter by
Me or two millimetres. Tt is, therefore, necessary to separate the films while the
Biickening takes place, and nob to pub them again into communication until after the
fiteryal which experience has proved to be snflicient to prevent any greab change in
Siameter, We have attempted as far as possible to overcome these difficulties, and
have carried out our observations in two different ways.
