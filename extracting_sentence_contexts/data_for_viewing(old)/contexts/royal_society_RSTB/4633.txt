anatomical features, and it will simplify matters if we glance briefly at the points
that have come to light in comparing Sphenodon with other forms. In other


SYSTEM OF THE: TUATARA, SPHENODON PUNCTATUS. 241

Reptilia the three main arterial trunks come off separately from the ventricle, while
in the Tuatara they come off from a short common trunk, probably representing the
conus arteriosus of the Amphibia which has been lost in other Reptilia.

Sphenodon possesses both a ductus caroticus and a ductus arteriosus (BoraLit) on
each side, and they are in a moderately developed condition. That this is a primitive
condition is shown by the fact that it occurs in the Amphibia Urodela, and is not
found, so far as is known, in any other reptile. The carotids, in origin and general
distribution, and also in the absence of a common trunk, ¢.e., a carotis primaria,
resemble those of the Urodele Amphibia, and also some of the primitive Lacertilia.
The same is also true of the arteria laryngeo-trachealis, which comes off from the

ag pulmonary artery in Amphibia and in certain Lizards. This vessel appears to be
homologous with the arteria cesophagea of the Urodeles, and so is a relic of the
S time when respiration took place in the mucous membrane of the buccal cavity and
a pharynx. VAN BemMeLEN (10, p. 102) gives his opinion of the neck region as
