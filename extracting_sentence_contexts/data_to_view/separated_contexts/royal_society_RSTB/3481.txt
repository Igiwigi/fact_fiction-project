The reticulum itself represents the remains of the bodies of those cells of the
archenteric floor which are in process of disintegration. This interpretation has been
confirmed by examination under the oil-immersion lens, by whose aid the contours of
the degenerated cells could in some cases be observed. The nuclei in the reticulum
occupying the gap on the left, in the section, are simply the nuclei of such degenerate
cells of the archenteric floor ; whilst, ventral to these again, and to the gap which
they occupy, are the nucleated bodies of several yolk-laden cells of the entoderm
which originally clothed the ventral surface of the intact archenteron

It appears quite certain, from the facts and observations above set forth, that the
disappearance of the ventral wall of the archenteron in the blastoderm of Ornitho-
rhynchus takes place primarily through an intracellular degenerative process, and is
not to be represented as one of mere mechanical disruption. The interpretation
given above fully explains the retention of entodermal cells here and there over the
otherwise bared surface of the archenteric plate. That retention is due to adhesion
through a reticulum of more or less degenerate cell-material.
