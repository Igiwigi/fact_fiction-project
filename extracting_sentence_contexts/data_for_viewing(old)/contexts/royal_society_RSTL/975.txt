pretending to rigour, and at the same time are presented with
another very striking instance of the inherent distinction be-
tween the differently coloured molecules of light, which, since
the time of NEwrTon, every new step in optical science has
tended to place in a stronger point of view. At the same time,
by the easy and complete explanation this principle affords
of all the more perplexing anomalies/in the tints, the theory
of alternate polarisation to which they were hitherto s0 pal-
pable and formidable an objection, stands relieved from every
difficulty, and may now be received as fully adequate to the
representation of all the phenomena of the polarised rings,
and entitled' to rank with the fits of  easy transmission and
reflection, as a general and simple physical law, In fact, if we
investigate by this theory a general analytical expression of
the tint developed for any position/and thickness of the plate,
taking this element into consideration, it will be found to. in-
clude all the phenomena, as far as they can be computed,


crystallized bodies on homogeneous light. 51

while the /aw ofdispersion remains unknown. But we may go
yet farther. The nature of the formula furnishes an equation
by which the actual quantity of the separation of the extreme
red and violet axes may be deduced from observations -of
