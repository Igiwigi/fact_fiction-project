The ciliary processes, from their connection with the lens,
were by some believed capable of bringing it forwards; by
others they were supposed to contract, and by that action elon-
gate the eye, and remove the lens further from the retina : but
these processes could never bring the lens forwards, unless the
cornea was also moved forwards ; for the lens and processes
forming a complete septum, the aqueous humour would pre-
vent the lens from making any advance in that direction :

and the processes themselves are neither strong enough in

their muscular power, nor sufficiently attached to the coats of
the eye, to alter its form by their contraction. In birds like-
wise, the bony rim renders this impossible. That the axis of vision is really lengthened, and the lens
moved forwards, for the purpose of adjusting the eye to see
near objects, is rendered highly probable, since all the facts I
have been able to collect seem to point out these changes :
nor can the action of the external muscles increase the curva-
ture of the cornea without producing them. If the axis of vision being lengthened was believed by some
physiologists to produce the whole adjustment of the eye to
see near objects ; if the crystalline lens being moved forwards
was supposed by others to do the same thing ; and if the cor-
nea being rendered more convex appeared at the first view
equally to account for it ; all the three, when combined for that
purpose, must undoubtedly be considered as sufficient to pro-
duce the effect. EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE. (Tab.
