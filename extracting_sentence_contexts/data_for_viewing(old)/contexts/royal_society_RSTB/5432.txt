larvee of the nematode parasite. Normal females go to oat panicles and there lay eggs ;
similarly, the parasitised flies responding to the same urge of the life-cycle rhythm
also fly to the oat panicles, but, instead of eggs, deposit larvee of the nematode parasite.
These find their way, possibly in response to some chemotactic stimulus, into the plant
tissues surrounding the fly larve. Here they undergo two more moults and become
young adult males and females. The latter, after receiving spermatozoa from the
males, enter frit-fly larvee and in this way the cycle of growth within the host is
carried on.

So far the events described above have been determined for the stem and panicle
generations of flies, but it is evident that an exactly similar cycle must be passed through
in the case of the overwintering generation on grass. That this is so is proved by the
fact that the first worms found by the writer in oat stems were ensheathed larvee under-
going their last two moults, and these must have come from parasitised flies of the over-
wintering generation.

The accompanying diagram (text-fig. 1) has been drawn to illustrate the life-history
of the fly and the parasite.

SrructuRE AND DEVELOPMENT.
(a) Technique.
Oat stems attacked by frit-fly were opened with stout needles in tap-water and the
free-living stages of T'ylenchinema were picked up by means of a capillary pipette under
