and when the Baltic rises very high, its waters flow for s0me miles into the lake. In
that part of the town called the Rid-
darholmen, immediately above where
the waters of the lake meet the sea,
(se Map, fig. 6.,) s0me of the buildings
have of late years become insecure,
because the level of Lake Maeler has
fallen, so that the piles on which the
buildings rest are not constantly under
water as of old. The tops of these
piles being now every year alternately
wet and dry, they are continually rot-
ting away. This fact is unquestionable ; and I saw the houses, which, in consequence
of this failure of support, are much rent, and out of the perpendicular.

But during the time that this change has occurred, no corresponding fall has been
observed in the neighbouring quay, or Skeppsbron, which is filled with brackish
water, and which ought to have been equally affected on the supposition of a generat
rise of the land ; and we naturally, therefore, inquire whether some particular circum-
stances haye not of late years given a freer outlet to the waters of Lake Maeler, 80
as to cause them to 8ink. Now several Swedish engineers remarked to me, that the
decay of the piles had taken place since the removal of the two old bridges in Stock-
holm, which being supported on a great number of wooden piles, o√æstructed the free
discharge of the lake, the waters of which now pour in a rapid and unbroken current,
through the large arches of the new bridge; and secondly, they observed that the
