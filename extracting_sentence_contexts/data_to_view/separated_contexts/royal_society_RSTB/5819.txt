The position of I;, therefore, in these four experiments is in
agreement with the theory of the first available space. Similar instances of a leaf
arising in the smaller angle between two older leaves on account of their asymmetric
development were given previously (1931, p. 9). In Nos. 21 and 25, mentioned above,
1k was similarly asymmetric, its stipule on the side of the wound being the larger, but
the asymmetry was not great enough to compensate for the fact that the larger angle
between the centres of I,k and I, was found on this side of the apex, as can be seen from
fig. 13, No. 21. Part 4.â€”EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH BOTH I,A AND I,K AROSE.

(15) General. Tn six experiments two complete leaves arose soon after the operation, one on each
side of the wound.
