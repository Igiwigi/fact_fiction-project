The process of intrusion of elements
from the follicle ceases at the time when the one layered follicle becomes many layered
and commences to secrete the zona striata, but the peripheral arrangement of the intruded
elements persists for some time after and can be seen in oocytes of even 800u in diameter. In oocytes above this size they, too, have disappeared, either fragmenting and producing
the finely granular material, impregnated with silver or osmium, scattered throughout
the cytoplasm, as did the G.T.1, or undergoing a more complete dissolution, resulting
in their dispersion and loss of affinity for the metal. The fact that in some oocytes,
after the zona striata has commenced to form, the peripheral elements can be seen to be
shrunken, only slightly impregnated, and more or less flattened against the membrane,
supports the latter conclusion. On the other hand, in the larger oocytes of, for instance,

24 mm. in diameter, in which enough yolk has not yet been formed to make impregnation
difficult, the amount of these granules in the cytoplasm is many times that in the oocytes
just after the fragmentation of the G.T.1.
