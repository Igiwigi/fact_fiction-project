In a paper formerly communicated to this Society | by Sir
EverarD Howe, and since published in the Philosophical
Transactions for the year 180g, some facts were stated which
render it probable that the various animal secretions are depen- _
dent on the influence of the nervous system, and this opinion
seemed to derive support from some physiological experi-
ments which were afterwards instituted by myself, and in
which it was observed, that after the functions of the brain had
been destroyed, although the action of the heart continued,
and the circulation of the blood was maintained as under or-
dinary circumstances, the secreting organs invariably ceased
to perform their office.

It has been attempted by former physiologists to determine
how far the nerves are necessary to secretion, but there are
