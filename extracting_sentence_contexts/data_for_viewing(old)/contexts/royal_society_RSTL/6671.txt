= The most concentrated form of this acid that was dealt with, acid of sp. gr.
=y 1553, contained already upwards of 8 equivalents of water. Its transpiration-
Zime was 1:7356, referred to the time of water as 1. With further dilution the time
Fiminished, till at the proportion of 12 equivalents of water the time had fallen to
25287. About this point the rate of diminution is reduced, and the transpiration-time
ven becomes stationary for a short portion of the range of hydration. The retardation
served appears to coincide with the formation of a 12-hydrate of hydrochloric acid.

e existence of such a compound is further supported by the fact that solutions of
yarochloric acid tend to the same composition by evaporation at the atmospheric tem-
FJerature, The degree of hydration of most stability at high temperatures, and having
Jhe highest boiling-point, is known to be at or near the proportion of the 16-hydrate.
e existence, however, of the latter hydrate, at the ordinary temperature, is not sup-
orted by the transpiration experiments now recorded, conducted as these were at a low
