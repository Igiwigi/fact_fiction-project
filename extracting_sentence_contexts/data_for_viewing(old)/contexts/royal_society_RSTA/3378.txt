For our studies, we have used a well-vetted and -used structure generator, MOLGEN 5 [49],
which provides a wide variety of structural constraints and further features that facilitate the
construction of in silico compound libraries. This program permits the use of so-called fuzzy
formulae that allow ranges to be specified for the numbers of atoms for each chemical element.
This makes it possible to explore multiple molecular formulae in one program call. Another useful
and time-saving feature of MOLGEN 5 is the ability to include lists of forbidden substructures
(badlists) that can be passed as input to the program. Using such badlists, it is possible to
suppress unlikely, typically unstable chemical structures in the output datasets. Comparison
of the output datasets with published databases again offers an opportunity to vet whether
the badlist substructures represent valid restrictions on real-world chemistry. This process of
generation and comparison can be repeated iteratively. If valid structures are found in databases
containing compounds that have, in fact, been synthesized and/or isolated from the chemical
literature, then the badlist is too restrictive.

It should be noted that formula-based structure generation does not formally take into account
synthesizability, although this criterion can be evaluated in the output structure sets using
various programs, for example the commercially available SYLVIA (estimation of the synthetic
accessibility of organic compounds) software package (https: / /www.molecular-networks.com/
products /sylvia).

Using MOLGEN, we were able to generate libraries of «-amino acids (of the sort used by
biology in constructing proteins, with diverse side chains on the «-carbon, and as opposed to
B-, y- or 5- etc. amino acids) [8] and nucleoside analogues (for our purposes, molecules enabling
the attachment of a functional group such as a nucleobase which could provide non-covalent
