Temperature 17° C. Tue INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS. The experiments detailed above for the metals copper, mercury, and bismuth, to
which, according to Russett’s experiments, silver must also be added, have established
the following facts :—(i.) the primary change is that between the metals and nitrous
acid ; (ii.) no gas is evolved at first from the surface of the metal ; (iii.) the amount of
nitrous acid increases up to a constant and maximum proportion ; and (iv.) those
conditions which increase the amount of metal dissolved per unit time, are equally
those conditions which increase this constant proportion of nitrous acid. If then a
trace of nitrous acid becomes once formed, and if, also, the quantity of nitric acid is
present in very considerable excess, it would appear that these results may be
explained as follows :—(i.) the metal dissolves in nitrous acid to form the metallic
nitrite and nitric oxide ; (ii.) the nitrite formed is decomposed by the excess of nitric
acid to reproduce the nitrous acid; and (iii.) the nitric oxide formed in (i.) is not
evolved as such, but reduces the nitric acid or the nitrate to produce a further quantity
of nitrous acid. These changes may be represented thus, taking copper for example :

(i.) Cu+ 4HNO, = Cu(NO,), + 2H,0 + 2NO,
(ii.) Cu (NO,). + 2HNO, = Cu (NO,), + 2HNO,,
(iii.) 2NO + HNO, + H,O = 3HNO,.
