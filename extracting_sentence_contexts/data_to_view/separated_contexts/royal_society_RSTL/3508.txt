This arrangement proved, as indeed I ex-
pected, quite inadequate to the end proposed ; but it sufficed to reveal several lead-
ing facts, viz. 1st, That with the paper employed (which happened to be a specimen
prepared by the process in art. 31. on Mr. Tarsor's principle) the maximum of ac-
tion was not beyond the violet, as I had always understood it to be, but rather about
the confines of the blue and green, nearly where Frauxnorrr's ray F is situated.
2ndly, That the extent of the chemical spectrum beyond the visible violet light far
surpassed any idea I had previously formed of it. For, in fact, the visible termination
of the violet rays nearly bisected the photographic image impressed on the paper.
3rdly, That # the visible violet rays there occurred a sort of minimum of action,
about one third of the way from Frauxnorer's ray H towards G. 4thly, That the
whole of the red, up to about Frauxnore's line C, appeared to be inactive. And
5thly, That where the orange-red rays, or the less refrangible half of the portion from
C to D in Frauxnorer's spectrum, fell, there was communicated to the paper a sort
of ruddy tint, a dull brick red.

52. From this experiment, coarsely performed as it was, several practical conclu-
sions came to be deduced.
