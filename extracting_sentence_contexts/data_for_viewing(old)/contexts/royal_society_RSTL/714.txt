all purposes in which explosions or inflammations are to be guarded against, whether
from fire-damp, or carburetted hydrogene, coal gas, vapours of spirits, or of ether,

And by the introduction of glass cylinders within the wire-gauze cylinder above the

flame, the wick may be made very large, and it burns on the principle of the Liverpool
lamp.

74 Sir H. Davy's-researches on flame,

The facts stated in Section II, explain why 80. much more
heat is obtained from fuel when/it is burnt quickly ; and they
show that in all cases the temperature -of the acting bodies
should be kept as high as possible, not only because the gene-
ral increment of heat is greater, but. likewise, because those
combinations are prevented which at lower temperatures take
place without any considerable production of heat : thus, in
the Argand lamp, the Liverpool lamp, and in the best fire-
places, the increase of effect does not depend merely upon the
rapid current of air, but likewise upon the heat preserved by
the arrangements of the materials of the chimney, and com-
municated to the matters entering into inflammation.
