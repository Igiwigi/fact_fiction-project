Upon this point
may be remarked that in some instances we were able in the Cat even to differen-
ate, as we easily could do in the Monkey, between the upper limb and the lower
mb areas. That is to say, that if the dorsal cord were observed, we got a well-
farked effect by exciting the lower limb focus (as indicated by FrrRimr), whereas
Recitation of the fore limb focus produced no visible change in ‘the cord’s state, as
pvidenced by the electrometer. Thus the following facts were noted in the Cat (126).
