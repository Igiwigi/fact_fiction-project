The underlying tissues may also be affected down to, but (as SoRAUER
observed in other cases) not including, the epidermis of the lower side. The lower
epidermis, however, ruptures, and the result is a perforation in the leaf.. The club
shape of the hypertrophied cells is apparently due to the fact that after the cells
have broken through the epidermis, the pressure is removed from their free ends,
which consequently swell, while the lower ends are still pressed upon by one another. The elongated cells are extremely thin-walled. They contain nuclei with highly
refractive, degenerating nucleoli.
