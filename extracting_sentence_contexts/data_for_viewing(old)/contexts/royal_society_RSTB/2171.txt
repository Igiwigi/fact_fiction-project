were bodies “which remind one strongly of unicellular alge, the exact nature of

which I have not yet determined ;” and later on he gives me credit for mistaking the
ferment cells for unicellular alge. This is not so ; saying a thing is like another thing
is not the same as saying they are identical. Indeed, in a subsequent paper published
in the ‘ Philosophical Transactions’ for 1885, I showed that unicellular alge are not
present. However, Herr FrENzEL does not seem to have seen that paper. I shall
have occasion further on to refer to FRENzet's observations, so I need not now give
further quotations from his papers, except to call attention to the fact that he does
not think the colouring matter found in the glandular epithelium is related to
chlorophyll. However, he has not used the spectroscope in his work, and is not,
therefore, in a position either to confirm or deny the truth of my statements. He
acknowledges, however, that there is no difference between the pigment colouring the
contents of the ferment and the fat-holding cell of Crustacea, and that colouring the
contents of the ferment cell and the granular cell of the Mollusca. And I am now
quite certain that this pigment is either entero-chlorophyll, in most cases, or an
associated lipochrome. In the Crustacea either of these is, however, present in much
less amount than in Mollusca. It is hardly necessary here to point out that since
chlorophyll is an indefinite term used in a different sense by different observers, it
would be safer to restrict this name to the green or blue-green constituent of the
mixture extractable from leaves by fat solvents, the spectrum of which consists, in the
