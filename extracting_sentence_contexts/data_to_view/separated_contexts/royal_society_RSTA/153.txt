a relation which is equivalent to G.(p, gt(a)) = (pS),,-
The rest of the theorem, except for the equation p; = n;/,, is included in (9.5) and Theorem 20

The fact that p; = n,/; is an immediate consequence of Theorem 8. The following result is a partial converse of Theorem 12:

(7.4) If p is maximal, and R/p has characteristic zero, and if the exponent of (pS)q is
equal to its depth for all i = 1,...,¢, then G/pG has a primitive element over R/p.
