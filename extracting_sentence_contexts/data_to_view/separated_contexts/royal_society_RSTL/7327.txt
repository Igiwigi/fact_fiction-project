This rate was main-
tained for two minutes and a half, when it suddenly diminished to fifty. 'ZIn all the animals I haye observed after section of the pneumogastrics T have found

ipver lasts for more than a second. In order to arrive at a satisfactory explanation of
tHese facts, it is necessary to consider what is the condition of the heart and circulation
