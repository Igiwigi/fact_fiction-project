In particular, if we have a uniform pj, ie. pj =p=1/C?, then there are a total of m=C' states, Lo |
and S$; =—mpIn(p) = —In(1/Clr). In many of the calculations below, C is taken to be 20, the

actual number of amino acids; we have left the value general in some of our formulae so that “a

a reduced amino acid pool, although unlikely, could be considered. ig

Given that the average protein length is Ip = 325aa (see [27] for a review of values), for : Zs
20 unique amino acids, we have that pj =p =1/20°% = 1.46 x 10-4, where there are 20° :f

kT(S; — 0) = 4.03 x 10~18 (J) or 1.24 x 10-79 (J per amino acid). This value provides a minimum
for synthesizing a typical protein. We can also calculate the biological value from the fact
that if four ATP equivalents are required to add one amino acid to the polymer chain with
a standard free energy of 47.7 (kJ mol-!) for ATP to ADP, then the efficiency is 1.03 x 10-16

Landauer bound. : S
It should be noted that the efficiency of the translation system is much closer to the Landauer 2
bound than estimates for other biological processes. For example, synapses have been estimated aed
to be 10° to 108 times worse than the Landauer bound [93]. : _
These results illustrate that translation operates at an astonishingly high efficiency, even : 4
though it is still fairly far away from the Landauer bound. To put these results in context, it : Ss
