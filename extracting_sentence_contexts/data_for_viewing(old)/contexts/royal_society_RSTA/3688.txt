(which scales once again like length”). In fact, our analysis of the lower bound would also work : s
for this non-local substrate term. However, our analysis of the upper bound requires estimating at
the energy of an explicitly given deformation, which would be much more difficult for a non-
local model. Moreover, the use of (2.2) would not eliminate another key idealization, namely
that the sheet is free to slip along the substrate. In addition, our goal is to consider a thought-
experiment not a physical experiment: how does geometry induce wrinkling, when a thin elastic
sheet is required to conform to a sphere? With these considerations in mind, we take the view that
the Winkler model used in (2.1) is appropriate for our purposes.

In fact, Winkler-type substrate terms have been used to model many experiments. In [1,2,4,7]
(see also [5]), such a term arises from the gravitational potential of the fluid below the sheet. There
is, however, an important difference: in that work the prefactor scales as h-1, whereas in (2.1) it
scales as h~?. By considering one-dimensional examples, one sees that in our setting the cost of
wrinkling (determined by optimizing the length scale, based on competition between the bending
and substrate terms) is O(1) (half way between I? and h-?); this is why it contributes to the
leading-order energy. In [1,2,4,7], by contrast, the different scaling makes the cost of wrinkling
0(1) (so it is subdominant).

We turn now to a discussion of our results. They involve (i) identification of an effective
functional Fy, whose minimum determines the radial strain in the sheet, the approximate length
scale of wrinkling and the limiting behaviour of the minimum elastic energy (min E;,) as h — 0;
and (ii) upper and lower bounds for the excess energy, defined as the difference between min E;,
