A well-motivated example of this effect
is heavy right-handed seesaw neutrinos with sizeable Yukawa couplings [7]; a less motivated
example that has been widely discussed in the literature [40-43] is that Planckian physics might
introduce additional sources of potential destabilization. (For a more detailed discussion of this;
see [44].) In this respect, the hint of near-criticality might be compared with the hint of gauge
coupling unification: both are easy to disrupt by new physics thresholds (in which case they are
simply coincidences) but might be real hints pointing to some deeper and more fundamental
theory. This intriguing near-criticality has led to many theoretical speculations about its significance
[5,10,45-54]. Is somehow A(Mp}) ~ 0 connected to the fact that we also are very close to the phase

2In the red region labelled ‘non-perturbativity’ the running 2. hits a Landau pole below Mp1.
3For discussions on the gauge dependence of A; and how to satisfactorily deal with it; see [29-33].

“In [10], this number is reduced to approximately 1.3.0. However, comparison between the NNLO stability line of [4,5] and
the refined result of [10] shows nearly perfect agreement. The discrepancy is simply due to the different choice of mass
parameters in [10], namely M, = 173.21 + 0.87 GeV and, especially, My, = 125.7 + 0.4 GeV (figure 3b).
