“1, Magnetic storms are apt to occur at times which, starting from a certain point,
are multiples of 13°64 days. During some years the odd multiples and during other
years the even intervals are principally concerned.

“2. Magnetic storms often recur after several successive intervals which are equal
to some lapse of time sufficiently near 27°28 days to fall within the limits of rotation

of sunspot zones.

$21. If we look at Tables V. and VIL. we see that the interval between the crests of
the principal and secondary pulses is somewhere about 15 days, but the crests are so
rounded that the interval might well be a day or more short of this. The fact reminded
me of Prof. Scuuster’s remark about a 13°64-day period ; it also suggested that we
might have to do with the half of Dr. Scummr’s period. It thus appeared desirable
to ascertain definitely whether the magnetic data employed in the previous investiga-
tions did or did not show a period. This was investigated in the following way :—

The 5 days of largest H range in each month were selected, and the magnetic
character figures put down in successive columns for each of these and the 35 subsequent
days. The columns were numbered n to +35, the column v including the
representative days of largest H range. A year or two's data sufficed to show that
something was to emerge, so the enquiry was applied to the whole 11 years, and the
investigation was extended so as to include 5 days (columns n—5 to n—1) preceding
the selected days in column n.
