TI entirely
disagree with the main sub-groups erected by Ortmann. Reference to my figure of
Madrepora (fig. 60, p. 214) will be sufficient to prove that the theca of Madrepora
corresponds in structure precisely with OrTMANN’s own definition of an Hutheca,
differing only in the fact that it is porous. To call the solid parts of the Madrepora
theca “synapticule,” is to deviate wholly from the original application of the
term by Epwarps and Haim (antea, p. 167), in so far as no part of them is made
up of septal granulations, The synapticula would, in this case, have to be defined as
a thecal bar, having its own centres of calcification set at right angles to, or very
obliquely to, the centres of calcification in the septum, These thecal bars are, more-
over, always built wp exactly opposite each other, and at one definite radial distance
from the centre of the calyx. The homologue of such uniting bars is found in the
theca (= Eutheca of Harper and Ortmann) of Turbinolidw, and not in the occasional
irregular rings of synapticule and pseudosynapticule in the calyces of Siderastrea,
