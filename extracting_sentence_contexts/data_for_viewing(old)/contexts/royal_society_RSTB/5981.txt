surrounding regions.

As the limbs commence their backstroke they extend as rigid plates, thus opening
up free exits from the inter-limb spaces, and water from the latter is thrown out
backwards, fig. 1, limbs 1-5, producing the swimming stream.

A constant supply of water is thus being drawn from the surrounding regions into
the median space between the two rows of limbs, sucked into the lateral inter-limb
spaces and then thrown out backwards. Put in other words, the median space is
being continually emptied and, to replace this, water is drawn from the surrounding
region. Its only entrance is between the distal ends of the limbs, but the median space
extends right up to the ventral body wall at the proximal end of the limbs. Now
suction occurs throughout this length, and in fact, as I shall show later (p. 275), is at
a maximum near the body wall. Hence, of the water entering the median space, some
will be sucked into the inter-limb spaces at once near the distal ends of the limbs
fig. 1, inter-limb space 10-11, but the bulk will pass towards the ventral body wall
before being sucked away, fig. 1, inter-limb space 6-7. There is thus in the median
space a definite movement of water towards the mid-ventral line. Also, since the
region of suction is continually passing forwards (see below), the water, on entering

the median space will be subjected to two forces, one drawing it towards the body
and the other anteriorly, and it will pass, on the whole, obliquely forwards to the
