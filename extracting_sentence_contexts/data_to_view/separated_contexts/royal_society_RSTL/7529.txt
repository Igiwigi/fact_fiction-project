I have
noticed that the specimens in which the exposed portions are the roughest and most.
granular, are those in which the structure is most confused, not merely in the labyrin-
thic growths, which are naturally of coarser texture, but even in the compactly built
spiral lamina, which, usually 80 well defined, is often scarcely traceable in such indi-
viduals. 46. It has been stated that the shells of a number of the minuter forms of Foraminifera
are to be found imbedded in the shelly material forming the test, their presence being
due to the fact of their having been living amongst the sand in the neighbourhood of
the animal whilst the process of building its skeleton was being carried on. Their
identification is of considerable importance, as they afford, together with the organiszms
to be observed in the limestone matrix, the only data by which the depth of water wherein
the animal lived, may be indicated with any degree of accuracy. In the test itself the
following have been noticed: in many cases it is impossible to do more than identify the
Genus, specific and varietal characters often depending on peculiarities not to be recog-
nized in $ections.
