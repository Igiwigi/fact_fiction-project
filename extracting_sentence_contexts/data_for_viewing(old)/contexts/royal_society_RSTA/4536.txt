also relevant for strategic planning in sectors such as water, energy and agriculture [14], though
sectoral impacts relate more to regional than global changes. The focus on 15-year periods means
that we are examining fluctuations in the transient response of the climate [4] about the longer
term greenhouse warming trend.

Some bets have been set over much longer periods, as is appropriate for CO) climate change,
but they are less interesting to examine because the outcome is near certain warming and because
such bets are barely verifiable within the lifetime of those postulating them. A recent bet based on
a climate ‘normal’ of 30-year means [15] has been posed by the Center for Inquiry [16]. They are
willing to bet that each year the past 30-year mean will exceed the previous one. They note that
those who believe there is no basis for the ongoing warming ought to take up the bet, and that
those who reject greenhouse climate change presumably must believe that global temperatures
must soon stabilize or fall. The fact that so few bets have actually been taken against greenhouse
warming implies that the level of actual resistance to greenhouse theory by climate contrarians is
not as strong as claimed. The analysis of betting strategies here shows that contrarians are rational
insofar as they are not betting against greenhouse warming.

2. Climate variability across temporal scales

Any bet on temperature changes over the next decade and a half will depend on natural variations
on this time scale as well as any greenhouse forced response on this time scale. These are mixed
in together in the climate record, but this discussion is intended to show how their relative roles
are changing.

Climate varies on all time scales. What changes with scale are the magnitudes and rates of
