It is further the distribution to
which my explorations by stimulus of last year would certainly point. But, in order to
tes the matter still more thoroughly, I tried the effects of section in destroying the

direction, which is to be immediately considered in the text (B). And as it seems probable that in snch a 8imple
case as this the same nerves would serve to convey impressions in both directions, perhaps the most judicious
view to take of the difference between the degree of sensitiveness displayed by the polypite when a tentacle is
injured, and that displayed by the tentacles when the polypite is injured, is to suppose that in the former case a
feeble ganglionic discharge is added to the stimulus, which discharge would of course be absent in the latter cage.

* These facts were partly ascertained by the method of experimentation described in the last footnote. Tt
must here be added that in conducting snch experiments the greatest care must be taken not to agitate the
drops of water in which the animal is contained. The disturbance caused by capillarity on introducing the
needle-point into these few drops of water is sufficient to cause the tentacles and polypite to contract, eyen
though they be a long way off, I therefore used two object-glasses separated by a small interval, s0 as to break
the continuity of the water between the point of irritation and that of the tisxue whose physiological connexions
with such point I wished to ascertain.
