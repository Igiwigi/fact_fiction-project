the global change in Oz and CO2 air-sea exchanges has been quantified and the contribution
due to global warming isolated. It was found that the ocean has lost approximately 1100 Tmol
of potential oxygen to the atmosphere over the observational period, which represents a loss
of approximately 50 Tmol yr~!. This observational constraint on the ocean air-sea flux has been
combined with a suite of climate models to estimate the magnitude of the global deoxygenation
and to discuss its future evolution.

The turbulent nature of ocean circulation, manifest in a vigorous mesoscale eddy field, means that
pathways of ventilation, once thought to be quasi-laminar, are in fact highly chaotic. The chaotic
nature of ventilation pathways has been quantified by defining a non-dimensional ‘filamentation
number’, which estimates the reduction in filament width of a ventilated fluid parcel due to
mesoscale strain. In the subtropical North Atlantic of an eddy-permitting ocean model, the
filamentation number is large everywhere across two upper ocean density surfaces, increasing
with depth, implying highly chaotic ventilation pathways. Confirming this result, an advective
mapping of surface properties onto the density surfaces reveals highly filamented structure. These
results have important implications for the spreading of atmospherically derived tracers into the
ocean interior, and for the capacity of water parcels to retain memory of their surface properties.
