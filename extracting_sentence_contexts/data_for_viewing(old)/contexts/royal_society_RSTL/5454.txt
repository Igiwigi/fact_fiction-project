also Ek, k,k, k, k, k, becomes

and C(z, 7,,7,,7,,) vanishes, except for the cases where 9, 9, qz 9, represent respectively,
9: the index 1 or 4, q, the index 2 or 5, q, the index 3 or 6, and gq, the index 7.
Hence Ek, k,,k, kk, kk, k,) =, ks bs ke:C(k bes bes hy),
and consequently 7, becomes
+8C(k, kykes kg) > {hs beg eg + 24r; (fs ee bes eg + beg Beg) }
Hence we are able to predict that the general expression for our - in the case before
us will be
Ck th) Ott) Ct thy th,)
T<FS{LK,kkk)X5 + +k+k,) (ko kt ft foto tho et fo ks)
| —A(k, kk, +k, kk, +k, kg ky, +k, koh)
For in the first place, the fact that the 7 vanishes when more than three relations
of equality exist between the K's, proves that we may assume 7, of the form
S{C(k, kk, k,)X6{k, kk ky; ky, ky},
the semicolon (;) separating the Fs into two groups, in respect of each of which
severally @ is a symmetrical form. But if in the expression last aboye written for 7,
we make kh, =kke=hk,* kr=kss
it becomes
