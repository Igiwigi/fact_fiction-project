considered to be excitable was not so in the Orang. ‘This is especially the case in the
frontal lobe, the whole of which in front of the ascending frontal gyrus was inexcitable,
with the exception of the area for the representation of turning the eyes to the
opposite side, which is just in front of the preecentral sulcus. See figs. 1 and 3.

Similarly, the ascending parietal gyrus gave relatively much fewer results than the
same gyrus in the Bonnet Monkey, being practically wholly inexcitable in its upper
third (the superior parietal lobule).

3. The chief fact in this connection, and indeed possibly the most important new
point observed in this investigation, is the frequent limitation of movement to one
segment when a point is excited, instead of, as in the Bonnet, a sequence of move-
ments being thus produced. As an extreme instance of this singularity of function
we may mention square 31, where flexion of the elbow and nothing else was obtained.
The elbow in the Macacque, it will be remembered, was never unaccompanied by
movements of other segments and rarely initiated a ‘‘ March,” whereas in the Orang
we found it represented absolutely alone. (See “‘ Marches,” p. 144.)

It is well known that in the lower orders of animals the integration of representa-
tion becomes less perfect as we descend in the scale*—that, in fact, it is increasingly
difficult to differentiate the areas for the limbs; while, on the contrary, in ascending
the scale, we have shown in our previous communications that it is easy to differen
