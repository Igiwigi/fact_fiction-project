In
the porpoise, dugong, mysticetus, and human heart (Plate XIV. fig. 44) the carnee
column are more or less reticulated, particularly in the two latter, the musculi papil-
lares varying from two to four (4h h" 1"). This increase in the number of papillary
muscles in the right ventricle, which might at first sight seem to interfere with the
bilateral distribution of the fibres im the primary or typical ventricle, is accounted for
by the fact that in the right ventricle the muscular fasciculi, from which the papillary
muscles spring, do not, always coalesce as in the left yentricle, but remain permanently
apart. 'The musculi papillares of the right ventricle are less distinctly spiral than those
of the left, and are somewhat flattened to suit the concavo-convex $shape of the right
ventricular cavity. They occupy the septal wall posteriorly (A ), and the right
ventricular wall anteriorly (4k).
