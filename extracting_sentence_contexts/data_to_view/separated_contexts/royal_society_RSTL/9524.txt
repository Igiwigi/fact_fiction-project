Tts configuration: undoubtedly depends upon that of the terminal as well
as upon that, of the surface of the glass upon which it is actually formed ; but as thy
phosphorescent light has no direct connexion with the luminosity of the gas i
gives us no direct information as to what is going on within the tube, save 80 far as
testifies to the existence of these streams of material particles coming from the
negative terminal. Tho relation of this to other electrical phenomena seems not to have been clearly
understood, and it has been supposed by some to indicate that the gas within bs
tube js in some special and peculiar state differing widely from the ordinary gaseous

| molecules and the frequency of the collisions between them. As we are of opinion
> that there are no sufficient grounds for such a supposition, but that, on the contrary,
- the phenomena are compatible with the ordinary molecular theory of gases, we hall
d-! proceed to state our views upon the snbject, and the experimental facts upon which
these views are based. Tt is by no means an unusual phenomenon to find streams of particles driven off
4 from the surface of bodies highly charged with electricity. The very familiar
phenomenon known as the * electric wind ‚Äù is an instance of this kind.
