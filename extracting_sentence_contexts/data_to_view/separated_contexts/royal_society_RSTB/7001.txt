Correlation of this late-glacial detritus silt with the Allerad layer of north-western Europe which has
been recognized in Ireland. All the evidence from Windermere, from stratigraphy, pollen
analysis and macroscopic plant remains, supports the view that this detritus silt represents
a temporary period of relative warmth during the retreat of the ice-sheet. That this period
was not of interglacial magnitude is shown by the relative narrowness of its deposits
(maximum 50 cm.) and by the fact that it is overlain only by a comparatively thin deposit
of laminated (and therefore presumably waterlain) clay. This shows that there was no
readvance of ice over the site after the temperate period, but presumably only a downward
movement of valley glaciers from the central mountains towards the lake. This is in contrast
with the interglacial deposits of the neighbouring coastal plain (Kendall 1881; Eastwood,
Dixon, Hollingworth & Smith 1931) where peat beds containing the remains of temperate
plants are sometimes several feet thick and are overlain by boulder clay, presumably
deposited in situ.
