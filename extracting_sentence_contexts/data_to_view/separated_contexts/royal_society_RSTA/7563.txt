The saddle-point value is less than the value at the maximum and less than the
value at ,/3. Since for c = 0, 9 real and >,/3 we have

I(—f) = (s/o) x8,
it follows that £(—/f) continually increases from @ = /3, and we see that there can be only

one intersection in (1,,/3) and none for 0>,/3. Thus the I’, - and T’,,-pulses are necessarily
significant and the I’,,-pulses also if

04 [Ba + Ry (3 —4/B3)* > x8 +hy (1-95)! + hy (3-99). (11-30)

It is now apparent that the order of appearance of the I’,,-, T'y,-, U's,-, P',-pulses is not

fixed but depends on the values of hy, hy, % %, fo, 6; We must first check that the three

cases treated geometrically above do, in fact, arise in the order I to III as x is continuously

increased. At any given 0 the function #(—/) increases linearly with x at a rate proportional to 0,

so that although the saddle-point varies, the value of .4(—/) there is certainly increasing

at a lesser rate (with respect to x) than at a point for which 0>1; and for #>1, the greater
( then the greater the rate. It is now readily seen that cases I to III must arise in that order;
likewise that any one of the above conditions for the appearance of a particular pulse must
be equivalent to a simple minimum distance criterion, «> Xp.
