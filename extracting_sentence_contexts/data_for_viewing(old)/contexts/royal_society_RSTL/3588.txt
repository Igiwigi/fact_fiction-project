that colour which is commonly termed layender-grey ; at least such is the impression

i, e, to cobalt. This glass insulates two red rays of definite refrangibilities; one which I call the mean red, the
other the extreme red, This latter is situated 80 decidedly at the extremity of the visible spectrum, that if a
dot be made in the centre of the well-defined and round solar image to which it corresponds, and the glass be
then laid aside, that dot is judged by the eye to lie exactly at the end, or if anything rather beyond than within
the end of the visible spectrum. This is the ray which forms the subject of a communication to the Royal
Society by Mr. Coorzs (read May 16, 1839), but which I have pointed out to the especial notice of photo-
logists on several occasions, viz. 1st, in my paper on the action of crystallized media on homogeneous light,
read December 23, 1819, and printed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1820 (See vol. ex. p. 88); 2ndly, in
a paper read November 18, 1822, before the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and printed in the Transactions of
that Society for 1822; 3rdly, in my Treatise on Light (Encyclop. Metropol. $5 487, 497, 503.). This ray
has, in fact, been constantly used and recommended by me as a standard ray, for which purpose it is admirably
adapted on account of the facility of insulating it in a 8tate of purity.

them, and who proposed that term, or that of simple grey, to express it. It was in
the course of my experiments on the polarized rings in 1819, made with M. Biort's
apparatus, that I was first led to something approaching to convietion of the existence
of snch rays. While following out the measurements of the angular diameters of the
