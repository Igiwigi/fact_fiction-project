Figure 2. Glx and GABA concentrations in the V1 (a), MT (6) and PFC (c) are plotted as a function of the motion transition point. Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient r,
the 95% CI (confidence interval) and the p-values are shown in each graph. A regression line with 95% Cl is shown only in the graph with statistically significant
