branching of the axis. In A. corrugata this, as has already been stated, takes the form
of relatively infrequent dichotomies, which do not appear to bear any relation to the
insertion of the leaves, whilst in the other two species the branching is axillary. If
Bower’s view as to the primitiveness of dichotomy within the Filicales is accepted
(10, 11), then A. corrugata has retained the primitive method of branching, both in
petiole and axis, accompanied by a loss of radial organisation, whilst the remaining
species have retained the radial organisation of the axis but have evolved a more
advanced type of branching. It may be noted in this connection that Clepsydropsis
australis, with which Ankyropteris has much in common, has retained an upright
radial type of organisation, accompanied by a repeatedly dichotomising axis and an
absence of axillary branches (35). It seems certain that, whatever the primitive mode
of stem-branching in the ferns may have been, axillary branching was evolved at an early
period in their phyletic history, and has, in fact, been considered by Lane (26) to be a
primary feature of the organisation of the Ophioglossaces, a group showing a consider-
able number of structural similarities to the Zygopteridee. Lana, indeed, appears to
regard the case for the primitiveness of axillary branching in ferns as stronger than
that for dichotomy (27).

Our views as to the relative primitiveness of these two forms of branching must
obviously affect our interpretation of the structure of the petiole trace in Ankyropteris
corrugata. There can be little doubt that this strand is wholly homologous with what
Scorr (37) has termed the ‘‘ common trace ” of A. Grayi. It has the same general form,
and shares with it both a median and polar groups of protoxylem. Whilst, however,
in A. Grayi the central protoxylem, with the adjacent metaxylem tracheids surrounding
it, becomes detached as the stele of the axillary branch, that of A. corrugata dwindles
