A plant of #. globulus growing in a cool greenhouse, and free from outgrowths, was
removed to the stove, but developed no outgrowths. This was probably due to the

fact that the leaves were old, as the plant was hardly growing at all when the
experiments were made.

Outgrowths have been described by Soraver in E. globulus and E. rostrata. The
same observer has also noted the occurrence of outgrowths in E. Stuartiana,
E. coccifera, and E. saligna.*

With regard to the pathological effects of outgrowths, some observations have
already been made which may here be summarised. The colourless globular
outgrowths are very transitory, and apparently have no injurious effect upon the
leaves and stems which bear them. But the remains of the old intumescences which
have gone black somewhat disfigure the plants.
