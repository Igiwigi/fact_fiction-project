A more
detailed analysis would require estimating the wave vorticity in the kj,-w diagnostic diagram and
exploring the ratio for a given Fourier component, which is planned for the future. However,
from the energy transport perspective, we have seen that horizontal magnetic field allow IGWs
to propagate upwards into the atmosphere. Combined with the fact that, horizontal models
also show stronger nonlinearity parameter, this suggests that wave breaking may be a possible
scenario by which IGWs dissipate their energy in an atmosphere with predominantly horizontal
fields. Vertical fields, on the other hand, appear to prohibit IGWs from propagating into higher
layers and therefore prevents them from undergoing wave-breaking at chromospheric heights. The numerical solver used in this work is capable of capturing strong discontinuities related to
wave breaking condition, but the coarse resolution of the simulation restricts us from exploring
this aspect adequately.
