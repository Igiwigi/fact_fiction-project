Sith other elements ; but with certain elements, and under certain conditions, combi-
Shation may be induced. The elements which have been directly united to nitrogen
care (w) boron, (b) silicon, (c) titanium, (d) lithium, (¢) strontium and barium,
‘{f) magnesium, (g) aluminium, (/) mercury, (i) manganese, (j) hydrogen, and
{h) oxygen, the last two by help of an electrical discharge.
5 (a.) Nitride of boron was prepared by W6uLER and DevitiE* by heating amorphous
“gboron to a white heat in a current of nitrogen. Experiments were made to test
2yhether the reaction would take place in a tube of difficultly fusible glass ; but it was
round that the combination took place at a bright red heat to only a small extent,
Sand that the boron, which had been prepared by heating powdered boron oxide with
Sinagnesium dust, was only superficially attacked. Boron is, therefore, not a convenient
‘absorbent for nitrogen. [M. Motssan informs us that the reputation it possesses is
Edue to the fact that early experiments were made with boron which had been
obtained by means of sodium, and which probably contained a boride of that metal.

: (b.) Nitride of silicont also requires for its formation a white heat, and complete
union is difficult to bring about. Moreover, it is not easy to obtain large quantities
of silicon. This method was therefore not attempted.

(c.) Nitride of titanium is said to have been formed by Devizte and Caron, by
heating titanium to whiteness in a current of nitrogen. This process was not tried
by us. As titanium bas an unusual tendency to unite with nitrogen, it might,
perhaps, be worth while to set the element free in presence of atmospheric nitrogen,
