C, 0째4 per cent. ; Mn, 1째05 per cent. Its breaking strength was 37 tons per square
inch with 24 per cent. elongation over 8 inches. The end of the rod was heated to a
white heat in the forge and quenched and would then stand a large number of shots
without serious damage. In some cases tool steel hardened, and tempered blue, was
used, but it was found difficult to get the temper exactly right. The pieces butted to
the end of the rod were usually of mild steel. For recording the movement of the rod
and of the box in which the piece was caught each was fitted with a pencil which
moved over a horizontal sheet of paper and the length of the mark was measured.

Assuming that the bullet strikes the rod fairly in the centre, and that the
fragments are shot out radially, the total momentum recorded in rod and piece should
be equal to the momentum of the bullet, which at 2000 feet per second is 61째2 lb. feet
per second units. In fact, considerable variations were found in the total momentum,
For instance, in 110 shots fired at a 1-inch rod, the maximum total recorded was 76,

the mmimum 50, and the average 63. With a rod of 14 inches diameter, the

variation was less ; 61 shots showed a minimum of 59, a maximum of 70, and a mean of

62째5. High values are probably due to fragments being thrown back by irregularities

in the surface of the rod, low values to slight errors in aiming. It was found,
