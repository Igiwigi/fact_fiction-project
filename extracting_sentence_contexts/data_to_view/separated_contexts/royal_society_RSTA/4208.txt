The microscope tube was ground and lapped by us on one of
Brown and SHarpeâ€™s cutter grinders, which are not recommended by the makers for
producing a cylindrical surface. However, by applying care and attention and
rotating the tube between centres we have succeeded in making a tube so cylindrical
that we are unable by any of our appliances to detect any defect of form. We have
to thank the mechanical assistant of the laboratory, Mr. James Coox, for making the
V-grooves so perfect that the sensitive level we employ does in fact reverse when
mounted on the microscope tube. The riding level is a very substantial affair, the frame is of brass cut away as much
as possible for the sake of lightness, A cross level is attached to the frame by
adjusting screws. The main level is mounted in a copper tube (see p. 232).
