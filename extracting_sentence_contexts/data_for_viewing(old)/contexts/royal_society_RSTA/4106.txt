contact angles of 153° and droplets were found to roll easily from a tilted surface. When an oil-
water mixture was poured onto the mesh, the water permeated through the mesh while the oil
remained on top (figure 25). Although this configuration helps reduce the impact of fouling, the
fact that the surface is only superoleophobic under water limits its application.

Surfaces that are superoleophobic in air are typically also superhydrophobic due to water
having a higher surface tension. Such surfaces would, therefore, be unsuitable for oil-water
separation as the interactions with both liquids are similar.

However, it is possible to create a coating that repels oils but has an affinity for water [136—
141]. This is achieved through the use of a fluorosurfactant, which contains a high-surface-energy
head group and a low-surface-energy tail group. Fluorosurfactants are typically used as additives
in paints or cleaners. However, the presence of the ionic head group in many examples allows
for complexation, either in solution or on a coating, with polyelectrolytes. After deposition, the
fluorinated tails segregate at the air interface, resulting in a low-surface-energy barrier that repels
oils. However, when droplets of water are placed on the surface, they are able to penetrate down
