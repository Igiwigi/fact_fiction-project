Tt has the double purpose, first, of making
Known the systematic and highly satisfactory character of the results which have been
a obtained ; and, second, of acting in some measure as a guide, and certainly as an
* £ncouragement, to the several establishments at home and abroad which have adopted
Ke Kew System of magnetic investigation.
&Z The instruments employed for the determination of the lunar-diurnal variation furnish
'Kcontinuous photographic registry of the changes in the direction of a magnet whose
Motion is limited to a horizontal plane, and in the amounts of the horizontal and vertical
Emponents of the force acting on a freely snspended magnet. The photograms which
Fecord these changes are submitted to a very careful and exact process, by which the
gariations from a permanent zero, of the horizontal magnetic direction, and of the
mounts of the horizontal and vertical components of the Force, are measured and tabu-
ted at twenty-four equidistant intervals of an astronomical solar day. The accuracy
Af the tabulations is checked by a repetition of the process of measurement by different
Persons, and by a reexamination in cases of discrepancy. 'The proportion of failures in
the hourly records from any or from all causes whatsoever is very small—less in fact
than 1 per cent. throughout the whole period. 'The subjoined Table (No. I.) shows
that of 175344 positions which should have been recorded, there were only 1497
| failures, of which 103 were occasioned by the employment of the instruments in other
experimental processes. It must be remembered also that the period under notice is
that of the commencement of the record, when experience has to be gained, and the
eauses of accidental failures have to be remedied.
