In addition, there have been efforts to develop multifunctional CT
contrast agents via conjugating various functional molecules such as targeting ligands, peptides
and Raman reporters on the gold nanomaterials [2,43]. Although gold nanomaterials are attractive materials as CT contrast agents, they are too
expensive to be used in clinics. In fact, approximately 50g of gold should be consumed for a
human whole-body scanning session, making it hard to be commercialized in the market [37]. Thus, there have been attempts to find other cheaper alternatives. For example, lanthanides
have been proposed as CT contrast agents because gadolinium complexes have been used
as MRI contrast agents in clinics [36].
