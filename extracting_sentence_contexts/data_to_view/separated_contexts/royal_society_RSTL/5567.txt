M. Scnrey afterwards ascertained, that after destruction of
the lower part of the cervical and upper part of the dorsal region of the cord in
there is an immediate dilatation of the small vessels of the wings+, and Browx-Sfquany
had previously shown that after transverse section of the spinal cord in the lumbar region
in Birds and Mammals, an increase of 1?, 2®, or 3% Fan. took place in the temperature of
the paralysed parts. All these facts tend to the same conclusion, namely, that the spinal
cord is the part of the nervous centres which presides oyer the blood-yessels, and that
one important action at least which it induces in them is constriction of the circular
coat of the arteries. But there still remains, I believe, some difference of opinion with
regard to the interpretation of BerNarp's experiment ; and there might be some colour
for the idea that the red and turgid state of the vesels seen after division of the
sympathetic in the neck was due to a change in the blood, such as occurs in inflamma-
tion, and that the pallor ensuing upon galyanizing the nerve was the result of a return
of the vital fluid to its normal condition after restoration of neryous influence. But all
ambiguity of this kind seems to me to be removed by some obseryations made several
years ago by Mr.
