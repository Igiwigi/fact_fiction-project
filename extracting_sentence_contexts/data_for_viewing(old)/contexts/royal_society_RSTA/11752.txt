So far as these calculations go they indicate the way in which the process of

attempting to establish a uniform acceleration, at speeds nearly that of radiation,
may fail. The damped harmonic train of waves may have such a small damping

coefficient that it is no longer legitimate to neglect those waves, and a uniform
acceleration cannot, in point of fact, be established.

We may further observe that an uncharged sphere of atomic size would, under
ordinary conditions, give fundamental vibrations of frequency corresponding to
extreme ultra-violet radiation, damped with exceedingly great rapidity. Our result
proves that, at a speed approaching that of radiation, the fundamental vibration may
be brought within the visible spectrum range, and at the same time the damping
becomes relatively small.

A similar conclusion holds for an unconstrained charged sphere provided m’/m is
not large.

These results are of significance in optical theory, and investigation of the effect
