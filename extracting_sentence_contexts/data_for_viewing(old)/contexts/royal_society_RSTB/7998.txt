and they obviously form a very difficult subject for study, but the difficulties would be
equalled by the fascination of the task if it proved to be practicable. The behaviour of
elephants, both as individuals and as a community, is evidently related to two outstanding
attributes, the possession of a prehensile organ and their virtual immunity from predators
(except, in modern times, man). A measure of our ignorance of their habits is the fact that

glands is unknown, even in the Indian elephant. Beyond the fact that “musth’ is apparently |
related to sexual excitement, although males which are not ‘musth’ will readily mate with
a female that is in oestrus, little is known of this phenomenon. It does not occur simul-
taneously in all the males of a group, and does not appear to have a marked seasonal
rhythm in the elephant population as a whole. The temporal gland sometimes secretes in
a healthy female. In the African elephant these glands function, at least over a considerable
part of the year, not only in adult males but also in juvenile males and in juvenile and
adult females, including pregnant animals. The relation of ‘musth’ to breeding is obscure,
and it is not even clear that the ‘musth glands’ have the same function in Indian and
African elephants.
