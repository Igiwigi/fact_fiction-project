were found starting from the same sub-origin as Frerichs’ two and additional branches
starting from the second sub-origin. A search next showed a number of branches
commencing at a point 50 cm.~! above the second sub-origin and five strong branches
commencing at a point 50 cm.~' higher still. In a number of cases the branches seemed
to be in pairs with the separation already noticed.

The existence of four components established the quartet structure of the band, and
it seemed reasonable to assume, in accordance with Mulliken’s suggestion, that the
transition was 4) > 4/7. The separation of 0-45 cm.~! should then be connected with the
spin fine structure of the 42 state. From this point a search for additional branches
and an attempt to identify those already found by means of the combination relations
were carried on simultaneously. Fortunately, in many cases the probable J values of
the lines could be established directly from the fact that the branches could be followed
close up to the origin. When the analysis had been partly completed Budo’s paper (1937)
appeared confirming tentative conclusions on the structure of the #2’ state. With the
confidence thus inspired it did not take long to identify the remaining branches found
empirically and to calculate the positions of the lines of the weak branches with the
aid of the combination relations.

The observed structure of the bands agrees with that to be expected for a *2 > 4/7
transition with alternate lines missing in each branch. It will be shown in the next
section that the initial level F/(K) is blended with Fj(K) and Fj(K) with Fy(K). The
effect of this is to reduce the total number of branches from 48 to 40, all of which have
been observed in the (1, 0) and (0, 1) bands. The absolute J values of the lines of the
branches were checked in the usual manner.
