where the Obama administration pledged a 26-28% reduction in GHG emissions by 2025,
while President Xi simultaneously made a general pledge to commence emissions reduction
by 2030. However, the proposed reductions are far from sufficient to contain significant
additional accumulations of GHGs. Moreover, enforcement is lacking; there are no clear plans
of implementation on either side, and the reliance of the US pledge on executive authority

means it may well be reversed under a Republican administration.? The differences between
these respective pledges reflects the inherent asymmetry of the problem more generally. A global
agreement must resolve the fact that negotiating countries are at very different stages of
development, and that the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) will either require compensation
for stringent emissions reductions, or will only commit to mitigation once development has
taken place [11]. Optimistically positing significant Sino-US progress beyond their recent pledges,
world energy demand is still predicted to increase as incomes, not to mention populations, in
LDCs increase in the future [12,13]. For all of these reasons, adaptation is now an unavoidable
feature of the response to climate change, particularly in LDCs. This view is reflected in the high-
level institutions of the UNFCCC with the formation at the COP16 in Cancun of the Cancun
Adaptation Framework (CAF). Similarly, both AR4 and ARS [2,3] have detailed chapters devoted
entirely to adaptation. Even the US president has recently highlighted the need for climate :
preparedness [14]. =

Of course, as with mitigation, adaptation decisions must be taken despite considerable
