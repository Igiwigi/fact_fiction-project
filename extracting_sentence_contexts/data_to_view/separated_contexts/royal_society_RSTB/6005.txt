If
the position of the first two on the ventral side of the thyroid membrane in Megalophrys
robusta is characteristic of the family, this provides a small point of contrast with all
other Anura, except Alytes and Discoglossus. The most characteristic feature of the larynx is the incompleteness mid-dorsally of
the cricoid ring. This might have been considered a primitive feature, in view of the
fact that the cricoid is known: to develop from a pair of distinct cartilages (MARTENS,
1897), but the cricoid is incomplete dorsally in Rhacophorus (Polypedates) dennyst,
(FRazrer, 1924), which also, curiously enough, has the hyalia represented by anterior
processes alone. This is regarded as an instance of convergence, but throws doubt
on the primitiveness of the condition in the Pelobatide. In Pelobates (fide Hente and Biume) and in Megalophrys (Leptobrachium) hasseltw
(fide Bepparp) there are no cesophageal processes; in other species of Megalophrys
there are two parallel processes.
