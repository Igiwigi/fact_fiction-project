the greatest interest, for the skull of Echidna is really monocondylar, and resembles
that of Squamata in this respect.

An examination of vAN WIJHE preparations brings out clearly the essential differ-
ences between the two fundamentally different types of joint as found in mammals
and birds, in particular as regards the fates of the hypocentral and pleurocentral
elements of the proatlas vertebra. The paired occipital condyles of the mammal
arise from the base of the occipital arches, and at the place where in the bird the single
condyle is developed, there is in the mammal a deep notch (the incisura intercondyloidea
of some authors).

Turning now to the condition of the occipito-atlantic joint in reptiles, one of the
most interesting facts elucidated by Hayek (1924) is that the crocodiles and Chelonians
resemble the birds in including the hypocentral and pleurocentral elements of the
proatlas vertebra in the basal plate, having an odontoid peg consisting of the pleuro-
centrum of the atlas vertebra only, and having an intervertebral intrasegmental joint ;
while Sphenodon (ScHaurnsLanp, 1900) and Squamata (HayeK, 1924) resemble
mammals in including the pleurocentral element of the proatlas vertebra in the odontoid
peg, and having an intravertebral intersegmental joint. The hypocentral element of
the proatlas vertebra in Sphenodon and Squamata becomes attached to the hind part
of the basis cranii, and contributes to the formation of the single median occipital
condyle (as presumably in Echidna).

It follows, therefore, that the condyle in Sphenodon and Squamata is different from
the similarly named structure in crocodiles, Chelonia, and birds.
