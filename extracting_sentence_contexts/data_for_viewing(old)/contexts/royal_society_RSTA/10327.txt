But during the winter the curves were so irregular, even on the finest days, that it
was quite impossible to decide whether a particular curve ought to be neglected or
not, so I used, during the winter, all the curves quite independently of the weather
This caused irregularities in the final curves, but has not, I think, affected the
conclusion to be drawn from them.

Dissipation —The value of the dissipation, as measured by Exster and Gerret’s
instrument, depends to a very great extent on the manner in which the instrument
is exposed to the wind. This is as it should be, for the actual dissipation from the
earth’s surface (which the instrument is designed to measure) depends largely on the
wind strength. In order that the instrument should measure the amount of dissipation
taking place from the earth’s surface, it should be exposed to the same wind condition
as the general surface. This fact bas not been fully realized by most observers. It
has been quite a common practice to shelter the instrument from the wind, either by
erecting screens or by observing close to a building, and in several cases the instrument
has been placed within a room close to an open window. Observations taken under
such conditions are of very little value ; they are certainly of no use in comparing the
dissipation of one place with that of another, and at the best can only be used to
compare variations from time to time at the same place. In order that the dissipation
at one place may be compared with that of another, the instruments used should in
both cases be exposed to the full force of the wind, for wind strength is just as much
a factor in determining the dissipation as is the ionization. For this reason my
instrument was only used in a freely exposed situation, where it was in no way
sheltered from the wind. This method also has its drawbacks, for with anything like
a high wind the leaves of the electroscope were so blown about that they continually
