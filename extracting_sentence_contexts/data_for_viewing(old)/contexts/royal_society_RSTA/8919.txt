In the are spectrum of manganese Kayser and Runce* found five triplets with
separations about 173 and 129, and arranged them in two series, one sharp and one
diffuse. The formule given by these observers were

vy = 41223-86 —125229n-* —1377549n-'; (Diffuse series)
Ay, = 172-07; Avy = 129-14;

v = 41222-15 —119890n-* —580770n-*; (Sharp series)
Ay, = 173-78; Avo = 129°14;

An attempt has been made to extend these series, but a considerable difficulty arose
from the fact that the manganese spectrum is very rich in lines and that such expected
triplets would probably be very faint. Additional triplets, however, have been
recognised, as shown in Table I.

Sharp series, 1\p—ms.—The first two triplets of this series were traced by Kayser
and Runer. The observations of JanicKrt on the structure of the manganese lines
show the lines of the first triplet to be quite simple and sharp (see Plate 1, fig. 5).
The lines are fairly strong at low temperatures and are present in many other spectra
as impurity lines. The three lines were measured in the iron spectrum by Kinrpyt
and the wave-lengths in the table have been quoted from his measurements. The
wave-lengths for the second member of the sharp series (see Plate 1, fig. 4) entered in
the table are quoted from Fucus.
