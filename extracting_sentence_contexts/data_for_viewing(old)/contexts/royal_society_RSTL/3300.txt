lakes may 8weep away or accumulate vast quantities of rubbish in the valleys; earth-
quakes may hurl down piles of fragments ; and torrents during the lapse of ages, or
under fayourable conditions (such as the descent of many pebbles), may excavate a
gorge of almost any depth, but which, as' far as it is possible to judge, will always be
narrow and steep-sided. All this must often have happened, and will s0 again ; but the
glens of Lochaber plainly show that the effects of ordinary alluvial action is exceedingly
small, far smaller than any one would have anticipated. And as their outline does
not differ in any marked degree from that of all other valleys, this conclusion may
be extended to other cases. .

In Glen Roy, where the three shelyes can be seen near each other, little or no dif-
ference can be perceived in their state of preseryation ; indeed the upper one, I think,
is more perfect than the one below it. From this fact an argument has been ad-
vanced by Dr. MaceuLLocn, that no long interval of time could have elapsed between
their formation. But this view is quite inadmissible; either the worn and deeply
notched rock of the shelves on Tombhran, or the buttresses on the middle shelf (as
at the head of Lower Glen Roy), which are composed of large masses of well-rounded
shingle, is sufficient, without considering the intermediate shelf and other appearances,
to prove that the water must haye remained at levels intermediate between the highest
and the 972-feet shelf for very long periods. Hence the alternative is obvious, and
is in direct accordance with what has already been advanced, namely, that the ordi-
nary alluyial action is 80 exceedingly small, that whether the surface has been ex-
posed during one, two or more whole epochs, no sensi√æle difference can be perceived
in the state of its conservation.
