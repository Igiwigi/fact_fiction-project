would naturally fill up the vacant space rather than stimulate the expansion of the
skull, and the undeveloped anterior extremities of the visuo-sensory cortex would
gradually mature, the sight of the animal being apparently normal but. really
relatively defective. It may be added that these considerations are only brought
forward as a possible explanation of the facts and as an alternative to what I consider
the less probable one of Virzov.


OF THE VISUAL AREA OF THE HUMAN CEREBRAL CORTEX. 177

The immense quantity of literature which has, been published on the clinico-
pathological aspect of this subject renders it impossible to give even a brief résumé of
all the facts adduced, but fortunately a considerable amount is relatively useless,
owing to absence of precision, or only valuable as supporting statements previously
advanced. The earliest recorded case bearing on the subject was published by
Crarixov (10) in 1863. In this case permanent right hemianopsia coexisted with the
absence of a large area of cortex on the median surface of the left occipital lobe.
During the next twenty years numerous similar cases were reported, and, in 1884,
Srarr (11) collected and analysed 27 cases of lesions of the occipital lobes and neigh-
bouring parts combined with hemiopia. He concluded from a study of these cases
that the visual area lies in the occipital lobes, that the exact site is doubtful, and
that a lesion on either the convex or the median surface may cause hemiopia. He
alluded to the discovery of WERNICKE (1881) that the optic radiations passed just
beneath the cortex of the angular gyrus, and noted how a lesion of the angular
gyrus might cause visual disturbance by implication of these fibres and thus explain
