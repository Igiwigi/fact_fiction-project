This graph shows how the instability develops by increasing the noise intensity. Below we
analytically determine the minimum noise intensity, Dmin, at which the instability occurs. First,
we rewrite equation (3.1) in the canonical form

dp =(-yp — 2x + Asin @i)dt — /DxsW(), dx = pdt (3.2)

Here, due to the fact that the system features multiplicative noise, we have to decide whether to
consider this equation in the Ito or Stratonovich sense. We will consider both cases, starting with
