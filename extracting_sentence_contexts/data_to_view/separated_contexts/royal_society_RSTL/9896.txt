This idea was tested and verified on the spot. The Journal of Telegraph Engineers
for December 8th, 1880, contains the following record of what occurred. © When
Professor BELL was good enough to show me his experiments, I happened to be
myself experimenting on the action of vapours upon radiant heat. Old experiments
had revealed, and new ones had confirmed the fact that, as regards the absorption of
heat, there existed vast differences between vapours. This is well illustrated by the
deportment of bisulphide of carbon and of sulpharic ether, one of which is highly
transparent, and the other highly opaque to radiant heat. Tt occurred to me that, if
the action were due to the absorption of heat, we might possibly extract musical
sounds ſrom sulphuric ether vapour, whereas bisulphide of carbon vapour being trans-
parent to heat-rays they would for the most part go through this vapour unabsorbed,
and produce no 80norous effect.
