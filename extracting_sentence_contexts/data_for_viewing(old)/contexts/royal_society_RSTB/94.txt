Errksson observed that the inner cells of the swelling contained the vibrio-like
bodies described by Woront: in the outer part of the swelling he occasionally
noticed Fungus hyphe proceeding radially inwards from cell to cell, and becoming
branched and finer as they go inwards. Eriksson saw no hyphe in the cells con-
taining the vibrio-like bodies : he noticed also that the latter are not always simple
rod-like bodies, but oftener forked, &c. He left it open whether any connection
exists between the hyphee and the vibrio-like bodies.

In 1878 Kwyy asserted* that the tubercular swellings on the roots of Leguminosze
do not appear on plants cultivated in nutritive fluids, and expressed the opinion that
this was because some parasite which causes the tubercles is absent from the fluids—
in fact, is evidence in favour of the parasitic nature of the swellings. Kwny also
stated that he found a plasmodium in the dividing cells of the tubercles, especially in
Cicer: he states that the parasitic plasmodium can be followed from cell to cell in the
form of delicate, sparsely branched strands. Where they traverse the dividing
cellulose-walls the plasmodial strands are slightly thickened (Joc. cit., p. 55).

Then followed the Paper by Franx,t in which he confirmed and extended
Ertksson’s statements as to the ubiquity of the swellings on the roots. FRANK states
that the greatest care is necessary to prevent the development of the tubercles, that
they occasionally occur on water-cultures as well as on roots in any soil. They did
not appear on roots in soil which had been heated, though every plant in soil not so
treated had them. Frank concluded that the roots are infected from outside by a
“ germ” which must be as ubiquitous as the germs of putrefactive and fermentative
