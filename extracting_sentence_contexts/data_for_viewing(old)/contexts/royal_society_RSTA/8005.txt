accurate if x does not exceed 3-25, but for greater values of « it is unreliable. The
value of D, is obtained from (99). When « has the value 3 we find from the expressions
for A.D, and A that, very approximately, D, = 18. Also for this value of « the
approximate value of Ds is s\y.

We can say, then, that in the neighbourhood of the value x = 3, or to be more
precise for the range of values of « lying between 2-75 and 3-25, say, C, is small in
comparison with D, and Cs is large in comparison with Ds. These considerations
effect a great simplification. In fact, writing S = 8, + iS,, the approximation to S$
becomes

Now in the small range of values of « under consideration C,, é; and e, change very
slowly, so that their values when « = 3 are amply sufficient.

When x = 3, 2C,/e, = 4, approximately, and e, = 2/7. Also
