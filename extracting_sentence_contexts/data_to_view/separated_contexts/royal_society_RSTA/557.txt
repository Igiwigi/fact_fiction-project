This is primarily due to the forward thrust which is exerted by the escaping gases
and which is by far the largest force acting on the projectile. Owing to the magnitude of the
thrust, it may not be necessary to know the magnitude of the aerodynamic forces and couples
(in particular, the drag) to the same degree of accuracy as for a shell, but this advantage is
offset in practice by the difficulty of accurately determining the thrust, and by the con-
siderable variation occurring between projectiles.§ In nearly all other respects, however, the
problem of predicting the path of a rocket is much more complicated than the similar pro-
blem for shell. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that the rocket’s motion is very

+ Thus projectiles which derive their oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere are excluded. t See, for example, Fowler, Gallup, Lock & Richmond (1920) or Nielsen & Synge (1946).
