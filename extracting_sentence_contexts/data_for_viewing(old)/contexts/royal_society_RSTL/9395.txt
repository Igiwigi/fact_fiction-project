S, form we could integrate the differential which they form and geb the impulse and

2 (80.) In paragraph (41) I inferred from the work with the whirling machine that
= with 9” cups the z is the same for 24” and 12” arms ; but what precedes shows that
Q this is not the fact, and that each type of anemometer has a special a, I would
therefore suggest to meteorologists and opticians the propriety of confining them-
8elves to two types: one for fixed instruments, the other for portable ones. For the
first the Kew type should, I think, be adopted ; if the determination of its constants,
given in paragraph (70), be not thought sufficiently exact, there would be little
difficulty in making more observations like those described there, and under more

#=2'0709 less than in No. 4, but 80 large as to make it evident that there must be 80me other cause of
the increased value of #.
