ment memes, lacking a CE they cannot predict and
evaluate the consequences of those imitated behaviours.
The Storybots, on the other hand do not imitate behaviour
directly. Their method of learning from others is mediated
by the mind-tool of language. Table 1 summarizes the
classification outlined here.

Applying the framework of Dennett’s tower does raise the
interesting question of whether intelligence must necessarily
be achieved by building each level of generate-and-test on
top of the preceding one, or whether robot intelligence
might skip one or more, to achieve cumulative culture more
directly. The fact that we are able to skip the Skinnerian
level is a consequence of hard coding the capabilities sum-
marized in table 1. Strictly speaking, this is a serious break
with both the evolutionary origins and cumulative nature
of each level in Dennett’s framework. Given, however, that
artificially evolving each capability in succession is far
beyond what can be achieved in evolutionary robotics at pre-
sent [41], and that we have demonstrated the implementation
of Skinnerian learning, the break is—we believe—justified.

(b) What can we learn from the Storybots?
In order to address this question, consider first what we
might learn from the Storybots as presented in §3. These
