pyrolusite, is heated in the oxyhydrogen flame, a very brilliant banded spectrum is
obtained which is for the most part coincident with the Bessemer spectrum,

Observations were further made on the spectrum of the flame obtained on adding
spiegel-eisen to Bessemer metal, on the temperature of the flame at different stages
in the process, and on different spectra obtained by the employment of different kinds
of iron,

Accurate determinations were made for the first time of the wave-lengths of lines
observed in the spectra of the Bessemer flame of spiegel-eisen, and of manganese
dioxide.

The fact that six lines of iron were present in the Bessemer spectrum was estab-
lished, and considered to be a proof that iron may exist as vapour at a temperature
below its melting-point, since certain experiments led to the conclusion that the
Bessemer-flame was not hot enough to melt wrought-iron.

This work of Marsnatn Warts is the most exhaustive investigation of the subject
that has up to the present appeared. In 1874* Grerner observed in the flame from
highly manganiferous pig-iron the spectrum of manganese as figured by Wxpp1N@.

During the meeting of the British Association, at Sheffield, in 1879, I made a
short examination of the Bessemer flame with a small direct vision spectroscope, at
the works of Messrs. Brown, BAyLEy, and Drxon; I also examined the flame of
