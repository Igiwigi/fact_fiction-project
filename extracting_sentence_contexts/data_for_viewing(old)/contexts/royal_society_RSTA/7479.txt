used, rather than the values which could be estimated for the individual alloys, since the
amplitudes at 4-22°K for the most contaminated specimens were very small, and only
rough estimates of f could be obtained. Most of the alloys showed (though to a lesser extent)
the modulations characteristic of pure tin and, as for pure tin, ‘smoothing’ was adopted to
estimate the field variation.

In the preliminary experiments it was hoped to use the data of Hulm (1950) on the varia-
tion of resistivity with mercury concentration, but it early became apparent that it was
quite impossible to assume that the mercury concentration in the crystals was at all the same
as that put into the original alloy from which the crystal was grown; thus if x was plotted
against nominal concentration, not only were the points badly scattered, but they did not
even indicate any monotonic behaviour. It was thought likely that mercury had been lost
to a varying extent by the different specimens, and this was in fact later confirmed by direct
chemical analysis of some of the crystals. To overcome the difficulty, new crystals were

grown taken from the middle portion of a long wire of the alloy arranged as shown in figure
19, so that the remaining portions on either side could be used for resistance measurements.
In this way for each new crystal a reliable value of R/R, was obtained, where R is the residual
resistance, measured at 4:22°K, and R, the resistance measured at room temperature.
For the most contaminated alloys it was found that the transition to superconductivity
(normally occurring at 3-73°K) was so smeared out that the resistance at 4:22° K was
already less than the residual resistance, owing to incipient superconductivity; this was
