These were the first ternary alloys
analysed, and the analytical technique was greatly improved for all remaining alloys. FREEZING AND MELTING POINTS OF ALLOYS OF SILVER AND COPPER. 87

In the remaining alloys the analyses indicated that a little zinc was lost in
melting, whilst the germanium and gallium contents by analysis were slightly greater
than those intended. This may be due to the fact that borax takes up a little of the
copper during the melting, or alternatively to segregation effects. In only one alloy
did the difference exceed 0+25%,, and in this the higher germanium content was
confirmed by the analysis of a further portion of the cooling curve ingot. which was
cut off and used for the solidus determination. It does not seem probable that the
results are substantially in error on account of segregation, because the analyses of the
portions cut off for the solidus experiments gave analytical values for gallium and
germanium which were within a few tenths of a per cent. of those obtained from the
analysis of the complete sections, although the zinc contents diminished slightly on
account of volatilization during the annealing at high temperatures.
