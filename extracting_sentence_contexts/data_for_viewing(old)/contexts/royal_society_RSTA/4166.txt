just like actual facts, let us define QM as dealing only with knowledge, information, etc.,
rather than with objective reality.

(ii) Excess ontology: Many Worlds. The counterfactual does occur, but in a different world, split
from ours at the instant of measurement.

Our option is moderate ontology. It does not seek shelter in strict positivism, which can seldom
be falsified yet is equally barren. It rather indulges into a modicum of speculation with its
inherent risk of being proven wrong. Our inspiration comes from Wigner’s seminal essay ‘The
unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences’ [17]. Following a long line of
thinkers ever since Plato, Wigner mused that ‘The miracle of the appropriateness of the language
of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither
understand nor deserve’. What, after all, is so unique about science? It is the fact that mere
information, especially mathematical, can yield, with appropriate manipulation of its symbols,
additional information, which may strike us as odd or even wrong. Yet, if we take it seriously, we
may find that Nature indeed possesses what this new information conveys!

“This perfectly reasonable approach was recently suggested to us via private communication from W. M. Stuckey (2015).


Our moderate ontology concerns the nature of time. It is from the present physical and
mathematical attributes of time that we seek to derive a new property. Our first derivation
(which is, let it be stressed again, a rigorous one) is QO [1], whereby quantum events happen
and sometimes also unhappen. This ontology offers, paradoxically, a demystifying account of the
quantum world [2]. We now dare to speculate further into the nature of time and endorse the idea
