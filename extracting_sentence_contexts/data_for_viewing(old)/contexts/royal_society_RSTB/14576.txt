words, people expressed less confidence when they used
wrong names and more confidence when they used correct
ones. The same authors also found that confidence in
having identified the right concrete source and labelled the
smell correctly was also inflated (see [83] for discussion).
Given that people are usually bad at naming concrete sources
of smells, finding that their confidence is both relatively infor-
mative and high is enigmatic: if people struggle and are
frequently incorrect in identifying the smell of lemon or man-
darine as such, why should they be over-confident in their
naming capacity? Here a yet-to-be-tested possibility is
that, as people used more abstract and generic labels in com-
municative contexts, the fact that those are more likely to be
agreed by other speakers means that agreement will boost
confidence in those terms being correct or safe. In other
domains, high confidence tends to be better explained by
high inter-individual agreement than high correctness (e.g.
[84]). Speakers may discover by themselves that by moving
away from names that refer to the actual or typical source

of the smell, and using more abstract terms, they not only
secure more agreement but are made to feel more confident
in their labelling capacities.
