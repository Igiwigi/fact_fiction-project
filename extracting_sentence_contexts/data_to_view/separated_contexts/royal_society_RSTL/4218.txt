The order of their radiating power is black the lowest, then green, white, crimson,
scarlet, orange, yellow, dark blue and light blue snccessively, the difference between
light blue and black being 1*3. The same parcels of wool were exposed to the direct
rays of the sun many times, and as nearly similarly situated as possible, The mean
of fifty-eight simultaneous readings of the thermometers placed on them gave—

Thus black and light blue are at the extremes of the absorptive powers, and 80
far confirm the results obtained by the night obseryations, as the absorptiye power
of substances is proportional to their radiating power. But as these results with respect to colours may have been affected with the par-
ticular parcels of wool I used, and different results might have been obtained had
other parcels been used, I do not place much confidence in them ; yet, s0 far as I
could discoyer, each parcel was equal in thickness, hardness, and in fact in every
respect except that of colour. Bodies in the state of powder, placed on the raised board, formed a third class of
substances. These were black-lead, charcoal, whiting, chalk, lamp-black and river-
