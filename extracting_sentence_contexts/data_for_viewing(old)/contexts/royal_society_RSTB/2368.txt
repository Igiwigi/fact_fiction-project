'= and I think therefore that the change effected by massage is essentially due to com-
pression and increased eyeball tension, producing some modification of the retinal
8 elements, as evidenced by their modified response to light.

FI The response to electrical stimulation exhibits an analogous change, and I have
8 expended much time in the endeavour to disengage some “law” amid the rather
ES perplexing phenomena presented by “stale” or injured eyeballs. There was never
g the slightest doubt or uncertainty as regards a fresh and uninjured eyeball; the
Sp response was always positive. Difliculties of interpretation arose only in the case of
eyes that had undergone manipulation; these, however, have been considerably
‘| diminished since I have found means of experimentally modifying at will the character
2 of the response by means of increased eyeball tension, And I may remark in passing
2 that this fact has led me to believe that in the modifications that have sometimes
3 (but not always) supervened with lapse of time, alterations of eyeball tension
8 have been a principal factor. I have witnessed response of the first type two or
cs three days after death, when the eyeballs had become obviously flaccid ; and I have
£ witnessed response of the first type very shortly after excision, and I now think it
P probable that in such case the eyeball had been accidentally compressed more than
= usual.

g The various ,types of response that may be witnessed on excised eyeballs, are
