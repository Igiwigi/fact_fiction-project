strengthen the contribution of more recent assemblages, simply
because older ages tend to have larger standard errors (figure 7).

In this vein, a second binomial GLM was fitted to the data,
which did not include any weights. This second model remained
highly significant when compared to a null model including all
terms (i.e. both population density and African region attribu-
tion) but no interaction between them (likelihood ratio test:
x? = 887, d.f.=810, p<0.001).

(e) Archaeological data
Archaeological data used in these analyses comprise stone arte-
fact data derived from assemblages from 409 stratigraphically
distinct archaeological layers in 116 African Late Pleistocene
sites. These data are primarily from ROAD, the ROCEEH Out
of Africa Database, which was designed and is maintained by
the ROCEEH team/project, Tiibingen University, Germany, and
include all known African sites documented and published up
to the end of 2014. The sites can be accessed on the The Role
of Culture in Early Expansions of Humans (ROCEEH), 2018,

‘lithics’ and entering an age range from 10 to 125 ka, without
