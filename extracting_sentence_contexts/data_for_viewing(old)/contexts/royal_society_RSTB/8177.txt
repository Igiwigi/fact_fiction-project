Pacific Ocean, in which lived at least some characteristically Pacific ammonite genera,
and that periodically it overspread the continental margins. In the neighbourhood of
Indonesia this ocean was in free communication with the Tethys. In both early and late
Jurassic times (Hettangian, Sinemurian and Tithonian) there was certainly free migration
along and out of the Tethys, from the Himalayas through Indonesia, New Guinea and
New Caledonia to New Zealand (Papuan geosyncline), as shown by ammonite faunas
now known from all these places. Since, however, typical European Lower Lias genera
such as Psiloceras, Schlotheimia, Artetites and Arnioceras, with their relatives, occur not only
throughout the Tethyan-Papuan geosyncline but also all down the west side of both the
Americas, it is to be inferred that these genera were as indigenous in the Pacific Ocean as
in Europe, and were world-wide.

The fact that all these known occurrences are on the sites of geosynclines led Haug
(1900, 1910) to identify the geosynclines with waterways and to infer land almost every-
where else; but the coincidence of known occurrences with geosynclines is due to the
compression and upheaval of the geosynclines above sea-level in relatively recent geological
times, and it is illogical to suppose that regions outside them which are under oceanic water
to-day could not have been also under water in the Jurassic.

An equally fantastic notion, that the Liassic ammonites of western North America and
Japan lived in a landlocked inland sea covering a small part of the north Pacific only, as
shown on J. W. Gregoryâ€™s map in his Presidential Address to the Geological Society (1930,
p. xci), is negatived by the identity at specific level between the Lower Lias ammonites of
western Canada, Europe and Peru, and at least at generic level between those of the
Americas, Indonesia, New Caledonia and New Zealand.
