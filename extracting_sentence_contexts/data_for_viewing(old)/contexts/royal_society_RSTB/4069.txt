ventricular surface this wave rapidly finds its way into the Purkinje system. It is also evident


EXCITATORY PROCESS IN THE DOG’S HEART. 211

Our estimate of conduction rates in the three tissues of the heart which are
concerned may be stated as follows :—

Purkinje tissue . . . . . 38000-5000 mm. per sec.
Auricular muscle. . . . . 1000 mm. per sec,
Ventricular muscle . . . . 300-500 mm. per sec.

In harmony with these estimates is the fact that by far the highest glycogen
content of the heart is to be found in Purkinje tissue (NaGAyo) while auricular
muscle is stated by BerBLInGER* to be more heavily laden than ventricular. The
functional significance of these differences in the power of conduction will be alluded
to a little later.

THe EnpocarpraAt LINING.

Observations upon the endocardial surface of the ventricle present many natural
difficulties. We have employed many different forms of electrode; the most satis-
factory results are obtained with single and rigid contacts of glass tubing curved to
suit the point or points examined. The glass tube has a broad outlet filled by a
kaolin plug; the shaft of the tube contains copper sulphate and a copper wire, the
