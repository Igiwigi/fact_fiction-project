membrane with average nanotube diameter of 16 nm. This result is representative for all membranes and conditions tested. : S
Sudden decreases in total resistance are clearly linked to current shocks, which disrupt the concentration polarization layer 1

build-up, which is then resumed until the next current shock. The compounded error of the resistance values is estimated at
25%. (Online version in colour.)

(d) Numerical analysis

As the experimental conditions in the present work fall close to or within the region of EDL
overlap, the simplified solution for F=1 reported in equation (1.11) cannot be applied to the
present case and, in fact, does not accurately reflect experimental data. Therefore, equation (1.4)
has to be used, with a calculated solution for F. This was done considering the full, nonlinear
P-B equation (1.6) and the linearized one equation (1.7).
