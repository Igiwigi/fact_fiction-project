For those strongly opposed to geoengineering,
the moral hazard argument presents another piece of evidence confirming their views; for
those sceptical about climate change, the moral ‘hazard’ of reducing mitigation is in fact not a
hazard at all. In addition, it is clear that the counter moral hazard argument could have been constructed
differently. In this study, the argument states that, although geoengineering may distract from
current policies, this is not in fact a moral hazard. An alternative—and arguably just as plausible—
counter-argument would be that, although reducing current commitments on mitigation would
be a negative outcome, geoengineering will not in fact cause this to happen. In other words,
geoengineering will coexist with existing policies, in the same way that adaptation now coexists
with mitigation.
