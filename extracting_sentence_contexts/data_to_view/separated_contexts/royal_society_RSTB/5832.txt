Meanwhile the lower mesoderm sheet undoubtedly stretches
so that not only does it cover the whole upper surface of the esophagus exposed anteriorly
to the first septum and the upper surface of the horizontal septum on each side, but it is
tucked into the lateral triangular cavities of the trunk, where the ectoderm (¢.u.) is
internally exposed. It forms a lining (A.s.e.) to this ectoderm and also covers (h.s.8.)
the anterior surface of the first septum, with which it is to fuse indistinguishably. It
is interesting to recall at this point the fact mentioned on p. 280, and illustrated in
text-fig. 29, that in the later larva the mesoderm of the head shows a definite posteriorly
directed projection (p.p.) on each side. This is the part of the mesoderm that stretches
to fill the triangular trunk cavities in the manner just described. The formation of certain blood vessels of the head region takes place at metamor-
phosis, and is illustrated in fig. 16, Plate 32, where their distribution is shown.
