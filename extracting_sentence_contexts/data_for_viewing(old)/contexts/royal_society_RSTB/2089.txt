the hygroscope for absolute, but for comparative or relative readings.

Wind.—It is important that observations of any accuracy should be made in a
place free from air-currents. In a wind, the air on the surface of the leaf is so rapidly
renewed that the index of the hygroscope cannot react fairly. If the stomata are

widely open, a reading can be obtained out of doors, but it cannot be an accurate one.
SranL* points out that my hygroscopic index sinks to zero when the leaf on which
it rests is fanned ; he ingeniously makes use of the fact in his discussion on Desmodium
gyrans, in which he supposes the shaking of the terminal leaflets by the gyrating ones
renews the air on the surface and leads to increased transpiration. It will be seen,
therefore, that there is here a serious possibility of misinterpretation, since in a fanned
leaf the conditions of increased transpiration accompany a fall in the index. This
error is easily avoided if readings are not taken in a strong draught of air.

Some questions of manipulation may find a place here. It is generally easy to see
aivhen the index has approximately come to rest, but it is safer to leave the hygro-
‘geope on for a given time. I generally take readings after 10 to 20 seconds. As
Hon as the reading has been taken the hygroscope must be removed until the neat
Bbservation is made.
