This led them to suggest in 1900 the possibility that the
metallic vapour was charged and carried the electric current, but the effect was not
sufficiently marked in their photographs to enable them to make any definite assertion
in this respect. ScHENoK later, in 1901,* showed that the streamers could not be the
actual carriers of the current, as they do not proceed more than a short distance
across the spark gap before the electrical discharge becomes reversed. My photographs are therefore important, as the fact that the luminous vapour
actually comes back towards the pole when the electric field of the spark reverses its
direction forms so much definite evidence that the particles of which it is composed
must be charged. This suggests that modifications may be called for in our view of
the nature of the streamers. While one view of their constitution is that they are due
to purely thermal diffusion and incandescence of the vapour of the electrode metal,
another one possible is that they are mainly produced by the luminescence of charged
atoms suddenly torn off from the surface of the electrode, and propelled towards the
centre of the spark gap by the intense electric field of the spark ; and the photographs
support the second of these conceptions.
