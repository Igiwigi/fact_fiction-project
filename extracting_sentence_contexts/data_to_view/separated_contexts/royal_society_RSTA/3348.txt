On the other
hand, the observed increase of rigidity with time may be merely the result of a slow
annealing and due to the easing of the crystalline structure from contraction stresses. In the present case of quartz fibres such small “ time effect” as exists, is, I think,
undoubtedly due to a gradual annealing, and in the case of metal wires it is probably
due in part to each of the causes mentioned above. Tt is a curious fact that, although a quartz fibre is made quite brittle and useless
for most practical purposes by being heated to about 500° C., yet its rigidity at the
ordinary temperature of the laboratory is increased so long as it is not heated
above 760° C.

Since the rigidity of quartz fibres is much more constant than the rigidity of any
metal wires, and as also the period and the logarithmic decrement of the torsional
vibrations are independent of the amplitude of oscillation so long as this is small, it
appears that quartz fibres are by far the best material to use for suspensions in all
forms of torsion apparatus where accuracy is required. In conclusion, I wish to express my sincere thanks to Professors J. H. Poynrrne
and J. J. Tomson for their kind encouragement and valuable advice throughout the
course of these experiments.
