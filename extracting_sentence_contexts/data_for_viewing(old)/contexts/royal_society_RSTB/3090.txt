+ A very small dose, ¢.g., 1 ¢.c. of a 1-per-cent. extract, does not usually produce immunity, and the

repetition of the dose is followed by a rise in blood-pressure, but less than that caused by the first dose.

the depressor substance is overpowered by the pressor, while with subsequent
injections these conditions are generally reversed, although the depression which is
the most marked phenomenon of the second and subsequent doses may be succeeded
by a slight and gradual rise of pressure. The facts relating to the heart and blood-
vessels recorded by the before-mentioned observers have been also observed in our
experiments. We have not found the cardiac inhibition to be a constant phenomenon ;*
sometimes it is absent altogether with the doses of pituitary which we have employed,
and often it is so slight as almost to escape observation. Most commonly it does not
come on at the same moment as the rise in blood-pressure, but its advent may
be delayed for some seconds or even for a minute or more ; it is frequently preceded
by a period of cardiac acceleration. In all these respects the effect of the active
substance or substances of pituitary extract has a certain resemblance to that of
suprarenal extract. Nevertheless the substances are undoubtedly different, for with
pituitary extract both the vascular contraction and the cardiac inhibition are much
more prolonged, and the latter is seen even after section of the vagi; moreover,
the immunity to a repeated dose is quite characteristic of pituitary. Nor is
