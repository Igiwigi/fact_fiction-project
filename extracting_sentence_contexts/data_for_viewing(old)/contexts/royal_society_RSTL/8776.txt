the refraction thus caused will be to increase the effect of the wind on sound moving
against it, and to diminish that on the sound moving with it. But when the diminu-
tion of temperature is downwards, as it was at Villejuif and MontIhery, and as it always
is near the earth on a clear dewy night, it will directly diminish the effect on sound
moving against the wind, and increase it on the sound moving with the wind. That is
to say it will prevent the wind lifting the sound in one direction and will aid it in
bringing it down in the other. 'Thus it will prolong the distance to which sound can
be heard against the wind, and diminish that at which it can be heard with the wind
(when the surface is rough); and when the downward diminution of temperature bears
a certain relation to the strength of the wind, it is easy to see that it may neutralize or
even reverse its effect.

These facts, all taken together, appear to me to afford a satisfactory explanation of the
phenomenon observed by AraGo. There was, however, one other phenomenon observed
during the same experiments on which I will venture a word in explanation.

The reports of the guns at Montlhery as heard at that station were attended with
prolonged echoes, but it was not so with those at Villejuif. This phenomenon was not
explained by the experimenters; but I think it admits of a simple explanation. 'The
ground 8urrounding Villejuif towards Montlhery is very flat with not a tree upon it for
miles, and being all arable would at that time of the year be .covered with crops.
Around Montlhe6ry the country is hilly, some of the hills rising 100 feet above
Montlhery itself ; their sides are in many places precipitous, and are largely covered
with trees. From the flat country around Villejuif there would arise no echoes, but
from the hills and trees aronnd Montlhery it is quite certain that there must arise very
