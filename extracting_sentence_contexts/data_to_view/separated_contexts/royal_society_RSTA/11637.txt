274 PROF. K. PEARSON ON THE MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF EVOLUTION,

frustrated by the obvious fact that size of adult families does not follow any approach
a normal distribution, Thus, I find in 205 adult families the following frequency :—

This Table shows the number of those families in which (1) the number of sons and _
daughters, (2) the number of sons only, (3) the number of daughters only correspond,
with the title in the top line. Now, although, as I propose to show later, the quantity, = S («y)/(no,o3), is really
a significant characteristic of correlation, just as 0, and oy are significant for variation
even in the case of skew frequency, still there is little to be gained by working it out
in this particular case, where, the statistics being insufficient to accurately determine
the skew law of frequency, we shall not be able to find what we want—the law of
regression. *

But several points as to paternal reproductivity may be learnt from these families. In the first place, of the 25 families with no sons, the father in 5 cases only was below
the mean, in 20 cases above the mean height.
