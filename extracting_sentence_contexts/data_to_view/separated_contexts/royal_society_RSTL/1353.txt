The hydatid, from its apparent want of muscles, and other
parts which generally .constitute. an‚Äù animal, was for a long
while denied its place in the animal world, and considered as
the production of disease ; we are, however, at present in pos-
session of a sufficient number. of facts, to ascertain, not only
that it is an animal, but that it belongs to. a- genus of which
there are several different species. Hydatids are found to exist in the bodies of many quadru-
peds, and often in the human ; the particular parts most fa-
vourable to their support appear to be the liver, kidneys, and
brain, although they are sometimes detected in other situations.
