To this end,
we first discuss a potential origin of GW in a pre-RVM inflationary epoch, in which, as we shall
argue below, stiff axion matter is present.

(a) Stiffaxion matter and origin of primordial gravitational waves

In the absence of CP violating (e.g. GW) perturbations of the FLRW metric, the anomalous
couplings of the KR axion with the gravitational Chern-Simons terms in the action (2.8) are
absent. If one assumes that such a gravitational action describes the space-time dynamics in
the early Universe, then, in view of the fact that the KR axion in the theory has no potential,
as a consequence of its implementation as a Lagrange multiplier of the Bianchi constraint (2.5),
one observes that the KR axion behaves as a stiff matter in this cosmological setting, i.e. a fluid
with equation of state w = +1, assuming homogeneity and isotropy in the Universe. We note at
this point that stiff matter dominance was assumed to characterize the early Universe also in the
model of [79], but in that model stiff matter consisted of baryons and not axions as in our case. From a generic point of view, stiff matter eras have also been considered in cosmology in the work
of [80], but from a rather different perspective than ours.
