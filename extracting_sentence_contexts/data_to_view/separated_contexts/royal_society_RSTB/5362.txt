was centred on the part played by the intervertebral disc, rather than that played by the
notochord. It was generally held that the nucleus pulposus arises by liquefaction of
the tissue of the disc and that the notochord may or may not contribute to its formation. Gapow (1895) appreciated the confusion and maintained that either such liquefaction
occurs or that the notochordal expansion continues to grow, or that both these facts hold
good. WuU..LIAMs (1908) gave what is probably the most correct account and main-
tained that the notochord loses its cellular nature and becomes syncytial, vacuoles
filled with a mucin-like substance appearing in its cytoplasm. Later, the notochordal
tissue comes to resemble cartilage, and persists in the region of the intervertebral disc
as the nucleus pulposus.
