Maydis, and others. Now, if we supposed the spore to germinate in this manner while still attached to the
mycelium inside the plant, we should have something very like what happens in the
Fungus I have described. In fact, I regard the swollen parts of the mycelium which
give rise to the gemmules as the homologues of the spores proper (i.e., resting-spores)
in the ordinary Ustilagines. Anyone who compares the development of the spores
in those Ustilaginese which have been sufficiently studiedÂ§ cannot fail to notice the
remarkable similarity to the development of the branches which bud off the gemmules
in this Fungus. If, for any reason, the future resting-spore of an Ustilago began to
put forth buds (gemmules) before it developed its thick coats, we should have the
very process I have been describing.
