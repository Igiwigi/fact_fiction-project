We thus propose that there may exist a direct and rapidly responding mechanism of
protein regulation at the translational level.

2. Model

Figure 1 illustrates the two main features of our translation model, namely (i) ribosome traffic
along mRNAs and (ii) the cycle of aminoacylation and usage of tRNAs. We also include explicitly
the fact that ribosomes extend over several codons and cannot overlap. We now describe each of
the aspects of the model in turn.

(a) Ribosome traffic

We derive a system of reaction rate equations for ribosome traffic on mRNAs by adapting a
model of translation in bacteria [21]. We consider explicitly that mRNAs are precise sequences
of different codons.
