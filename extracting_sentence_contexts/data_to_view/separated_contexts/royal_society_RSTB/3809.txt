The characteristic fossils are Nautilus danicus and certain Gasteropods which are
characteristic of the Tertiary. This disappearance of the Ammonites, which have
previously characterised the Secondary deposits, and the appearance of the precursors
of the Tertiary Gasteropods have induced some authors to place these beds in the
Eocene. It will be seen by a reference to the zonal table (pp. 164, 165), that the
Asteroids of the Danian are very closely related to those of the Upper Senonian and,
in fact, belong to groups of forms which are as characteristically secondary as the
Ammonites, and, like them, do not proceed upwards into Tertiary beds. Recent
researches by Dr. BriinnicH NretsEn (35), based upon a study of the Brachiopoda,
have disclosed that the Danian chalk can be divided into three horizons: (1) The
* older” Bryozoa-chalk, (2) the ‘ newer” Bryozoa-chalk, and (3) the Crania-chalk.
