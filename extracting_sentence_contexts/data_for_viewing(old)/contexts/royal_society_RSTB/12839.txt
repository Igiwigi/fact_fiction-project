ing is extended one could argue that, rather than mutants with
defective plastids showing ‘repression’ of PhANG expression,
they never reach the phase in which the activation of such
genes occurs.

Such ‘delay and allow time to correct’ response could
explain the widespread nature of virescent phenotypes,
caused by defects in metabolism [9], in protein homeostasis
[7,8], or even in genome stability [43]. It does not suffice to
enable successful chloroplast biogenesis under some con-
ditions (e.g. growth on norflurazon), but it does in others
(e.g. the mutations here discussed). While GUN1 may not be
entirely responsible for the response, the fact that its loss con-
verts a virescent phenotype into a lethal one also highlights
the adaptive significance of retrograde communication (and
of its anterograde follow-up). Loss of TOC159, a component
of the plastid protein outer translocon, or of PRPL11, a plastid
ribosomal protein, have been also observed to result in
synthetic lethality when combined with the loss of GUN1
[13,55]. Such observations demonstrate not just the fascinat-
ing, intriguing nature of the pathways of interorganellar
communication, but also their fitness value.
