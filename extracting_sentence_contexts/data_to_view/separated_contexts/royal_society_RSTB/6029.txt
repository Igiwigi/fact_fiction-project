Now, this is the region in which one would expect to find a representative of the
basal connexion (articulation or fusion) which is one of the most constant features
of the attachment of the pterygo-quadrate to the brain-case throughout the verte-
brate series. Here again, it is possible to make a rigid definition: the basal

connexion is formed by the contact of the basal process of the pterygo-quadrate
with the basitrabecular process of the neurocranium, in such a manner as to be
antero-dorsal to the palatine nerve, antero-ventral to the orbital artery, and ventral
to the vena capitis lateralis and orbital sinus. In Callorhynchus, therefore, the fusion
of the pterygo-quadrate with the brain-case immediately in front of the foramen
through which the palatine nerve passes answers exactly to the definition of a basal
connexion, fig. 9, and the fact that the orbital artery runs up through the same
foramen as that which allows the palatine nerve to run down is exactly paralleled
in Lepidosteus and Salmo (pr BrER, 1926, a). As to the relative participation of basal
process (of the pterygo-quadrate) and basitrabecular process (of the neurocranium)
little can be said, Judging from the condition in Selachii, where the basitrabecular
