plants. The radiating arrangement of these vessels suggests, as the quotation already

made from the writings of M. BRONGNIART points out, an exogenous mode of growth,

a conclusion fully borne out by facts yet to be mentioned ; small cells arranged in single

or double vertical rows pass outwards, like medullary rays, between these vessels. 'The

tisswe immediately surrounding the ligneous zone has almost always disappeared from
the specimens of this plant, its place being represented by an almost vacant space; but
there are indications, as Mr. CARRUTHERS has correctly pointed out, that it has been a
delicate form of parenchyma. In the present example almost, every trace has disap-
peared save a narrow ring (9) of disorganized carbonaceous matter at, some little distance
from the ligneous zone. The space within this tissue represents the innermost portion
of what I regard as the cortical layer. Scattered through this vacant space, as well as
the more external one, we find in the transverse sections small bundles of minute scala-
riform vessels (fig. 1, m) fringed round with delicate parenchyma, and exhibiting a
