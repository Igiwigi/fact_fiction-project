The tangents in the glassy and the liquid state (figure 6b) are used to determine the glass
transition. The glass transition temperatures, Tg, and the temperatures associated with the first
maxima of the crystallization peak, T,, are listed in table 1. The glass transition temperature is
determined as the limiting fictive temperature [14,15].

The data shows that the previously dried sample absorbs water from the atmosphere during
the preparation procedure. This water can be removed during a relatively short annealing at
250°C. The water is widely removed after annealing of 10 min. Longer annealing has practically
no effect on the glass transition and crystallization.

The high temperature required for sample dehydration indicates that the water in ACMC is
structurally bound. The remaining water strongly affects the Tg and consequently the molecular
mobility in ACMC. This may be the origin of differences in crystallization kinetics.
