As to whether such fibroblastic forms should be regarded as true fibroblasts is mainly a
question of nomenclature. Certainly on an embryological basis the fibroblastic forms
derived from the alveolar epithelial cells can hardly be regarded as true fibroblasts in
view of the different germ layers concerned in their formation.

(6) COMMENTARY ON THE FOREGOING OBSERVATIONS,

(i) The Stimulus to Epithelial Hypertrophy.—-A clear cut instance of this is seen in that
proliferation of the bronchial epithelium, which results in the bounding of the cut edges
of the implant by the cicatricial epithelium. What is the stimulus which causes the
bronchial epithelium, devoid, in the adult, of mitoses, to evolve in such a manner ? The
fact that the cicatricial epithelium is formed as readily around adult as foetal implants
suggests that no mysterious, endogenous factors peculiar to the growing bronchial
epithelium of the foetus can be invoked. The factor producing the hypertrophy of the
bronchial epithelium seems to be simply the act of cutting the bronchus. In the effort
to restore epithelial continuity the cells grow out from the cut end and invest the
implant. As to why the epithelium of a cut bronchus in a tissue culture should be
suddenly stimulated to grow, is as inexplicable as nerve, or, indeed, epithelial or any
other form of regeneration. We are totally ignorant, as recently pointed out by
SHERRINGTON (38), of the physico-chemical repercussion on the cells in all such instances.
We only know that damaged tissues tend to repair themselves.

(ii) Detachment of the Alveolar Epithelial Cells —Not only the epithelium of the bronchi
becomes hyperactive in vitro, but that of the alveoli exhibits the phenomena of detach-
