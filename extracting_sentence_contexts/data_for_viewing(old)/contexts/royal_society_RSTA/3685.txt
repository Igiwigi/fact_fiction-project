mantle is serpentinized [39], considerable uncertainty associated with updip transport and arc
magmatism makes it difficult to estimate the net flux of subducted water.

Many previous studies on net water flux have suggested that too high net flux would cause
too large a change in the global sea level to be consistent with observations. Ito et al. [36] estimated
the net water flux into the mantle as 1.2 — 11 x 10‘ gyr™!, but they felt that the higher rates in
this range were geologically unrealistic and suggested that the rate of 1 — 3 x 10’ g yr~! might be
acceptable, if it were only for periods of 100 Myr or so. Similarly, a more recent study [40] suggests
that the long-term net water influx should be less than 1 x 10! g yr“! to keep the sea-level change
below 100m over the Phanerozoic. The consideration of sea level in these studies, however,
usually assumes that the present-day hypsometry also applies to the past. This assumption is
difficult to justify because the surface topography of the Earth has gradually been modified
by the thermal and chemical evolution of its interior. In fact, substantial water influx is possible
without causing any change in the sea level, as shown in the next section.

3. The secular evolution of water budget and the emergence of continents

(a) Eustasy and continental freeboard

After the rise of atmospheric oxygen at approximately 2.4 Ga, hydrogen escape into space became
trivial [41], and the amount of surface water has been subject to a dynamic balance between
volcanic degassing and subduction. There is no a priori need for the volume of water in the oceans
to stay constant, and the distribution of water among different reservoirs could also change. Even
if the volume of water in the oceans remained the same, the Earth’s hypsometry is time-dependent
because of continental growth and the secular cooling of the mantle, and the area of oceans (or
