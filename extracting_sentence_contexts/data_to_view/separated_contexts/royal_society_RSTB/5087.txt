Amphipmous cuchia is the so-called Cuchia “eel” of India. It is a member of the
order Symbranchii, and is devoid of an air-bladder and of pectoral fins, and both
opercular openings are united so as to form a single crescentic mid-ventral aperture. Its skin is kept moist by the secretion of abundant unicellular glands ; it appears
to be naked, but close inspection reveals the fact that there are in it a multitude of
minute cycloid scales. It spends the greater part of its life out of water, wriggling
along the muddy banks of rivers and ponds ; it is also found in grassy meadows and in
muddy places among the roots of bushes. When the dry season approaches it burrows
in the banks of streams, and here male and female pass the summer together in the same
burrow.
