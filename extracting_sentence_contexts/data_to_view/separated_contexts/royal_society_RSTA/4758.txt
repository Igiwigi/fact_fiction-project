In default of the additional evidence afforded by
polishing, they probably represent lines of minimum compactness, along which the
etching is deeper, or even, according to Commander Hartmann, lines of tension. * In fact, polishing revealed some cavities which were relatively important in gold
alloyed with bismuth, thallium, or potassium. In this last case, and especially in
the alloy with indium, we observed grey filaments, which were possibly due to the
