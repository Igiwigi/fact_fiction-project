They are possibly also viscero-inhibitory. The only spinal nerves which come into direct communication with the sympathetic
ganglia are the vasomotor fibres. In fact, so convinced is GASKELL of this that he
maintains that “this chain might, therefore, be most appropriately called the chain
of vasomotor ganglia, instead of the present meaningless title of main sympathetic
chain.” GaskELL shows, moreover, that these vasomotor fibres are conducted along
the sympathetic chain from their source to their distribution. In the anterior
thoracic region they pass forwards along the chain to be distributed to the carotid
and vertebral arteries, to the arm, and to the heart.
