is freed from dust by plugging up the front end of the permanganate tube with glass
wool, When larger amounts of oxygen were required the above method was found
to be inconvenient, and the electrolysis of concentrated caustic potash was substituted
for it. The oxygen evolved underwent a preliminary drying by passing through
a tube packed with solid potassium hydrate before being admitted, through a glass .

pentoxide. As thus prepared, the gas was liable to contain traces ot hydrogen and
hydrocarbons, but that these were not in suflicient amount to affect the results was
proved by the fact that the oxygen prepared in this way gave the same results as
that obtained from potassium permanganate, which must have been free from
these impurities.

The resistance readings were reduced to platinum temperatures by the method
described by CatLENDAR.* The wire was standardised by determining the melting
point of potassium sulphate by the method previously described. For the parabolic
correction, which is small at all the temperatures considered, Witsonâ€™s{ value of the
constant (A = 151) was assumed. This assumption seems justifiable as the value
referred to the same kind of platinum wire.

It has been pointed out above that it is necessary to get rid of the initial positive
leak from hot platinum before experiments can be made on the part of the leak which
