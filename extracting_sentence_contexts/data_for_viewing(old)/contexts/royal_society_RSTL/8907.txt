And this conclusion is very much strengthened by the additional fact that at
whatever point in a contractile strip which is being progressively elongated by section
the contractile wave becomes blocked, the blocking is sure to take place completely and

Â© exclusively at that point. This fact, it appears to me, can only be properly explained
by supposing that more or less differentiated lines of discharge pervade the contractile
tissue of the gonocalyx, and that the sudden and complete blocking of the contractile
waves which invariably takes place at some determinate point during the progress of
the section is due to the latter having at that point severed some important line of
discharge, which had previously served to convey the influence of the lithocyst to the
undivided parts of the gonocalyx. Nevertheless we must bear in mind that this
deduction is 8upported by no histological evidence, and that it is, moreover, very difficult
to reconcile with the fact that some specimens of Aurelia aurita endure 80 enormous
an amount of the most severe forms of section without suffering loss of physiological
continuity between any of their parts.

The deduction also appears difficult to reconcile with another fact, viz. that in 8ome
cases (which, however, are greatly in the minority) the blocking of contractile waves
in spiral strips admits, after a time, of being overcome, the contractile wayes again passing
from the strip into the gonocalyx as freely as they did before the section reached the
point at which the blocking occurred, and this occasionally two or three times in suc-
cession. I think, however, that there is a theory by which all these paradoxical facts
may be reconciled; and s0 at, the present stage of my inquiries I provisionally accept
the hypothesis of there being present in the locomotor system of Aurelia aurits more
or less definitely integrated lines of discharge. But, in making this statement, it is
