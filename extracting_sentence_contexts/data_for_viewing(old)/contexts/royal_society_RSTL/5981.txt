is a ï¬†mall orifice for a medullary artery at the middle of the back part of the tibia, but
it does not open into any medullary cavity: the bone is cancellous throughout.

The fibula is thickest at its upper end, where it has a trihedral form ; the outer surface
is convex and rough, the inner and hinder surfaces are concave and smooth, meeting at
a sharp interosseous border directed obliquely backward: this border is slightly thickened
and produced at its middle part, where the shaft of the fibula, is compressed: it
augments in thickness and resumes its trihedral shape as it descends, and terminates
in a moderately produced outer malleolus (f) with a very rugged surface, except where ib
articulates with the astragalus.

1n the Mylodon, as well as in the Megalonyx and Scelidotherium, the tibia and fibula
continue separate, a fact affecting the value of the evidence which CUy1ER deduced from
their anchylosed condition in the Megatherium in fayour of its affinities to the Arma-
dillos. to which this structure is peculiar amongst existing Mammals. But, since it is
known only in the order Zruta, it forms an interesting additional proof of the essential
relations of the huge extinct animal under description to that now anomalous group of
Manumals. The tibia of the Mylodon is proportionally shorter and thicker than in the
Megatherium : the outer articular swrface at the upper end is of a subcircular form
and lightly concave: in the Megalonyx it is convex, but in a less degree than in the
Megatherium. The lower articular surface in both Mylodon, Scelidotherium, and Mega-

lonyx, presents the additional facet for the fibula. The hemispheric excavation on the
inner side of the distal articulation is relatively larger in the Mylodon than in the Mega-
therium. This excavation, with the concomitant protuberance of the astragalus, is pecu-
