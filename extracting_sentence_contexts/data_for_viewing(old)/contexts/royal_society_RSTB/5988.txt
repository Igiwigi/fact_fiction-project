This exact correspondence between the setules and the overlying gnathobasic sete
in itself is sufficient evidence on which to label the former comb setules, but there is
additional evidence to be obtained from the sixth limb. Here there are no filter sete
but there is an armature of setules which I have already described. These I maintain
comb the particles off the filter sete of the distal endites of the fifth limb. Now they
are continuous forwards with the semicircles of setules corresponding to the gnathobases,
fig. 9, and if they function as comb setules on the sixth limb, it is safe to deduce that the
same series acts in a similar manner further forwards.

From what I have described so far, the functioning of the limb is closely similar to
that of Chirocephalus. Food is concentrated in the median space by the more distal
filter setze, but that these are not the ultimate filters is indicated by the fact that they
are comparatively wide apart, and further that the setules do not completely span the
gaps between them. The food particles so concentrated are sucked towards the mid-
ventral groove and finally on to the filter sete of the gnathobase. From this position
they are combed off by the comb setules on the walls of the food groove on the next
forward movement of the limb, and are finally blown forwards by the spurts of water
from the inter-limb spaces at the end of the next backstroke. The anteriorly directed
exit grooves from the inter-limb spaces which I have described in Anostraca are here
very well defined by the ridges running from the base of each limb, fig. 9. I thus
maintain that there is a forwardly directed current in the food groove produced in
exactly the same way as by Chirocephalus.
