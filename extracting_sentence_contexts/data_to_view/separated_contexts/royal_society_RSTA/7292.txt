If the present theory is to be held it therefore appears that we must assume that there is
very much more ionization above the maximum of the /, layer than has previously been
supposed. Furthermore, since its density is nowhere greater than that in the /, layer it must
necessarily extend up to very great heights where the density of the atmosphere was

previously thought to be negligible. This constitutes a serious objection to the present theory,
but so many other facts appear to be explicable in terms of it that it seems worth while to
examine how such extra ionization could perhaps arise and to consider its consequences. The simplest way of explaining the presence ofa large number of electrons at great heights
is to suppose that they are produced from ionization of an atmosphere which extends, in
