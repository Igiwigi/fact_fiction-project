In fig. 15, on
Plate 5, we have a section of my only example of this species in which the medullary
vascular cylinder, @, b, is invested by a secondary, exogenously-developed zone, d. The plant just described again illustrates the gradual development of a medulla
within the interior of a vascular bundle where, in the youngest state of the bundle,
no traces of cellular structure could be discovered, but the germs of which must
necessarily have been furnished by the procambium from which, in the youngest
twigs, the entire bundle originated. The probable philosophy of these facts may be
considered after describing some additional undescribed types. Figs. 16, 17, and 18 represent sections of a Lepidodendron from Halifax, for which
T propose the name of ZL. intermedium, and which is remarkably distinct from any
other form with which I am acquainted. Its vasculo-medullary axis, a, b, differs
from all other known Lepidodendra, with one exception.
