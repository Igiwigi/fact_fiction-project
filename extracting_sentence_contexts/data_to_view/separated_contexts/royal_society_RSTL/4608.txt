It then loses its thick and sharply-defined borders, or
double outline, and assumes the appearance of a much finer and more delicate fibre. When partially broken by traction, the two extremities are connected often by one of
its borders only, and sometimes only by the axis cylinder, which has then the appear-
ance of an almost imperceptible, shadowy line; in the unbroken portion of the fibre,
however, the axis cylinder appears perfectly pellucid. The following summary of the principal facts described in this paper may perhaps
be found useful. That the posterior grey substance, at the lower extremity, and in the dorsal region,
of the spinal chord, consists only of a single mass ; and that the sbstantia gelatinosa
there extends uninterraptedly across from one side to the other. That the nerve-fibres of the grey substance, including those of the subsfantia gela-
tinosa, are not grey fibres bearing nuclei, like those of the sympathetic, but fine
tubules.
