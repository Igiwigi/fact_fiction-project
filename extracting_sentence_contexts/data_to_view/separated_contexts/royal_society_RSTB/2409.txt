The protection of the receptacle is carried out
partly by the margin of the pinnule which curves over the sorus, forming what is
sometimes called the “ false indusium”; partly by the true indusium, which arises by
upgrowth of superficial cells within the margin, at the base of the young receptacle ;
it precedes the sporangia. As no statement of the order of succession of the latter
has been made to my knowledge, I have looked into the matter. CAMPBELL
describes} “ the development of sporangia beginning very early, and new ones forming
up to the time that the leaf is full grown,” but he does not give the facts we require. Observations were made on O, sensibilis, with the result that the basipetal order of
succession was demonstrated. The receptacle is elongated as in Cyathea, and the
sporangia appear first at the apex of it, followed in quick succession by those below.
