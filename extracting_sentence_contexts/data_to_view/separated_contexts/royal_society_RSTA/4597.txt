The 400 waveforms
were analysed by computer to classify the length of the transient before Helmholtz motion was
established, and this transient length is coded in the colour scale of figure 4a. The results show a trace of Guettler’s predicted wedge-shaped region, but the data are
‘speckly’: the transient length varies from pixel to pixel, and even within the wedge there are
some black pixels that did not produce Helmholtz motion at all but a different regime of nonlinear
oscillation. In fact, the experiment gives a hint of sensitive dependence: even with the computer-
controlled bowing machine, repeating the parameter space scan does not produce identical results
but a different pattern of speckles. However, the underlying wedge-shaped region within which Helmholtz motion is produced,
at least sometimes, persists. The task of theoretical modelling is to produce a set of simulations
capable of reproducing this behaviour with sufficient fidelity that the model might be trusted to
shed light on how the details of the pattern might be affected by changes to the string, or the
instrument body behaviour, or some other musically relevant aspect.
