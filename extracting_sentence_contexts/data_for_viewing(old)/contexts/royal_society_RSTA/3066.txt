The inverse correlation between both the DMS(P)t pool and the DMSPp pool (data not shown)
versus salinity (R? of 0.685 and 0.662, respectively) provides further supporting evidence for the
impact of sea-ice melt on the biogeochemical composition of the upper water column (figure 8d).
Sea-ice melt can also lead to increased DMSP through stabilization of the upper mixed layer and
a subsequent increase in primary production as a result of favourable light conditions. Growth


conditions did have a positive control on DMSP production (table 3), but were of much less
importance than the community composition and total organic biomass, both of which were
influenced strongly by sea-ice melt. On the contrary, phytoplankton use DMSP as an osmolyte,
and hence reduced concentrations are to be expected when algae have to adapt to lower salinities
in an ice melt event. The fact that the opposite is shown in the present study indicates the release
of ice-associated algae with high concentrations of DMSP as the primary driver of the changes in
DMSP that we observe. While it could be expected that the release of intracellular DMSP—and
conversion to DMS—would increase upon ice melt as ice algae are introduced to relatively fresh
melt water, there was no correlation between DMS(P)d and salinity in the present study.

A more detailed investigation of the phytoplankton-pigment fingerprint also showed a
correlation between DMS(P)t and DMS(P)d with zeaxanthin (data not shown). This suggests
a contribution of dinoflagellates to both the production and conversion of DMSP, although
the contribution of this group to total Chl a was minor. Both haptophytes and dinoflagellates
are well known for their extremely high intracellular DMSP concentrations and expression of
enzymes that convert DMSP to DMS [23,50]. The presence of algal DMSP-lyases can result in high
fractional DMS production from dissolved DMSP, whereas bacterial conversion of DMSPd often
