most advantageous to the people. This is reflected in the
Variability Selection Hypothesis. The producers of the lithic
artefacts types (i) heavy-duty core tools (mostly bifacial arte-
facts), and (ii) microliths in West-Central Africa exploited a
wide variety of environments and resources in the Pleisto-
cene of West-Central Africa. However, certain human
behaviours, exhibited in the form of technological modifi-
cation as an adaptation strategy, do not seem to have been
determined or controlled by the prevailing climatic (and veg-
etation) changes. Examples include the persistence of lithic
tools characteristic of the MSA from the Pleistocene into the
Holocene in Senegal and Central Africa despite contrasting
climatic conditions during the two periods. Such adaptation
strategy would only have been possible because of the inno-
vation and behavioural flexibility of humans which aided
them to cope with the fluctuating climatic and environmental
