the characteristics of sensibility. If a charged Leyden jar* (* On Stratified Di

IV.,” Proceedings of the Royal Society, March 22, 1877) be employed with a sitable
tube, the instantaneous discharge that passes through the tube on the Jar being
connected with it will show all the symptoms of zensitiveness during its passage
through the tube.

This direct evidence of the connexion between intermittence of discharge and the
gensitive state will, we believe, derive further support from the accordance of the
various phenomena with the theory of the sensitive state which will be deyeloped in
the course of this paper, and which rests upon the hypothesis that the sensitive state
is due to such an intermittence—a hypothesis which the authors of this paper venture
to hope is sufficiently demonstrated by the experimental facts already stated.

In conelusion, the authors of this paper desire it to be understood that, in claiming

intermittence as an essential of the sensitive discharge, they do not intend to exclude
all ideas of intermittence from the non-sensitive discharge. The experiments of Sir
W. Grove,+ Mr. De La Rug, and others, have shown almost to demonstration that
there is intermittence in the mos stable and non-sensitive discharges. But 8nch
intermittence musb be of an order almost incomparably higher than that of which we
are peaking. 'Though sensitiveness has been found to co-exist with intermittence ab
the highest speeds attainable by the mechanical or chemical means above referred to,
and even in many cases to increase with the rapidity of intermittence, it is by no
means necessary that it should continue to do 80 when this rapidity is increased, say,
