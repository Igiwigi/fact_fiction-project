The diagram of Cunninghamia
(text-fig. 16, B), shows a similar condition, though the branch strand is relatively
larger than in the fossil. In the living plant three strands run off in this manner, one
to each ovule, but in many of the sections one strand only is cut in this position, as
they come off at slightly different levels. Consequently the fact that only one branch
strand has been observed in the fossil cone has no weight in favour of the view that
there might have been only one seed to each scale. :

Between the bundles which form a series across the distal end of the scale are
groups of connecting transfusion tissue (see Phot. 28, Plate 5, Â¢.), which both as to
size, form, and position are paralleled in Cunninghamia. These cells in the fossil
show round, apparently bordered, pits, in some cases, and in others a large irregu-
larly meshed network thickening (see Phot. 31, Plate 5). In all the bundles there is
almost no trace of phloem, though there are a few soft crushed cells behind a
cambium-like zone that indicate that at least a few such cells existed.
