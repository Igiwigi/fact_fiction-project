To
complete the solution, it is necessary to compare the value obtained as above, with the
assumed value of the irrational function, which will lead to equations for the determina-
tion of the 2 unknown quantities.

26. As an illustration, consider the given matrix

M=( a, )
| c, d |
and let it be required to find the matrix L=x/M. In this case M satisfies the equation
M*—(a+d)M+ad—be=0;

L=(«,p)
| v3 |
T/—(a+3)L+a—By=0;
and from these two equations, and the rationalized equation L*=M, it should be possible

to express L in the form of a linear function of M: in fact, putting in the last equation
for I its value (=M), we find at once

L=;[M+(—Þ)}

which is the required expression, involving as it should do the coefficients «+5, «5—y
of the equation in L. There is no difficulty in completing the solution ; write for short-
ness «+3=X, &z—py=Y, then we have

ud &, [3 J= a+Y db NJ

and in like manner if

then I satisfies the equation

and consequently forming the values of «+3 and &>—Py,

a+d+2Y

b OE.
+Y)(4+YL)—b
EE DEhD—bs

and putting als» a+d=P, ad—bc=Q, we find without difficulty

X=vVP+24/Q,

Y=/Q,
and the values of «, B, y, 3 are consequently known. The sign of Q is the same in
both formulz, and there are consequently in all four solutions, that is, the radical y/M

has four values.
