enters into the exploring coil, and for the other to use a known bar of soft iron. We
have then to deduct from 471c the magnetising force required to magnetise the bar of
soft, iron to the state observed, and to distribute the remainder over the shorter length

of sample examined. The results obtained in this way are subject to a greater error,

\ the 8oft iron bar to the body of the block. A small correction is required, important
in the case of bodies but slightly magnetic, for the fact that the area of the exploring
- coil is greater than the area of the bars tested. Thus the induction meazured by the
Â© exploring coil is not only that in the sample, but something also in the air around the
| sample. The amount of this was tested by substituting for a sample of iron or steel a
bar of copper, and afterwards a rod of wood, and it was found in both cages that the
| induetion B was 370 when the force H was 230. The correction is in all cases small,
| but it has been applied in the column giving the maximum induction, as it materially
\ affects the result when the sample contains much manganese, and is consequently very
< little magnetic.
S The resistances were determined by the aid of a differential galvanometer, the
connections being made as shown in the accompanying diagram, fig. 3. The additional
= resistance R was adjusted until the balance was obtained. The resistances actually
i measured are, some of them, as low as 575g of an ohm, they must not therefore be
