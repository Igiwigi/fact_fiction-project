of hippocampal principal cells are place cells [5-9] suggested early on that
location is a major component of the functional output of the hippocampus [2],
but it remained unclear how the space signal was generated. It was clear that
the pattern was not merely extracted from sensory inputs, but the mechanism
that generated the space signal, and its location in the brain, were not apparent.
Following the discovery of place cells, accumulating evidence raised the
possibility that the hippocampal place signal was not generated within the hip-
pocampus itself [10,11]. An obvious place to look for an external origin was the
entorhinal cortex (EC). The EC provides nearly all of the cortical input to the
hippocampus, with the exception of weak components from the pre- and para-
subiculum to the dentate gyrus [12,13], and from postrhinal cortex to CA1 [14],
and a more substantial input from perirhinal cortex to CA1 [15]. The majority of
