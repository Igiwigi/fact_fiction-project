of the same sample and charging it with rather less than the amount of hydrogen
theoretically necessary for converting all the oxygen into water, it was expected that
the platinum black would then be in a position (after pumping off the water formed
at the ordinary temperature) to absorb oxygen directly in the calorimeter. For this

Fig. 3.

purpose 5051 grams of platinum black were placed in the experimental tube, A,
(fig. 3) which was then exhausted. It was estimated that this quantity of platinum
black contained 22°20 cub. centims. of oxygen, for the complete conversion of which
into water 44°4 cub. centims. of hydrogen would be necessary.

As a matter of fact, only 39°05 cub. centims. of hydrogen were admitted from the
gas burette, B. The apparatus was then allowed to stand for a few hours, when the
tap, C, communicating with the pump was opened, Practically all the hydrogen
admitted was found to be absorbed, for on putting the pump in action only about
a quarter of a cub. centim. of gas was extracted. On surrounding the experimental
tube, A, with a copper sheath and applying a Bunsen burner, 10°75 cub. centims.
of gas were pumped off, which on examination was found to consist of :—
