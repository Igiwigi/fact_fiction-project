These results do not agree with the view of physiology, according to which the
generative power should remain for some time at the same height. But we ought
not te lose sight of the fact that the legitimate fertility is to be regarded as the
resultant of two different forces. The number of children born in a family is, in fact,
not a consequence of the physiological power only, but also of the wish to have
offspring. In a family where children already exist, the wish for the increase of them
is weaker and will be weaker, the greater the number of offspring. Now as the number
of children increases with advancing age, the force of the moral factor increases also
with the age. Thus passing from younger couples to older ones, we pass at the same
time from small to large families, that is from those where the wish for offspring is
greater to those in which it is less, where consequently the influence of the moral
factor is preponderant over the physiological one. It is to this preponderance that
we must attribute the fact that the probability of birth diminishes so rapidly and so
regularly with the advancing age.

I shall prove in the following, statistically, that by eliminating the influence of the
moral factor, we find fertility distributed in a much more uniform manner over life,
But let us first of all recognize the course which the curve follows under the
influence of both factors. Though this curve does not represent the course of natural
law, it furnishes notwithstanding a picture of the actual state of legitimate fertility,
and thus of the chief condition of the multiplication of mankind.
