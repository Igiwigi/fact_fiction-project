extensor.

Although further details of the arrangement of the muscles is not required, it
is very necessary to draw attention to certain consequences of their actions. In
studying the mechanism by which the movements are brought about at the various
joints, I found that action of the deltoid produced, in addition to the movement at
the shoulder, a passive extension at the elbow joint. This latter might be produced
by the force of gravity, the forearm simply falling as the upper arm is raised ; but on

the other hand, it can be produced owing to the fact that the long head of the triceps
is not long enough to allow the upper arm to be raised to the level of the shoulder
without its pulling on the forearm, and thus producing extension at the elbow. A
more remarkable effect, however, is that which resulted when traction was directly
made on the triceps, for not only was extension at the elbow produced, but extension
of the whole extremity including the digits, all the segments of the limb being thus
brought into a straight line. The way in which this is produced is that the extensor
carpi radialis passes over two joints, viz.: the elbow and wrist, and the muscle is not
long enough to allow the elbow to be fully extended without its pulling on the meta-
carpal bones into which it is inserted, and thus producing extension of the wrist. In
like manner, the extension of the toes is due to the fact that their extensors, which
also pass over more than one joint, are too short to allow extension at the wrist
without their pulling on the bones into which they are inserted.
