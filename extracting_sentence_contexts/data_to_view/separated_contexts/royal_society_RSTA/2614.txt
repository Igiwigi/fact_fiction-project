Magma reservoirs are composed of the magma and mush domains and
have three constituent phases with very different physical properties: melt, fluids and crystals. There can be transitions between the domains as heat and mass are transferred within the system
leading to change in state. Rheology is a critical property and the fact that the viscosity of the
domains and components magmatic systems varies by 25 orders of magnitude, from the very
low viscosity of gas to the very high viscosity of the hot rocks that surround magma reservoirs,
plays a fundamental role in shaping the dynamics of magmatic systems. This viscosity range
helps explain the huge diversity in igneous phenomena and in the rates of igneous processes. It
represents a substantial challenge to any modelling efforts.
