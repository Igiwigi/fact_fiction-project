The only difference between the manuring of the two plots was that,
during those first six years (and the seventh), plot 10 received in addition to the
manures mentioned a quantity of sawdust, which was, however, without effect. Aﬀter
the six years, the two plots continued +0 receive the same manure with the one impor-
tant exception that the potass-salb was now excluded from the mixture applied to
plot 10, and the quantity of the soda-salt was increased. Referring to Part I., p. 345, for a fuller account of the facts, it may be briefly 8tated
that, during the first six years, plot 10 had received about 900 lbs. of potass per acre,
which calculation showed was considerably in excess of that removed in the crops.”
There was, therefore (if there were no loss by drainage, and there would certainly be
but little, if any), an annually accumulating residue of potass. At any rate the result
was that, compared with plot 9, there was but little falling off in the amount of total
produce grown during the firs five or six years after the cessation of the application
of potass; and practically the same amount of nitrogen was taken up as on plob 9 with
the continued supply of potass. Yeb the amount of potass taken up declined eyen in
the first year of the cessation; though it continued much in excess of that taken up
on plot 4-2, where none had been supplied.
