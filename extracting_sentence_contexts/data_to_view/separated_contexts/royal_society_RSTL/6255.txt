But the effect is explained by the experiments of
Mr. BaLyouR STEWART, by which it is proved that the radiative power of heated rock-
salt is extremely feeble. Periodicity can have no influence here, for the ether is capable
of accepting and transmitting impulses of all periods; and the fact that rock-salt
requires more time to cool than alum, simply proves that the molecules of the former
glide through the ether with comparatively small resistance, and thus continue moving
for a longer time ; while those of the latter presenting broad sides to the ether, speedily
communicate to it the motion which we call heat. This power of gliding through still
ether, possessed by the rock-salt molecules, must of course enable the moving ether to
glide round them, and no coincidence of period could, I think, make such a body a
powerful absorber. Many chemists, I believe, are disposed to reject the idea of an atom, and to adhere to
that of equivalent proportions merely.
