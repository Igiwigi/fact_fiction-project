In many cases the pro-embryo continues its course down the canal
formed by the embryo-sac-tube, which formerly brought the female nucleus which
has given rise to it. On the other hand, it frequently bores a new path through the
hitherto uninjured nucellar tissue: Gravity can have little if any influence upon its
direction of growth. Apart from the fact that the female cones, and with them the
ovules, are usually inclined at a considerable angle to the vertical, there are
circumstances in which the pro-embryo will grow directly upwards towards the
micropyle. { This has been observed only in a few cases, in all of which fertilisation
has occurred above the line B (text-figure).
