These authors generated a map of predominant microstructures as a function of solidification
velocity and chemical composition. Coupled eutectic growth ceases at 0.02 ms™!, at higher rate
first band structures and then microsegregation-free structures at the limit of absolute stability
(approx. 0.6ms—!) appear. The band structure is caused by a reverse behaviour of temperature
at the solidification front [21], and the microsegregation-free microstructure appears due to the
fact that the partition coefficient approaches unity [22]. This is also confirmed by theoretical
considerations [23-25]. The transition to partitionless solidification where solute diffusion does
not exert any influence can be defined by the ratio between the solidification front velocity V and
the maximum speed of atomic diffusion in the liquid phase Vp [23]: if V > Vp, the alloy solidifies
as a single metastable phase of the initial composition without solute redistribution [24], and
the eutectic reaction is suppressed [25].
