1. Introduction

Interindividual variability in visual perception has generally been considered to be
little more than noise and, therefore, has rarely been the focus of scientific research
[1]. However, recent studies have shown that it is correlated with functional and
structural aspects of the brain, such as neurotransmitter concentrations and cortical
volumes of brain regions. Thus, comparing the differences between individuals’
visual perceptions can be a rich source for understanding neural mechanisms of
human visual perception. In fact, the concentration of the inhibitory neurotransmit-
ter y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the V1 (primary visual cortex) measured using
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was found to be predictive of the inter-
individual variability in orientation discrimination performance [2], visual
bistable perception [3] and binocular rivalry after monocular deprivation [4].
In this study, we examined interindividual variability in the perception of visual
motion. This is one of the fundamental components of visual scene analysis
[5-7], but its relationship with neurotransmitter concentrations is not yet under-
