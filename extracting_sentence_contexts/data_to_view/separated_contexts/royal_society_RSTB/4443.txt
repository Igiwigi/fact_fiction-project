The CO, output remains constant for the
greater part of the work period, but diminishes somewhat in the last determination. The respiratory quotient is only 0Â°966 in the first observation during the work, and
shows a diminution during the course of the work, though in the last observation
during the work it is still a good deal above the initial resting value. The whole
course of events during the muscular work is, in fact, remarkably like that found in
the case of Dova.as in the long experiments with lighter work (Experiments 5 and 6,
Table 111). Nine minutes after the work ceased, however, the respiratory quotient
falls below the initial resting value, and a further fall occurs in subsequent periods,
and even when the experiment terminated 48 minutes later there was no sign of
recovery. In Experiments 9 and 10 it willbe seen that the hyperpnoea during the work is at
a maximum in the first determination, 7.e., at a time corresponding to the abnormally
high respiratory quotient, and CO, output, and that there is a decided drop in the
amount of air breathed per minute in the subsequent observations during the exercise.
