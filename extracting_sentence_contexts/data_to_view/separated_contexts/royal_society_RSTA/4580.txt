In
order to secure that the splash shall follow the lines here recorded, the polishing with
a dry cloth or wash-leather must be repeated just before each observation, and after
this the sphere must be handled as little as possible ; with these precautions a stone
sphere behaves in just the same way. Photographs No. 2 and No. 3* show that the
liquid rises over and surrounds the sphere with a thin close-fitting sheath. Figs. 5
and 6 show a subordinate side-sheath, which, without doubt, was due to the fact that
the sphere had a crack in it, which occasionally carried down air with it, and
disturbed the symmetry of the splash. In Photograph No. 7, however, the symmetry
is complete, and it is nearly so in Photograph No. 8. When any failure of the
polishing occurs, the liquid is kept away from the sphere, and the splash, instead of
being almost noiseless, is accompanied by a sound of bubbles rising to the surface and
bursting.
