There are two pos-
sible interpretations of this particular observation. On the one
hand, the fossil calibration could be correct, and the rate shift
inferred on that branch could be real. The fact that Lorisiformes
are among the smallest- and shortest-lived primates suggests at
first sight that this particular rate deviation could correspond to
acase where a rapid shift has indeed occurred in the life-history
strategy, leading to a shorter generation time. However, in that
case, the higher substitution rate should have been maintained
over the subsequent branches, within Lorisiformes. Instead,
what is observed here is a high rate only along the basal
branch of the group (electronic supplementary material,
figure S4).
