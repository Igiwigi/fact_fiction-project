Readings reduced to 25° C,

now to be moved through twice the angle necessary with the former arrangement ;
the reading-sensitiveness of the instrument was, in fact, doubled by this change.

A gravitational survey, connecting the towns of the eastern Queensland seaboard
with Sydney, was now projected, the first connecting station chosen being Armidale, a
town on the table-land in the northern part of New South Wales. The observations
given in Plot 3 show an immense improvement in the behaviour of the balance,
though they give evidence of a break of 5 sextant minutes in the reading on
returning to Sydney—due to the shaking which the instrument had experienced in
transport. We had, by this time, found out the necessity of observing only when the
temperature was at a maximum or a minimum,

On the return from Armidale it was found that some air had leaked into the
instrument. In trying to discover the leak, through carelessness, the delicate
