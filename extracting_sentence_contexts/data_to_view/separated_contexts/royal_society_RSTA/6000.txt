They can actually reveal how shear
information on the surface of the skin is translated into normal stress that is measured by
the piezoelectric polymer sensors working in thickness mode. While in such a configuration
PVDF polymer sensors only measure the normal T33 stress component [77], we have previously
proven [78] that shear information on the skin surface can also be detected by the sensors. As
a matter of fact, shear forces tend to unbalance the normal stress distribution on the substrate
(where sensors are integrated) by producing a kind of wake in the direction of their resultant. Ahead of the wake, the compression is increased while at the rear a tensile region appears. However, this previous study has been made for static contacts, not dynamic ones.
