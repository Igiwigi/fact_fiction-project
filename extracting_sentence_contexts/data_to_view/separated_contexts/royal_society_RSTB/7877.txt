The most striking feature of the ovary at this stage is undoubtedly the great degree of
hypertrophy of the interstitial tissue. A small proportion of the excess of bulk of the foetal
as compared with the neonatal ovary is due to slight enlargement of the peripheral
follicles, but by far the greater part of it is due to the interstitial tissue. It may be remarked
at this point that the elephant ovary resembles that of the mare, not only in that the
interstitial tissue is rendered conspicuous during foetal life, but also in the fact of its being
remarkably inconspicuous in adult life. In both animals the increase in weight of the
ovary during pregnancy appears to be attributable almost entirely to the growth of the
corpora lutea and the increased vascular supply involved in their development. This is in
contrast with the sequence of events in some other animals, in which the interstitial cells
