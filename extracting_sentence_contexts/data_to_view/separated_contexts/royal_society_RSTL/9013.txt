Tn the case of Tiaropsis diademata the action of strychnia is very similar, with the
exception that there is no continuous spasm, although occas/onal ones occur amid the
twitching convulsions. After a time, however, all convulsions.cease, and the animal
remains quiescent. While in this condition its reflex excitability is abnormally
increased, as shown by the fact that even a gentle touch will bring on, not merely a
8ingle responsive spasm, as in the unpoisoned animal, but a whole series of successive
spasms, which are often followed by a paroxysm of twitching convulsions. "The condi-

S tion of exalted reflex irritability is thus exceedingly well marked. Recovery in normal
a water at this stage is rapid, the motions being at first characterized by a want of coor-
5 dination, which, however, s0on passes off. Z $5.
