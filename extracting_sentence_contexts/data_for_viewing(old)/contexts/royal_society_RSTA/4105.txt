Another approach to replicate the role of aquaporins with non-biological channels is with carbon
nanotubes (CNTs). CNTs are a cylindrical carbon-based material with atomically flat walls and
diameters ranging from 1 to 250nm. Although they are intrinsically hydrophobic, water transport
has been found to be possible through such confined channels [99]. In fact, membranes containing
aligned CNTs have been found to exhibit water fluxes several orders of magnitude greater than
expected based on conventional models. It is theorized this could be because of the atomically flat
walls and the formation of hydrogen bonds between adjacent water molecules inside the tube,
both leading to a smooth energetic landscape for water travelling inside the nanotubes [100].
However, for nanotubes to act as purification membranes, either the nanotube diameter must be
small enough to reject solutes, or chemical modification must take place at the nanotube entrance
to increase selectivity [11].

CNTs have been successfully used as filters for the removal of contaminants of various sizes.
Aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were grown on a hollow carbon cylinder
through a spray pyrolysis technique. The inner diameter of the nanotubes was found to be 10-
12nm. The material was found to remove Escherichia coli (2-5 wm), Staphylococcus aureus (1 \.m)
