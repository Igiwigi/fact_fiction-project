Figure 12a,b shows the colour maps of b,(d, y) and the sol-
ution found by the reconstruction procedure f; g;. The general
shape is quite well reproduced, and differences appear only
at a relatively small scale. Figure 12c,d shows the recon-
structed functions f(d), g(y) for which we have found the
following analytical expressions,

similarly with the distance to the wall r,,, the proportionality

only weakly invalid, as illustrated in the practical examples

found that only one or two non-zero modes were enough to
