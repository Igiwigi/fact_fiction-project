it will be seen that the bud had developed in a relatively restricted space.

In the present state of knowledge no adequate explanation of these structural develop-

ments is possible. Some factors in the situation may, however, be considered. In the first

place, it should be mentioned that the inner strand of the polycyclic system is not a true

component of the bud stele: it is, in fact, the stele of a root which has effected a more or
less longitudinal penetration of the basal region of the bud stele. This root disappears
about the level of the sections illustrated in figures 64 and 65 and figure 95, plate 12. The
bud tissue, in this as in many other instances, is thus seen to end blindly in the outer cortex
(figures 69, 70), and, apart from the presence of the penetrating root, is not conjoined with
the meristele of the parent shoot. Space does not admit of a full account being given of
the penetration of buds by roots, but in these and related experimental studies of D. aristata
and D. filix-mas the phenomenon has been frequently observed. Briefly it may be said that
the root nature has been ascertained (i) by the relation which the penetrative vascular
strand bears to the meristele and (ii) by the observation of undeniable root apices actually

penetrating buds. (Evidence is available in the writerâ€™s collection of slides and photo-
graphs.)
