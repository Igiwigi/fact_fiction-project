But, inasmuch as the action is reciprocal, we ought also to
S obtain evidence of diamagnetic polarity by reversing the conditions of experiment ; by
2 making the magnet the moveable object, and inferring from its deflection the polarity
Ss ofthe mass which produces the deflection. This experiment would be complementary
& to those described in the communication referred to, and existing circumstances
z invested the experiment with a great degree of interest and importance. = In fact an experiment similar to that here indicated was made by Professor
& W. Wes, previous to my investigation, and the result was such as to satisfy its
= author of the reverse polarity of diamagnetic bodies. I will not here enter into a
L minute description of the instrument and mode of experiment by which this result
S was obtained; for the instrument made use of in the present inquiry being simply a
S refinement of that made use of by M. Wes, its explanation will embrace the
A explanation of his apparatus. For the general comprehension of the criticisms to
which M. Wzper's results have been subjected, it is necessary, however, to remark,
that in his experiments a bismuth bar, within a vertical spiral of copper wire, through
which an electric current was transmitted, was caused to act upon a steel magnet
freely suspended without the spiral.
