By studies all over Europe it has become possible to establish a co-ordinated scheme of
history for the complex development which the forests have followed in response to
widespread climatic changes during and after retreat of the ice of the last glacial period. In this way pollen analysis reflects not only forest history but also the underlying
climatic changes, and it may therefore be employed as a chronological scale against

which other post-glacial events can be measured. It has, in fact, been accurately
correlated on the continent with phases of human culture and with detailed geological
history, such as the stages of the Baltic Sea and the deposition of de Geerâ€™s varved clays. Several difficulties stand in the way of a direct correlation of continental results with
those of the Fenland. In the first place some of the valuable index trees of the con-
tinent are absent from Britain, e.g. Picea and Abies, whilst others, such as Fagus and
Carpinus, are here at their north-western limit, and form relatively limited areas of
woodland, and those limited to specific soil types.
