ment of fig. 20. Fig. 24 is for the cage where a constant load of 3 kilos. was applied
to the wire. Fig. 25 is for a constant load of 6 kilos., and fig. 26 for 12 kilos. (Figs. 23,
24, and 25 are drawn about the same axes; fig. 26 is drawn about a separate axis of J

to avoid confusion.) After each of these loads was applied, the wire was subjected to
the process of demagnetising by revyersals before the magnetisation, whose effects were
to be noted, was begun. The importance of this will appear in the sequel. ($ 32-34.)
In all four figures the greatest magnetising force applied was nearly the 8ame, but the
magnetisation in figs. 24 and 25 (and to a less degree in fig. 26) was greater than in
fig. 23 on account of the fact that the presence of a moderate amount of load increases
the magnetie susceptibility of iron, especially of iron which is treated as the specimen
under test was treated.*

The figures show that the presence of load diminishes the general thermoelectric
effect of magnetisation, and finally reverses it when the load is great. For the reason
already given, the form of these curves is not very precisely defined, and the evidence
of hysteresis in the relation of E.M.F. to magnetism is, at the best, inconclusive.

$32. It has been said that in figs. 24, 25, and 26, after the load was applied, the
wire (although then not ab all magnetic) was subjected to the process of demagnetising
by reversals before the observations were taken. This was because it was found that
the process in question was very effective in wiping out what may be called the
