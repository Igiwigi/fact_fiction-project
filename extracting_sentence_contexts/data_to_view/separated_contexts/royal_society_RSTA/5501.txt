Typically, heart-rate alterations are quantified looking at the time intervals
between consecutive R peaks because of their ease of detection. However, the frameworks found
the P-wave very important for this class (figure 2a). Given the fact that the P-wave does not
change during bradycardia, the assessment of the low heart rate might have been performed
by the network ‘looking’ at the rate of both P-wave and QRS complex. Similarly, the frameworks
found the T-wave relevant for the detection of AF (atrial fibrillation), which is characterized by the
absence of the P-wave, an oscillatory pattern on the ECG baseline and irregular heart rate. In this
case, the frameworks hint that the network may use samples between consecutive beats where the
T-wave, the isoelectric line, and part of the P-wave are located to detect AF.
