Waves are
more amenable to time-reversal schemes since they can be described in many situations by a
linear operator and any error in the initial conditions will not suffer from chaotic behaviour. It is interesting to note that both the holographic principle and the time-reversal mirror (TRM)
approach are mainly based on the time-reversal invariance of wave equations. They also rely on
the fact that any wavefield can be completely determined within a volume knowing the field
(and its normal derivative) on any enclosing surface [1,2]. Hence, information reaching the two- :
dimensional surface is sufficient to recover all the fields inside the whole volume. Based on these =
properties, Gabor [1] introduced the holographic method providing an elegant way to back- 3
propagate a monochromatic wavefield towards its initial source and to obtain a three-dimensional
image of any radiating object.
