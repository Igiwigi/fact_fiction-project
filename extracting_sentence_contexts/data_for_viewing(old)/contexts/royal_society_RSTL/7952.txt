< At Ce, c the absorbent action has reached its limits ; it has touched the boundary line
EZ indicated by fig. 21, producing that undulating outline of the medullary cavity which
gives to its common arenaceous casts their calamitean form, and which here, as elsewhere,
v is only found in stems of notable dimensions. In the specimen of Calamopitus, which
2 T have previously referred to as described in the Transactions of the Manchester Literary
S and Philosophical Society, the absorbent action has gone yet further. Almost every
A trace of the pith has disappeared through its operation. The inorganic cast, of the

medullary cavity exhibits its sharply defined Calamitean outline in immediate contact
with the persistent vyascular and cellular tissues of the woody zone; and it is an inter-
esting fact that the specimen which thus exhibits the entire completion of the process
of pith-absorption is the largest in which I have hitherto discovered structure, its

* In this respect tho Calamites only exhibit the sxame phenomena as appear in Dadoxyon, Dictyovylon,
and other exogenous stems of the Coal-measures, in British specimens of which I have rarely seen concentric
rings of growth that T could identify with periodic checks arising from secular yariations of climate, Never-
theless 8uch rings do occasionally occur,
