elastomers (Adams & Warner 2008; Lashley et al. 2008; Salje et al. 2008). In the
following, I will exemplify some of the more technical aspects of multi-scaling
analysis and draw some wider conclusions at the end.

2. The mesoscopic length scale

The term ‘mesoscopic’ refers to ‘intermediate’ between long and short, and
applies to microstructures to be seen in between the atomic and the macroscopic
length scales. Very often the mesoscopic scale is located between 10 and
1000nm, although the proper description implies that the effective rules for
structural, dielectric, magnetic interactions, etc. are different from those of
atoms and also different from those of a macroscopic body. Two aspects are
important here: firstly, the fact that any finite body relaxes at the boundary
