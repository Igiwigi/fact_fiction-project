In order to keep this paper at a reasonable length, we will exclusively deal with maximal
estimates in the 2-smooth setting. Maximal estimates for stochastic convolutions in 2-smooth
Banach spaces are useful in applications to stochastic partial differential equations. Typically, one
takes X to be L?, the Bessel potential space H*?, or the Besov space Bj, ,; as will be explained in
example 2.1 these spaces are 2-smooth if 2 < p,q < oo. Maximal estimates in the setting of UMD
spaces are covered in [13] and the follow-up works [10,11]. Maximal inequalities for stochastic
convolutions in 2-smooth Banach spaces with respect to other noise processes than (cylindrical)
Brownian motions, such as Poissonian noise, are discussed in [14-16] and the references therein;
see also survey [17] for the Hilbertian case.

An important motivation to study stochastic partial differential equations in the setting of
2-smooth Banach spaces comes from the fact that estimates in Sobolev and Besov spaces with
high integrability exponent p (which are 2-smooth) can be combined with Sobolev embedding
results to obtain further integrability and regularity properties of solutions. This plays a key role
in many papers (see [8,9] and references therein).

2. Preliminaries

We assume familiarity with the basic notions of probability theory and stochastic analysis.
This preliminary section fixes notation following the references [6,18,19] where unexplained


terminology can be found. All random variables and stochastic processes are assumed to be
defined on a probability space (2,.%,P) which we fix once and for all. We work over the real
