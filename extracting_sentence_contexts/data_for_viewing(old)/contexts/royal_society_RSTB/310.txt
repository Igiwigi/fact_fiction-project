tomous, as in fig. 14. It is therefore obvious that branches like figs. 1-5 represent
some special ramification, distinct from the normal dichotomous one; and the only
possible explanation that I can discover is that such arrested or subordinate branches
were destined to support strobili.

It cannot now be doubted that the strobili of Lepidodendron were affixed to their
sustaining branches in two ways. In one fine Lepidostrobus in my collection the base
of the strobilus terminates the extremity of a long, slender pendulous twig. But in
another very fine, example, in the Museum of the Owens College, the large Lepido-
strobus is planted laterally in an almost sessile manner upon a strong branch. In
this instance the strobilus is evidently sustained by a short, arrested lateral twig,
corresponding to one of the Halonial tubercles. The sections, figs. 1, 5, further
establish another morphological fact, viz, that the young branches of a Lepido-
dendron may have a vascular bundle devoid of all visible traces of a cellular medulla,
and yet such a medulla may be developed in its interior at a later stage of growth.

In some of my earlier memoirs I advanced the hypothesis that age produced
other morphological changes, beyond mere growths, in these Lepidodendroid plants. To
this M. Renavtr replied, speaking of LZ. Harcourtii, “ On peut done conclure que la
différence de diamétre des rameaux de Lepidodendron n’apporte pas de changements
dans la disposition générale des tissus qui les composent.”t

My sections of L. Harcourtii demonstrate that such changes do occur; since, as
the section, fig. 1, shows at a, the older and larger branches possess a very large
medulla, which exists in like manner in all the older Halonial branches, which certainly
