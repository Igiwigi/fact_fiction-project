166 MR. R. ASSHETON ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE UNGULATE PLACENTA, AND

cotyledonary burrs have the internal face (i.e., the face next the embryo) slightly
concave, and the external border of the trophospongia markedly convex. The
crypts penetrate roughly perpendicular to the concave surface and so have a radiate
arrangement.

Figs. 19 and 20, Plate 12, illustrate respectively the fundus of a erypt and an
apex of a villus of this stageâ€”not, however, corresponding ones.

The fact I want to draw attention to in these figures is that in the fundus there is
a plasmodial layer and in it are two dark staining elongated nuclei. These I take to
be those of a binucleate cell which has just passed from the foetal villus trophoblast
and become adherent to the uterine wall.

On the tip of the villus (fig. 20, Zr. D.) an almost identical pair of nuclei occurs,
forming part of the villus trophoblast, but with a very close resemblance to the two
nuclei in the fundus (fig. 19). A little to the right of this there is another pair of
nuclei not so dark as the above mentioned, but darker than the majority of
trophoblast cells.

These three pairs of nuclei represent, I take it, the stages of translation from a
close attachment to the foetal villus to a firm attachment to the walls of the crypt.
