Observing the chirality of
these two modes is instructive; in the regions where one is left handed the other is right handed
and vice versa (figure 3d).3

Importantly though, using the C-points present in the glide waveguide at vg = 0 will not result
in unidirectional emission dependent on spin. Nature conspires against the use of the C-points
present at the bandedge: whereas in the W1 waveguide the left- and right-handed C-points
approached each other in position and annihilated at the bandedge, in the glide waveguide :
they approach in frequency and annihilate at the bandedge. This unfortunate fact is caused [=
by the multi-mode nature of the waveguide at the bandedge. The two degenerate modes have 23
oppositely handed C-points at identical locations and frequencies. For example, at the location
of a right-handed C-point in the lower mode, there will be a left-handed C-point in the upper mea)
mode with the same frequency and group velocity.
