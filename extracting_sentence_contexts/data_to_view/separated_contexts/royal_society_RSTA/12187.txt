As the absorption of the yellow spot diminishes
towards its boundary, it follows that, within certain limits, the smaller the patch that
is viewed the greater will be the loss of luminosity in that part of the spectrum where
the absorption takes place. From observations made in the manner shortly to be
described, it was found that, for our eyes, there was no sensible difference in the
results when the two shadows fell on the white square of 14-inch side, or a square of
l-inch side, but that, if the side were increased to 2 inches, the measures differed
slightly but unmistakably. This will account for the fact that the original luminosity
curve slightly differs from that now recorded for the centre of the eye, as part of the
image of the larger patch must have fallen on the less absorbing part of the yellow
spot. It is not quite apparent why the eye should not distinguish between the
differing luminosities of the different parts of the shadows, but it is probable that the
average luminosity was observed. Table I., Col.
