Ethyl-acetyl. Methylated acetone.

The presence of methyl in the 80-called acetyl has been abundantly proved, conse-
quently the chlorous radical is the same in both the above formulz, whilst the for-
mation of butyric acid, by the substitution of ethyl for hydrogen in the methyl of acetic
acid, proyes that ethylated methyl is identical with propyl, and that consequently
methylated methyl is the same thing as ethyl, therefore the basylous radicals in the
above formulte are also identical.

Butyral, which is isomeric with methylated acetone, has been classed by KEKULE
amongst the ketones, but we cannot agree with this classification, as, unlike a ketone,
It yields on oxidation a fatty acid containing the same number of atoms of carbon, and
it also reduces with facility ammoniacal solution of silver oxide; in fact KEKULE's own
definition of a ketone excludes it completely from this class of bodies, Butyral does
not appear to be identical with the butyraldehyde obtained by the oxidation of protein
