Like
most of the organic remains they appear to have suffered considerable erosion; it is therefore
impossible to determine their original length, and hence not possible to refer them to a
species with any certainty. The segments are more slender than seems usual in M. spicatum,
and on the whole they are wider than the long segments of the aquatic form of M. verticil-
latum, so it is reasonable to suggest that they are most likely to be M. alterniflorum. This
would agree with the fact that the only Myriophyllum pollen found in this layer is that of
