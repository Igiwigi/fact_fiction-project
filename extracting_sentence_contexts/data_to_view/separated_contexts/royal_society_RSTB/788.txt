We have given this name to the instrument we are about to describe, because
it supplies us directly with graphic records of the contractions of the muscular wall of
the heart. It consists in principle of an arrangement by which the variations in the
distance from one another, of any two points upon the heart wall, can be magnified
and traced upon the surface of a revolving cylinder without restraining either the con-
tractions of the heart wall or the movements of the heart. One important advantage
of the instrument consists in the fact that, by its means, it is possible to obtain simul-
taneous graphic records of the contractions and expansions of the wall of one of the
