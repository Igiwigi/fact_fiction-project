On the 17th of June the rise from low to high water in the afternoon
was only eight inches, although the rise in the forenoon had been four feet. In the
same manner, the fall from high to low water in the forenoon of June 22 was only
two inches, and in the forenoon of June 23 only one inch, although the intermediate
fall in the afternoon of those days was above four feet. And these movements of the
surface in the forenoons of those days, which we have called a fall from high to low
water, are in fact more simply conceived as a mere temporary check in the rise of
the water from the preceding low to the sncceeding high water. And accordingly
on June 24 the movement plainly assumes this character; the ascent is checked, but
no descent takes place. In the register of the observations it is stated that * from
6b to 8" the surface remained stationary, 80 that we may say there was no low
water.‚Äù And thus one of the two half-daily tides being obliterated, we have at this
period only one tide in the twenty-four hours.
