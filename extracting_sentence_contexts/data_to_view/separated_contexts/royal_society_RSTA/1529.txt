For the third dimension, we needed to choose a value that
represents ‘infinity.’ To achieve this, we studied the effects of elongating the cylinder to the third
dimension. In figure 3, we present the results for two different values of the length in the third
dimension, y = 1344nm (2 x a) and y = 2688 nm (4 x a). We see that as we make y longer, the
intensity of some peaks decreases, due to the fact that they are associated with this component. Therefore, from now on we use y = 2688 nm. We did not explore larger values of y because of the
limitations imposed by the quasi-static limit model.
