tistribution of the efferent and afferent roots of each spinal nerve, especially in the
wer half of the body of that animal. I have recently published some experimental
gotes on the arrangement of some motor fibres in the lumbo-sacral plexus, and the
gresent paper deals chiefly with the distribution of the afferent fibres of the roots.

PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS.

In the researches which have had for their subject the peripheral distribution of
fhe posterior roots of the spinal nerves, the plexuses of the Mammalian fore limb have
Seen more studied than have those pertaining to the hind limb. With the exception
af the five experiments extant by L. Turok (1856), there seem no experiments on
fe cutaneous fields of the afferent spinal roots of the Mammalian hind limb previous
#0 my own. ‘This fact may lend interest to observations, especially on so high a
“ype as the Monkey, and I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to the
oyal Society for pecuniary aid, Pincing, that somewhat expensive laboratory animal
ithin my reach,
_ Experimental inquiry into the subject appears to commence with C. Eckuarp
(1)*, who appended to a research on the innervation of the muscles and move-
ments of the hind limb of the Frog (1849) a brief note on the cutaneous distribution
the sensory roots of the four hindmost spinal nerves of that type. One general
usion he drew, and it is as follows : “ The field of skin to which a sensory root
is not exactly that which overlies the muscles which are supplied by the
