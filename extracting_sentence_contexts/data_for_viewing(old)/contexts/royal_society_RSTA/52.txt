For example, when M coincides with R°, we find A= vx. The choice of the relation (5.2) points
out that the microstructural descriptor is insensitive to rigid translations in space of the whole
body. In fact, v at a point describes what is inside the material element placed there: it brings
information about the inner structure, which translates with the point and changes independently
of the translation itself.

Isometric-type changes in observers pertain also to the space where we select the reference
configuration. Let w the value at x and t of a vector field over the reference space. An observer in
this space is once again a coordinate frame. We indicate by w’ the values of the considered vector
field after rotating and translating the coordinate frame. The pull-back of w’ to the first observer
gives a transformation rule analogous to (5.1), a rule defining w*, namely

w* := C(t) + q(t) x (x — x0) +, (5.3)

where Xo is another arbitrary fixed point, ¢ a translation and q a rotation vector.
