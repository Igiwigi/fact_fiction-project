5. I may notice, in passing, that the preceding equations give rise to a 80mewhat sin-
gular unsymmetrical quadratic transformation of a cubic form. In fact, the second and
third equations give X': Y': Z7/=YZA—PX*: FXY—07*: PAX —TY*. And substituting
these values for X', Y', Z/ in the form

+P(X"+Y" +2") —(1+2P)X'Y'Z,

Ae result must contain as a factor

8 +P(X'+Y*+2%)—(1+2Þ)XYZ ;
fe other factor is easily found to be
S —P(P(X*+Y* +2") +3IXYZ). Svreral of the formule given in the sequel conduct in like manner to unsymmetrical
tensformations of a cubic form.
