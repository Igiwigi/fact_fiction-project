interaction. There remains, therefore, the vasomotor system of nerves, with the
depressors and the intracardiac nervous mechanism, to which we must look for the
chief explanation of the phenomena under consideration. From the experiments in
which the cord was divided in the neck, we gather that the effects of vanadium-poisoning
upon the pulse occurred as usual, while the diminution and fluctuations in blood-
pressure were no longer visible, being indeed replaced by a rise. As in those experi-
ments the yasomotor centre, the accelerators, and the vagus centre and terminations
were eliminated (the vagus terminations by means of the curare which was injected), we are
driven to the conclusion (1) that the depression and fluctuations of blood-presgure are for
the most part due to some action of the poison on the yasomotor centre, and (2) that the
irregularities of heart-beats are caused by an affection of intracardiac ganglia. The
former conclusion is strongly confirmed by the disappearance of respiration-curyes, which
must be due to vasomotor mischief, and by the fact that other centres in the cord are
acted on by vanadium. Hence it seemed hardly necessary to perform any special experi-
ments after elimination of the depressors. The latter conclusion is fully borne out by

Experiment LIII. on a frog, where the usual diminution followed in a heart which was
directly observed after the removal of all extracardiac nervous influences.

The rise of blood-pressure which follows injection into the veins of rabbits whose
cord had been cut is considered to be due to the greater vigour of the heart which
was noticed. ,
