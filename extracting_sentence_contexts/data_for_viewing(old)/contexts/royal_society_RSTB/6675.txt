those from which their progeny are able to emerge. If this were not a general rule,
parasitic species would soon be non-existent. The behaviour is described as instinctive
because the femaleâ€™s actions are such that they are preadapted to situations which are

likely to occur; for instance, the female searches for hosts which she may never have
encountered as an adult.

Salt (1937) states that the fact that Trichogramma will reject true but unparasitized
hosts provided they are contaminated with the smell of a female, indicates that this
parasite selects its hosts by criteria which are not necessarily criteria of suitability.
Now it will be generally conceded that the seeking out of hosts by parasites is done with
the object of either depositing an egg, or possibly feeding on the host contents; unless
considered in relation to these ends, the activity is meaningless to the observer. As
apparently Trichogramma does not feed on its hosts, one may justifiably claim that
unparasitized hosts which are examined, will, in the natural course of events, be
parasitized by the examining female. The criteria used are liable, but not certain, to
be criteria of suitability, for a host may be rejected for no apparent reason. But why
should a female, having sought for a host and found an unparasitized one, leave it
without depositing an egg? In the laboratory, the significance of this odour to the
female is obscured because in confining females in a Petri dish they may wander
