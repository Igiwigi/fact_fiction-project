water drops such 2s are formed in these expansion experiments, has not, as far as I
am aware, been worked out. This is especially true of the colours filling the centre
of the field within the diffraction rings. Since the whole of the colour phenomena
from the first appearance of small diffraction rings to the disappearance of all colonr,
except the bluish or greenish-white, are confined within quite a narrow range of
expansions, the size of the drops evidently diminishes with great rapidity with
increasing expansion.

When all diffraction colours disappear, and. the fog appears white from all points of
view, as it does when v,/v, amounts to about 1°44, we cannot be far wrong in assuming
that the diameter of the drops does not exceed one wave-length in the brightest part
of the spectrum, that is, about 5 x 107 centim. That the absence of colour is not
due to the inequality of the drops is evident from the fact that the colours are at
their brightest when »,/v, is only slightly less than 1°44, and from the perfect regu-
larity of the colour changes up to this point.

Taking the diameter of the drops as 5 X 107° cub. centim., we obtain for the
volume of each drop about 6 x 107 cub. centim., or its mass is 6 X 107 grm.

Now, we have seen that when the expansion is such as produces the sensitive tint
(when v/v, = 1°42), the quantity of water which separates out is about 7°6 x LO~? grm.
in each cubic centimetre. With yreater expansions rather more must separate out.

We, therefore, obtain as an inferior limit to the number of drops, when v/v, = 1°44,
76 x 10-6
