To return now to the experimental work. In the following table the time required
for the pressure to fall to three quarters, one half, one quarter of its maximum value
is given for a number of distinct experiments, whereas the cooling curves for three
different diameters of cordite at gravimetric densities of 0°1 and 0°15 will be found
plotted in fig. 16. It is noticeable that after the first tenth of a second the curves
taken under similar conditions, but for various sizes of explosive, lie closely together,
showing that the diameter has no material effect on the subsequent rate of cooling.

When we refer, however, to the table, we see that the times required to reach a
given fraction of the maximum are different for different diameters.

This apparent discrepancy is explained by the fact that the total quantity of heat
absorbed is primordially a function of time. When the combustion is very rapid, the
maximum pressure is reached while the walls of the enclosure are still cold and the
percentage fall of pressure per unit time is high. With a slow-burning cordite the
surface of the enclosure becomes considerably heated during the combustion of the
explosive, and after the maximum the percentage fall of pressure is correspondingly
lower. Briefly stated, at any fixed interval of time after ignition the total heat
absorbed by the enclosure, and, therefore, the temperature of its inner surface, will be
nearly the same for all diameters of the explosive. In consequence, the rate of cooling
as measured by the rate of change of pressure at any stated time is unaffected by
the speed of combustion.

The rate of cooling for a given volume of the enclosure does not vary, as is usually
