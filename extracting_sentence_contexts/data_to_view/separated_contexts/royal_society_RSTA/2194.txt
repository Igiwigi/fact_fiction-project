Motivated also by
the polygonal coherent structure present in the Earth’s atmosphere during particular periods of
the year, in this article we summarized what we have found for the particular case of total vorticity
equal to zero. Besides possible geophysical motivations, such a case is particularly interesting
from a mathematical point of view, for its universality. In fact as we have discussed in previous
articles—see for example [1,9,10]—a starting point of the mathematical formulation of the study
of Euler incompressible fluids is the solution of the Poisson equation AY =a, where W is the
stream function of a passive tracer advected by the velocity field generated by the vorticity field
w. When solving the equation above on a sphere the fact that the surface is closed imposes an

extra condition:
i} odo =0,
sg

where do denotes the element of area in S?. (We shall also use do or, in some cases do’ for
other surfaces.) This implies that the corresponding equation for the Green function—i.e. the
fundamental solution of the Poisson equation—also has to verify such a condition, and it is
therefore generalized to

ArG(r, to) = 5(r, 0) + C,

where 6 is the usual Kroneker delta and C is a compensating field, such that the integral over the

surface of the right-hand side is zero. An infinite number of choices are possible for C and each of

them would correspond to a choice of gauge that would give rise to a different Green function.
