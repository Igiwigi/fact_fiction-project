beacons (a black/white-striped cylinder and a grey funnel).
Not only did the GluN14?°°! mice acquire this non-spatial
beacon task perfectly well (see fig. 7 of [12]), but they were
also completely unimpaired during its subsequent reversal
when the platform was then switched to being associated
with the opposite visual cue (see fig. 10 in supplementary
information of [12]). It is of course tempting to attribute
these different outcomes to the spatial/non-spatial nature of
the two discrimination tasks, given the prominent role in
spatial information processing attributed to the hippo-
campus. However, it is also important to point out that
these GluN14?°4! mice are perfectly capable of very high
levels of spatial memory performance (figure 1). In fact,
their performance on the standard, open-field version of the
Morris watermaze task was as good, if not better, than that
of the controls (see fig. 3 of [12]).

Thus, although spatial reversal is exquisitely sensitive to
hippocampal NMDAR ablation, this is not the case for spatial
acquisition. We have observed a similar pattern of results
with GluN14?°™! mice in the classic, open-field version of
the watermaze task. As previously mentioned, GluN14?°C4?
mice acquired the standard, fixed location, hidden escape
platform version of the watermaze task as well as controls
but were then substantially impaired during a subsequent
