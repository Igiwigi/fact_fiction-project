With respect to the nature of the blue substance of nocturnes, the question
naturally arises, “ Is it Heemocyanin”? To answer this question it would be necessary
to discuss the prevalent views as to the nature and functions of Hxemocyanin. We
propose to leave this discussion for the present and to content ourselves here with
recording several facts. In the first place the blue colour of nocturnes (Macromysis)
is not discharged by carbon dioxide, so that, if the discharge of colour by this gas is a
decisive test for Heemocyanin, we must conclude that the blue substance of Macromysis
is a different body. In the second place, the blood of M. nigra, which is constantly
alkaline, exhibits variations of colour.
