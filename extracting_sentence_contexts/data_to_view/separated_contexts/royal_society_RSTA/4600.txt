In the context of
algorithms which generate samples from the posterior parameter distribution only, x is simply
equal to 6, the current position of the Markov chain in the parameter space. For RIMCMC—where
the Markov chain is being used to generate samples from the joint posterior (equation (4.3))—
the current state of the Markov chain is x = {0,,k}, where k indexes the model structures and 6;
represents the current parameter estimates of the kth model. Guaranteeing that the resulting Markov chain will obey detailed balance (and therefore have
a stationary distribution equal to the target) is complicated by the fact that different model
structures will usually feature different numbers of parameters and, as result, RIMCMC involves
the propagation of a Markov chain across parameter spaces of varying dimension. Consider the situation where the algorithm’s current state is x € R" and the state x’ ¢R” is
proposed via

P(0,M|D)=

x’ =h(x,u), (4.4)
where |i is a user-defined function and u is an auxiliary random variable sampled from a
distribution g(u); as will be shown, the variable u allows the preservation of dimension of the
Markov chain and ultimately assures detailed balance. In [54,55], it is demonstrated that detailed balance will hold if
