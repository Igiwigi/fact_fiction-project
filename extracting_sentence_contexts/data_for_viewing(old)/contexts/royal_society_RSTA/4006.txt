Unconventional biological matrices have recently attracted much attention. They are perceived

as carriers of chemical information on the human organism. Such matrices (collected in a : a
non-invasive manner) include hair, nail, breath, saliva, tears, meibum, nasal mucus and skin :s
excretions. The greatest interest comes from the fields of clinical chemistry [1,2], toxicology [3] and : z
forensics [4]. This interest can be—in part—attributed to the success of mass spectrometry (MS). In : ey
fact, MS is a versatile technique of chemical analysis—often used in molecular characterization of :S
biological matrices [5]. Development of very sensitive analytical methods, based on MS, enables —
detection of various substances at very low concentrations [6]. Thus, it is often possible to detect :=
trace quantities of a drug after the administration of a single dose. Most clinical studies are 3
based on the analyses of standard matrices such as blood, urine, faeces or tissue biopsy material. : s

In the areas of clinical analysis, toxicology and forensics, both the identities and the quantities : =
