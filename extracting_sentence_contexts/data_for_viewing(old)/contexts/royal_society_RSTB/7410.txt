about 1 m. in length, is lined throughout its greater part with trophonemata up to 1-0 cm. long.

The structure of the ovary would suggest that Cetorhinus is oviparous, but that of the uterus
clearly shows that it is viviparous (or ovo-viviparous). There are no modern records of pregnancies,
although the sex ratio in the commercial catch is thirty or forty females to one male. Sexual
maturity is not reached until at least the third year of age. Females are impregnated in surface
inshore waters during early summer, but pregnant females evidently migrate elsewhere, either
horizontally or vertically or both, and do not reappear until after parturition.

INTRODUCTION

It is remarkable that the anatomy and biology of a fish so large, conspicuous and common
as the Basking shark should be practically unknown, especially in view of the fact that it is
the subject of a commercial fishery in the British islands and consequently is not inaccessible
to naturalists. The modern literature contains reports on the general anatomy of this fish
by only four persons, Home (1809, 1813) who examined two adult males, de Blainville
(1811) who examined one, Pavesi (1874, 1878) who examined two immature males, and
Carazzi (1904, 1905) who examined an immature female. There are numerous observations
on the occurrence of the species in various parts of the world, and some authors have
described the whalebone-like gill-rakers, but our knowledge, such as it is, of the general
anatomy depends entirely upon the work of the four named above; Owen (1866) obtained
his information from the work of Home, and adapted some of his figures.
