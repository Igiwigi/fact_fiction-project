Any base line, for example, which meets
three other base curves will in general give rise to a special base plane of ¥ of
the kind in question. (c) We may have a base plane of ¥ corresponding to a certain class of points near l~— In fact it may require only one condition to make ®-quadrics osculate any surface
of intersection of two of them along the line /; and if this is so, and if | be given
by equations z = ¢ = u = 0 and x by equations z = ¢ = 0, then it can be shown
that to points near 1, for which w is of the first order of smallness and z and ¢
both of the second, there correspond points of a base plane of Y’. This completes our brief indication of the peculiarities that can arise in the reverse
systems ‘’; and as we have already remarked that the transformations under con-
sideration are not of a sufficiently general character to justify further elaboration in a
paper like the present, we shall leave them here and pass on to those of the next type
for which the general ®-surface is Is.
