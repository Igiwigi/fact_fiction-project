ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSZ.

case is of less than minimal intensity, is able at the top of a staircase to give rise to a
contraction of very nearly maximum intensity. This latter fact proves that the stair-
case action is, at any rate in part, dependent on the process of stimulation as distin-
guished from that of contraction. Moreover, that the effect is one pervading the
whole extent of the irritable tisses, is proved by another fact, viz. that when at any
stage during the construction of a staircase the electrodes are snddenly shifted to any
other part of the irritable tissues, the next contraction will rank as the next step in
the staircase. Other experiments have conclusively proved that the staircase action |
obtains in the case of the natural ganglionic stimulation in exactly the same way, both
quantitatively and qualitatively, as it does in the case of artificial stimulation. The excitable tissues of Aurelia may be thrown into tetanus by means of strong
faradaic stimulation.
