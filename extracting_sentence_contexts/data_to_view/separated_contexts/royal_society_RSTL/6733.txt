From what we know, independently of the Tides, of the depth of the Atlantic Ocean,
this value, and that found from the ratio of S to M in the Diurnal Tide, will seem
nearer the truth than the higher values found from other considerations. From this it
may be inferred that the theory of Tides, with friction, in these two cases, comes nearer
to the truth than it does in the other cases from which the higher values are derived. L do not know why this is 80, and would recommend the fact to the notice of those
mathematicians who are conversant with the Theory of the Tides. Her Majesty's Ship © Investigator”' was secured in her Winter position by Noon of the
