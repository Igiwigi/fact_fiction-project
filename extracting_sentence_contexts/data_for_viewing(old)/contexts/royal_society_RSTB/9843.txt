increased engagement of this sensorimotor brain region
when viewing incongruent stimulus and knowledge pairings
relates to increased demands on motor simulation mechanisms
to reconcile human and artificial features of an observed agent.
In order to evaluate this necessarily speculative interpretation,
further research is required to replicate and more fully delin-
eate how stimulus and knowledge cues to human animacy
interact. If we take a step back and attempt to construct a
broader view of how the current study’s findings fit in to the
wider literature on the biological substrates of social perception
and social cognition, given that some findings do support the
‘like-me’ hypothesis [25-29], while others do not [30-33],
and the fact that not all reported results survive correction

for multiple comparisons, replication of these findings will be
important for future progress towards understanding how
we perceive animacy in other agents.

for social artificial agent design

The theoretical implications of the current study and research
reviewed in this paper extend beyond the laboratory and
serve to inform disciplines in addition to social cognition and
neuroscience, including robotics. Over the past decade, individ-
