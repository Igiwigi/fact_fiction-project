Boiling-point and capillary attraction, which in a similar way can be calculated
from each other. Deviize and Hogx have shown the specific gravity and index of refraction to be con-

nected with each other. Whether these relations hold good with other similar substances, whether in fact
these experiments have brought forward one example of a general law, or only disco-
vered a singular anomaly, must be left for further research to decide. EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE. PLATE LXIV.
