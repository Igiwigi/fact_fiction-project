then advisable to allow all to remain undisturbed for at least twenty-four hours, to
permit the hydrogen to soak into the apparatus and displace any other gas which may
be condensed on the surface of the glass, The whole is again exhansted, and then a
third time filled with hydrogen.

Preliminary observations are now taken for viscosity ; and the logarithmic
deerement at standard pressure and temperature, noted. The pumping ont and
refilling with hydrogen should now be repeated, observing the logarithmic decrement
each time, until ib is found that it no longer decreases in value ; when this is the
case accurate observations are commenced.

688. It has been found that hydrogen has much less viscosity than any other gas ;
the fact of the logarithmic decrement not decreasing by additional attempts at
purification is the test of its being free from admixture. This method of ascertaining
the purity of the gas, by the uniformity of its viscosity coefficient ab 760 millims., is
more accurate than collecting samples and analysing them eudiometrically (706).

Several series of observations in hydrogen have been taken. For a long time it
was considered that hydrogen, like other gases, showed the same slight departure from
Maxwezir's law of viscosity being independent of density ; for the logarithmic decre-
ment persistently diminished as the exhaustion increased, even at such moderate
Pressures as could be measured by the barometer gauge, Had it not been that the rate
of decrease was not uniform in the different series of observations, I should have con-
