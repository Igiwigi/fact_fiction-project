tractions. In all such cases, the actual heat-production observed is the resultant of
the thermal effects of mechanical shortening or extension, and of the physiological
effects set up by the stimulus. This is still further complicated by the fact that,
during relaxation, the part of the potential energy set free on excitation which has
not been used up in doing work is irreversibly degraded into heat. The matter can,
however, be made rather more intelligible by the consideration of a physical analogy. Tt will be seen from this that, if a muscle, whether excited or not, be released and
allowed to shorten, we may expect to find an absorption of heat, in addition to the
absorption of mechanical potential energy transformed into work.
