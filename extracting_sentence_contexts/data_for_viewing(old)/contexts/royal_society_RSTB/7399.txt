The approximation of the dimensions and shape of the tooth to those of the orang needs to
be borne in mind in connexion with Dart’s (1934) statement that in contrast to the sectorial
lower first milk molar of the modern anthropoid apes, that of Australopithecus is molariform.

Lower second molar. This tooth does not agree with any single modern ape in all the
metrical attributes that we have examined. On the other hand, it agrees with at least one
in each of them. Thus neither in length nor breadth does it differ significantly from the
orang-outang or gorilla, although it is significantly broader relative to its length than in
these two species. The talonid index, however, does not deviate significantly from the
orang-outang at a level of P<0-02. The tooth is, on the other hand, significantly longer
and broader than the corresponding tooth of the chimpanzee, with which, however, its
shape as described by the two indices which have been computed corresponds. This latter
fact may be noted in relation to Dart’s (1934) claim that in its cusp morphology, and broad
squarish shape, this tooth is human rather than ape-like.

Permanent dentition (Table 2)

The only teeth of the permanent dentition of the type specimen of Australopithecus which
had erupted are the upper and lower first molars.

Upper first molar. This tooth is longer and broader than the corresponding tooth of the
male and female chimpanzee. The length and trigone and talon breadths do not differ
from these dimensions in the modern gorilla. The talon breadth is significantly larger than
in the female orang-outang, but neither the length nor trigone breadth differs from this
type. In both size and shape the tooth corresponds to that of the male orang-outang,
