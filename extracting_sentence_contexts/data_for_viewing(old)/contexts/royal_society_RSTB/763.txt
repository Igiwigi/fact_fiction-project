The posterior turbinal (figs. 57, 75, 83, 84, and 158, P.7rb.) has the form of a
scroll attached by the whole of one edge to the aliethmoid. It is rolled upon itself
caudad (fig. 83) forming about one turn, Like the other turbinals its line of attach-
ment is oblique, passing from above forwards, as well as downwards.

The middle turbinal (figs. 57, 75, 88, 84, 157, and 158 M.7rb.), is also attached
along the whole length of one nearly vertical edge: from its attachment it passes at
first mesiad (fig. 83), then turns caudad, then laterad, then mesiad again, and passes
cephalad as a broad plate somewhat indented in the middle by a vertical furrow,
which gives it the appearance when viewed from its inner face (fig. 57) of a double
fold. The broad vertical plate thus formed is attached to the aliethmoid along the
anterior part of its ventral border, but is free dorsad, its apparent connection with the
dorsal wall of the olfactory chamber in fig. 57 being due to the fact that the mucous
membrane is not removed: anteriorly it is rolled upon itself caudad (figs. 83 and 84),
forming a scroll of one turn, which is attached to the aliethmoid above and below,
but is free in the middle.

The anterior turbinal (figs. 57, 75, 83, 84, and 157, A.7rb.) arises as a single,
somewhat oblique plate from the aliethmoid. Soon after its origin it turns caudad
(fig. 83), then cephalad, then caudad again, and finally curves forwards, forming a
single oblique scroll with an in-turned anterior border.

The anterior accessory turbinal (figs. 57, 77, 83, 84, 155, and 156, A.A.T7rb.),
arises dorsally as a narrow plate springing from the anterior turbinal near its origin
(fig. 83) ; it passes forwards and downwards, and merges into the hollow ingrowth of
