It
is perhaps more significant than elegant. But it was not
possible to found names upon specific properties not common
to both; and though a name for the basis of soda might have
been borrowed from the Greek, yet an analogous one could
not have been applied to that of potash, for the ancients do not
5eem to have distinguished between the two alkalies. The more caution is necessary in avoiding any theoretical
expression in the terms, because the new electro-chemical
phenomena that are daily becoming disclosed, seem distinctly
to shew that the mature time for a complete generalization of
chemical facts is yet far distant ; and though, in the explana-
tions of the various results of experiments that have been
detailed, the antiphlogistic solution of the phenomena has

been uniformly adopted, yet the motive for employing it has
been rather a sense of its beauty and precisian, than , a _convic-
tion of its permaneney and truth. , c

The discovery of the agencies of the, -gas8es oxtroved the
hypothesis of STaur. The knowledge of the powers and
effects of the etherial substances may at a future time, possibly
act a similar part with regard to the more refined and inge-
nious hypothesis of LavorsIeR ; but in the present state of qur
knowledge, it appears the best approximation that has been
made to a perfect logic of chemistry. Whatever future changes may take place in theory, there
seems however every reason to believe that the metallic bases
of the alkalies, and the common metals, will stand in the same
arrangement of substances: and as yet we have no good
reasons for assuming” the compound nature of this class of
bodies.*

The experiments in which it is said that alkalies, metallic
oxides, and earths may be formed from air and water alone,
in processes of vegetation, have been always made in an in-
conclusive manner ;Þ for distilled water, as T have endeavoured

* A phlogistic chemical theory might cettainly by defended; 'on the idea that the
metals are compounds of certain unknown bases with the same, matter as that exist-
ing in hydrogene; and the metallic oxides, alkalics and acids compounds of the same
bases with water ;—but in this theory more nnknown principles would be aszumed
than in the generally received theory.
