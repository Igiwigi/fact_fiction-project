In fact, the genetic distance between the gamma-type and
beta-type TM is great enough that it allows for the possibility
that they were acquired from independent sources, and that
their shared features are due to convergent evolution rather
due to than common ancestry. This situation has implications
for phylogenetic analyses, as alignments of non-homologous
sequences will not reveal valid evolutionary relationships.
For retroviral fossil hunters, this high degree of divergence
is fortuitous, because it allows even very degraded env
sequences to be readily categorized, simply by examining
whether a BLAST search using the sequence as a query turns
up one or the other env type. Class I and class II RT sequences,
by contrast, are much less divergent and are clearly homolo-
