114 DR. J. Y. MACKAY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF °

These facts, although probably widely known, do not seem to have been appreciated
in their relation to the question of the development of the vessels, inasmuch as it is
improbable that an artery running ventral to the vein and nerve, as does the subclavian
in Birds, can correspond in origin with a trunk which, asin Mammals, crosses dorsal to
these two structures. Only two observers, so far as I have been able to ascertain,
have taken notice of the different positions of the vessels. One of these, SABATIER,*
has been led to propose a scheme of development differing in some respects from that
of RaruxKe, while the other, BRENNER,t in a paper on vascular abnormalities, merely
notices the facts, and expresses a doubt as to the correctness of the accepted beliefs.

The intercostal arteries are directed chiefly from the aorta, but the first two or three
spring from the vertebral.
