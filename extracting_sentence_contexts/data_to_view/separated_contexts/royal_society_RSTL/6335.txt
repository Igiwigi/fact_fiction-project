In even the sfore Pig there was four times as much
of the total fat of the body, in the Carcass, as in the Offal parts; and in the fat Pig there
were from eight to nine times as much fat from the Carcass as from the Offal parts. The
general conclusion would seem to be then, that, perhaps on the average, three-fourths or
more of the total fat of a slaughtered animal, in good condition, will belong to the
carcass partsâ€”that is to say, to those parts which may be reckoned as almost entirely
devoted, in some form or other, as human food. It has been already seen in Table III, and the column illustrating the fact is repeated
in Table IV., that the percentage of fat in the collective Carcass parts of the fattened
animals amounted to from one-third to one-half, or even more, of the total weight of the
Carcass. We will now consider what was the proportion of the whole animadl at the time
of its being slaughtered, which was nearly, if not quite, pure fat. In the fifth column of Table IV., the percentage of total fat in the Fasted Live-weight
of the several animals has been calculated by the addition of the respective items
recorded in Table III.
