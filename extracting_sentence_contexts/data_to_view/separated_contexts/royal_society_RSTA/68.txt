in error in what is after all a small fraction of the total resistance and
moment of inertia—one which, in fact, is so true that neither the power of the
instrument maker nor our knowledge of the constants will prevent our introducing in
practice variations of far greater magnitude—may be allowed to pass, especially as
without something equivalent it would be impossible to find expressions which would
apply to the more complicated conditions which will be considered later.

The same considerations apply exactly to the sensitive plate, which, when the
greatest efficacy with respect to moment of inertia is required, should no longer be
made prismatic, but should become more narrow towards the ends, as shown in fig. 1.
I may mention that in the original instrument, which I made before I had arrived at
any of these results, I did, as a matter of fact, make the active bar of the shape
shown, because I felt that the lower corners were doing more harm by their moment
of inertia than they were doing good by their conductivity. Since the active plate is taken as one of the invariables of the circuit, any propor-
tions that may be desired may be taken for it, and the resulting resistance and
moment of inertia made use of in calculating numerical values. I have in the
arithmetical work which follows taken the active plate to be of the original shape and
size, that is, a rectangular prism, 10 X 5 X ‘25mm.
