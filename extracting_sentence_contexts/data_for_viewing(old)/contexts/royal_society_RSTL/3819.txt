Nevertheless, whatever may be its composition, the immersion of fragments of
phosphatic calculi in the liquid formed as before stated, was followed by very stri-
king resalts: rapid chemical action ensned, visible to the naked eye; when viewed
by means of a low microscopic power, vehement decomposing action was manifest,
the calculous particles becoming surrounded by areol or nebulce of white sediment,
which continued increasing until each fragment was reduced to a pulpy state resem-
bling mortar, perfectly soluble in very dilute nitric acid.

On snspending a fragment of fusible calculus, by means of horse-hair, in a test-
glass containing the fluid, it became at once involved in a white cloud, from which
a continuous stream of precipitate gravitated to the hottom of the glass. After the
lapse of half an hour the calculus was found to have lost weight. This was an import-
ant fact, without which it might have been supposed that decomposition of the s0Ju-
tion alone had given rise to the precipitate.

Being inclined to doubt the evidence of my senses, rather than arrive at a false
conelusion, I repeated the experiment. Another particle of triple phosphate was
placed in a fresh quantity of the liquid ; at the moment of immersion chemical action
commenced, and pursned the same course, until the fragment became a semi-solid
mass, readily disintegrated. After a time nothing remained but the shreds of mucus,
or other animal matter, which had cemented the earthy ingredients together.

The result of analogous experiments, performed subsequently, warrants me in sta-
