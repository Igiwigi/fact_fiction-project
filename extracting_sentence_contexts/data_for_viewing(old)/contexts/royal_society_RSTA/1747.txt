(2.4) shows that this will not affect the B-field generation rate as this term is curl-free, although it
will curtail B-field transport by the Nernst effect, which would be important in this set-up [17].

Figure 6 shows the Biermann-generated magnetic field after 60 ps using f = 0.05 and f = 0.15.
Although the resolution of these simulations was relatively poor as the flux limiter caused the
f =0.05 simulations to go unstable, a clear reduction is seen in B-field generation when the flux
limiter is increased from f = 0.05 and the B-field is more localized. Also shown in figure 6 are the
electron temperature profiles from the f = 0.05 and f = 0.15 CTC simulations after 60 ps as well as
lineouts of the B-field through the point of maximum field (at y=50 microns). The temperature
profiles show that the magnetic field is generated at the steep fall in the temperature due to the
artificial transport barrier for both f = 0.05 and f = 0.15 and is therefore unphysical. The line out
of the B-field shows that the line integral of the magnetic field is reduced by the flux limiter (often
this is the important variable), in fact the line integral of the magnetic field from x=0 to 100
microns is reduced by 20% for f = 0.15 compared to f = 0.05.

Finally we note that a situation similar to this 2D simulation set-up may be realizable
experimentally by inducing a density jump in a gas jet. This could be achieved by overlapping
two gas jets of differing pressure or by the presence of an obstacle in the gas jet (although the
latter would result in a shock).

4. Discussion

Here we have shown that two kinetic effects on the Biermann battery become important when the
electron mean free path can no longer be considered small compared to the electron temperature
gradient. This is due to the fact that LTE breaks down in this case and the electron distribution
