The separations
resulting are 705°93, 456°69, with F, (0) = 24590°13 and F,(o) = 2529606. If we
apply the rule shown in the preceding elements for F,;,(2), the denominator is
2°937300—2A, = 2°868676. Satellites depending on 30, 2d would give separations
51°44 and 34°20, and the fact that these separations occur in connection with
n = 17800 renders the identification of that for F (3) rather doubtful, a doubt which
is increased when we test the allocation by the law indicated above that the

differences of the denominators of F,,(m)—F,,(m+1) is always the same multiple of
A,, as is done below. The line 19897 has separation 689°33, and therefore should
have a satellite (too faint) 16°60 above it.
