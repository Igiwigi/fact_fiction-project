exceedingly simple: as ripeness approaches, certain cells of the thickened outer layer,
situated where the pore will be formed, may be distinguished by their smaller size,
both in surface view (fig. 16), and also in section (fig. 17); the thinner-walled cells
below begin to shrivel (fig. 18), forming thus an extension of the cavity of the
loculus upwards towards the surface; as this is approached, the smaller cells above
noted come apart (fig. 18), and as they themselves also shrivel, the result is a slit-
like pore, which assumes an irregular oval outline, being lined by the persistent
remains of the shrivelled cells (fig. 19), The actual rupture is thus seen to occur in
the cells immediately above the sporogenous group: these it will be remembered,
appear to have a common origin with the sporogenous group from an original parent
cell. It will be further noted that there is nothing here of the nature of an annulus;
there are no specially indurated, or hygroscopic cells, not even such as are found in
Angiopteris. In fact, with the exception of those plants in which the shedding of
the spores takes place in water, this mode of dehiscence is probably the simplest of
any Filicinese. And yet, as will be subsequently pointed out, it is fundamentally the
same type as holds for all other Marattiacez.

From the sections above described of sporangia just before the rounding off and
tetrad division, it is possible to estimate the approximate number of spore-mother-
cells ; and multiplying the number of these by four, the potential number of spores
of each sporangium may be arrived at : but in making estimates it is to be remem-
bered how variable the sporangia are in this genus. In an average example of
D. alata (fig. 14) there are 108 spore-mother-cells exposed in the single vertical
section ; fig, 15 shows that there are about 4 layers of them: the total number of
spore-mother-cells is therefore about 432, and the potential output of spores will be
