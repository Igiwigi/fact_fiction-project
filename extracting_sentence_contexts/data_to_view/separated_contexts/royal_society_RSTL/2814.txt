When the spectrum is viewed through nitrous acid gas the phenomena are $till
more remarkable. While the gas exerts a general absorbent action over the violet
extremity of the spectrum, it attacks it when in a diluted state in definite lines as
sharp and distinct as those in the solar spectrum ; and what is still more important,
it acts upon the same parts of light as the cause which produces the fixed lines in
the sun's spectrum. In other respects the character of its action is similar to that of
the blue glass and the green sap of plants,

In thus comparing the phenomena of absorption with those of thin plates, we find
no connecting link but that of giving a divided or a mutilated spectrum ; and even
this common fact has not the same character in both. In coloured media the bands
of light and darkness have no fixed relation, as in periodical colours; and the light
removed from the dark portions, as well as the tints from some of the coloured spaces,
have wholly disappeared, in place of being found in the reflected beam. I have already mentioned that by the aid of two substances I have been able to
study this subject under a new aspect, and that the nacreous substance described by
Mr. Horner was the one which first exhibited to me the connexion between absorp-
tion and periodical action.
