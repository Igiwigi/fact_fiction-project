transverse section (COA) the cells are seen to be fragmented and, while retaining evidence
of their regular arrangement, the junctions are “ telescoped ” into each other, so as to
produce a series of concentric arcs. A few of these fragments, cut somewhat obliquely,
are shown, greatly enlarged, in fig. 15 (No. 395). The bright fragments are the junctions
of the cell walls, the dark parts are the remains of the lumens. The stellate shape,
bounded by ares, and prolonged where the cells are cut obliquely, is characteristic of the
junctions of a broken cellular mass.

Comparison with fig. 16 (No. 393), which is part of a transverse section of the “ cortex
band,” shows the similarity in shape and disposition of the fibrous strands in the “ cortex
band.” ‘The concentric areas arise from the fracture of the “ cellules”’ of the cortex, and
the anastomoses of the strands correspond in shape and arrangement to the junctions
of the xylem cells. We have, in fact, a Dictyoxylon Bogen-struktur. The macro-
structure of the “cortex band” is therefore that of a fragmented Dictyoxylon cortex,
and the microstructure that of a heterogeneous periderm.

both Sigillarize and Lepidodendra, in which the periderm is often enormously developed.
