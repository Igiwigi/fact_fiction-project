As the paradoxical aspect is the
sehaviour of real people, however, these arguments are valid, and all means of
disposing of the paradox could be similar in character. While Bernoulli’s observations of human risk aversion and even the functional
form he proposed for modelling these are ‘correct’ in a specific sense elaborated in
86, these behavioural regularities have a physical reason that Bernoulli failed to
point out. In fact, it appears that he was not aware of this physical reason, which
justifies only ug(w) =In(w). Bernoulli {1, p. 33] did not consider the anit’
form of utility essential and wrote of Cramer’s work, which uses uc(w) = /w:
‘Indeed I have found his theory so similar to mine that it seems miraculous that
we independently reached such close agreement on this sort of subject’.

5. Ergodicity

The question of ergodicity in stochastic systems is concerned with a conceptual
choice in giving meaning to quantitative probabilities.
