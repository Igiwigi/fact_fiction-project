I now beg to submit to the consideration of the Society the results of a careful
examination of these fossils, and of other illustrative specimens in the collections of
my friends, in the hope that this addition to the previously recorded knowledge of
the osteology of the Wealden Reptiles, will be found to possess considerable physio-
logical interest and importance. The fragmentary and isolated condition of the os8eouns relics found imbedded in
the fluviatile deposits of the South-East of England, affords a sufficient excuse for
error in the interpretation of a piece of bone, or in the reference of an entire hone to
a particular genus or species. My own mistakes in this respect I shall unreseryedly
point out, and I would fain hope that other labourers in the same department of
natural history, but of far higher authority, will not hesitate, after the noble example
of the illustrious Cuvies, to make similar admissions ; for it is only by substituting
truth for error, and facts for hypotheses, that correct principles of palzontology can
be established. The fossils in my possession consist of seyeral bones of the extremities and pectoral
arch, and of cervical, dorsal, and caudal vertebre of the Iguanodon, equal if not
surpassing in magnitude any previously discovered; and portions of the sacrum of
individuals of different ages; together with dermal and other bones of the Hylao-
saurus, Goniopholis, &. The recent acquisition of some of these relics excited in
my mind a desire to renew the attempt to construct the skeleton of the colossal reptile
whose remains were first brought to light by my early geological researches in Tilgate
Forest.
