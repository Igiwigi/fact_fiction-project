Finally, a comparison of the composition of the estimated consumable portions of
the fattened animals, with that of wheat-flour bread, led to the conclusion that,
taking into consideration the much higher oxidable capacity of the fat of the animal
food than of the starch of the bread, the animal food contributed a considerably
higher proportion of non-nitrogenous substance, reckoned as starch, to one of nitro-
genous 8ubstance, than bread. We aid :—* It would appear to be unquestionable,
therefore, that the influence of the introduction of our staple animal foods, to
supplement our otherwise mainly farinaceous diet, is, on the large scale, to reduce, and
not to inerease, the relation of the assumed flesh-forming material, to the more
peculiarly respiratory and fat forming capacity, 80 to speak, of the food consumed.” It was concluded that the admitted advantages of a mixed animal and yegetable
diet were essentially connected with the amount, the condition, and the distribution
of the fat in the animal portions of the food ; that concentration and digestibility
were probably elements in the explanation of the facts ; that the liberal distribution
of the ready-formed fat with the transforming nitrogenous matters throughout the
body, will modify the character of the changes constantly going on ; and that the
difference in the condition of the nitrogenous substance in the animal and vegetable
foods, has also to be taken into account. Quantity and Compoxition of the Mineral Matter (As) in certain separated parts, and
in the entire bodies, of the ten, animals analysed. In our former paper the actual quantity of ash was given for the bones, and for
certain oft parts separately, of the carcass ; also for each separate internal organ, and
