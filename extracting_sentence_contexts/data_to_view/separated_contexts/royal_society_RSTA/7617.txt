The state
of the quartz surface, that is, whether it is drawn, fused, or polished, is of very much
greater importance. In the final microbalance, for instance, the ratio of the two
surfaces at each end of the beam was about three to four, the larger surface being
the blown buoyancy bulb and the smaller a fused quartz coverslip. This is prob-
ably due to the fact that the bulb has a more continuous surface than the coverslip,
which had presumably been rolled, and was therefore slightly pitted or corrugated. Evidence in favour of this view was gained in the final compensation, when a number
of bulbs of different sizes was tried. It was found in one case that a small, rather
imperfectly blown bulb with a quite definite “ bloom” on its surface adsorbed
more sulphur dioxide than a bulb of larger radius with a smooth, clean surface.
