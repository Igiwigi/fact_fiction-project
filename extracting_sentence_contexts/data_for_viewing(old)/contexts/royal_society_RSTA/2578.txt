I am not trying to question the uppermost historical significance of Euclid’s book, which
questioned the standards of proofs accepted before that time, and which set new standards for
many centuries to come. Quite amazingly, many proofs in the later books, including Euclid’s
proof of the infinitude of primes, are proofs even for us.

e Actually, even at the university level people rarely seriously contemplate the proofs they
are telling to their students in the elementary courses. Thus, until very recently most of
the proofs in undergraduate Analysis courses suffered from systematic delusions related
to the incorrect use of infinity, that survived from the early twentieth century.

A crucial fact, used to establish the equivalence of continuity in terms of sequences and in terms
of neighbourhoods, is that any infinite set contains a countable subset. Here is the usual proof,
to which generations of students were exposed. Let X be an infinite set. Since it is infinite, it is
non-empty, and thus contains a point x;. Then the set X \ {x1} is still infinite and thus contains
a point x2 # x1. Proceeding in the same way, we eventually get a countable subset {x1,x2,x3,..-}
of X.

This ‘proof’ is short and crystal clear. This is why colleagues in Analysis used to overreact
when challenged by the simple fact that in this form, without additional assumptions, the proof is
completely wrong—as are most other naive arguments using ’...’ in similar sloppy fashion.

What this argument does indeed prove is that X contains an arbitrarily large finite subset
{x1,...,Xn}, which is called mathematical induction. Using some form of the axiom of choice, one
