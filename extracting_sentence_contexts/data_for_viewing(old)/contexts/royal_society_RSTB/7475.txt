the main facts are recorded in table 3 and in the figures.

Discussion AND CONCLUSIONS

From the experiments on Rhoeo discolor reported above and from observations made on
normal plants, information has been obtained with regard to three main questions. These
questions concern the manner in which a leaf primordium is determined and develops,
the factors locating the position in which a primordium is determined and the causes of
the asymmetry of the primordium. They will now be discussed in turn.

As to the first questicn the evidence indicates that in Rhoeo the centre of a primordium
or a small central region is determined first and that from this centre the flanks extend
round the apex until they meet. For the fact that in Rhoeo the flanks of P, continued to
extend round the apex after the centre of P; had been removed shows that once this
extension has begun it does not depend on the presence of the centre. It might, indeed,

be suggested that the whole area occupied by P, had been determined to form a leaf
before the centre was removed and was only gradually occupied by the flanks; but the
results of some other experiments in which the apex was split do not support this suggestion.
In these experiments, which will be more fully reported later, the split was made at right
angles to the median plane of P,. When the operation was made early in the plastochron
at a stage when P, subtended less than 180Â° the whole visible part of the leaf was confined
