The chief physiological inferences deducible from a spiral form of the finest
threads of mnscle, will I think be obvious. At all events, it would be premature for
me to introduce remarks on this subject at any length, before my researches are con-
firmed by those of other observers. Yet there are two or three conclusions that
seem called for, in connection with the foregoing facts.

51, Every one knows that in proportion as a spiral is shortened, the spaces between
the curves of the spiral are made smaller, and the diameter of the spiral expands :
while, in proportion as the spiral is lengthened, as by removing further asunder its
two ends, the spaces between the curves of the spiral are made greater, and the dia-
meter of the spiral is diminished. This may serve to illustrate what takes place in a
musele ; which is no other than a yast bundle of spirals: showing that the musele in
contraction should be short and thick ; while upon the other hand, in relaxation it
should be long and thin (compare « and Þ in fig. 66). DR.
