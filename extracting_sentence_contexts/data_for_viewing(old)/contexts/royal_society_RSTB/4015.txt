whose inheritance was maternal in 1909-11 and paternal in 1912, material only of
1912 was examined, so that it is impossible to say if the difference of inheritance
between 1909-11 and 1912 was correlated with differences of elimination.

6. The elimination of chromosomes is connected with the formation of chromatin
vesicles.

14. Sea TEMPERATURE AS AFFECTING INHERITANCE, ETC.

In a previous section we have stated that in 1912 the inheritance in hybrids made
with Z. miliaris as the maternal parent was different from what it had been in
former years. That this changed inheritance was due to some factor operating on
the germ cells before fertilization is indicated by various facts which are fully stated
in Section 16 (see p. 342). The conclusion was forced upon us that some environ-
mental condition had so changed the female germ cells of E. miliaris that they no
longer transmitted the characteristics of the species to hybrid offspring.

In this section we suggest that there may be a connection between the changes in
temperature of the inshore waters, during the winters preceding the experiments,
and the types of inheritance found in the hybrids. A set of curves is given showing
the temperature of the sea-water at Plymouth for the years embraced by our
experiments. They cover each year the period for Hehinus during which the germ
cells are undergoing growth and maturation. They have been constructed from
weekly means, furnished us by the Meteorological Office, obtained from temperatures
taken daily from the end of the Promenade Pier, Plymouth. They correspond but
