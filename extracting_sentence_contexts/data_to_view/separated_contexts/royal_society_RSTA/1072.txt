This is what I call quantum causality. In the EPR case, it is only possible to
establish both complementary quantities for two EPR pairs, (S11, S12) and (S21, S22), and never
for one; and if we had predicted the second quantity, instead of the first one, for S12, it would not,
in general, be the same as it is for S72, although predictions concerning them would still be made
with probability one. That QM correctly make these predictions is crucial, because it reflects the
fact that it is a falsifiable and (as things stand now) correct theory of quantum phenomena. This
situation is, however, inherently statistical: if we repeat the experiment for yet another identically
prepared pair, say, (S31, S32), So as to make predictions concerning the position of S37, we can
make such a prediction (ideally) exactly, but the outcome of the measurement on $39, will not in
general be the same as for S}2 or S22. This argument could be transferred, with a few easy adjustments, to Bohmâ€™s version of
the EPR experiment and spin variables.
