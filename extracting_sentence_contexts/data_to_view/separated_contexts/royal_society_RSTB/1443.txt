Shere is evidence in each tracing of corresponding contracture and depression of irrita-
Shility. The only difference is that the final loss of irritability produced by isobutyl-
Sildoxime is reached somewhat earlier than that produced by isonitrosoacetone.
2 As previously pointed out, the inverse relationship exists between isonitrosoacetone
spn propylaldoxime, and whilst thus occupying a position between these two aldoximes,
‘Bhe toxicity of isonitrosoacetone more nearly approaches that of the isobutyl compound. Bhis latter fact may be further illustrated by fig. 55.
3 The tracing shows the action on a frog’s muscle of a 1 per cent. solution of
“gsonitrosoacetone and may be compared with fig. 30, which shows the action of a
2 per cent. solution of propylaldoxime. The muscle immersed in the solution of
@sonitrosoacetone lost irritability in three quarters of an hour, and the muscle in the
Prvylaldoxime solution lost irritability in an hour and thirty-eight minutes.
