identical size and appearance in all early stages; but the two lateral members are
lower down than the other four. In fact McNas (1872) missed them altogether, as
Ss they would not be seen from above. There is no evidence that the lateral stamens are
5 in any way different from the others or arise earlier; if they represented a normal
rs outer whorl, they should be developed earlier and be always growing ata greater rate

a than the others. They establish normal contact relations, and the appearances seen
are identical with those of six equal primordia as in the general case of Angiosperm
floral development. That is to say, the six rounded primordia extend to just touch
a all round the ellipsoidal axis. The fact that the whorl droops as it were on the two
6 sides is clearly the expression of fact that the floral axis is (1) tangentially extended,
iS and (2) under considerable pressure, pinched as it were in its rounder median portion ;
gg the periphery of the mass has freer conditions of growth, and what should have been

& _ When members (1) arise simultaneously, (2) make similar and normal lateral contacts,
3 (3) grow at an identical rate, they must be regarded as morphologically identical, and

S phyllotaxis-constructions ; there are no others. The floral axis is here ellipsoidal in
% section instead of being centric, and the whorl droops laterally as it were around the

g series obtains instead of the ring of the more usual centric system. The rounded apex
oa with the two lateral stamens low down on its flanks now explains why the vascular
og bundles which will supply them are subsequently seen to be lower in the axis than
