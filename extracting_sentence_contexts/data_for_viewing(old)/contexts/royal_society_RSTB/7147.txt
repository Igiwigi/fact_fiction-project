tioning as an organ of equilibrium by virtue of its gyroscopic properties. Fraenkel (1939)
published details of his experiments on Muscidae at about the same time as Braun (1939)
produced a comprehensive comparative account of the morphology and results of extirpa-
tion in Brachycera, the two authors drawing different conclusions about the function of
the halteres. It is clear, therefore, that no agreement has yet been reached.

The suggestion (Fraenkel & Pringle 1938) that it is the gyroscopic properties of a moving
mass that provide the haltere with its special features as a sense organ was derived from
a study of the detailed anatomy of the organ, and has been confirmed by experiments.
Since there is, so far.as is known, no other structure anywhere in the animal kingdom
(except possibly the similar organ in Strepsiptera (Ulrich 1930) ; see also Wigglesworth 1946)
in which this particular physical property is employed, it has been necessary to include
a treatment of the dynamics involved. The fact that the moving mass of the haltere oscil-
lates rather than rotates makes even the physical problem a novel one, and no reference
could be found in mathematical literature to any treatment of the theory of such a system;
this has therefore been worked out from first principles (see appendix II). It is necessary
to have a clear picture of the dynamics of the haltere in order to appreciate the validity
of the experiments described later in the paper.

The hypothesis that the halteres of Diptera are gyroscopic organs of equilibrium applies
generally to the whole group. Differences in structure between different flies make it
difficult to judge of the effectiveness of the organ in some families, and the descriptions
and discussion in this paper refer particularly to the higher muscid flies, on which most of
the new investigations have been made. Braun (1939) established clearly the correlation
between the degree of development of the halteres and the power of flight, and it may be
