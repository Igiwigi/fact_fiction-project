The esker in places shows the arched bedding, which is often claimed as
characteristic of true eskers. ‘The material is in places finer-grained on the western
slope, while the bedding is steepest on the eastern front. Some of the large lenticles
of gravel are coarsest to the south, but the included rocks indicate that the material
came from the north or north-west—a fact previously recorded by Carver Lewis
(1894, p. 149). Glacial strive are said to be not uncommon on the stones, and
Prof. Szymour and I noticed clear glacial grooves on the boulders in the lower part
of the esker.
