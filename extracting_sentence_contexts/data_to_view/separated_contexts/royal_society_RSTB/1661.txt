Both currents can excite the tissue, but it appeared that the homodromous must
be more intense than the heterodromous in order to secure this excitation, a fact
previously referred to in connection with the galvanometer experiments, and
interesting since the partial immunity of this organ to electrical currents, unlike that
of Torpedo,* is evidently more pronounced for currents of a direction similar to those
of its own activity. The records of the response resemble, in their general features, those previously
described, but differ, inasmuch as they are fused with the residuum of the induced
current. The response to homodromous stimulation will be referred to in detail later, as it
presents certain special features.
