When it comes to the deformed algebra A needed for a curved space-time, we have to allow that no
specific ket-space |...) be singled out globally to represent the algebra, as in §5, but that we might
have different such representations, each defined only ‘locally’, in some sense, but where the
‘Heisenberg algebra’ would be independent of the particular |. . .) representation, and isomorphic,
locally, to that provided at the end of §5, namely A. A central question arises here, concerning the
appropriate meaning of ‘local’ in this context. Although these issues are not yet fully resolved,
we do have the (Hausdorff) space NV defined globally, and we have a well-defined notion of local
neighbourhoods within V.

In fact, assigned to each single point of PN, i.e. to each ray y in M (and therefore also to each
point I of N, providing a z-scaling for y), there is a canonically and conformally invariantly
defined flat twistor space T,,, which plays a role of a kind of ‘complex cotangent space’ to NV at
I’. This is obtained from the notions of a local twistor, and local twistor transport [2]. A local twistor
is a quantity Z% = (w“, 1), defined at a point q of the space-time M, which transforms as

under a rescaling of M’s metric, according to gay +> Kore Sab. Since a local twistor is a quantity that
can be assigned separately to each point of M, we need to be careful when relating this concept
to the notion of twistor used earlier, in §§1-3, where the 2-spinor pair (w4, 14’) referred globally to
the (flat) space-time M, assigning coordinates to the complex 4-space T that is associated with M.
The notation in this section does correspond exactly to that of §§1-3, but only if we think of q as
at the particular space-time origin point O.
