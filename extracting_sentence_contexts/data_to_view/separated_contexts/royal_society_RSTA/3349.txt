If life is, in fact, a means to dissipate free energy, one would expect that the mechanisms
behind all its universal properties involve free energy-driven non-equilibrium processes. One
of these universal features of life is homochiralityâ€”the fact that all the chiral amino acids used
by terrestrial biology are left handed (the sugars are right handed). The fact that this effect is
not a mere enantiomeric excess is surprising and requires a detailed explanation. Our recent
work [5] shows that homochirality emerges as a consequence of a rather general characteristic
of life: autocatalysis/self-replication driven by an external source of energy. The consequence of
the chiral symmetry breaking of biopolymers is that it is possible for them to make higher order
structures, such as the supercoiling and packing of DNA, something that would be very difficult
for racemic molecules.
