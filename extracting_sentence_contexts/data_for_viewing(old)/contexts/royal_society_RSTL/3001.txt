Graafian vesicles even of the Ox.

91. I have now gone through a minute description of the parts concerned in pro-
ducing those appearances denominated by Vox Barr the *cumulus” and *disec,” as
figured in Plate VII. fig. 62., and Plate VIII. fig. 80. If these figures, taken from
that author}, be contrasted with g? of my own figures in Plate VII., and particularly
of fig. 55., it will be obvious that the *cumulus” of Barn is made up of what I have
called the tunica granulosa, and the central portion of the retinacula; and that the
band-like portions collectively of what I have called the retinacula, mainly contribute
to present the appearance denominated the *flat disc” by Bars.

is rendered probable by the fact, that when gentle compression has in some degree displaced this vexicle, it re-
sumes its previous situation as 800n as the pressure has been removed. This fact was observed by Professor
Bax, but from not having seen the true form of the structures here called the retinacula, he was not in a con-
dition to explain it,

One of the figures now referred to, from the Dog (Plate VIII. fig. 66.), presents four ova in one Graafian
vesicle, which number, as well as three, I have repeatedly met with in this animal. Professor VALevTIN has
also figured three in one Graafian vesicle of the Dog (Dissertation by Bxzxnarvr, ©*Symbolz,” &c., fig. vii.).
Two ova are very frequently present in the same Graafian vesicle in this animal; but in the Ferret (Mustela
Furo) this is till more frequently the case. In the last-mentioned animal indeed I saw in many instances
three, and not rarely four, ova in one Graafian vesicle. When this is the case, it is not unusual to find one or
two ova apparently defective. To explain the existence of a plurality of ova in one Graafian vesicle, we must
suppose that in 8uch instances the membrane of the ovisac forms around, and thus includes in one cavity, the
granulous enyelopes of a corresponding number of germinal vesicles (23.).
