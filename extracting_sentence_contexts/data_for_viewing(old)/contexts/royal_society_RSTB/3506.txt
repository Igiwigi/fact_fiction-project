alternation may occur throughout the length of an arm and in all the arms of one
specimen, ‘The facts observed certainly suggest that this character is a variable one in
the species. To obtain an idea of the form of the ambulacral ossicles, evidence from
many specimens must be pieced together. They were apparently more or less
rectangular, the members of a pair being in contact only at their anterior and
posterior ends ; their inner (radial) borders were thickened, appearing as a raised
triangular area on the dorsal surface of the ossicle. The adambulacral pieces consist
of a stalk lying in the plane of the actinal surface of the ossicle, and a spine-bearing
bar, which curved back over the dorsal surface, so that the spines lay over the
thinner regions of the ambulacral ossicles. On the actinal surface, the ambulacral
