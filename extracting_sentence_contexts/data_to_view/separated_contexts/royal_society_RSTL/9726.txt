C., viz.: from 00007317 to 00009474. B It will be noticed in the case of this alloy, which differs from the preceding one
S(Cugl, 2AglT) by containing nearly 10 per cent. more of iodide of silver and nearly 10
Sper cent. less of iodide of copper —(1) that the contraction takes, place through the
=same range of temperature (65* C.), beginning, however, 19* C. lower ; (2) that the
£ coefficient of expansion above the point at which contraction finishes is the same ; (3)
E that the specific gravity and fusing point are practically the same. In fact, the almost
Ss0le effect "of the additional 10 per cent. of iodide of silver has been to increase the
Zeoeſſicient of contraction between 214* C. and 280* C.
a
SZ 27. The addition of the fourth molecule of AgT in Cuglz,4Agl raises the percentage
Sof Agl to 71:2225, and the effect has been—
(a) To diminish the coefficient of expansion below 159* C. to 00001999, and

& between 159* C. and 180? C. to 00001056.

(b) To annul the coefficient of expansion between 180?
