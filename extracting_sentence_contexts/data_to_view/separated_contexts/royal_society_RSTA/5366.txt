How were physicists able to solve this difficult problem without actually doing
the computations in algebraic geometry? The short answer is: by placing the
enumerative problem in the right physical context. Within quantum theory it
makes perfect sense to combine all the numbers Ny into a single generating

function
F(g) => Naaâ€™.
d

In fact, this function has a straightforward physical interpretation. It can be seen
as a probability amplitude for a string to propagate in the Calabi-Yau space
X. In quantum theory one has to operate under the fundamental principle of
summing over all possible histories with a weight given by the classical action.
