g §1. In a previous paper,* called E, for brevity, I discussed the results obtained for
= the diurnal variation of the potential gradient of atmospheric electricity at Kew
Observatory from 1898 to 1904. The present paper deals with the same subject, but
employs data from the fifteen year’s 1898 to 1912. The earlier period of seven years,
though longer than that available at most observatories, was too short to give a
satisfactorily representative presentation of some of the phenomena. To obtain results
fairly characteristic of the locality many years data are required of some of the
meteorological elements, especially barometric pressure and rainfall. For the latter
element, in fact, a considerably longer period is desirable than that available even now
for potential gradient at Kew. The same may be true of potential gradient itself, but
various reasons exist for not waiting longer. Owing to building operations, the
electrograph results for 1913 were exposed to special uncertainties. Also the transfer
of the electrograph from the position it has‘occupied since 1898 is now in contemplation.
Thus 1912 may be regarded as ending an epoch.
