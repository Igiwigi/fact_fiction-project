squamous portion in mammals, concludes that the zygomatic portion of that bone
represents the quadrate bone, but, as we have seen that the squamosal in Anomodonts
has the same relation to the skull, and to the lower jaw, as in Mammals, this interpre-
tation has no support in the Anomodontia.

Professor Cope has described the quadrate bone of Clepsydrops natalis as having a
horizontal ramus, which he affirms to be “nothing more than the zygomatic process
of the squamosal bone of the Mammalia forming with the malar bone the zygomatic
arch.” But, from the fact that in the Dicynodontia and Theriodontia the squamosal
bone always takes the development and function here attributed by Core to the
quadrate, there is an @ priori improbability that a type so nearly allied to the
Anomodontia should present a fundamentally different structure, when the external
characters are described as similar. It is difficult to suppose there has been any error
in the interpretation of the facts, since Professor Cops, in 1870, recognized the
quadrate bone in a South African Anomodont skull ; but in the absence of figures it
is impossible to judge of the evidence on which the interpretation rests.

A feature which specially distinguishes the Dicynodont skull from the skulls of
allied animals is the enormous development of the squamosal bone, and, although
it is difficult to speak with confidence on a matter that is necessarily hypothetical, it
