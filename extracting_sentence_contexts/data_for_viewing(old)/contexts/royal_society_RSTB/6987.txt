The Triassic Foraminifera are not at all well known, perhaps in part because the
conditions indicated by the sediments of that age were often unsuitable for their
colonization and preservation. But the precursors of the Lias, as contrasted with the
Palaeozoic forms, seem to have been in process of establishing themselves.

The Lias is largely a clay formation, in the muddy conditions of which Foraminifera
often thrived. Afterwards their shells were well preserved in the same medium. This
favourable environment seems to have led to a rapid evolution of new types, most
particularly noticeable in the Lagenidae, which so largely dominate the Lias fora-
miniferal fauna. As a result of this rapid evolution, with an abundant population,
difficulties are found in the naming of many specimens of this family, which seem to
show a wider variation within the group than is often the case. In fact, the ‘species’,
and sometimes the ‘genera’ also, are by no means sharply defined.

Certain authors have endeavoured to describe such Lias faunas by the multiplica-
tion of trivial names. By the nature of the problem these forms are generally ill-defined
and insufficiently differentiated from neighbouring species both in nature and by their
authors. A natural consequence of this is that the greater the number of such similar
species that are proposed, the more do intermediate specimens become unnameable.

As explained below (p. 29), the view is here taken that it is preferable to subdivide
these ill-defined aggregates of a population rather broadly, using few trivial names, and
allowing considerable variation to each species. Even so it is sometimes a matter of
opinion as to what name to use for a given specimen. This view is supported by the
