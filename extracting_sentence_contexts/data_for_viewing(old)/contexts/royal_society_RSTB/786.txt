in the tissues, any trace of animal tissue being destroyed by the concentrated caustic
potash, nor does it permit the use of collodion. We had at this stage to content
ourselves with the examination of the brown amorphous masses in the tissues, and of
the decolourized particles after removal from them.

Professor Oxtver,* however, brought to our notice the use of Hau de Javelle as a
clearing re-agent superior to caustic potash for vegetable structure. Its application in
our case was most successful. If the black particles are dehydrated, embedded in
collodion, and cut, and the sections are then steeped in the Haw de Javelle for from
two to five minutes, or until gas bubbles begin to appear in them, it will be found that
the fungus has been rendered beautifully transparent, whilst remains of the original
animal tissue are still visible. In fact, within certain limits this re-agent has very
little action upon the animal tissue, and thus at once permits the study of the clarified
fungus in relation to its surroundings. It suffices for this purpose that a portion of
the tissue containing the black masses should be thoroughly dehydrated in absolute
alcohol, then transferred to ether, and subsequently to collodion. The collodion is
allowed to concentrate, and the impregnated mass is hardened in methylated chloro-
form, and cut. The sections are washed in the Haw de Javelle until almost all the
colour has disappeared from the particles; they are then rinsed in plenty of distilled
water and stained with logwood or hematoxylin. No matter how old the specimen,
and we have examined the oldest in this country, the results are always the same.

The following are the results obtained from an examination of seven specimens of
the black variety.t
