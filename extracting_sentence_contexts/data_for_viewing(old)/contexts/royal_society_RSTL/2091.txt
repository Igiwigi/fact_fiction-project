So unexpected a result naturally induced me at first to
attribute it to some error in the observations ; but on repeat-
ing it many times, and having measured the greatest error
which the means I employed were susceptible of when used
even a little carelessly, I found that half a degree was the
greatest error I could make in reading off the oscillations, and
that this retrograde motion was in many cases equal to three,

four, or five degrees; so that the measure of the observed
fact was from four to eight. times the extent of the greatest
possible error of observation, even admitting it to take place
at both extremities. It is/true, I did not always observe this
retrograde motion ; but in twenty experiments the needle,
screen and plate, not being always at the same relative dis-
tances, I noticed it seventeen times. The next step seemed
to be to find some mode of encreasing the unequal distribu-
tion of electricity on the metallic plate, supposing that to be
the cause of the phenomena. I therefore made a very small
lamp, which being lighted, was placed on the stage L of the
revolving apparatus, immediately under the copper. It was
afterwards found convenient to make a small aperture in the
lower millboard cylinder, just opposite the platform support-
