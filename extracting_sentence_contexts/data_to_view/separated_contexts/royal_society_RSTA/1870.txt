Darwin's theory

A key property that the theory of evolution shares with Mendeleev’s periodic table is that it
is based on observed facts. Darwin’s virtue, and the key to his success, was his remarkable
command of the diverse facts that define the natural history of plants and animals, living and
extinct. Darwin organized these facts to propose a process, natural selection, to explain how
species change over time. It is not mere speculation about how species form. The facts behind
natural selection are: (1) all organisms produce many more offspring than are required to replace
themselves in the next generation.
