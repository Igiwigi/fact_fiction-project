gemmules are so obscured by their progeny that they are almost certain to be over-
looked, and special methods are necessary to detect them. They are there, however—
at least, recognisable remains of them are (fig. 18).

The tubercle, when all its cells have undergone the above changes, now passes into
a state of rest: it is a mass of cells full of yeast-cells—gemmules, germs —so tiny*
that they might well be, as they were, mistaken for Bacteria. The rotting of the
root and tubercle liberates these into the soil, and an extended acquaintance with
these “ germs” and their numbers leads one to feel no surprise if they turn out to be
the ubiquitous germs which it has been suggested must exist to account for the
universality of the root tubercles.

Speculation apart, however, I have the following facts to offer. I made several
attempts last year to infect the roots of the Bean by laying pieces of the tubers on
the young rootlets of water-cultures. The success was only partial and doubtful, and
the results did not seem sufficiently satisfactory to be worth recording. At the end
of the summer I collected a number of the Bean-roots which had tubercles on them,
and dried them; these I kept through the autumn and winter, and made further
experiments in January, February, and March of this spring (1887). Several of the
infected plants had already developed several typical tubercles in March and April,
and indeed the preparations from which figs. 7-9 and 11-13 were made have been
obtained from these artificially infected tubercles. I have since repeated these
experiments with marked success.

The most curious feature about the matter is, perhaps, the long “period of
