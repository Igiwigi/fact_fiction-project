In a subsequent survey of haphazard natural
these are found in the signal peptide or pro-peptide regions. For collections taken between 2008 and 2014, the allele frequencies

example, between D. melanogaster and D. simulans, we find nine continue to match those observed in 2001 (SM Rottschaefer &


BP Lazzaro 2015, unpublished data). The fact that the derived
threonine allele also segregates in D. simulans (employing the
same codon sequence) is intriguing, although the threonine
state is rare in D. simulans (0.05% observed frequency). In the Attacin A/B locus, a lack of reciprocal monophyly
between D. simulans and D. mauritiana is suggestive of intro-
gression through hybridization between species (electronic
supplementary material, figure S1). However, a systematic
study of introgression patterns between the two species [33]
did not report any of the Attacin genes as having a signature
of recent introgression, indicating that, if these regions are
introgressed, either the introgression was ancient and this poly-
morphism has persisted or the introgressed region was too
small to be classified as such in the previous study.
