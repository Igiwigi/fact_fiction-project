therefore arranged our experimental method so as to investigate these phenomena in
their entirety. It is impossible to give a full explanation of all the results we have
obtained, because the functions of the medulla are not yet fully understood, and
therefore, whatever hypotheses we have advanced on these points in this paper, have
been inserted merely for the sake of clearness, and are fully open, of course, to future
revision. However, the recorded tracings of all the experiments show so clearly that
a diminished activity of the medulla occurs as a definite sequence of events contem-
poraneously with increase in the intra-cranial pressure, that we regard this fundamental
fact to be established ; therefore the value of the results, as regards the estimation of
the effect of increased pressure, is independent of exact knowledge of the mode
of their production. Further, we believe that our experiments have an important
general bearing, in that they show how the three “ centres ” regulating the heart rate,
the blood pressure, and the respiration, can be impeded or arrested, either together, or
almost separately, and consequently the varying influences they have the one on the
other can be estimated with an approximation to accuracy.

2. Historical Retrospect.

Of course an immense number of researches have been made in investigation of the
general subject of intra-cranial pressure and compression of the brain, but for the
present purpose, with the view of avoiding confusion, we have selected only those
