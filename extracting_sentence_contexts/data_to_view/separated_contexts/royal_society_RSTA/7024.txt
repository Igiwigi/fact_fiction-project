It is next shown that, ifa line parallel to OP and at a distance A/OP from it has an intercept
less than OP cut off by @, or @, then #â€™ cannot exist. This condition is seen to be satisfied
if P lies in [A), F\, 1] or [B,, F\, 4]. From this fact theorem 2 follows for R of type III also
(see figure 5). For R of type IV there is still the possibility that P lies in [4 F,, 4]. A sufficient condition
to exclude this is seen to be provided by theorem 3.
