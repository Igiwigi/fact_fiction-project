Hence they are probably chiefly acti

powers directed to the production of a bactericidal, or at least antibiotic, substance. I

AND BEHAVIOUR OF THE WANDERING CELLS OF THE FROG. 313

* Section IX. The facts brought forward in the preceding sections lead to certain conclusions as
9 the morphological position and physiological attributes to be accorded to the

poradic mesoblast.
# Morphology. BD

In the Frog, the sporadic mesoblast consists of three kinds of cells, the eosinophile

ell, the hyaline cell, and the rose-reacting cell, together with the red corpuscles and

tttelets. Of the two latter, we, personally, can say nothing from our own know-
; nor have we any reason beyond the general facts of their distribution in the

, ly, for placing them in the same morphological group with the three first-named
ents.* Leaving then the red corpuscles and platelets out of account, we find
hgt the sporadic mesoblast of the Frog contains elements precisely similar to those
hich compose the similar tissue of such a widely divergent animal as Astacus.
