There are, however,
several matt yellow patches on the hind wings, which remain the same colour at
all angles. The strive of these scales are tooth-shaped (see Plate 3, fig. 30),
though not quite so coarse and comb-like as those on the corresponding patches
of O. poseidon. No colour, except that due to pigment, ean be produced by
structures of this description, but careful examination reveals the fact that the
transition to other portions of the wing is not so abrupt as was thought. Indeed,
scales may be found in which the triangular striz are so acute and compressed
that they become approximately parallel-sided plates. Moreover, with the best
apochromatic objectives, and in thin sections, it can be seen that in most scales
the pillars appear to have pointed or acute-angled tops, as shown in Plate 3,
