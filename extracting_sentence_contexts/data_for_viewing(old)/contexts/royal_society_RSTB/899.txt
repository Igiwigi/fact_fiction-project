zygapophysis ; in width it is 13 millims. at the front and 14 millims. at the bac
The corresponding measurements of the second vertebra are—length 10°5 millim
width in front 11°5 millims., at the back 12°5 millims, The remaining vertebra
the series are crowded together, and partly pushed one over the other.
On each side of the vertebree are to be seen long slender processes dire
backwards, and so regularly arranged as to impress one with the belief that
were processes fixed to the vertebra, and not loosely attached ribs, which are usuall
found curving backwards in quite another fashion. I cannot be certain as to th
point of attachment of these processes, but it seems to have been near the hinder en
of each vertebra. The diminution in size of the posterior vertebra and the presene
of these transverse processes leads to the inference that they belong to the caud
region, and that somewhere in front of them the pelvic girdle would be found. As
matter of fact portions of bones have been uncovered in this region, but, unfortunately
nothing that can be definitely assigned to any part of the pelvis or limbs.
These caudal vertebree are of Lacertilian type, and the question naturally arises, ca
they be referred to either of the skeletons above described, or to any of the form
known to occur in the Elgin Sandstone of other localities. They are too small for an
known example of Hyperodapedon and much too large for Telerpeton, but woule
agree in size with some of the specimens here included in the genus Gordonia, and
might have belonged to such a form as G. Duffiana. Tt seems quite possible the
it may really be part of the specimen so named (Plate 31), but there is no informatio!
to justify this supposition, and for the present this specimen is simply referred t
Gordonia.
