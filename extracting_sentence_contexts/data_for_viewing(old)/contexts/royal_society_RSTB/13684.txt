mutual transitions between the non-punishing and the pro-
socially punishing variants, indicating a minor but present
role for the latter in preserving cooperation. This cooperative
environment relies on the regular influx of mutant strategists
to mitigate the second-order free-rider problem, moderating
the cyclical dynamics it induces. New punishing agents intro-
duced into the population are progressively transformed into
the non-punishing variants. Their role is confirmed by elec-
tronic supplementary material, figure S24, where in the
presence of both reputation and punishment, cooperation
levels decrease for lower mutation rates.

All in all, these results point to the fact that, in the OPGG,
reputational information acts as a cheap substitute for costly
punishment. Cooperators are rewarded with a positive repu-
tation, which makes future opponents more likely to
cooperate with them. This is in line with the experimental
results of Ule et al. [50], who found that, in the presence of
reputation, subjects prefer rewarding positive behaviour to
punishing those who defect. Since the AD reputational mech-
anism can be considered an indirect method of sanctioning
anti-social behaviour, our result is also in line with Balafoutas
et al. [51] which experimentally finds that people prefer to
punish indirectly rather than directly.
