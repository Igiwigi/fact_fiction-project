We were inclined to ascribe this spectrum to the presence of a
compound of carbon with one of the usually inert gases. But we have since failed
to detect this spectrum ; and we think it probable that in removing oxygen from the
sparked gas some carbon was introduced with the phosphorus we then used. REmMsEN
(‘ American Chemical Journal, V, No. 6) has drawn attention to the fact that some
specimens of yellow phosphorus contain carbon, probably in combination, and that on
burning the phosphorus, carbon monoxide and dioxide are formed. After the sup-
posed purification from carbon compounds, we must have introduced carbon monoxide
into the argon of which the bulk of the sample of gas consisted, and still recognising
a spectrum similar to that of carbon, we ascribed it to the presence of ‘ metargon.”
The phosphorus we at present employ does not produce such a spectrum, and
we must therefore withdraw our statements regarding this supposed gas. On making a mixture of pure yellow phosphorus with powdered charcoal, and
using it to remove oxygen from argon, the spectrum of the remaining gas was

“c

identical with that which we described as “ metargon,” even to the bright bands in
the violet, which are not present in the spectrum of pure carbon monoxide, but
which are visible in that of cyanogen.
