In spite of these facts many data were
collected, and can be used to show the relationship between the signs of the electricity
of the rain and the potential gradient. Defining the sign of the fine weather potential
gradient as positive, it may be taken as a general rule that negative potential gradient
only occurs during periods of disturbed weather. It is a well-known fact that during
thunderstorms the potential gradient undergoes violent and rapid changes, and these
changes must in some way be associated with the same electrical effect that causes the
thunder and lightning. Thus one might expect that a close relationship would exist
between the sign of the potential gradient and the sign of the rain electricity, but this
consideration was not borne out by the measurements. From the records of the three instruments, potential gradient electrometer, rain
electricity electrometer, and rain-gauge, it has been possible to pick out 1950 two
minutesâ€™ intervals during which rain fell and the potential gradient was measured.
