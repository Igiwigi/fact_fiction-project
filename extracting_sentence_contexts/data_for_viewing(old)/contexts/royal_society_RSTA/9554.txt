As pointed out in the previous papers, determinations of the true specific heats
throughout this range are needed to bridge the large gap between Nernst’s observa-
tions at liquid hydrogen and liquid air temperatures and the observations above
referred to at higher temperatures.

For determinations in the vicinity of fixed points at low temperatures the method
employed by Nernst is an admirable one and his experimental values carry great
weight. a

He has given, in the cases of silver and lead, the results of investigations at
higher temperatures (e.g., at —78° C.), but these determinations cannot, for several
reasons, be regarded as satisfactory. The validity of this conclusion is indicated by
the fact that individual values at the same temperature differ by about 4 per cent.

PART I
EXPERIMENTAL Metnops AND RESULTS.

(1) Description of Apparatus.

Our method of investigation demanded a constant temperature enclosure, and the
apparatus described in succeeding pages was designed for this purpose.

We abandoned the use of liquid air on account of the uneconomical nature of the
processes that would be involved, and utilised the Joule-Thomson cooling effect in a
direct manner.
