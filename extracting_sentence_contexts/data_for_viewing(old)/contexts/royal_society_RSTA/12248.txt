ke of a combination of order & of a unipartite number, zeros excluded, and of a
position of a unitary multipartite, zeros not excluded, and each combination or
position of the nature considered is uniquely represented by a tree.

The number of compositions of the multipartite 1’-!, zeros not excluded, into
x fewer parts is

ye + gr-l SS aa + fer)

umber which also represents the number of the aggregate of the combinations of
number n, of orders 1, 2,..., zero parts not excluded.

The interesting fact here brought to light is the connection between the unipartite
ers and the unitary multipartite numbers.

85. We have seen that k”~! expresses the number of combinations of order k
essed by the unipartite number m. Each combination involves a certain number
the & different symbols and we may inquire the number of combinations which
ve exactly p out of the k symbols. It is clear that one combination can be formed
ich involves any one symbol and none of the others ; hence, & combinations involve

-asingle symbol. Two out of & symbols may be selected in (3) different ways ;

each such selection we must take the number of combinations of the number m,
er 2, and subtract the number of these in which but a single symbol appears.
