The sugar and the alizarine were probably secondary products
of decomposition formed from the rubianic acid by the action of the alkali. Rubianic Acid. â€”This substance really merits the name of an acid, for though its
acid properties are not well marked, the fact of its giving crystallized compounds
with the alkalies is a sufficient indication of the class in which it should be placed. It erystallizes from its watery s0lution in silky needles of a pure lemon-yellow colour,
which when dry form a light, bulky interwoven mass. Sometimes it is slowly depo-
ited from its watery s0lution in grains and masses of an indistinctly crystalline form,
which leave an orange tinge.
