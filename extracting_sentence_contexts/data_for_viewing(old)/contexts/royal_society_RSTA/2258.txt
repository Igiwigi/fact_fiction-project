Assuming the answer to Q1 is positive, one can ask the next, critical question:

(Q2: counterfactual identity) is it possible that in this assignment of values to all random
variables in the system any two content-sharing random variables Rj and Re be always
assigned the same value?

If this question, too, is answered in the affirmative, i.e. if there is an assignment of values that
only depends on the variables’ contents, rather than also on their contexts, the system is deemed
non-contextual in the ‘counterfactual sense’.


Note: in our understanding of Q2, the variables Ri and Re measure the same content in two
distinct contexts, one of which may be, but need not be factual. One might object to this and argue
that one should only be interested in this question if one of the contexts c,c’ is the factual context.
A comparison of two counterfactual assignments, one might insist, is of no interest. I can see no
convincing justification for imposing this restriction. Using our example (2.4), if one meaningfully
contemplates a counterfactual value of RS when the measurements are factually made in context
c =2, one should also be able to consider counterfactual value of R}: after all, R} and R} are jointly
distributed, it may even be the case that one of them is uniquely determined by the other, e.g.
R} = —R}. But then, if one can speak of the value that R} would have had if one measured q = 1 in
context c = 1 instead of measuring q = 2 in context c = 2, then one can also speak of what the value
of RE would have been if the same q = 1 were measured in context c = 3. And the requirement that
the assignment of values should only depend on content would then dictate that R? be assigned
the same value as R}.
