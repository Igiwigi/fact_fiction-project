Hy (p) = 1. Of these the term Cp must be excluded ; for referring to Chapter IV., p. 478, we see
that the velocities normal to the surfaces p, q, are

Hence the presence of this term would make Q infinite at the axis, where
0=a=th /(l—p.1—/¢). These expressions, in fact, tell us that where we may have 1 — g? = 0, the terms
of y that involve p, must contain the factor 1 —g*, and vice versd. The loci to
which these values correspond are given on p. 478. They are, namely, for
