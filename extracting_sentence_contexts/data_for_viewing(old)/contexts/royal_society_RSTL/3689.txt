and a deposit was gradually formed when the iodide of potassium was added in pro-
portions of 2, 3, 4, or 5 equivalents to one of the double chloride. These solations,
as also those containing a larger amount of iodide, were intensely red. It was evident
that the decomposition was far more complicated than

Changes in the state of combination of an element may be rendered visible by a
change in the intensity of a colour, even where no change in its character occurs.
Thus oxide of copper diss0Ived in acetic acid gives a much more intense blue than
when the same amount is dissolved in sulphuric acid. This fact was taken advantage
of in the following experiment, which affords additional evidence of the truth of my

main deduction. Sulphuric acid was added to a solution of acetate of copper; it
reduced the colour greatly. The experiment was reversed, acetic acid being added
to a solution of sulphate of copper; it deepened the colour, but considerable excess
of the acid was required to make a very evident difference.
