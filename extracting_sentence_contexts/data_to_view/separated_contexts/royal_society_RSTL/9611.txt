In his
latest memoir, already quoted, M. RExAuLT combines his fossil Gymnospermous
Phanerogams in one group, to which he gives the common name of *Diploxyl6es,”
and in a foot-note (oc. cit., p. 260) he 8ays : © Sous ce nom je reunis toutes les plantes
qui, dans le faiscean lib6ro-lignens de la tige on des feuilles, presentent un double
accroissement, V'un centripdte, Vautre centrifuge.” My friend here reasserts the old
Brongniartian hypothesis in all its definiteness. Tf the evidence produced in the pre-
ceding pages is nob sufficient to demonstrate the erroneousness of this hypothesis, I
am wholly unable to conceive what kind or number of facts would accomplish that end. The enormous number of Lepidodendroid and allied plants that have now been
described by M. Rexavir and myself seem to me to justify an attempt to ascertain
what bearing our discoveries may have upon the problem of Evolution.
