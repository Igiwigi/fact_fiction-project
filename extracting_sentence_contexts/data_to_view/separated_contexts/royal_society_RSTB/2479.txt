If this condition, or the earlier condition referred to above, were
present in the adult stem, StRAsBuRGER would not admit that the sheaths in either
case merited the name phloeoterma. A very strong argument against the validity of SrrasBuRGERâ€™s interpretation of
this and similar cases is that it takes no account of the facts of development, and
makes the same sheath in the upper part of the stem a true phloeoterma, and in its
lower, presumably more primitive and typical region, a mere histological layer of no
morphological importance. It further offers no explanation of the fact that, even in
the case of the adult, the layer which he regards as the phloeoterma is not continuous,
but passes inwards on the flanks of the bundles. It seems difficult to retain a
morphological hypothesis which is so obviously in opposition to the facts of develop-
ment. The above reasoning in regard to the endodermis is obviously not affected by
the question as to whether this layer is in all cases really the innermost stratum
(Phleeoterma) of the cortex, because if it be not the most internal layer of the funda-
mental tissue, then, @ fortiori, it follows that everything outside is cortical tissue.
