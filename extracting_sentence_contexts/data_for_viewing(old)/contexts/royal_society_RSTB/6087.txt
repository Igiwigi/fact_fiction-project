p. 24). By Marsumoro as D. minus (LyDEKKER) (1921, p. 91 (17)).
Diceratherium shahbazi (Pirerm™, 1912, p. 25).
Placed as a member of a “ Pro-Chilotherium” group by Marrow (1929,
p. 510), together with D. minus.
“ Rhinoceros” sivalensis var. gajensis (LYDEKKER, 1884, p. 5).
Placed as Aceratherium gajense by Prrerm™ (1912, p. 28).
Teleoceras fatehjangensis (PtLeRIM, 1912, p. 32).

To this list must now be added some further forms in the present collection, which
appear to be different from those already recorded from the district.

It is obvious, from the list given above, that there is a wide divergence of opinion
as to the generic position of these species, and this serves to emphasize the fact that
the genera and species of rhinoceroses from the Oligocene and Miocene deposits of
Europe and Asia are extremely confused. This is due to several causes ; to the too
frequent imperfection of the material on which to work, to the non-recognition of the
extent to which variation can occur within a species,* to a lack of an adequate succession
of forms in time, and finally, the greatest obstacle of all, to the difficulty of deciding
on what characters, among a number that show only shades of difference, one should
rely on when founding generic distinctions.

With these various difficulties in mind the specimens from Baluchistan may be
described and named as follows :—

Aceratherium blandfordi (LYDEKKER, 1884, p. 2, Plate I, fig. 6 and Plate II, figs. 1-3).
