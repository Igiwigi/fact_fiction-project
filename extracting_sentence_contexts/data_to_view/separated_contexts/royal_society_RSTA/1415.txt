3, article on “ Line Standards,” for more complete details. Jn the present case the defining lines of the yard and metre intervals referred to above
are all included in the first and last six spans of the bar, and this has an important bearing
on the scheme of calibration. It was, in fact, possible to calibrate the scale in six entirely
different ways, each including at least one of the principal metre lengths, and four
of the principal yard lengths, the six resulting independent calibrations being finally
combined in one adjusted mean calibration. Each calibration consists of two parts,

(a) A main calibration, involving the intercomparison of the intervals resulting from
the division of the whole scale, or such part of it as may be selected, into a number
of equal parts, each of which is a multiple of 1} inch (the length of a span); and

(b) A subsidiary calibration involving a comparison of the spans in the first interval
of the main calibration with those of the last interval, these two intervals being
the ones involving some or all of the important graduations defining the metre
and yard lengths. For example, the first of the six calibrations carried out involves (a) an intercom-
parison of six intervals each 6 spans long, and (b) a comparison of the six spans in the
first interval with the six spans in the last.
