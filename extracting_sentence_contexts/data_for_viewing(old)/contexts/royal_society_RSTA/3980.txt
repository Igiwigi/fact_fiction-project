a stronger coupling between the two methods, we extend the LBM to cover the whole simulation
domain, whereas the DSMC is confined only within some regions of the domain. In this way,
a two-level grid is obtained (figure 1b). A few basic subroutines define the implementation of
the hybrid simulation adopting the illustrated projection and reconstruction steps. During the
time integration of the LBM equations, the discrete distributions f;,(x, f) are advanced on a coarse
time level increment, At,gm, over the whole domain, including the part that lays underneath
the DSMC region. Then, the DSMC domain is integrated, and it is advanced to the new time on
the LBM level through a sequence of fine level time steps, Atpsmc. The ratio between the two
time steps, depending on the LBM lattice spacing and the DSMC particle characteristic collision
time, defines the number of subcycles the DSMC should run for each LBM time step. The LBM
solution information in proximity of the fine level grid is passed to the DSMC via the imposition
of proper boundary conditions on the particle simulation domain. At the beginning of each DSMC
integration step, in fact, particles are generated within the buffer region by sampling Gradâ€™s
distribution built according to the reconstruction step. The particles, in both the DSMC and the
buffer regions, are allowed to stream for one fine level time step. If a particle from the DSMC
region crosses the interface, that particle will contribute to the fluxes of mass and momentum for
the LBM discrete distributions corresponding to the node where the crossing occurred, so that the


populations will be corrected as
