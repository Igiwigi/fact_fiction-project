That philosopher, in
his profound investigations of the phenomena of light, especially when polar-
ized, has conceived it necessary to admit that the vibrations of the ether take
place transversely to the ray of light, or to the direction of the waye causing
its phenomena. *© In fact we may conceive direct light to be an assemblage,
or rather a rapid succession, of an infinity of systems of waves polarized
(i. e. vibrating transversely) in all azimuths, and s0 that there is as much
polarized light in any one plane as in a plane perpendicular to it.” Hzrscner
says that FrEsNEL supposes the eye to be affected only by such vibrating
motions of the ethereal molecules as are performed in planes perpendicular
to the direction of the rays. Now the effects in question seem to indicate
how the direct vibration of the luminous body may communicate transversal
vibration in every azimuth to the molecules of the ether, and 80 account for
that, condition of it which is required to explain the phenomena.
