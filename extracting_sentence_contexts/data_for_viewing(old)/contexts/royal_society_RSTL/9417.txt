evolution.

Tf, however, this theory should be found to explain the greater part of the configura-
tions of the satellites round the planets, it would hardly be logical to refuse it some
amount of applicability to the planets, We should then have to suppose that before
the birth of the satellites the planets occupied very much larger volumes, and pogsessed
much more moment of momentum than they do now. If they did 80, we should not
expect to trace back the positions of the axes of the planets to the state when they
were perpendicular to the ecliptic, as ought to be the case if the action of the satellites,
and of the sun after their birth, is alone concerned.

Whatever may be thought of the theory of the viscosity of the earth, and of the
large speculations to which it has given rise, the fact remains that nearly all the effects
which have been attributed to the action of bodily tides would also follow, though
probably at a somewhat less rapid rate, from the influence of oceanic tides on a rigid
nucleus. The effect of oceanic tidal friction on the obliquity of the ecliptic has already
been considered by Mr. STONE, in the only paper on the snbject which I have yet
geen.* Tis argument is based on what I conceive to be an incorrect assumption as to
the nature of the tidal frictional couple, and he neglects tidal reaction ; he finds that
the effects would be quite insignificant, This regult would, I think, be modified by a
more satisfactory assumption.
