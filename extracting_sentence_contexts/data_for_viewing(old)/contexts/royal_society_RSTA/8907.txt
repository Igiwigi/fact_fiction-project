This leads to

where K is some constant.

The first term, 94-5, corresponds to an initial stress and optical effect in the material
before loading. This initial stress, independently determined, was found by Coker
and Cuaxko to be 73 lbs. weight per square inch, and the agreement is quite within
the probable error of the observations.

* A possible explanation of the marked alteration in the coefficients of O,, may be found in the fact that
in the last of the earlier tests this specimen was subjected to a load of about 236 bars, which was considerably
greater than the heaviest load applied to any other specimen, and may have produced serious permanent
strain. This could not have been detected, as the extensometer was dismantled between the tests, and
there was no means of recovering the zero. Thus, although the recovery of the stress-optical effect was
complete (and this could be ascertained at any time by means of the compensator), there may have remained
considerable strain which would have affected the new strain readings for the specimen.
