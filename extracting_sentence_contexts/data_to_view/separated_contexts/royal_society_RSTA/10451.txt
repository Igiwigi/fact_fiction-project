Each nipple has one
round pinhole of about 15 or 20 candle power; the holes are parallel to each other,
and each gives a flame in the form of a straight thick line of a few millimetres
diameter and of a few centimetres in height. Round the brass ring a brass jacket
is fixed, forming a hollow ring connected with the tubes + and 7’. Water runs
continuously through the hollow ring of the burner, which thus remains cool, in
spite of the fact that flames of about 200-250 candle power are concentrated in a
very small area. Using this arrangement of the burner, we find that the acetylene

flame becomes perfectly pure and clear, and remains so for any length of time, even
