The pygopodid sex chromosomes genes linked to sex chromosomes than lineages with female
are homologous to chromosome 4q of the chicken and the heterogamety (Fisherâ€™s exact test: p=0.074). Moreover, the
human chromosome 4. It seems that sex chromosomes in the ratio can even be biased in favour of the tested hypothesis;
pygopodid ancestor evolved independently from sex chromo- e.g. nematodes in fact do not represent the difference in
somes of other amniotes, as no amniote group studied to date expression between males and females, but between males
with known partial gene content of sex chromosomes and hermaphrodites [60,61]. Also, we grouped species
