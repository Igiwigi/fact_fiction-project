Esyrr thus describes the state of - the floor near the en-
trance of one of the largest caverns at Gailenreuth. Â© Dans
toute la contree le terrain'est marneux, mele avec du limon,
et tire sur le jaune, mais ici on trouve une terre moins limo-
neuse dans une profondeur considerable. -Je ne pretends pas
encore la prendre absolument pour une terre animale telle
queest sans contredit Ja terre qui se trouve plus bas, mais pro-
bablement elle doit y Etre rapportee, p. 9g. This again is
consistent with the circumstances of the cave at Kirkdale,
the mud, thus dubiously spoken of, being probably of diluvial
origin, and reposing 'on, and being mixed with, the animal
earth that had been formed before its introduction. The ab-
sence of black animal earth at Kirkdale, results from the fact
of the flesh, and great part even of the bones of the animals
introduced to it, having been eaten by the hyenas,

224 The Rev. Mr. BucKLANnD's account of Fossil Teeth and

caverns, does not, however, depend so much on comparisons
between the stalactitic matter and earthy sediments which
they contain, as on the agreement in s8pecies of the animals
entombed in them, viz. in the agreement of the animals of
the English caves, with those of the diluvian gravel of the
greater part of Europe ; and, in the case of the German
caves, on the identity of the extinct bear with that of the dilu-
vian gravel of Upper Austria, and the extinct hyzna with that
of the gravel at Canstadt, in the valley of the Necker ; and
at Eichstadt, in Bavaria ; to these may be added the extinct
rhinoceros, elephant, and hippopotamus, which are common
to gravel beds as well as caves.
