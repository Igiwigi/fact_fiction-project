“"Qrith the horn hygroscope. < Another fact noted by Scuwenvener, Lerrces, and Stan, namely, the closure of the stomata of
lea in winter, is easily verified. It is worth noting that in the warm winter of 1897-98 the
(Atomata were found clearly open on January 20 (temperature 12°), in the following :—

Prunus Lawrocerasus and lusitanica, Hedera Heli, Capsella Bursa-Pastoris, Cheiranthus Cheirt; the
hygroscope was at zero on Buxus sempervirens and Ilex Aquifolium. Tn many leaves, especially those of Monocotyledons, the hygroscope readings vary in different parts
of the same leaf.
