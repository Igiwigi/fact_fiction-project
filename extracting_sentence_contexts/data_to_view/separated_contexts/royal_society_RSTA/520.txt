Translational relaxation leads
to the losses of ‘hot’ atoms. Chain branching reaction H + O2 =O + OH at T= 300K has the rate constant keq(300 K) =
2.5 x 10-7! (em? s~!), which is significantly lower than the rate of recombination of ‘cold’ atoms
(1.6 x 10-1? (cm3s~1) at p=1 atm). In fact, the rates of these processes become close to each

impact has a rate constant ky, = 1.6 x 10-19 (cm3 s~!), and leads to the formation of additional
radicals with probability close to 50% (the rest of the ‘hot’ atoms will be thermalized in collisions,
and recombine).
