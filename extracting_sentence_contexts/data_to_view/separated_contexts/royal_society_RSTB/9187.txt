Considering that about half of
the 26 types of amacrine cells are GABAergic [57], para-
crine secretion may sustain a non-negligible tone of
GABA in the intercellular spaces of the IPL, in spite
of the uptake of this transmitter by Muiller glial cells
[58]. Thus, the ubiquitous presence of extracellular
GABA may control the excitability of the neural
processes in the IPL by acting on metabotropic
GABAsg receptors, which are widely expressed on ama-
crine and ganglion cells [59], as well as on synaptic and
extrasynaptic ionotropic GABA, and GABAc receptors. In fact, tonic GABAergic currents have been reported in
bipolar cell terminals [60,61] and starburst amacrine
cells [62]. The IPL is unique in the nervous system
because in its five, 10 1m thick strata are segregated
the synapsing processes of over 50 different types of
neurons, each encoding different parameters of the
light stimuli: the glutamatergic synapses connecting
OFF-cone bipolars to OFF-ganglion cells in stratum 2
are adjacent to the glutamatergic synapses between
ON-cone bipolars and ON-ganglion cells in stratum
3. It is known that blocking GABAc¢ receptors unmasks
a sizeable OFF excitation in ON-ganglion cells whose
dendrites ramify close to the ON-OFF border [63].
