Under
such circumstances the operation of the heart wood, when it
exists in large quantity comparatively with the bark and
foliage, as in sound pollard oak trees, must tend to check
and diminish, rather than to promote, growth ; and amongst
trees of this description I have often been able readily to
Select such as were sound by the slowness of the growth of
their branches comparatively with those of other trees of
apparently the same age, which were become hollow. Whether the heart wood of oak trees, which are deprived
of their bark in the spring, and suffered to remain standing
till the following winter, recover the whole, or a part of the
good qualities which it loses (or is supposed to lose) in the
spring, is a very interesting question. A few experiments


of the heart wood of trees. 143

which I have made, lead me to think it probable, that both
the alburnum and heart wood become improved in quality
under such circunistances ; but I am not at present in pos-
session of such facts as can enable me to give any decisive
opinion. I am, my dear Sir, with great regard,
sincerely yours,
