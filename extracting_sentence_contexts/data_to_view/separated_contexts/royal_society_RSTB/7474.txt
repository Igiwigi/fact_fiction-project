corporal mutilation, the covering of the privy parts, hairdressing, bows and arrows,
stone axes, and the way of building their houses. The cultivation of the tobacco plant
in New Guinea has always been’ in the hands of the oldest elements of the inland
population as far as the most inaccessible parts. The need of the coastal people for
tobacco has always been supplied from inland; not one case of a reversed direction is
mentioned in the literature, notwithstanding the fact that during the last half century
a considerable amount of foreign tobacco has been imported to the coastal population. To this importation are to be ascribed the terms tembaku and sembaku with related forms
such as sabachai, which were widely spread far down along northern New Guinea; in a
number of more distant areas tobacco has quite different and apparently more native
names. Van Nouhuys (p. 78) refers to and rejects various theories to explain how tobacco
seed might have reached New Guinea; carried by birds or by ocean currents, or the
Polynesians at the highest period of their culture might have brought the cultivation of
tobacco to New Guinea from Peru or Mexico.
