But @ (the
longitude of the perihelion) is not the same as ; the former being measured entirely
in the plane of the orbit from a radius vector, fied in that planeF, and assumed as
the origin of longitudes. Consequently z, in PoxTEcouLaxT (which we will call s, for
distinction), is not the same as (z) in the present paper. In fact, if we equate the
expressions for the mean anomaly in the two notations, we have

4—o=(:;)—7;
also it is evident that if we put for the angle between the node and the origin from
which @ is measured, we have dB= = cos ud, and 7=»+B+2, $0 that
da=du+(1—cos:)dv. If then it were allowable to consider R as capable of being expressed as a function of
» and +, instead of @ and (z), and if we represented by (R) the expression for R 80
transformed, we should have
dR 4R d4(R) , , 4(R)
FELL) d(s)+&c.=—==do+ * d +&Cc.;

and if, in the two first terms, we put for d@ and d(:) the values da=dw+(1—cos1)dv,
d(:)=d,+(1—cos1)d, and compare the two expressions, we find

dR_d(R) dR_d(R)

da — an d(s) © a?

dR dR , «R\ 4(R)

F+(1>co8) (71 +75)
These relations, together with the equation

n=&+(1—cos:)/,

are easily seen to render the expressions at the end of art. 55 identical with those of
PoxTECOULANT; in fact, it is by an equiyalent transformation that the latter are
finally obtained by that author from the correct expressions in p. 328. But it is to
be observed that this proceeding is founded upon a false assumption ; for it is im-
possible to express R as a function of a, e, «, », z,, @, as is obvious from the considera-
tion that R, in its original form, is not a function of (:)—# merely, but also of (s);
whilst (:) is not expressible as a function of the new elements, as is $hown by the equa-
tion d(:)=d:,+(1—cos1)d».
