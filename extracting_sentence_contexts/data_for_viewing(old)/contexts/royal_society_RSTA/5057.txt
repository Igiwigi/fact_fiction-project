after the initial impact.

The second example showing the response of another normal glass to impact with a spherical
projectile is presented in figure 5. Here a 1mm diameter steel sphere impacts at normal incidence
a block of the B2O3 glass at a velocity of 150ms~!. The contact between the sphere and the
B2O3 block occurs in frame 3. No cracks appear to form during the loading period, but some
densification takes place, which can be seen at the arrow in frame 3. In fact, within this densified
zone two white arcs appear. A possible cause for the appearance of the arcs may be the refraction
of the transmitted light through the densified zone. Unloading begins between frames 4 and 5
and several radial and lateral cracks form (see frame 5), which continue to grow for another
microsecond after the sphere has left the surface of the glass block (see L in frame 6). It will
also be seen that in frame 5, a dark protrusion has just appeared on the glass surface around
the contact during the unloading (i.e. rebound) of the sphere. This dark protrusion is, in fact, a
ring of detached B03, which leaves the impact surface in a direction normal to it at a velocity
of 135ms~! and a dent is left behind in the glass surface. This rebound velocity of the sphere is
relatively high, being about 85% of the incident velocity. This relatively high rebound velocity
is reasonable, as little or no loss of energy occurs because of the absence of any cracking during
the loading part of the impact.

It is interesting to mention that, if ByO3 is mixed with 32.5% by weight of Na2O, the response
of the resulting glass is quite similar to that of soda-lime glass [19].

and 2, resulting in compaction and densification (see arrow in frame 3) and plastic flow causing pile-up in frame 4. No cracks
