engaged, this general result has pressed upon me constantly, namely, the necessity
of admitting two forces, or two forims or directions of a force (516. 517.), combined
with the impossibility of separating these two forces (or electricities) from each other,
either in the phenomena of statical electricity or those of the current. In ass0-
ciation with this, the impossibility under any circumstances, as yet, of absolutely
charging matter of any kind with one or the other electricity dwelt on my mind, and
made me wish and search for a clearer view than any that I was acquainted with, of
the way in which electrical powers and the particles of matter are related; especially
in inductive actions, upon which almost all others appeared to rest.

1164, When I discovered the general fact that electrolytes refused to yield their
elements to a current when in the solid state, though they gave them forth freely if in
the liquid condition (380, 394. 402.), I thought I saw an opening to the elucidation of
inductive action, and the possible subjugation of many dissimilar phenomena to one
law. For let the electrolyte be water, a plate of ice being coated with platina foil
on its two surfaces, and these coatings connected with any continued source of the
two electrical powers, the ice will charge like a Leyden arrangement, presenting a
case of common induction, but no current will pass. If the ice be liquified, the in-
duction will fall to a certain degree, because a current can now pass; but its passing
is dependent upon a peculiar molecular arrangement of the particles consistent with
the transfer of the elements of the electrolyte in opposite directions, the degree of
discharge and the quantity of elements eyolyed being exactly proportioned to each
other (377.783.). Whether the charging of the metallic coating be effected by a pow-
