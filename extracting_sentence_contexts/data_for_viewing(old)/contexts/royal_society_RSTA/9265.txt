(independently of the specific gravity) from the heartwood to the sapwood of the same
tree. ‘Tests on large and small specimens have in some cases given different results,}
and this has led some investigators to suggest modifications of the usual formule.}
Again, in all cases where shearing over the principal planes is involved, impact and
vibration experiments give higher values of the constants than statical experiments,
and the latter often show important “ time-effects,’’§ 7.c., the deformation increases
with the time the load has been applied. Other causes of systematic variation in the
elastic properties have been suspected, such as a variation of E,, with the width of the
annual rings (other things being equal), though in this particular case no relation could
be discovered.||

Practically the whole of this work on the elastic properties of wood has been of an
experimental and empirical nature. That is to say, except for the simple fact that the
visible structure differs in the longitudinal, radial and axial directions, and therefore
suggests three planes of elastic symmetry, no attempt appears to have been made to
discover whether the elastic properties can be explained to any appreciable extent by
