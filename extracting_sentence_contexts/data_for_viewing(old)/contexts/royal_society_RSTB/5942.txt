the larger angle but not on the opposite side of the apex. This is best seen in fig. 14, D,
and fig. 15, D, which show sections passing through the insertion levels of Lk. It
might indeed be objected that since in these four experiments I,k and I, were 8 or 9
plastochrons old when examined, the areas which they occupy are different from what
they were when I, was determined. It is indeed probable that the stipules of I,k and
I, have extended since I, was determined, but the “ short time ” experiment, No. 62,
mentioned on p. 376, shows that I,k became asymmetric at a very early stage, probably
in its first plastochron. The position of I;, therefore, in these four experiments is in
agreement with the theory of the first available space. Similar instances of a leaf
arising in the smaller angle between two older leaves on account of their asymmetric
development were given previously (1931, p. 9). In Nos. 21 and 25, mentioned above,
1k was similarly asymmetric, its stipule on the side of the wound being the larger, but
the asymmetry was not great enough to compensate for the fact that the larger angle
between the centres of I,k and I, was found on this side of the apex, as can be seen from
fig. 13, No. 21.

Part 4.—EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH BOTH I,A AND I,K AROSE.

(15) General.

Tn six experiments two complete leaves arose soon after the operation, one on each
side of the wound. These leaves, which will be called I,a and I,k as in the previous
experiments, were always joined by their stipules over the top of the wound. It is
probable that they were never absolutely simultaneous, but they were near enough to
being simultaneous for their stipules to unite through the overlapping of their primary
