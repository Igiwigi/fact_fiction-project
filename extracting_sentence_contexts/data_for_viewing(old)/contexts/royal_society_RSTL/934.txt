In the case of thin plates, this light is transmitted in other
rings: we Should therefore be led to think that in the case of
the light passing by bodies, it should be at one distance in-
flected, and at another deflected: and in fact the phanomena
agree with this, for fringes are formed by inflexion within the
Shadows of bodies; they are separated by dark intervals ; the
fringes and the intervals without the $shadow decrease in breadth
according to the same law; s0 that the fringes and intervals
within the shadow correspond with the intervals and fringes
without, respectively. Nor will this explanation at all affect
the theory formerly laid down; it will only (if found consistent
with farther induction) change the definite spheres of inflexion
and deflexion into alternate spheres. At any rate, the facts here
being the same with those described by NewTox, but in diffe-
rent circumstances, teach us: to reconcile the difference, which

and what we have seen not only entitles us to conclude that
. the cause is the same, but also inclines us to look for farther
