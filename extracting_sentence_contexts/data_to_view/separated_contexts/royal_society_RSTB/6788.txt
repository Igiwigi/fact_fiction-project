Many of the luteal cells are somewhat shrunken, and there is a considerable
degree of proliferation of connective tissue cells filling the spaces between them. The
nuclei have undergone no change (fig. 67, Plate 9). In the early stages of lactation no further degenerative changes are to be found; in
fact the corpus luteum often presents a surprisingly healthy appearance (fig. 68,
Plate 9). As lactation progresses the central part of the corpus luteum first shows signs
of decreasing activity. Here the cells are shrunken to a mean diameter of 20, or less,
and become comparatively widely scattered in a background of connective tissue.
