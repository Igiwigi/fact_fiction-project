fissure widens by the drying and contraction of the adjoining cells. The firmer
tissues of the remainder of the wall constitute a resistant framework, so that any
such contraction widens the slit once formed. The simple arrangement is, as regards
the individual sporangium, quite like that in Danea, though complicated by the
change of form of the whole sorus as it ripens; and together with the simple
structure goes the absence of individual projection of the sporangia.

But in Angiopteris, where the sporangia are freely projecting bodies which do not
exercise a controlling influence upon ote another at the time of dehiscence, and thus
leave free scope for change of their form, a more elaborate mechanical system is
present, and I have endeavoured above to explain how it works.

When we place the above facts in connection with those familiarly known in the
Gleicheniacew, Osmundacex, and the main body of Leptosporangiate Ferns, we see
that the presence of an annulus, and its elaborateness, are to be correlated with the
freedom of the sporangia from mutual relations with others; it is a mechanism—and
in the Leptosporangiates a most wonderfully specialised mechanism—which is pro-
duced only in those forms where it has an opportunity of working; its oftice is to
induce a change of form of the sporangium on rupture, and this can only be carried
out when the single sporangium is free from its neighbours. As regards its presence
or absence, Danaea and Kuulfussia may be cited as the least specialised of Ferns,
excepting, perhaps, the Hydropteridee.

It has been shown, in the detailed description given above, that in all the four
genera the typical mode of origiu of the sporogenous group, together with the group
