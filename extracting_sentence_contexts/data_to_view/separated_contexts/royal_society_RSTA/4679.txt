We will refer to this concept as ‘local periodicity’ (figure 3). The identification

of the local periodic structure is facilitated by the fact that the lattice is often Cartesian and the
modulation is obtained not changing the local period, but changing the dimension and orientation
of the elements inside a uniform lattice. In the following, we will refer to a lossless substrate with
thickness h and relative permittivity er, and to metallic patches arranged on a square lattice of
period d. The local periodicity assumption allows for the definition of average tangential fields in a
simple way using a local Floquet-wave (FW) expansion.
