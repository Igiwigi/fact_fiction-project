for the conditions used in this work, particularly the low zeta potential of the CNTs, justifies using
the Debye-Hiickel approximation. Therefore, the difference between the nonlinear and the linear
solutions to the P-B equation is negligible. This is confirmed in figure 5, where the experimental
data for the ratio between EO and pressure-driven permeabilities for the borate buffer solution is
reproduced with the corresponding values for the two solutions. As discussed earlier, this might
not be the case for other materials more commonly used in EO, such as silica. The ratio between
EO and pressure-driven permeabilities is here normalized by the pressure Ap, to eliminate this
dependence and only show the one from the nanotube diameter.

As can be observed, the model overestimates the experimental data in most of the CNT
diameter range investigated. This could be attributed either to a larger error in the estimation
of the effective voltage, as discussed earlier, or in the measurement of the experimental data (flow
rate and or nanotube diameter). Another possibility can be the fact that the no-slip boundary
condition has been used to solve the Navier-Stokes equation with the electro-osmotic term. There
is ample evidence in the literature, including for the same nanotubes used in this work, that
a significant amount of wall slip is present for water flowing through CNTs under a pressure
gradient. Considering slip could alter the permeability values resulting from applying the model
to the present case, at least in the pressure-driven flow case, though whether slip is possible in the
case of an electrolyte solution near a charged surface is a yet unsolved problem [1], beyond the
scope of this work.

4. Conclusion

In summary, experimental evidence of the presence of EOF in CNMs close or in the region of
EDL overlap is presented for two different electrolytes for the first time. These results show that
