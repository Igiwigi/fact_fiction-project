For the indium alloys only the nominal concentration (probably
close to the truth) is given. The values of R/R, in brackets were not determined directly, but obtained by
interpolation of the relation between R/R, and concentration. The values of a have been adjusted to give
amplitudes (as defined in table 4) at 1-5°K; most of them were in fact measured close to this temperature,
but Sn9 was measured at 1-78°K and Sn 18 at 1-15°K.

For the other metals for which x was determined (gallium, mercury, antimony and
graphite) the determination was made only for the pure metals, and for gallium and
mercury as well as tin it is fairly clear that x is too large to be accounted for by collision
broadening alone. Thus the values of x for pure tin, gallium and mercury are all about 1° K,
which according to equation (6) would imply a collision time of about 2 « 10~!2s, while
the resistivities at low temperatures* indicate collision times of order 107!°s if equation
(24) is used and one electron of normal mass per atom is assumed. This assumption may well
be unreliable (though it does appear to be right for tin), and moreover, the collision time
that enters into Dingle’s theory is rather differently defined from that which enters into the
resistivity, but it is unlikely that a discrepancy of a factor of order 50 in the collision time can
be accounted for in this way.
