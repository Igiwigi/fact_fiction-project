obtained first an approximate solution which he termed “ Scuster’s approximation,”
since it was based on the method used by ScuusTer in his paper* on “ Radiation Through
a Foggy Atmosphere ” (the use of the equations of linear flow of radiation) ; he obtained,
secondly, the correction to Scuuster’s approximation. The result is that for an
extensive atmosphere the law of darkening is approximately a cosine law, with a
coeflicient of darkening of rather less than 3 (ScHusTER’s approximation), independent
of the coefficient of scattering. The analysis is identical, in fact, with that required
for radiative equilibrium in an absorbing material, as far as the integrated radiation
is concerned. The application which Scuwarzscui.D made was to the relative intensities in a
Fraunhofer line, and in the neighbouring continuous spectrum, and to the variation
of the ratio of these from the centre to the limb. If a Fraunhofer line is due to selective
absorption in an extensive absorbing mass, it should vanish at the limb in the continuous
background ; if it is due to any kind of selective scattering in a general scattering mass,
then the intensities in the line and just outside the line should be cut down in the same
ratio from the centre to the limb, since by the foregoing theory the darkening is
independent of the magnitude of the scattering.
