March 13. The dorsal suleus was forming in three of the embryos exactly in the
line of the cleft.

March 14. In each of the eight instances the axis of the body is more or less pre-
cisely in the line of the sulcus: thus in five it was in the exact line, in one about
five degrees to the left, in another about three degrees to the left, and in the remain-
ing one rather more to the left of the given line.

Obs. 3 â€”Five eggs were placed in separate cells, and marked, as above directed,
and then removed to a high temperature.

March 26. The results obtained from these were confirmatory of the facts before
stated, as the variation between the line and the axis of the beings was only slight ;
the axis of two being directed to the right, one to the left, and one perfectly coin-
ciding.

Although these observations have shown that the axis of the body of the future
embryo corresponds primarily with the first cleft in the yelk, they point out that, at
times, the axis deviates to the left or right of that line. The cause of this deviation
I may attribute to a change in the position of the yelk, for on March 29, 1853, I
observed that the entire yelk occasionally shifts its position during the progress of
segmentation, in consequence probably of unsymmetrical division, in accordance
with the explanation before given at page 240,
