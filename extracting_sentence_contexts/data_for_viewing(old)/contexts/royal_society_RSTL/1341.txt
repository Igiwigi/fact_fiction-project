results. Whenever equal quantities of potassium were com-
bined with unequal quantities of sulphur, and exposed a≈øter-
wards to the action of muriatic acid, the largest quantity of
sulphuretted hydrogene was furnished by the product con-
taining the smallest proportion of sulphur, and in no case was
the quantity of gas equal in volume to the quantity of hydro-
gene, which would have been produced by the mere action of
potassium upon water.


on the Nature of certain Bodies. 67

From the general tenour of these various facts, it will not
be, I trust, unreasonable to assume, that sulphur, in its com-
mon state, is a compound of small quantities of oxygene and
hydrogene with a large quantity of a basis that produces
the acids of sulphur in combustion, and which, on account of
its strong attractions for other bodies, it will probably be very
difficult to obtain in its pure form.

In metallic combinations even, it still probably retains its
oxygene and part of its hydrogene. Metallic sulphurets can
only be partially decomposed by heat, and the small quantity
of sulphur evolved from them in this case when perfectly dry
and out of the contact of air, as I found in an experiment on
