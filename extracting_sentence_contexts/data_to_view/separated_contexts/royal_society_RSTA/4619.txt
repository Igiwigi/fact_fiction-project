ยง 15. On Currents due to Evaporation and Precipitation. A cause which has been advocated* in explanation of ocean currents is the
fact that in equatorial regions the amount of water evaporated into the atmosphere
largely exceeds that precipitated in the form of rain in these regions. The excess of
water in the atmosphere is carried away to be precipitated in temperate and polar
regions, thereby giving rise to an excess of precipitation over evaporation in the
latter regions. It has been urged with some reason that, as the actual amount
of water in equatorial regions does not diminish nor that in polar regions increase
from year to year, there must be a continual flow of water from the poles towards
the equator.
