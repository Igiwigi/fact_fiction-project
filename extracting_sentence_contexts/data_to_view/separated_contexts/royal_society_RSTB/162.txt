They were not attempted in the present research,

There can, however, be little doubt that the organ is thrown, by the passage of an
induction shock through its substance, into a state of prolonged excitation which
slowly passes off, and, if this is so, then the rapid development of a large nerve-
organ response must, if sufficiently intense, be itself capable of throwing the tissue

into a state of prolonged excitation, Now it is only in cases of very vigorous response
to nerve excitation that the peculiar prolongation of the response referred to in Part IT.
is seen. There is thus every reason to suppose that this prolonged change is the same,
whether its precursor be an induction shock or the shock of the nerve-organ response
itself. The fact that in the one case the tissue is quiescent, whilst in the other it is
in a state of functional activity, does not really affect the matter. The experiments on
summation to be now referred to show that the tissue is capable of responding to two
stimuli occurring within 01” of each other, and that an after-effect may be procured
even when the tissue is in a state of activity by leading an induction shock through
the organ *02” after a response has been evoked by excitation of its nerve. To these
experiments we now turn.
