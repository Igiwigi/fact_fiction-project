series (helium group) than for the single line series (“ parhelium” group), and he
infers that the atoms which act as carriers in the former case have a single positive
charge, while in the second case there is a double positive charge.* Both sets of series,
however, are of the “are” type, with N for the series constant, whereas on Bour’s
theory, one should be of the N, and the other of the 4N type if SrarK’s deduction is
correct.

In the case of aluminium, Stark has similarly found evidence of atoms with one,
two, and three positive charges.t The first is associated with the doublets of the arc
spectrum, the second with a spark line at 4663°5, and the third with three spark lines
at 4529°7, 4513°0, and 4480°0. Attention is drawn to the fact that the higher charges
are connected with the enhanced lines, and differences in the behaviour of the two
sets of spark lines when the spark is passed in hydrogen are indicated. The series to
which the spark lines of aluminium belong have not yet been recognised, but StaRrk’s
results for this element are in general agreement with the conclusion indicated by
Bour’s theory that enhanced lines are associated with atoms of greater positive charges
than those giving rise to are lines. In the case of helium it does not seem possible to
reconcile Srark’s conclusions with those of Bonr, since the doubly-charged atoms, on
Bour’s theory, can only give rise to the system of series of which 4686 is the leading
member.

Srark’s conclusions are equally at variance with those of Lenarp,{ who found
reason to believe that while principal series are produced by neutral atoms, the
