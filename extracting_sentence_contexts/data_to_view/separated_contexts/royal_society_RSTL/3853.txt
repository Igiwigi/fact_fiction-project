That Vitreous Electricity carries heat with it in copper is indicated by each of
the three experiments on the thirteen slip conductor adduced above, but by s0 narrow
an effect; amounting on an average to only 0*02 Cent., which corresponds to a
reading of half that amount, or +J;zth of a degree, being 4th of a division on the
scale of each thermometer; with snch discrepancies among the results of the dif-
ferent experiments (Oct. 28th, effect 039, Nov. 2nd, ©0143, Nov. 26th, 01); and with
80 great fluctuations in the course of each experiment (se Tables I., II., III., \ 56
below); that I did not venture to draw from them 80 s8eemingly improbable a con-
clusion, as that the convective effects in copper and in iron should be in contrary
directions. The dynamic theory (F 18) was fully satisfied by the demonstration
which the experiments gave, that the convective effect is undoubtedly in iron a
conveying of heat in the direction of the Resinous Electricity, and that it is less in
amount in copper, whether in the same direction as in iron or in the contrary direction. But it was still an object of great interest, (in fact an object of much greater interest
than any verification of conclusions from the dynamic theory, which were in reality as
certain before as after the experiments directly demonstrating them,) to ascertain the
actual nature of the convective effect in copper, and I therefore endeavoured to make
more decisive experiments for discovering it.

50. The three experiments which had been made were quite safficient to prove that
the convective effect, whatever its true nature might be, was nearly insensible to my
thermometers without either more powerful currents or a more sensitive conductor. To work with more powerful currents would have increased immensely the labour of
carrying out the experiments, and would besides involve a large addition to the battery
which had been used hitherto.
