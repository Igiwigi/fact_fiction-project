Moreover, table 5 also shows that the stochastic solution outperforms all
deterministic solutions in terms of the expected total cost, with considerable improvement factors
ranging between 3.7% and 1.1%. Interestingly, although the stochastic model constrains the final volume of wind capacity
connected in scenarios 3 and 4, it is possible to demonstrate that, overall, this is better than
building a line that ends up stranded in scenarios 1 and 2. In fact, a sensitivity analysis where we
force the stochastic model to commission a new transmission line in epoch 2 (shown in table 6)
reveals that costs under scenarios 1 and 2 escalate with respect to those observed under the truly
stochastic solution and this cannot be compensated for by the cost reduction under scenarios 3
and 4. Furthermore, the early investment ina transmission line is not only economically inefficient
but also prevents the utilization of smart grid technologies (FACTS/QB and battery plant) that
have been displaced by the line. Table 6.
