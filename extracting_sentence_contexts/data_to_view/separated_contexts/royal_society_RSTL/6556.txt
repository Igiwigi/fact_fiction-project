Convection of conrse immediately set in, and its
amount was accurately measured by the quantity of heat withdrawn from the radiating
surface; this quantity, expressed in the units adopted throughout this memoir, was

62. The quantity of gas in the front chamber was now doubled, that is, it now had an

atmosphere of tension ; the withdrawal of heat then was expressed by the number
68. Ip In the last experiment we had double the number of atoms loading themselves with heat
S and carrying it away; if their motion had been as quick as that of the atoms when half
£ an atmosphere was used, they would have withdrawn sensibly double the amount of heat ;
= but the fact is that half an atmosphere carried off 64, while a whole atmosphere carried
S off 68; hence the absolute swiftness of the atoms in the case of the denser air must be
S very much less than in the case of the rarer. In fact, the amount of heat withdrawn
= will be proportional on the one hand to the number of carrying particles, and on the
= other to the velocity with which they move; hence if v and v' be these yelocities, we haye

S the particles of the air to the motion of their fellows.
