The younger primordia at the
base of the apical cone, i.e. P, to P;, also became evident after some time. But whereas the
actively growing leaf primordia were thrusting aside the lamp-black, no comparable growth
was evident in the axils of the younger primordia. The deposit, in fact, persisted in the axil
until the primordium had receded from the apex; thereafter it became dispersed. An
early dispersal of the lamp-black on the abaxial side of primordia was general. Again,
whereas from an early stage there was evidence of active dispersal of the deposit in the
subapical region immediately adjacent to the base of the apical cone, the apex, except in
the region of P, and P;, still showed a dense deposit.
