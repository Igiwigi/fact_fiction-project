Given any prime ideal p of R, there exists a prime ideal q of S lying over p. 3This is one of a series of existence-theorems proved by Krull (1937). The theorems in
stion hold under conditions more general than those postulated throughout Part I of
(Bis paper—as a matter of fact, that is true of almost all the results of this section. The proof
o&Theorem 5 reduces essentially to the remarks that unity cannot be integrally dependent
of the prime ideal pR,; so Theorem 14 supplies a prime ideal of S, which contains pG,,
aad consequently lies over p®,. In the paper of Krull (1937), again, (4, 5)—(4.7) are deduced
idly from the form of Theorem 5 proved there—
