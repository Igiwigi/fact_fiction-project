Usually, segmentation is performed after beat detection which :8

selection of the most robust segmentation algorithm for the clinical 12-lead ECG. However, given :8
the fact that this type of ECG can be quickly acquired at low cost, physicians usually recollect : re
the measurements in case of low quality. We therefore assumed that the ECG within the dataset 1

was of sufficient quality (but we leave this investigation for the future). On the other hand, when (Ss
the ECG signal is acquired in different contexts, e.g. sport activities and Holter acquisitions, the :s
quality could be lower.
