BxRzELIus based his conclusions on the following experiments, viz. (1) the constant
loss of weight which vanadic acid undergoes on reduction in hydrogen at a red heat;
(2) the action of chlorine on this reduced oxide, when a volatile chloride is formed and
a residue of vanadic acid remains, which is found to be exactly one-third of the quantity
originally taken for reduction in hydrogen. Hence Berzelaus concludes that the
number of atoms of oxygen in the oxide is to that in the acid in the proportion of
1 to 3; 80 that (asuming the lowest oxide to contain one atom of oxygen) the acid
contains three atoms, a result which BERzELIUs finds borne out by its capacity of satura-
tion. The question whether the acid contains one or two atoms of metal BerzeLIUS
decides in fayour of the former view, by finding that no compound corresponding to the
alums is formed when vanadic acid is brought together with sulphuric acid and potash.
'The analyses of the volatile chloride made both by BurzerLtus and SCHAPARIK confirm
this conclusion, and place beyond all doubt the fact that, if the atomic weight of yana-
dium be taken to be 68:5 and O=8, the formula of vanadiec acid is V O,, that of the
oxide prepared by reduction V O, and that of the chloride V Cl,.

In the present communication I shall show that, whilst confirming these fundamental
results in every particular, I still arrive at a totally different contlusion from BrrzeLus
respecting the constitution of yanadic acid, and all the other vanadium compounds; for
1 shall prove that the true formula of vanadic acid is V, O, (when O= 16), and the true
atomic weight, of yanadium 51-3, inasmuch as the substance 8upposed by BerzELIVs to
be vanadium is not the metal but an oxide with an atomic weight of 67:3, nearly that
of BeRzgLtvs's metal, whilst the supposed terchloride is an oxychloride. _

The following are the grounds upon which IT base my conclusions ; the experimental
