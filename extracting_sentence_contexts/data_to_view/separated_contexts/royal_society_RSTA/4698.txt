Mixing enhancement experiments

In this section, a problem of the mixing enhancement is explored owing to a mechanism of
gasdynamic instabilities developing at decay of after-discharge channel. It was mentioned in
the Introduction that such a mechanism is one of several direct and indirect ones that could be
realized at interaction of electrical discharge with a high-speed flow. The described mechanism
is based on an experimentally proved fact that a strongly turbulent gas motion develops in a
cooling post-discharge channel [33-35]. In experiments with a pulse sub-microsecond filamentary
discharge [36-38], it has been shown that there is one more, much faster, mechanism of the
after-spark channel expansion. In such specific mode, the expansion is driven by high-velocity
radial jets formed during the after-spark channel cooling.
