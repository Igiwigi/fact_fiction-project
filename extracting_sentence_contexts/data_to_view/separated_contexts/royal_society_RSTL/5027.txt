I ought here to mention that a similar separation did not take place on the
Addition of water only to an ethereal extract from archil previously dried. The con-
Alition which determined the separation in the first case appeared to be the presence
Sf a small quantity of ammonia, which would evaporate on drying the archil. And
#n fact when a small quantity of ammonia was added to the.extract from dried arehil,
A partial separation was effected. I do not here enter into the question whether one
f the sensitive principles may be obtained from the other, whether, for example, a
-ghemical combination of the orange-dispersing principle with ammonia might disperse
S green, or a green with a little orange. A solution containing a mixture of the same
ubstance in two different states of chemical combination, both compounds being
ensitive, is not the less justly regarded as containing two distinct sensitive prin-
ciples.
