In particular, the
spaces Lx, Ax, A, remain unchanged for k > 2. But, according to the Gelfand—Cetlin diagram, the
eigenvalue of Ey is necessarily 4, hence C’ = ¢,C lies in the same fibre of I, as C. Figure 3 provides a geometric interpretation of the above two facts. Consider E° a generic
ellipsoid in C3 with semi-principal axes v1,v2,v3 of lengths a1 <az <a3 (with a; =1/,/Aj). If
EF? =F> NV? is a circle of radius az contained in E°, then v2 must be an axis of FE’, giving the
condition W2 = Span(vz) C V?.
