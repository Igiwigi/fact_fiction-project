H. JONES ON THE STRUCTURE

scanty basis 8ubstance; they are quite devoid of basement membrane, and measure
only ;â€”59th of an inch towards their terminal extremity. The mode which I have
adopted of examining the ducts may be thought by some to he objectionable, on the
ground that the extremities of the ducts must necessarily be lacerated ; but I think a
careful repetition of the process I have indicated, will satisfy the observer that it
offers the most probable means for deciding the point in question ; in fact I know of
no other except injection which can be adopted, and I am satisfied that in this case
the results of injection are not to be depended on. To one remarkable character of
the ducts which has been mentioned I would ask especial attention, viz. the long
course which the smaller ramifications take without giving off branches. I have ob-
served one which ran 2th of an inch without giving off any branches, and another
which gave off only one branch in a course of 45th of an inch.
