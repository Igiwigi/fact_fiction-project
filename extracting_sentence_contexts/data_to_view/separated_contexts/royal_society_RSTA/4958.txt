According to the above analysis, the two

minute changes of level along the upper surface of a uniform mercury thread by an

turned on, the section of the thread became more nearly circular owing to
mutual attractions of the different filaments of the current, but there was
alteration in the direction of its length. This experimental evidence, combined with the fact (infra) that a theory
moving electrons, which are certainly independent physical entities, leads simply
the Ampkre-MAxweELt forcive, seems to justify the conclusion that either the
analysis is wrong, or else the ordinary treatment of electrodynamics in terms
specification by current elements is physically untenable. As tending to
exclusion of the first alternative, and also as of independent critical interest,
following discussion by aid of the more usual analytical method employed
Amphre, NeuMANN, and von HELMHOL?z is given. 4, Assuming that current elements serve as a sufficient physical specification, it
known that the mutual energy (kinetic) of two such elements, 1s and V8s’, must be
