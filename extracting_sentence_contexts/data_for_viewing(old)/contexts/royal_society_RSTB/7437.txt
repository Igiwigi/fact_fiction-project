(2) There are examples of united somites which do represent more than one segment, but
the early development of such structures may show their dual nature, as, for example, the
fused maxillary and first thoracic coelomic sacs in Hemimysis.

(3) Although most coelomic spaces arise each from a single lacuna within the somite
mesoderm, which then gradually enlarges, some coelomic spaces may arise from several
lacunae in a mesodermal band when the embryo is relatively large, as do the anterior
somites in P. moseleyi and P. capensis and in the species shown in figure 5a to d (p. 524).
The existence of multiple initial spaces is no evidence that each of these spaces represents
a segmental unit.

In an interpretation of any one animal the facts of development of that animal must be
adequately considered with appreciation of the above points, and comparisons must be
made with other Arthropoda. A disregard of these principles has led to faulty arguments
and confusion in the literature.

Lastly, there is a further possible cause of variation in segment numbers in the tagmata
of arthropods, which is not usually operative in head formation, but which may possibly

* This conclusion is at variance with that of Holmgren (1916) and Hanstrom (1928), who on neurological
evidence alone consider the jaw segment of the Onychophora to be the first segment of the body see (see
pp. 558 and 561).
