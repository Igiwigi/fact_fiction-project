nating waves from this electro-magnetic machine were transmitted through the same-
sized iron wire as was used in the preceding experiment, 8 inches of it were melted, and
a length of 24 inches was raised to a red heat. 62. A comparison of the heating effects of the two machines, as found by these expe-
riments, brings out the important fact, that a much greater amount of electricity is
evolved from the electro-magnetic machine than is evolved simultaneously from the
magneto-electric machine. Moreover, considering the smallness of the quantity of iron
of which the armature was made (only five pounds), and of the copper wire swrrounding
it, the weight of which was only 34 pounds, the heating effects of the electro-magnetic
machine are very remarkable. One of the most energetic generators of dynamic elec-
tricity is that invented by Grove, and it was found from experiments made with four
A new cells of this battery, the platina plates of which were 6x 34 inches, with double

zinc plates well amalgamated, and charged with concentrated nitric acid and a strong
solution of sulphuric acid, that ten cells of this powerful arrangement would be required
in order to produce the same heating effects as those produced by the electro-magnetic
machine.
