The cloud puffs represent the hadronization
process. Hadrons other than fy and hg are also produced but are not shown in the figure. The fact that the pair's spins can
remain entangled is represented by the vertical arrows. (Online version in colour.)

However, the quark and anti-quark, despite being unpolarized, nevertheless have entangled

spins, and this results in a measurable azimuthal dependence. The situation is very reminiscent of : =
the Einstein—Podolsky—Rosen scenario [4], but with the process of hadronization taking the place : =
of separate, distant measurements. The entangled spins are allowed in the TMD factorization 1B
theorem for this process, with fragmentation functions each carrying transverse spin indices.
