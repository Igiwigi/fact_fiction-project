_ geed,—the gain appearing only when the Nitrogen in the s0il and pot is taken into
© gecount. Tt will be remembered that the results of the experiments on the question
© whether there was an evolution of Nitrogen during germination and growth (Table XT.,

 p. 913) showed how completely the plants could appropriate the Nitrogen of the seed
from which they grew, leaving only traces of it in the soil. Again, the experiments on

- the decomposition of Nitrogenous organic matter (Tables VIII. and IX., p. 506) have

- shown how thorough was the decomposition coincident with the passage of any large

- percentage of the combined Nitrogen of the substance into the soluble state of ammonia.
Taking together these facts, we have strong grounds for assuming that at least a part
of the Nitrogen found in the 8011, in the cases where there was a gain of it in the total

Aproducts, has never been in actual connexion with the plant at all. Tndeed, in view of

Ihe facts just referred to, any gain of Nitrogen in connexion with the plant, without

Athero being a larger quantity of Nitrogen in the plant itself than that provided in the

Saoed, would be very questionable evidence upon which to establish the fact of the assi-

=milation of free Nitrogen.
