5. Cicatricial Intercalary Seginents.

The nature of the cicatricial mass, uniting two ends of a nerve by a bond which
does not allow re-establishment of function, is illustrated by two of the cases. In
these, although the mass has the appearance of cicatricial connective tissue, yet the
microscopical examination shows that from end to end the mass contains a rich
supply of young nerve fibres. But at the same time, these young fibres are
separated by much dense connective tissue, which in some places is massed together
to the exclusion of young nerve fibres (Plate 5, figs. 3 to 6; Plate 6, fig. 1). This
mass has evidently been supplied with nerve fibres by immigration into it of
neuroblasts, either from the central end or from both. I think from both ends, from
the fact that both central and peripheral ends of nerves, remaining entirely
separated, show at their ends a mass of connective tissue containing nerve fibres.
The latter do not run in parallel lines, as they do when met in a piece of old nerve,

but are convoluted, showing that they have been developed in the irregular spaces
of the connective tissue. But if a cicatricial mass connecting the two ends of a
divided nerve is thus supplied with nerve fibres from the central and peripheral ends,
there must be some cause preventing the transmission of impulses. The explanation
which seems to me most probable, is that if there has been much inflammation in the
parts, the amount of cicatricial tissue in the mass is so great, that by the time the
