A. D. WALLER ON THE “BLAZE CURRENTS”

fact that I have carefully examined into the possible parallelism between luminous
and electrical stimulation effects in different states of eyeball makes the omission
unadvisable, and I think it will be preferable that I should give a brief account of
these somewhat unsatisfactory results. Moreover, the very facts that no clear results
have been obtained, and that there is very evident defect of parallelism between
effects of luminous and of electrical stimuli, are, although negative items of evidence,
points of some possible future significance. At an early stage of the investigation, I noticed more than once that an eyeball
put up as usual in a dark box gave larger blaze currents than an eyeball put up on
electrodes and exposed to the continuous effect of ordinary light.
