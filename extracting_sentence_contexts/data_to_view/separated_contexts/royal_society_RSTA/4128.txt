We complete this presentation with remarks on the role of CP and Boolean logic. The
probability of a hypothesis H conditional on a collected data E is the ratio of the unconditional
probability of the conjunction of the hypothesis with the data to the unconditional probability of
the data alone. This is the famous Bayes’ formula (in fact, serving as the definition of conditional
probability):
p(H&E)
ple)
provided that both terms of this ratio exist and p(E) > 0. Bayes’ theorem relates the ‘direct’ probability of a hypothesis conditional on the data, p(H|E),
to the ‘inverse’ probability of the data conditional on the hypothesis, p(E|H),
pA)

p(HIE) = Fal p(E\H). (2.2)

This possibility to ‘invert’ probability p(H|E), ie. express it through the probability p(E|H) is based
on the use of Boolean logic, the basis to the modern probability theory and Bayesian reasoning. It
may be even better to consider Bayes’ theorem as an exhibition of commutativity of the operation
of conjunction in Boolean logic:

PAE) =

(2.1)

H&E = E&H. (2.3)

Quantum-like models of subjectivist PU, see §5, are based on non-classical (non-Boolean) logic.
