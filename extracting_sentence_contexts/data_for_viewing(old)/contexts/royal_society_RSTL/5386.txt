tically, and a strong transmitted light is employed. It is convenient also for viewing
the egg laterally with a simple plano-convex lens of low power, with the view of
observing the formation of the chamber above the yelk, or watching the cleavage of
the yelk; but the experience of some years has proved that the cell is not suited for
the lateral examination of the egg with the compound microscope, owing to the
thickness and the convexity of its wall. True, the passing of the spermatozoon into
the external envelope, and even ito the vitelline membrane, can Ã¾e readily observed
when the tube cell is employed in the upright position of the wicroscope, but I
have been unable to follow satisfactorily the course of the spermatozoon completely
through the yelk membrane in that position of the object, in consequence of the dark
colour and opacity of the egg.

To ascertain the fact of the impregnation of the ovum by penetration, it was then
necessary to invent some means by which the egg could be examined laterally with
the compound microscope. The great difficulty to be overcome was the tendency of

the dark surface of the fecundated ovum to maintain a vertical position, with the
consequent rotation or rather gravitation of the whole mass of the yelk, whenever
there was any change in the position of the cell. I contrived for this purpose a cell
or box larger than the one before described, which may be designated a cistern box ;
and with it I could note all the changes that took place whilst the egg was quite
undisturbed. This box resembles the animalcule cage of Mr. TuuryF, since it is
