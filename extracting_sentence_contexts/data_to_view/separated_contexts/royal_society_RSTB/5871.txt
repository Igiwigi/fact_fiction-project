The claw processes of the anterior gnathobases must also assist in pushing forwards
the food mass but I believe that this function diminishes as the food passes forwards. In fact, I do not believe that the main function of the claw process is gnathobasic. If it were so, it is difficult to see why it has lost the claw armature which is so conspicuous
in the hinder limbs, for its terminal claws, in fact, the only claws it retains, progressively
diminish in actual size in the anterior limbs although the gnathobase itself becomes
considerably larger. The function of the claw process is, I believe, to assist in directing forwards the spurts
of water leaving the inter-limb spaces. The exit channels from these spaces are covered
on their median side by the gnathobase and water is forced from the inter-limb space
when the limb is at the end of its backstroke.
