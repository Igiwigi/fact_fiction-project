fact we have experimentally shown (31.). Similar effects would ensue in placing a
neutral body under any other circumstances involving similar conditions, as in placing
a very small conducting ball immediately between two large electrified globes. The
small globe does not, under these circumstances, according to CouLonBs, take up any
free electricity.

48. It would be difficult, without the aid of induction, to explain in what way the
mere position of a neutral body, in respect of the electrical particles by which it is
surrounded, effects its power of absorbing electricity ; and even with this we require
a more extensive investigation of the phenomena than has yet appeared. That a
change of position of the electrical particles of a charged surface in respect of each
other, and of the body charged, is attended by important consequences, has been
already shown by Voura, who obseryed the curious fact that the intensity of a charged

plate becomes greatly diminished as its length is increased, although the area of the
plate and the quantity of electricity remain the same ; a subject which I have already
treated of to some extent *. But in extending a plate in length, we elongate, as it
were, the stratum of electricity resident about it, and thus place the electrical mole-
cules, if such exist, in a new relation of position in respect of each other and of the
