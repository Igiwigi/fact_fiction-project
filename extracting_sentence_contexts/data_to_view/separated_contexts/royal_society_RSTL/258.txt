In the
Asia, lately launched in the Medway, the arching amounted to
three inches and a quarter, and the comparative length of the
upper and lower parts was probably altered about two inches
at most : the parting of the butts amounting to 4; of an inch
each * ſor upwards of fifty feet in length in the midships, and
for about eight feet from the top of the side,” making a total,
extension of probably less than an inch : $0 that about half the

effect seems to have been produced in one way, and half in the
other; but apparently the greater half by the want of stiffness,

It is also usually observable, that there has been some degree

of permanent compression or crippling below, the butts of the

planks opening when the cause of arching has been removed,

and the sheathing being more wrinkled than would have

happened from the simple bending of the planks. Where it

has been. observed, that the fore part of all the treenails sup-

ported the pressure of the planks in the after part of the ship,

and the after part in the fore part of the ship, the observation

must probably have been made on the lower parts of the ship,

from the effect of a partial compression of this kind.

7 Authorittes. From this statement it appears, that unless some very strong
facts can be. produced, to disprove the probability, that the
relative angular position of the. parts constituting a ship may
always be materially altered, without an absolute failure of
strength, it cannot be denied that the principle of oblique
bracing offers a remedy for the tendency to arch, whatever
doubts there may be of the efficacy of any particular mode of
applying it. And even if no obgservations could be produced
in confirmation of the frequent occurrence of such a change
of the angular situation of the timbers, the suppoxition that the
stiffness could be perfect in this respect, notwithstanding the
unequal 'shrinking of the timbers, and other similar circum-
stances, while the ultimate strength gave way by' the failure
of the fastenings, is in itself so highly improbable, that no
positive evidence would be required for its complete rejection. We shall find accordingly, that Mr, Bovucve takes for granted
the existence of a partial flexure, as sufficiently admissible
without direct proof, and recommends the adoption of oblique
planking as a remedy; and that other experienced authors
have been equally favourable to the employment of some
similar arrangements, In speaking of Mr.
