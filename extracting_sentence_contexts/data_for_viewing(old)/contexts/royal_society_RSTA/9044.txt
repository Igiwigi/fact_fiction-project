Tue first Magnetic Survey of the British Isles by Ricker and THorre was reduced
to epoch January 1, 1886, and their more extended survey was reduced to epoch
January 1, 1891. For some years a revision of the original survey had been
contemplated by Sir ArrHuR Ricker, but for various reasons did not mature. In
the summer of 1913 the Royal Society decided to repeat the survey of the main
magnetic features of the British Isles obtained by Ricker and Tuorre, and invited
me to undertake the work.

It would in any case have been an honour to carry out this work, but to me the
honour was increased by the fact that I was a pupil of Sir ArrHur Ricker and
Sir Epwarp Txorrs, at the Royal College of Science, when their great undertaking
was nearing its completion. The Royal Society desired that I should consult
Sir ArrHur Ricker with regard to the general scope of .the new survey; and,
fortunately, Sir ArrHuUR was able at the time to enter into the matter both by
correspondence and by personal interview. His view was that the original 200 points
used by him and Sir Epwarp Tuorre should be re-determined and, if possible,
marked in some permanent way. He further desired that about 40 new points along
the Yorkshire “ ridge line” should be chosen.

We discussed the question of apparatus, and the strongest arguments were in
favour of using the same type of apparatus as before, viz., a Kew Unifilar and a Dover
Dip-Circle. I proposed to reduce all values to Greenwich Observatory as theoretical
