Tn our early experiments on this subject we attempted to investigate this problem
by covering dishes, containing absorbent solutions of caustic soda, with thin glass or
metal dises having central apertures of various sizes, and ascertaining from the
amount of carbon dioxide absorbed the relative velocity with which diffusion takes
place per unit area of the aperture.*

These first attempts were necessarily very crude, and the results were much inter-
fered with by convection currents, but they were sufficient to indicate that after the
aperture in the cover had been reduced to a certain point, the carbon dioxide passing
through unit area of aperture in a given time showed a marked increase, which could
not be satisfactorily accounted for by the mere difference in the gradient of the
partial pressures of the gas inside and outside the covered dish. This led us. to investigate the influence of a perforated diaphragm on the diffusion
of atmospheric CO, down a column of air in which the flow was at a maximum, that
is to say, only limited by the coefficient of diffusion of the gas. The interesting fact was then brought to light that as the end of the tube was
restricted the diffusive flow per unit area of aperture rapidly increased, and that
when the central hole had been diminished beyond a certain size relative to the cross-
section of the column, the amount of gas which passed became proportional to the
linear dimensions of the apertures. This is well shown in the following experiments :—

A series of similar flat-bottomed flasks was taken, having necks about 7 centims.
long and about 23 millims. diameter at the mouth. When 200 cub. centims. of a
normal caustic soda solution was introduced, the surface of the absorbing liquid, which
was about 10 centims. in diameter, maintained the pressure of the carbon dioxide in
the air of the flask at so low a point as to induce what was practically a maximum
diffusive flow down the tube forming the neck.
