Without a doubt,
the assumed constancy of the length of the antiferromagnetic vector does not mean that its
orientation kinetics is described by Brown’s equation. Recall that this equation is valid, strictly
speaking, only for a system whose regular magnetodynamics is described by the Landau-
Lifshitz—Gilbert equation. The choice of (3.1) as a theoretical basis, in fact, implies that rotations of
the antiferromagnetic vector has the same character as the motion of the magnetization vector of
each of the sublattices. Nevertheless, one should be aware that this approach is rather simplistic. In particular, it is known that in general case a dynamic equation for the AFM vector includes a
term proportional to the second time derivative, see, for example, refs. [21,22], in contrast to the
Landau-Lifshitz—Gilbert equation.
