â€˜The colour and fluorescence of such solutions are indeed identical with those of the
natural yellow pigment, and are affected in identical manner by reagents. So close
is this resemblance that, with the knowledge that both are related to uric acid, one
eannot but be impressed with the likelihood of the identity of the yellow substances. More direct evidence of the identity thus suggested is found in the fact that the
artificial product under treatment similar to that which converts the natural pigment
into lepidoporphyrin yields a purple derivative, apparently identical with the latter
substance. A yellow solution of pigmented urate, prepared according to the method of Htast-
wetz, will, if heated on the water-bath with 15 per cent. sulphuric acid, gradually
come to show the absorption bands of lepidoporphyrin, and will eventually yield a
purple precipitate of this substance.
