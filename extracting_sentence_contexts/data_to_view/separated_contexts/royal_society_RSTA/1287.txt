To summarize, the model we have in mind has the following structure. A transmission planner
is to determine a plan of transmission investments over a long time horizon that adapts to changes
in circumstances as exogenous market conditions (e.g. demand, fuel prices, etc.) become revealed
over time. The plan accounts for the fact that in the time interval between each transmission
expansion,! each generator in the network will choose a capacity level, and generation amounts
for each period in this interval that will maximize its profits over this time interval, accounting
for the actions of competing generators in a Cournot oligopoly. The transmission investments of
the planner are chosen to maximize the total expected welfare of generators and consumers less
transmission capital costs over the planning horizon. Nomenclature is provided in table 1.
