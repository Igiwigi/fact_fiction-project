Conjugacy and good coverage suggest that the DP could be a very good general purpose non- a
parametric density estimator. Unfortunately, the distributions drawn from a DP prior are, with a
probability one, discrete so they do not have a density. In fact, a draw from a DP prior can be is
represented in the following way: : 8

~
C= mdx, 61) 5
2 =

where the sum is an infinite sum, the z, are masses that sum to one, 6 is the Dirac-delta function :e
and the x; are locations for those probability masses drawn iid from the base measure H, which
controls the mean of G. To alleviate the problem of discreteness, the DP is often used as a prior on :=
the parameters of a mixture model, with the whole model now called a Dirichlet process mixture iB
(DPM) [20,24~26]. â€˜Sp

The particular example of a DPM of Gaussians, also known as an infinite Gaussian mixture :s
model [27], is widely used for both density estimation and clustering. Clustering refers to the ree
problem of finding groupings of objects or data points such that similar objects belong to the same :
group and dissimilar objects belong to different groups.
