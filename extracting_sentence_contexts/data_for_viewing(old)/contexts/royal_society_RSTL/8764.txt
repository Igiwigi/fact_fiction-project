Accordingly we may assume that if v, v', and v” are the volumes at the same tem-
perature of quantities of the solutions, the volume of each of which at 0? C. is unity, the

between the specific gravities of the solutions employed, which are
004355, 003748, and -004160
respectively, differ in the fourth place of decimals, we are led to the conclusion that F(s)
is a linear function of s, and that differences in the fourth place of decimals in the value
of the specific gravities do not involve important changes in the law of thermal
expansion.
From this it follows that equation (1), when written at length, is of the form
