resentation phenomenologically indistinguishable from the
probabilistic representation he posits. The challenge, given
‘confidentialism,’ is to specify an overlooked phenomenological
difference. We mention three possibilities.

One response would suggest that there are phenomenolo-
gical differences associated with perceptual anticipations of
what one would see were one, for example, to look more clo-
sely—where these perceptual anticipations would reflect the
distribution of credences [77]. It would need to be the case
that this phenomenology was perceptual and distinct from
feelings of surprise or fulfilment experienced when such
actions were, in fact, undertaken. A second response might
appeal to the epistemic emotion sometimes dubbed the ‘feel-
ing of certainty’ [78,79]. It is perhaps harder to maintain that
one can simultaneously experience distinct subjective feelings
of certainty regarding each of a range of candidates. But this
might be an option if perceptual consciousness represents
only one candidate feature with some credence assigned just
to it. (cf. Rahnev [80] on options intermediate between rep-
resentations of full distributions and single point estimates.
This option is not available to Morrison, who requires that
multiple candidates be assigned credences; nor does it fit
extant models that distribute credences across a range of
hypotheses.) It is unobvious, however, that this subjective
