The
only displacement of the eyes that can be regarded as truly characteristic of the
lesion is that which exists after all influence of the anssthetic has passed off. But
there is another effect of the anesthetic to which I wish to allude, and that is its
influence with regard to the position assumed by the eyes after ali displacement, the
result of the operation, has passed off, and the animal is again placed under the
anesthetic influence of ether. In the stage which precedes that in which the eyes
diverge—the stage, in fact, in which the eyes of normal dogs are displaced to one
side or the other—the eyes of such dogs are displaced to the opposite side from that
of the lesion, and this irrespective of the side to which they turned in the same

stage of narcosis before the peduncle was divided. The effect of the anzesthetic in

such animals, then, is to reproduce, at a certain stage of anwsthesia, the ocular
displacement which at one time existed as a result of section of one inferior peduncle
of the cerebellum. Nystagmus.—Spontaneous nystagmus is rarely observed when the animal is at rest,
but when disturbed and placed in some position in which it does not feel secure—as,
for instance, when placed to lie on its right side when the left inferior peduncle has
been divided—nystagmus is rarely absent during the first few days after the opera-
tion.
