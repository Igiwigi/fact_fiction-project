9. The chief difficulty in the reproduction of drawings or engravings, consists in
the necessity of operating a double transfer, s0 as to produce a resulting impression
of the same character as the original in both these respects, whereas from what is
above aid it appears that this does not apply in the case of a camera picture. Grant-
ing therefore that such a picture could be impressed with such depth and sharpness
as to be equal in these respects to a finished engraving, the problem of photographic
publication is s80lved, since it is a fact that the negative reversed photographic im-
pression of an engraving, however highly finished, such as is obtained by a single
transfer on white paper, is quite equal in precision and finish to the original en-
graving. 10. The above remarks relate only to what may be called the practical part of the
photographic art.
