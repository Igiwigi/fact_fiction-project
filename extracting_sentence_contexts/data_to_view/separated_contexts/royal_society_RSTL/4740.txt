Oride of Tetrethylammonium. I bave already briefly stated how this substance is prepared ; on decomposing the
iodide with an excess of sulphate of silver, a sulphate is obtained, from which suE
phuric acid and excess of silver may be separated by baryta. This was in fact the
first process by which I separated the base; it is, however, difficult to obtain the
Solution in this manner free from either baryta or sulphuric acid; nor haye I ever

used this process again, after I had found that digestion with freshly precipitated
protoxide of silyer produces at once the same effect. 'The oxide is added in small
proportions to the solution of the iodide, which is gently heated; it is immediately
converted into yellow iodide of silyer, which assumes a white colour on stirring, as
long as any undecomposed iodide is in solution.
