A link thus used may be referred to as a sounder. In this way it is possible to
obtain evidence of the existence, or of the exact value, of a calculated line which
lies beyond the region observed. It may even serve as evidence for the real existence
of a line in the observed region too weak to have been observed, for it was shown

in [IV.] that the e link appeared to have a tendency to increase the intensity of one
of the two lines to which it was attached. The method may be illustrated by an
example from KrS. In Kr, e = 3183°35. The value of §, (5) as calculated from the
formula is 47419°39, which is in the ultra-violet outside the observed region, But
47419'39—e = 4423604. This is within the observed region, and as a fact the
corresponding line is found at 44237°61 with dA = —'08 if e is free from error. As
an individual case this might be due to a coincidence, but when the same effect occurs
with line after line the cumulative effect becomes convincing. To see this it is
necessary to get at a glance a survey of all the cases, and for this purpose they are
exhibited in sets of diagrams in Plate 3. These diagrams also include links within
the observed region in order to show that where the method can be tested it holds.
It may be specially noted how the similar arrangement of sounders holds for the same
order in the three lines of the same triplet, and how in certain eases the u, v seem
alternative. Of. for example XS (1, 3, 4, 7, 8), or the main lines of the three paralld
D sets in X, viz. (20,)Dy, Dy, (—26,)Dy, or particularly the prevalence of the
—(e+v) combinations in the unobserved lines for KrD. In RaEm these links are
too large to be of wide application and in Ne too small to be of use. In RaEm
