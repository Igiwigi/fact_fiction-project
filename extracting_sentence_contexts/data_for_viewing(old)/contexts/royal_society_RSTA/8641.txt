rather wide straits, Carimata Strait and Gaspar Strait. In both of these the tide is
mainly diurnal ; in the latter, in fact, it is entirely so. At Pontianak, near the north-
westerly point of Borneo, the tide is still diurnal; thus the part of the China
Sea south of Pontianak and Singapore probably contributes little to the secular
acceleration of the moon.

Apparently the main tidal stream from the China Sea strikes the Malay Peninsula
somewhere near Cape Patani and spreads out from there; for on the coast north of
this point the flood stream sets to the north, while south of it it sets to the south.
The tide in this region is definitely semi-diurnal, though the heights of the two daily
high waters may be unequal. The depths in the western part of the sea and in the
Gulf of Siam are mostly about 30 fathoms, but there are many shoals around the

.coast where the depth is only a few fathoms, and it is therefore necessary to be very
