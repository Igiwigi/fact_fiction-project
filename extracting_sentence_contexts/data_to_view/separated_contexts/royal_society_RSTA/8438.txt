The means of the latter are given in Table I., under “ helix.’

Their values are large—over a centimetre on the scale—the case chosen for illustration
being one of those in which the R effect was overpowered by that of the helix for the
purpose of causing both 0, throws to be in the same direction (see above). The true
sign of the R effect is that of the observed 0, after subtracting from this the corresponding
helix throw ; this difference being given under “ 0, corrected for helix.’

It might have been expected that correcting for the helix effect in this way would have
brought the values of 6, for m-} and m— to equality. That it has not done so is due
to the fact that the helix effect as measured is greater than that which accompanies
the R effect, because in the case of an R effect the helix acts on magnetism which is
