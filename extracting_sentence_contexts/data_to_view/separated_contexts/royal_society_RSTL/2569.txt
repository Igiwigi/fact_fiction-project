Sand, gravel, and shells may then have been deposited at its bot-
tom, which on the subsequent removal of the barrier were left at their present height
above the lake. But if the shells had been submitted to a conchologist, they would
have been at once recognized as consisting for the most part of marine species, 8uch
as do not exist in the present waters of Lake Maeler, but are characteristic of the
Baltic. Whatever doubts, therefore, may hang over the causes which brought the hut
into the extraordinary position in which it was discoyered, it is impossible to reflect
on this and the other facts brought to light during the excavation of the Sidertelje
canal, without being convinced that very important moyements have taken place in the
land and the bed of the sea since the Baltic was inhabited by the existing Testacea,
and even since the sea was navigated by vessels, and this country inhabited by man. In regard to the shells, I may observe that the Mya arenaria is the only one found
by me in great abundance in any part of the Baltic which I did not see among the
fossi]s of any of the localities already mentioned, or those afterwards to be alluded
to, further to the north. But this shell does not, I believe, extend s0 far north in the
Gulf of Bothnia as S6dertelje; I could not find it eyen at Calmar, and further south,
at Solvitzborg, it was rare, and of very small size.
