The formation of these objects is extremely instructive,,as
it manifests the affinity between the matter of which stars are
composed, and that of the most unshapen chaotic mass of ne
bulosity. For the vanishing chevelure of a star being equally
connected, on the one hand, with the generally diffused nebu-
lous matter, and on the other with the star itself, round which
it is in a state of gradual condensation.; this double union de-
notes the mutual gravitation of the whole mass of nebulosity
and the star towards each other; and unless this. proof, can be .
invalidated, we must admit the fact of the growing condition
of stars, that are in the situation which has been pointed out.

This argument also adds greatly to the probability of stars
