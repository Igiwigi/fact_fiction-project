the ordinary methods, it may be observed as a general fact, that the energy
is acquired in somewhat less time than that in which it is again lost. This is
particularly the case in soft iron rendered magnetic, by an electro-magnetic
spiral; a simple contact between a magnet and a mass of soft iron will fre-
quently convey to it an attractive force, which it retains for a comparatively
long space of time. In regard to the susceptibility of different substances, it
is found to vary considerably; and depends on some peculiar property not yet
explained ; it seems to be in some-inyerse ratio of their retentive power. Thus
it'is not without difficulty that' hardened $teel is made permanently magnetic,
whilst its retentive power is considerable: soft iron, on the contrary, is observed
to be comparatively'feeble in its retentive power, whilst its snsceptibility of
magnetic change is great. It may be hence inferred, that in non-ferruginous
masses, the mere susceptibility of magnetic change, is in fact -als0 conside-
rable, but then their retentive power 1s $0 feeble, that the subsequent attraction
does not ensue to any great extent. This probably arises from some peculiar
state of the particles of these substances, which allows what may be termed
the new magnetic distribution, to tend more rapidly to the previous state of
neutrality, immediately the tension passes a certain point. In every observed
instance, however, more time seems necessary to restore perfectly, the original
state of the body, than was required to disturb it, the former being the result
of a progressive operation, whilst the latter is effected by a sndden and con-
centrated force.

iron, is invariably preceded by this new magnetic distribution in the iron ;
