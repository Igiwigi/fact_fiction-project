Ãž the very characteristically different flora encouraged, greater maturation also than
Sith the conditions of less luxuriant growth, and, relatively to these, a greater supply
the constituents known to promote maturation.
A As referred to in Part T., and as will be fully illustrated in Part IL1., the difterence in
the chemical composition of the produce of the two plots was quite consistent with
the difference in the relative predominance of families and species, and with the
relative condition of maturity described. Thus, ceteris paribus, the more mature a
plant, the less will be the percentage of both mineral constibuents and nitrogen in
its dry substance. Again, speaking generally, the percentage of the mineral con-
stituents is higher in the Leguminose than in the Graminew, and higher still in the
Mizcellanew, of the mixed herbage ; and the percentage of nitrogen is s0mewhab higher
in the Miscellanee, and considerably higher in the Leguminosz, than in the Graminew.
Quite consistently with these facts, the percentage, both of mineral constituents and

of nitrogen, was lower in the dry substance of the more gramineons and the riper
produce of plot 14, than in the more mixed and less matured herbage of plot 16.

Another point of interesb brought out by a consideration of the mutual relations
of the botanical and the chemical results is, that whilst with the heavier, the more
simple, and the more gramineous herbage of plot 14, there was a greater actual
quantity of both nitrogen and of mineral constituents taken up over a given area,
