W. HEAPE ON THE PROPORTION OF THE SEXES

was less complete than it was for the later three years, and that this was specially the
case for the country districts, and therefore for the coloured people who chiefly
inhabited those portions of the Island. IT am not in possession of sufticiently full details to enable a complete comparison to
be made between these two periods ; the chief fact of importance to be gathered is that
for the whole seven years, 1900-6, there were 21°21 per cent. of illegitimate births
for whites (2°49 per cent. more than for the last three years), and 70°72 per cent. for
coloured people (4°94 per cent. more than for the last three years). Thus it is clear the social condition of the country in the early years after the war
was different from what it became later and, so far as whites are concerned, in
accordance with the views already expressed, the increased prevalence of illegitimacy
in the towns will largely account for the increased proportion of F. births under that
head. For coloured people it will be seen there is an increase ot 0°98 F. for legitimate
births during the whole seven years (compare Tables XIV and XIII), and a decrease
of 1°98 for illegitimate births during that period.
