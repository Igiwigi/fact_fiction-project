The change, for example, may be represented thus:â€”

+ = + = + =
H, O., Zn, Zn, O, N=NH,+6ZnO.

6. To the preceding experiments I will only add the phenomena of substitution,
which, viewed in relation to them, assume a new form. The division of the chlorine
which takes place in substitntion is a very similar fact to that distribution of the ele-
ment which takes place in the formation of chloro-sulphuric acid (which I have be-
fore cited), and admits of a similar explanation. The problem is, why, with even
the smallest quantity of chlorine, does a portion of the chlorine ever combine with
the organic body? Why is the hydrogen never simply removed?
