Thus, collective migration is evident at practically
all scales (figure 1), in both natural and artificial systems. The universality of this phenomenon [8] has led to intense investigation; col-
lective migration has been studied substantially in animals [1,9], but only
comparatively recently in cells. The fact that collective motion is conserved at
different scales suggests that there may be common, underlying principles
that govern the movement of groups. It has long been noted in animals that
there is a remarkable degree of long-range organization that cannot be apparent
to each individual, meaning there must be some degree of leadership or com-
munication [10]. Likewise, embryonic morphogenesis involves large-scale
