Although the disposition of electricity on insulated conductors is subject to the
laws above deduced (16.), and which are invariable when the surface remains the
same, or is perfectly similar in respect of dimensions and form, yet these laws do not
appear, under eyery condition, incidental to the conducting surface. It has been
already observed by Vorra, that extension in length greatly contributes to increase
the capacity of a conductor ; 80 that of two plane surfaces of equal area, that which
has the greatest extension has also the greatest capacity for electricity. I have pur-
sued this interesting fact, and have arrived at some further results which seem of
importance. (o.) Having procured some rectangular plates of equal area, such as represented in
fig. 19, whose figures varied from a circle, through a square, up to a long parallelo-
gram, I submitted them to experiment, according to the methods already described
(14.).
