522 E, TREWAVAS ON THE HYOID AND LARYNX OF THE ANURA.

is constant in the Brevicipitide: (both muscles absent), it occurs in Eupemphix, also
in Atelopus and Oreophrynella (both muscles) in Bufo (petrohyoid) and in Dendro-
phryniscus (omohyoid), also in Pseudopaludicola (petrohyoid). In indicating re-
lationships it is of use as an additional character only.

Into this category comes also incompleteness of the cricoid ring. This was formerly
supposed to occur in Discoglossus, and to be a primitive feature. It is now known
not to occur in adult Discoglossus. In the Pelobatide a dorsal gap appears to be
constant and to be here a true indication of relationship, in spite of the fact that it has
also been recorded in the unrelated Rhacophorus dennysi (Frazier, 1924). A ventral
gap, however, is present in several unrelated species, namely, Oreophrynella quelchit,
Crinia signifera, Leptodactylus caliginosus (but not ocellatus), Pseudohemisus longimanus
and Cacosternum capense. A paired lateral break is present in Dendrobates tinctorius
(Biume, 1930) and perhaps in Edalorhina perezi.

In the shape of the hyoid there may be great diversity in related forms, but the Pelo-
batide are characterized by reduction of the hyalia (although this also is recorded in
Rhacophorus dennysi, as well as in an old specimen of Bufo marinus), and the Brevi-
cipitide, except Breviceps and Hemisus, have all, as far as is known, a ventral thickening
of the hyoid plate.
