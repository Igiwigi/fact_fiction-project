Iam told by Mr. Warzrnouss
that these results are of great importance, as affording evidence on the position of
several species whose place in the order has not been definitely fixed, either by their
external characters or by the structure of the skull, and hence they have been variously
placed by naturalists, and even by the same author at different times. Before entering on a description of the structural characters that pertain to the
teeth of the rodential families, or of individual teeth, it will be desirable to state those
conditions which are common to the whole order, otherwise it would be necessary to
repeat frequently the same fact. It bas long been known that the incisors of Rodentia
have the property of unlimited growth, and that the rate of growth equals the rate
of loss by wear; hence the exposed portion of the tooth is, in the normal state of the
dental apparatus, maintained of uniform length. The pulp-cavity in a longitudinal
section of the tooth is irregularly conical or wedge-sbaped, and in a transverse section
corresponds in some measure with the outline of the tooth.
