The supra-auditory cartilage (s.0.c.) is now passing into the supraoceipital,
and is again free from the capsule. The horizontal canal (4.s.c.) is cut across its arch,
the posterior canal (p.8.c.) through its ampulla, and the anterior canal (a.s.c.), above. The large space between the capsule and the basal plate allows the 9th and 10th
nerves (IX., X.) to pass, and the large size, and the thick edges of the basal plate
(b.0.) is due to the fact that the condyles are cut across. The notochord (n.c.) is
now directly beneath the basilar artery (b.d.) ; it is seen again in the attached wedge
of the azis (a4z.) ; the condyles of the atlas (at.) are also seen.

24th, Section (Plate 24, fig. 13).â€”The basilar plate and condyles (oc.c.) are cut
across in this section in the fore part of the foramen magnum. The roof-cartilage
(8.9.c.) lies upon the auditory capsule.
