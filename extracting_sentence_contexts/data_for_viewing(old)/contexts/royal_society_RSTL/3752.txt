tural cauſes, that we are enabled to judge of theſe
cauſes, and from thence their effefts when again
compounded every attempt to aſcertain the operations

into nature: nor can we @ priori determine the
value of any new inſtrument ; for, if it ſhould lead
to a ſingle diſcovery, or even to aſcertain a ſingle
fact, this may again lead to others of great importance,
of which we might have, either none, or an im-
perfect idea of before. For my own part, I have
always looked on a thick fog, and the ſweating, or
condenſation of the water's vapours 'upon the walls
in the inſide of buildings, to be the greateſt marks
