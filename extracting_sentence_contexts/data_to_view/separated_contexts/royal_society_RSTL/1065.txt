And,
as much of the iron of a_ ship is hidden, the best way of de-
tecting it, and of ascertaining' a - proper situation for a chro-
nometer, will be to set down'a compass in any place designed
for the former, and to observe and compare the direction of its
needle with that of the azimuth compass on deck, while the
vessel is on different tacks ; and if the disagreement between
the two be very considerable, another situation ought to be
selected. When I made my experiments on local attraction, on board
His Majesty's ship Leven, we placed several compagses in
different parts of the. vessel, some of which were very power-
fully affected under different directions of the ship's head ;
in consequence, no doubt, of their being within the influence
of partial action arising from some near, but hidden, mass of
iron. In support, and in confirmation of the necessity of taking
the above precautions, it may not be amiss to state the fol-


382 Mr. BarLow on the effects produced in the rates of

lowing fact. A very intelligent seaman; many'years a Master
in the Navy, and at present an officer in the Dock-yardat
Woolwich, to whom I was describing the nature of my ex-
periments, immediately exclaimed, that they explained a cir=
cumstance which he had remarked when he was master of a
first rate. He informed me, he always found that his chro-
nometer, which was a very excellent one, had a different rate
on board and on shore, amounting: to z” per day; but 'as he
well remembered that the birth he had selected for it was in
his cabin, nearly in contact with an. iron knee, he now saw
that it was the action of that mass of iron which had caused
all his'perplexity.

Lastly ; since it is rendered obvious by the experiments
with the plate of iron on Nos.
