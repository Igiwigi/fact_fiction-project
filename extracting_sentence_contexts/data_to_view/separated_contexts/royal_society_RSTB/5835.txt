Throughout the following pages frequent comparison
will be made with this Polygordius larva, and it should be understood that unless
otherwise stated, a reference to Polygordius means to the endo-larva of P. lacteus. This paper is by no means an exhaustive account. The cleavage and very early stages
have not been studied, and, as will become apparent later, these stages probably hold
the key to the explanation of several puzzling facts. The study starts with the fully
formed trochosphere and finishes with the young worm a few weeks after metamor-
phosis. Nor has it been possible during this period of the life-history to fill in all the
details; size alone has been a great handicap when studying the smaller structures.
