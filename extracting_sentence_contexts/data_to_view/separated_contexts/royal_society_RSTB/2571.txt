At the
same time fascicular grouping of the fibres is clearly seen, and the axes of fascicles
bend outwards from the median plane into the middle of surface granulations. 198 DR. MARIA M. OGILVIE ON THE MICROSCOPIC AND

The growth-lamelle curve very regularly round definite centres at the first laying
down of the septum, But, as successive growth-periods follow, the primary in-and-
out curving of the innermost layers becomes lost, and larger curves, much less regular,
make themselves evident. It is this fact which in Zupsammia gives to the innermost
growth-layers a certain distinctness from the subsequently developed layers. They
appear in sections as a lighter band on both sides of the median centres, while the
fibres beyond them, although having their crystallographical axes generally speaking
in the same direction, seem opaquer. The opacity is due to frequent variation in the
particular form of the curves of successive lamella, and a consequent crossing of the
fibres.
