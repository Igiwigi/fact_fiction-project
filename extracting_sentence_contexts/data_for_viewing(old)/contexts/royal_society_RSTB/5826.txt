in the margin of the caudal end of the dorso-medial nucleus. The evidence of this
experiment suggests that the latter nucleus is not concerned with the reception of any
fillet fibres.


THALAMIC CONNECTIONS IN THE RAT. 9

Summarising, Marchi degeneration in the thalamus is confined on the left side to
the medial medullary lamina and the posterior extremity of the ventral nucleus
(probably fibres of tectal origin), and on the right side to the medial medullary lamina,
caudal extremity of the dorso-medial nucleus, ventral nucleus, and habenular nucleus.
No evidence of degeneration extending into the neopallium was anywhere to be found,
in spite of the fact that the caudal pole of the medial geniculate body and the pretectal
nucleus of the left side were injured. All the degenerated fibres which result from
the lesion involving the Whole of the medial lemniscus at the caudo-ventral margin
of the thalamus appear to terminate in the ventral nucleus.

Rat Th. 2, fig. 9.â€”In this experiment, the needle was passed through the left
frontal cortex in a direction passing caudally and to the right, and with a slight ventral
inclination. The lesion passed through the anterior nucleus of the left side and across
the mid-line into the anterior part of the right ventral nucleus, extending as far as the
internal capsule which it partially involves. In the anterior part of the thalamus the
lesion extends linearly through the ventral margin of the left fimbria, the centre of
the antero-ventral nucleus and the stria medullaris of the left side and obliquely
downwards into the right habenular nucleus, fig. 9, a. A few sections more caudally
