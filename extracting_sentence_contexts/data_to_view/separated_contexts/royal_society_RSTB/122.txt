They are thus breathing for at least
fifteen hours out of the twenty-four a highly impure atmosphere. The effects of this
are often intensified, as is well known, by insufficient food and clothing, both of which
must render them less capable of resisting the impure air. The fact that these schools
become, as will be shown below, after a time habitually infected by bacteria renders it
probable that they also become permanent foci of infection for various diseases, and
particularly perhaps for tubercular disease in its various forms. From the considera~
tions advanced later on (page 106), it will be seen how an ordinary simple cold,
brought on say by a draught, may become a source of great danger to a child attending
such a school. The cubie space per person in schools, unlike that in houses, shows no definite con-
nexion (as will be seen below) with the purity of the air, except as regards the
number of micro-organisms.
