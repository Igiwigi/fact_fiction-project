It will be seen that, over both periods, one of the unmanured plots (12) yielded
more produce of hay than the other (3). It also yielded more nitrogen, and more
mineral matter, whilst, in all three particulars—hay, nitrogen, and mineral matter—
its decline in yield over the second period compared with the first was less. For a
long time the proper explanation of this superiority was not very obvious ; but it was

snpposed to be due, in part ab least, to the fact that plob 12 is earlier sheltered from
the evening sun, and therefore the less liable to suffer in dry weather. After the
experiments had been continued for 20 years, however, the 80il of each of the plots
was sampled, in three places, in each case 8ix depths of nine inches, or in all a total
depth of 54 inches, being taken ; and both the notes made on the sections of the 80il
and 8ubsoil, and the percentages of nitrogen at the respective depths (determined by
the soda lime method), lead to the conclusion that a considerable part, at any rate, of
plot 12 must have been made ground, as the mould extended to a greater depth, and,
as will be seen further on, the percentage of nitrogen in the lower layers was con-
siderably higher than in the case of the other unmanured plot, and indeed higher than
in that of most of the manured plots. After a careful consideration of the facts, it has
been decided that the results obtained on plot 3 provide fairer standards with which
to compare those yielded on the manured plots than would the mean indications of
