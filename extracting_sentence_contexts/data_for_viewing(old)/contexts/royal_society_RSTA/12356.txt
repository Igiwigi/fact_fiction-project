A fact mentioned by Admiral Sprarr* tends to confirm the opinion I expressed
when speaking of the Sicilian coast, that, previously to the submergence, the land
stood at a higher level than at present, for in excavating the naval docks at Valetta,
the breccia of red earth, with fragments of surface débris and land shells, were found
‘in fissures and crevices of the rock at 20 feet and more below the present sea-level.
Judging from the height at which the Rubble-drift is found it is probable that
the island was wholly submerged. It is a significant, though not conclusive, fact,
also, that not one species or even a single genus of its Quaternary Mammalia are
now living on the island, the only indigenous quadrupeds, according to Dr. Lerra
Avams, being the Weasel, Hedgehog, and Rabbit.

Carniola and Istria.—Some remarkable facts have been noticed in connection with
e mines of Carniola.t The hills around Kropp, which rise to the height of several
hundred metres above the sea level, are traversed by large fissures filled with a
reccia, with which is associated a hydrated oxide of iron in grains from the size of
@ pea to that of a nut. This breccia contains, as usual, angular fragments and large
blocks of the adjacent limestone rocks. The greater number of these fissures are
Unfossiliferous, but in a few the teeth and bones of Ursus spelwus have been discovered,
and in one the tooth of a carnivorous animal was found at a depth of about 250 feet.
BRONGNIART classed these fissures, some of which have been worked to the depth of
