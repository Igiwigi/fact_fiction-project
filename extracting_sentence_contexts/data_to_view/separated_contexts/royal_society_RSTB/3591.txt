but since their
geology and paleontology has been less thoroughly studied, the relationships are
still far from clear. We find, however, that, in both fields, the Middle Coal Measures
are the lowest horizon of the Upper Carboniferous represented, and that these rest,
in Warwickshire directly on Cambrian, and in South Staffordshire on Silurian rocks. The Lower Coal Measures, Millstone Grits, and Carboniferous Limestones are here
absent, which is, of course, a fact deduced from geological rather than palzeobotanical
observation. It is scarcely necessary to emphasise the fact that the problem to be
solved here has much in common with that with which we are concerned in the West
of England and South Wales. The tectonics of the districts under consideration here require much greater
attention than has at present been devoted to them before the relationships of these
coalfields can be made clear.
