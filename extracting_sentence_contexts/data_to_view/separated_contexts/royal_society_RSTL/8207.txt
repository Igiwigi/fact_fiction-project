s . V. When a metallic compound vapour, such as is referred to in I1L., is dissociated by
the spark, the band spectrum dies out, and the elemental lines come in, according to the
degree of temperature employed. | Again, although our knowledge of the spectra of stars is lamentably incomplete, I
gather the following facts from the work already accomplished with marvellous skill and
industry by SEccnt of Rome.

= VI. The un, s0 far as the spectrum goes, may be regarded as a representative of
S class (B) intermediate between stars (Â«) with much simpler spectra of the same kind and
jE stars (7) with much more complex spectra of a different kind. VII.
