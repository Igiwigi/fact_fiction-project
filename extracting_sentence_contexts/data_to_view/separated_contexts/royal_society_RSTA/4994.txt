Now compare this property of the polygon with that of the curve:
y ue

— 2208

We have by differentiation :
slope of curve 2 abscissa
ordinate 207

Hence: this binomial polygon and the normal curve of frequency have a very close
relation to each other, of a geometrical nature, which is quite independent of the
magnitude of x. In short their slopes are given by an identical relation, By a
proper choice of o and y, we can get the normal curve to fit closely the point-
binomial, owing to this slope property, without any assumption as to the indefinitely
great value of n. Tt is this geometrical property which is largely the justification for
the manner in which statisticians apply, and apply with success, the normal curve to
cases in which n is undoubtedly small. No stress seems hitherto to have been laid
upon the fact that the normal curve of errors besides being the limit of a symmetrical °
point-binomial has also this intimate geometrical relationship with it. *

(8.) Now let us deal with the skew point-binomial in precisely the same manner as
we have dealt with the symmetrical binomial.
