164 SIR G. H. DARWIN ON THE

“the figures of equilibrium”; the other may be called “ Rocnr’s problem,” and it
differs only from the former in that one of the two masses of liquid is replaced by a
particle or by a rigid sphere. However, in the numerical solutions found hereafter,
Rocue’s problem is slightly modified, for the rigid sphere is replaced by a rigid
ellipsoid of exactly the same form as that assumed by the other mass of liquid in the
problem of the figures of equilibrium. Thus, with this modification, the two problems
become identical as regards the shape of the figures ; but, as we shall see, they differ
widely as to the conditions of secular stability. This difference arises from the fact
that in the one case there are two bodies which may be subject to tidal friction, and
in the other there is only one.

If in either problem there is no solution when the angular momentum has less than
a certain critical value, if for that value there is one solution and for greater values
there are two, then the principle of Porycarté shows that the single solution is the
starting point of a pair of which one has one fewer degrees of instability than the
other. If, then, one of the two solutions is continuous with a solution which is clearly
stable, it follows that the determination of minimum angular momentum will give us
the limiting stability of that solution ; and this is the point of greatest interest in all
such problems.
