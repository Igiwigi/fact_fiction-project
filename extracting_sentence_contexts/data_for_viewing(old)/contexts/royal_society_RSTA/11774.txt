but also the relative values obtained at different parts of the temperature scale.
Whether these causes in fact account for the differences in the values obtained for
the 15° calorie, and in the still larger differences beyond 35° C., it is impossible to say
with certainty.

It is particularly unfortunate that such differences should exist with reference to
so widely accepted a standard as the 15° calorie. But it is clear that, apart from the
points above mentioned, there is a general consensus of observers that the value of J
for 15° C. comes on a very sloping portion of the curve and may therefore be affected
by small temperature differences. It is curious that the result of all observers who
have given a range of absolute values of J (i.e., RowLAND, GrirrirHs, BARNES, and
ourselves) is to give the value of the 30° calorie as 4°174 within +0°001. This may
be seen by reference to fig. 11, and may be connected with the fact that at 30° C.

the value of J comes on what is generally recognised to be the flat portion of the
curve near the minimum value. But it would be much better were the standard
value chosen over a longer range on the flat portion of the curve, and in such a way
