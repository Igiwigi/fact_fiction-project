depth of the whole stimulus. These findings indicate that V1
neurons respond to local disparities but not to global
matches: V1 neurons detect disparity even when the parts
of the stimuli that cover their classical receptive fields do
not match. The responsiveness of V1 neurons to ‘false
matches’ indicates that the stereo-correspondence problem
is not yet solved at this initial stage of the visual system.

The view that V1 neurons act as local absolute disparity
filters that convey information that is still too far-removed
from global depth perception is further supported by the
fact that the activity of V1 neurons does not correlate with
monkeys’ perceptual reports during a depth-discrimination
task [48] (but see [49] for an alternative explanation and [50]
for a discussion). Nevertheless, and as expected from the
resulting cortical blindness, lesioning V1 in macaques dra-
matically impairs stereoacuity [51]. Thus, although disparity
representations in V1 are still rudimentary and distant from
the global perceptual end product, they are nonetheless vital
for depth perception, in that V1 provides disparity infor-
mation that subsequent cortical regions use for further
processing.

The disparity tuning characteristics of V1 neurons indi-
