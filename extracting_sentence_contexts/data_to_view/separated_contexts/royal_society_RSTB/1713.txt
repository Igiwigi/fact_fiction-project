One point remains to be discussed ; in two, at least, of the preparations, sporangia,
like those of certain Ferns,* are found in association with Heterangium foliage.t A
portion of one of these preparations is represented in fig. 23, The sporangium, sm.,
is in close contact with a fragment of leaf, which appears to be continuous witha
small petiole of Heterangium. If the continuity between the sporangium and the
leaf could be established, the fact would be of the greatest importance. Careful â€”
examination of the preparation, however, leads us to doubt much whether this was
the case. The fragment is in bad condition, and we found it impossible to prove that
the shred of tissue on which the sporangium is seated, really.
