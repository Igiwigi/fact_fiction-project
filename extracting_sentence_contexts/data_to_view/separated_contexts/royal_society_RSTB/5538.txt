This explanation is apparently supported by
the fact that it has been shown that all those fungi which produce kojic acid also
produce at the same time ethyl alcohol, and hence, in passing, acetaldehyde.

(2) The source of carbon supplied, whatever its nature, may be first anabolised by
the fungus into a reserve carbohydrate, which is later hydrolysed by the micro-
organism, as occasion arises, into a monosaccharose which in its turn gives rise to
kojic acid. The close similarity between the amylene oxide form of a 6-carbon
sugar, and kojic acid

renders this a probable explanation, and it is further supported by the fact that
various fungi are known to store reserve carbohydrates and utilise them later as
occasion demands, e.g., glycogen in yeast, trehalose in A. niger. A definite proof was obtained that kojic acid itself is produced from xylose, and is
really responsible for the colour reaction with this carbohydrate, by growing A. effusus
on 500 ¢.c. CzaPEK-Dox solution containing 5 per cent. of xylose.
