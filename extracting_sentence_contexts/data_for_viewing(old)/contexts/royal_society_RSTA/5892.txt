We can therefore iteratively pick a monotonic sequence {A} satisfying
O<An<e™", dn 10, (3.4)

and choose the centres x; € D of the cubes in such a way that the cubes Q7,,, (x) are disjoint and,
setting Q; = Q),,(%n), we have

Mn>Cat?, vn. (3.5)

The existence of the sequences {x;} and {A,} as above is guaranteed by the fact that we can
inductively choose x; and 4, > 0 (small enough) to have

The fact that D has been chosen to be bounded guarantees that {x;,} can be chosen to be a
convergent sequence and {Q7;,,(%n)} to be contained in a bounded set. We conclude that {Qn}
is our desired sequence of cubes.


Step 3. Choice of the sequence ty and conclusion. The lower bound (3.5) shows that the condition
