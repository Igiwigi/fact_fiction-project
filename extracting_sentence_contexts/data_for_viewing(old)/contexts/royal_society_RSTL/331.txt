posure to heat, was. blackish, and grey, seemingly from char-
coal being formed, though in much smaller quantity than in
the preceding experiments with fixed alkalies. For the rea-
sons above given, F omit the particulars of these experiments
on earths.

It appears to me, that the above experiments justify the
inference that the joint affinities between respirable air and
phosphorus, and between phosphoric acid and mineral alkali,
are superior to the affinity between the whole, or at least
part, of the respirable air of carbonic acid and charcoal, co-
operating with the affinity between that acid and the same al-
kali. And, although I have not ascertained the facts with equal
satisfaction, the experiments already made seem to warrant
the conclusion, that the order of the affinities is such, that car-
bonic acid united to vegetable alkali, lime, barytes, magne-
sia, and clay, will be decomposed by phosphorus in a due de-
gree of heat. With respect to carbonic acid combined with

volatile alkali, as might be expected, I could not decompose
it, although I transmitted boiling hot phosphorus through a
very long tube, containing mild volatile alkali.
