A increased, as described at page 490, by its confinement in a strong envelope, a very much
smaller quantity suffices to develope the detonation of gun-cotton than if the fulminate

4. The mechanical condition of the gun-cotton most materially influences the result
obtained by its exposure to detonation. A considerable compactness or density, and a
consequently great resistance to motion of the particles, is essential for the detonation
of gun-cotton, as pointed out at page 497.

There are, however, several well-known facts, and some results of experiments insti-
tuted with special reference to this s8ubject, which do not appear to be in harmony with
the asxumption that the detonation of nitroglycerine and gun-cotton in the manner

described is simply due to the suddenness of the development and application of physical
force. The following are some of the more important facts of this kind ;—

1. The circumstance that the explosion of mercuric fulminate accomplished the deto-
nation of gun-cotton, whereas explosive agents less sudden in their action failed to
furnish this result, appeared to render it probable that silver-fulminate, which explodes
