TV. GeneraL ConcuLusions.

This fossil human’skull of a not yet adult Proto-Australian presents, therefore, the
general picture of a cranium similar in all respects to the cranium of the Australian
of to-day, combined with a facial skeleton of undoubtedly “ Australian” type, in the
palate and teeth of which there are to be found, in conjunction with the most
primitive characters found in modern skulls, certain characters more ape-like than
have been observed in any living or extinct race, except that of Hoanthropus.

From these facts, certain generalisations may be made. It is of interest to observe
that, from the comparison of this fossil with modern and Piltdown men and the
Anthropoid apes, there is brought forward further evidence to support the belief held
by many anthropologists, that in the evolution of the human form of skull, the
assumption of a definitely human type of brain was the primary and fundamental
factor by which man was enabled to differentiate himself from the more unenter-
prising descendants of the common ancestral form. In the fossil from Talgai, one
may discern a form of skull in which the cranium has long since become of the
definitely human type, but in which the face still preserves the last definite trace of
the lower, more brute-like characters.

It is further of interest to note that the Proto-Australian is, in some very important
features, to be sharply differentiated from Neanderthal man. This is nowhere more
