basement of the Royal Institution, is shown in fig. 4 (Plate 5). The furnace consisted
essentially of a blacklead or earthen crucible, in which broken coke was burnt with
a draught provided by hand bellows. A small crucible containing the steel and
alloying elements was embedded in the centre of the fire, a cover being placed over
this crucible to protect the charge. With these simple resources, Farapay states that
he succeeded in melting pure iron “ in twelve or fifteen minutes, the fire having been
previously lighted’; and that this furnace “ will effect the fusion of rhodium and even

pieces of pure platinum have sunk together into one button in a crucible heated by it.”
In fact, the crucibles then available softened and fused before the furnace reached the
maximum temperature which could otherwise have been attained. The difficult results
obtained and described by Farapay represent, therefore, quite remarkable per-
formances. Moreover, the results of the analyses now presented by the author,
showing, for example, the composition of the alloy steel specimen No. 31/D.4, which
contained such a low percentage of carbon as 0-07 per cent., given in Table IT, fully
bear out and confirm that the foregoing statements by Farapay were undoubtedly true.

Later on in the present paper reference is made to a number of experiments carried
out by Farapay in November, 1823, two months after Sroparr’s death, and con-
tinuing up to June, 1824. It is unfortunate that some of these specimens cannot be
found, as, owing to the high percentages of the added elements platinum and rhodium,
it might have been expected they would give alloy steels of particular interest. These
