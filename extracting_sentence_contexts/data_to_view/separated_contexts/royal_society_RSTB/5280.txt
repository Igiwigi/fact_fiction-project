It is underlain
by a few feet of typical Wheatley Limestones, in alternate hard and soft bands, the soft
bands bearing a close resemblance to the overlying rag in a more finely ground condition. The hard bands bear a very close resemblance to many of the Wheatley Limestones
in the Oxford district, and some of the courses even contain the same little white pellets
which give the flecked appearance to some of the bands of limestone at Lye Hill and Wood-
perry. Exogyra nana and Cidaris florigemma spines are abundant, but other fossils
are usually fragmentary and difficult to determine ; this in spite of the fact that ground-
up shells form one of the principal constituents. As we pass southward along the quarry
face, higher bands of this limestone appear, until at the southern end there is almost a
solid mass of limestone overlain by only 3 ft. of Coral Rag. In other words, making a slight
allowance for dip —the general trend of the bedding is nearly horizontal—in a distance

of about 50 yards in a northerly direction about 9 ft. of limestones merge into Coral Rag,
the hard bands tapering out, while the soft bands pass into it by imperceptible gradation,

Diligent search of these limestones reveals most of the fossils found in the overlying
Coral Rag, the fauna, though in bad condition, being richer than that of the limestones
of Wheatley, etc., which were not formed so close to the parent reef.
