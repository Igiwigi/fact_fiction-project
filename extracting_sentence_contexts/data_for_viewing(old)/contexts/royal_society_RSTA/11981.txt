velocity distributed over the elements of the conductor and independent for each
them. Nor is this in any way surprising, when we bear in mind that the velocity
a single electron is certainly of the type required for a generalized dynamical ve
component, and when we infer, as below (§. 23), that the forcive on a currer
considered as made up statistically from the moving electrons, is different from wh:
would be obtained by taking the current-element itself as a generalized velocit
component. Our conclusion is, then, that the only proper basis for the dynamic
analysis of the phenomena of currents flowing in conductors, in fact, of all cases of t
flow of true electricity, is to treat the currents as the statistical aggregates of
movements of the electrons.

by electrons, it is necessary in the first place to take a survey of the various ways i
which these electrons are distributed. In staticai circumstances the great bulk ¢
them are grouped together into polar molecules, which may be either in totally i
gular orientation as in an unpolarized dielectric, or may possess features of regule
which can be represented in a statistical manner by the type of theory first developec
by Poisson with respect to induced magnetism. If the element of volume possesse
