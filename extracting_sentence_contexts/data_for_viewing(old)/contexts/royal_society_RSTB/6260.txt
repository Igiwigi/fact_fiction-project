2 EMINENTIA THALAMI ANTERIOR, figs. 2, 3, E.T.

The eminentia thalami of this description corresponds to that described by
Kunienseck (1929), JeEENER (1930, Jdus idus, Clupea harengus, Osmerus eperlanus,
Mormyrus caschive). JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably
the homologue of the eminentia thalami described by Herrick (1917) in the urodele
amphibians. In a comparative study of this region, JEENER (1930) failed to find
a differentiated eminentia thalami in the Crossopterygii, in the Dipnoi, in the
Chondrostei, nor in the Holostei. In Polypterus bichir he found the subhabenular
area occupied by a differentiated pars dorsalis, and a pars ventralis thalami. In
the dipnoan Protopterus annectens, JEENER (1930, fig. 2) demonstrated what he considers
asa greatly enlarged pars dorsalis thalami; however, KuHLENBECK (1929) and
GERLACH (1933) appear not to agree with this interpretation.

The eminentia thalami of the Diaphus brain will be described, as it is very highly
developed in this teleost, figs. 2-3. In WEIGERT preparations the eminentia is sharply
differentiated from the relatively clear adjacent areas by its rich fibrocellular
