on Jurassic and Cretaceous genera and those made on recent corals by v. Kocu and
v. Hemer. But, from the fact that each author had already concluded his own work
before seeing the other's, written contemporaneously, the zoological and the paleon-
tological interests have remained, so to speak, estranged and have mutually missed
all the significance which they might have had. Moreover, v. Kocu and v. Harper
did not agree in the details they gave of the skeletal-forming cell, and the matter
has been somewhat in abeyance. The zoologists who have since published papers
support v. Kocw; hitherto no paleontologist has taken up the question. As I find
it to be one of considerable importance, I shall enter fully into the points of agree-
ment and difference between Koc and HEmwer,

Heer proved in the paper quoted, the general identity in the anatomy and
histology of Cladocora with facts previously determined for Actinians. He writes,
“The brothers Hertwie came to a conclusion (based on their investigations of the
mesenteries in Actinians) with which, so far as my research has gone, I can only
agree. It is, in the main, that Actinians and Corals (Madreporarian) are still more
closely allied with one another than they have as yet been regarded ” (/oc. cit., p. 28).
He then describes for the first time the lime-forming cells, to which he gave the name
“ calicoblast.” He found that the cell-nucleus was active during the earlier changes
of the cell-contents from organic into inorganic conditions, but gradually shrank as
the cell became filled with the granular or fibrous deposit. From that he concluded
that the cell ceased tts organic life when the change had completed and became
