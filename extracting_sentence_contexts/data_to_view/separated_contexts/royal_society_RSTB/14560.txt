Assuming
further that mutations have weak unbiased phenotypic effects
(ie. following the continuum of allele model [53-56] with
€ = Zm —Z small), invasion fitness can be Taylor expanded in
Zm around Zim =Z as

In this case, the population is locally uninvadable and selec-
tion on the trait is stabilizing for z* (figure 1a; [7,64]). By
contrast, any mutant can invade when h(z*)>0. In fact,
when h(z*)>0 and the singular strategy z* is convergence
stable (equation (2.5) holds), selection is frequency-dependent

p(Zm,Z) =1+8(z)(Zm — 2) + 1h) (2m—z)>+O(@), (2.2) and disruptive such that the population becomes poly-

ism, helping or competition [30]), can help understand how
adaptive polymorphism gradually emerges in populations
that are initially monomorphic. Together, the functions s(z) and h(z) thus determine
whether gradual evolution leads a population to a monomor-
phic uninvadable state under stabilizing selection or to
become polymorphic due to disruptive selection (figure 1).
