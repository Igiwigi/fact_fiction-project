the first volume of the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society is a
-l paper by Professor JouN LesL1E, © On Sounds excited in Hydrogen Gas,” in which
e author mentions some remarkable experiments indicating the singular incapacity of
_ for becoming the vehicle of the transmission of sound when a bell is struck in
Sat gas, either pure or mixed with air. With reference to the most striking of his
Aperiments the author observes (p. 267), © The most remarkable fact is, that the
mixture of hydrogen gas with atmospheric air has a predominant influence in blunting
& stifling sound. If one half of the volume of atmospheric air be extracted [from the
TSceiver of the air-pump], and hydrogen gas be admitted to fill the vacant space, the
Sund will now become scarcely audible.”
'D No definite explanation of the results is given, but with reference to the feebleness
& sound in hydrogen the author observes, © These facts, I think, deper.d partly on the
Snuity of hydrogen gas, and partly on the rapidity with which the pulsations of sound
Ee conveyed through this very elastic medium ; ” and he states that, according to his
Siew, he © should expect the intensity of sound to be diminished 100 times, or in the
ZSompound ratio of its tenuity and of the square of the velocity with which it conveys
= vibratory impressions.” With reference to the effect of the admixture of hydrogen
ith air he says, © When hydrogen gas is mixed with common air, it probably does not
Sitimately combine, but dissipates the pulsatory impressions before the sound is vigo-
.Lously formed.”
