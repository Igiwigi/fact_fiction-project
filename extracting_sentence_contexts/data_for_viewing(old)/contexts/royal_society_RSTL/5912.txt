than one centre, and pierced by a succession of dikes, was already complete before the

Val del Bove began to be formed.
\ In the first edition of my * Principles of Geology,” published in 1830-33, I considered
how far this great valley might be due to three causes,—l1st, engulfment ; 2ndly, explo-
si0n.; and 3rdly, aqueous denudation ; and I concluded that it was probably due for the
wmost part to engulfment. At a later period (1849*) I suggested that the sea might
Serhaps have once entered the valley and exerted a denuding power, an opinion which
did not maintain in later editions of my two treatises on geology, and which I entirely
Abandoned after visiting Madeira and the Canary Islands in 1854, when I became aware
f the prodigious excavating and removing power which torrents and rivers can exert on
volcanic mountain, when once eruptions have ceased. Mr. Dana had already called
Attention to this fact in reference to certain volcanos in the Sandwich IslandsF; and
AM. ZIEGLER, the eminent Swiss geographer, after surveying Madeira and publishing a
Map of the island, remarked in 1856 to Mr. HarTuxNG and me, that inclinations such as
characterize the river-channels of that island would be excessive and quite exceptional

2 It may, indeed, be said to hold true generally in regard to volcanic as contrasted with
Znon-volcanic mountains, that whereas in the latter the yalley-making power is at work
zluring the whole period of their growth, that same agency only comes into play in
Subarial yolcanos after their completion. The volume of rain-water and melted snow
Sabsorbed annually by a lofty mountain like Etna is s0 enormous, that if at length the
underground drainage is converted into a superficial one, the force of running water
