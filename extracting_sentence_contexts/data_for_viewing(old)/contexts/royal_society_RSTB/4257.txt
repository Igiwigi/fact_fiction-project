The work of Fayrer(1), and afterwards of Brunton and Fayrer (2), established
the fact that in cobra poisoning the failure of the respiration is the cause of death,
the circulation surviving for some time after the breathing ceases, and the heart
continuing to beat for hours if the aération of the blood is maintained by artificial
respiration, They satisfied themselves that a curara-like paralysis of the motor
nerve ends occurs in certain conditions, but they remained in doubt whether the
failure of the respiration is entirely due to this, and were inclined to believe that
it is due in part to paralysis of the respiratory centre; the phrenic nerve proved
insensible to the strongest stimuli in some experiments, while the sciatic remained
irritable, and there was a want of co-ordination of the diaphragmatic and thoracic
muscles in others, which appeared to arise from paralysis of the phrenic nerve.

In 1883 A. J. Watu(3) concluded that, while the peripheral motor nerves are
weakened, this is accompanied by a similar weakening of the central nervous system,
