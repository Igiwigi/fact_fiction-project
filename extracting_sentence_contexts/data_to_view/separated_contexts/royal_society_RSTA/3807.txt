Fourthly, the over-blow is characterised by a very powerful illumination, from
what appears to be a brilliant yellow flame which is generated within the vessel. During this over-blow there is a copious production of dense fume, composed of
oxidised metallic vapours, chiefly iron. The particles forming the fume are undoubt-
edly of very minute dimensions, as is proved by the fact that they scatter the light
which falls upon them and cast a brown shadow, and the cloud of fume ascends to a
great height before it is dispersed. Such small particles while within the vessel are,
doubtless, at the same temperature as the escaping gases. The spectrum of the
over-blow is continuous and very feeble in the ultra-violet, as it does not extend
beyond wave-length 4000.
