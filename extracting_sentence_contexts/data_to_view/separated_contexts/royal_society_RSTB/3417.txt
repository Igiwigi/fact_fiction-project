In 1893 (28) Sritrrz’s views on this subject were unchanged. In 1900 he drew
attention to the difficulty which is introduced into the phylogeny of Stelleroidea by
Gregory's description of Lapworthura and of Eucladia, and by his statements that
Bury had found a dorsal madreporite in young Ophiuroidea ; for, he argued, while in
Starfish we have modern forms with a dorsal (abactinal) madreporite and primitive
forms with ventral (actinal) madreporite, and according to AGAsstz, a ventral (actinal)
madreporite in young starfish, in the Ophiuroidea on the other hand the converse
appears to be the case. Again, if in the original stock of Ophiuroidea the madreporite
lay on the abactinal, and in the original stock of the Asteroidea on the actinal side,
this fact would not lead to the view that the Ophiuroidea and Asteroidea were derived
from the same stock. Here it should be pointed out that GreGoryY was mistaken in
his quotation of Bury, who was speaking not of the young Ophiuroid but of the
larva. In the same year (1900) Gregory in his article in LANKxstER’s ‘ Treatise on
Zoology,’ while still apparently holding the view that the madreporite is “ dorsal”
(abactinal) in some Ophiuroidea (see p. 238), did not turn his attention to the phylo-
genetic importance of this character.
