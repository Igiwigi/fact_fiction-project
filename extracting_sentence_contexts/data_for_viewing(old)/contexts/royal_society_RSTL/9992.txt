The acusticus (fig. 7) also shows a complete concordance with the arrangement in

L and turns ontward with the upper column of the trifacial, both forming an angle.
S Frivson has suggested that the latter pregents the marks of the facialis root in the
A brain of Mammalia, to which I would add that the acusticus root passing in elose
contact with it tends to increase the resemblance.

The vagus (figs. 8, 9, 10) also presents roots of origin corresponding to those in
M. cephalus, with the exception, perhaps, of the one from the cerebellum, which does

logises with the tuber cinerenm, and this part in the human subject sends fibres into the optic tract.

F In the figure 7 this does not show well, the parts being too 8mall, but in the original proparation
three distinet bundles of fibres are apparent here.

the tuberculum impar. The only peculiarity about ib is that the ganglion of origin of
the posterior root is situated higher than the corresponding part in M. cephalus, being
placed above, instead of below, the floor of the fourth ventricle.
