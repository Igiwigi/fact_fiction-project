between the areas in Northern Europe which are rising and those which are quietly
subsiding. These facts to be explicable on the theory of expansion, require, as it ap-
pears to me, far too capricious an action, in s0 s/owly and far-pervading an influence
as heat, to be admitted ; whilst on the supposition. of mechanical displacement such
difficulties are not presented. Thirdly, because (and it is my chief reason for reject-
ing the agency of expansion by itself) the movements appear to have been of the
8ame order with those now in progress in South America; and in that country the
elevation of certain wide areas, as I endeavoured to show in a paper lately (March 7,
1838) read before the Geological Society, cannot be attributed to any other cause
than an actual movement in the subterranean expanse of molten rock : to speak only
for example sake, such as would result from a change in position of those inequali-
ties in the ellipticity of the earth's surface, which seem indicated by the measurements
of arcs of meridians. It may also be inferred, from the facts given in that paper, that
the fluidity of the nucleus must be tolerably perfect. In the yolcano, even the lava
which is propelled to the summit of a mountain, far beyond the subterranean isother-
mal line of melted rock, and poured out on the surface, is oftentimes s0 fluid, that it
runs into thin sheets like molten metal. Also at the junction of the plutonic with
the metamorphic formations, we see tortuous thread-like veins branching from the
former into the latter, which could only have been injected when quite liquid. Here
the rock has been melted at a great depth under an enormous pressure, and yet the
fluidity must bave been very perfect: snch plutonic rocks moreover form the beds
on which all others rest. Considering these latter facts, together with the inferences
deduced from the phenomena observed in South America, it may be granted as not
improbable in any high degree, that this part of Scotland when it was upraised rested
