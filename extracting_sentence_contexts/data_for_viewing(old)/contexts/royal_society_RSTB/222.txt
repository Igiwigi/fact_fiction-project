these, with one exception, form a group immediately in front of the fissure of
Ro.anpo, and in the same region which we have already seen in the case of “all
toes” to be connected especially with the flexion movements of those digits as well
as the general representation of the hallux.

As we shall now leave the consideration of the movements of the toes for that of the
movements of the ankle, it seems to us very desirable to make further reference to
the fact just mentioned, viz., the peculiar localisation of the rare movement of flexion
of the small toes in what we may call the hallux region of the lower limb area.

To put the matter in a simpler light than is offered by the bare record of observa-
tions, let us state again that the whole region of representation of the lower limb is a
narrow strip running along and forming the upper fifth of the convex outer surface of
the excitable region in the hemisphere; further, that the middle of this strip, or

more strictly speaking, the junction of its middle and posterior thirds, is essentially
_ the seat of representation of the hallux, while each extremity is essentially the seat of
