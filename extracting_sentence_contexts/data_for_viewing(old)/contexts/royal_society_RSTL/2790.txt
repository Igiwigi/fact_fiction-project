that the heat of animals aroſe either from friction or fer-

thatof his body; and that the body, in this ſituation, con-
tinues its own cold. The Abbe CHAPPE D'AUTEROCHE
informs us, that the Ruſſians uſe their baths heated to
600 of REAUMUR'S thermometer, about 160 of FAH-
RENHEIT*, Without taking notice, however, of the heat
of their bodies when bathing. With a view to add

the year 1765 to 1769, the idea of a power in animals of generating cold (that was
the expreſſion) when the heat of the atmoſphere exceeded the proper temperature
of their bodies, was pretty generally received among the ſtudents of phyfie, from |

a hot ſummer-day, tothe belly of a frog, and found the quiekfilyer fink ſeveral

the living body poſſeſſes a power of reſiſting the communication of heat, d
