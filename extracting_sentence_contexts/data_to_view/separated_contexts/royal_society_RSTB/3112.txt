For this purpose I have selected the ovarian egg. In no other cell are
the structural changes more evident or their apparent correlation with the cell-
activity more striking. The definite limits to the period of secretive activity and the
fact that the products of secretion are stored up in the cell enable us to compare the
appearances presented by the cell-structures at varying and easily recognisable phases
of the cell-activity. Further, we can compare eggs in which a considerable quantity
of yolk is formed unaided with those which form but little or have it partially formed
for them. Finally, we are able in many cases to follow the gradual divergence from
a common stock and structure of nutritive cells and definitive ova.
