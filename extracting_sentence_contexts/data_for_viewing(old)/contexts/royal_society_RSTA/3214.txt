of Lagrangian planes from that needed for our current application, so those results cannot be
applied directly, and we must develop a new (though closely related) framework for the problem
at hand. It is worth pointing out that these results hold for any value of n (i.e. for a single equation
or a system of any dimension).

Having related the number of unstable eigenvalues to the Maslov index, our next task is to
compute the latter quantity. This is where the difference between the system and scalar cases
becomes apparent. An explicit computation of the Maslov index requires n linearly independent
solutions to the equation Lu =0. The derivative yy of the steady state is always such a solution.


Thus, when n= 1, g* contains all of the information needed to evaluate the Maslov index and
determine whether or not L has any unstable spectrum. This simple fact is the basis for the Sturm
oscillation theorem.

When n> 1, we cannot compute the Maslov index without knowing the additional nâ€”1
solutions. However, in the case of a pulse, we can use a geometric argument to give a lower
bound on the Maslov index, thus proving that at least one unstable eigenvalue exists. It is here
that the advantages of our definition of the Maslov index (and in particular our choice of reference
plane) become apparent. In particular, our definition is such that a zero in the derivative of the
pulse will generate an unstable eigenvalue. This property is not enjoyed by previous definitions of
the Maslov index for homoclinic orbits, which measure intersections between stable and unstable
subspaces, much like the Evans function.

For the last few decades, the Evans function has been the primary tool for determining the
