In an early stage of their development, the primitive fasciculi are often narrow
flattened bands, and present bulgings at irregular distances, which depend on the
existence of these bodies. It is interesting to notice how closely, in this state,
they resemble in form, size, and structure, the adult condition of the musele of
organic life, which has for the first time been correctly represented and described,
