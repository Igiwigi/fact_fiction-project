etc.) has been detected even on the spatial scale of single
ramets [86]. Above the ground the availability of light can
be similarly patchy, owing to the presence/absence of com-
petitors [2,5,7,11,87,88]. For clonal plants, which grow
horizontally to a considerable extent, the growth process is
similar to path-finding in a labyrinth of favourable/
unfavourable sites [33]. This is particularly important in
those species that tend to avoid the unfavourable sites
(figure 2b). An additional difficulty is that the environment
can change owing to competitors and disturbances; conse-
quently, the plant has to find ways in a labyrinth in which
new pathways are opening and old ones are closing over
time. ‘Ways’ refers to the fact that each branch has to find
its own route.

To solve this task, the plant has a limited amount of
resource at a time, which can be allocated into the growth
of different structures. Let me collect some characteristic
dilemmas posed by the environment to the growing plant.
(1) The basic dilemma of foraging is whether to stay or
move (see above). (2) When moving, it is a matter of decision
whether to avoid unfavourable patches by stopping at those
patch boundaries where the plant would move from favour-
able to unfavourable conditions (see the text above about the
plant’s ability to compare sites). The alternative is to enter
