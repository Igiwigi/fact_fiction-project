of wealth to obtain a nonlinear kinetic model of Boltzmann type for the joint density of
wealth and knowledge. This part is presented in §3. Section 4 deals with the derivation of a
Fokker—Planck-type equation, which models the formation of the joint density of wealth and
knowledge in the so-called quasi-invariant limit procedure. Finally, §5 is devoted to various
numerical experiments, which allow one to recover the steady distribution of wealth and
knowledge in the population for various choices of the relevant parameters.

2. An evolutionary model for knowledge

Even if a well-established definition of knowledge does not exist, and there are numerous
theories to explain it, one can agree on certain universal aspects about it. Knowledge can be
described as familiarity with someone or something unknown, which can include information,
facts, descriptions or skills acquired through experience or education. It is commonly accepted
that knowledge is in part influenced strongly by ones parents, but it is evident that the main
factor that can influence knowledge is the environment in which an individual grows up and
lives [43]. Indeed, the experiences that produce knowledge cannot be fully inherited from ones
parents, such as the genome, but rather are acquired over a lifetime from several elements of the
environment. The learning process is very complicated and produces different results for each
individual in a population. Although all individuals are given the same opportunities, at the end
of the cognitive process every individual appears to have a different level of knowledge. Also, it


is quite evident that personal knowledge is the result of selection, which allows the notions that
an individual considers important to be retained, and the rest to be discarded. This basic aspect
of the process of learning has been recently discussed in a convincing way by Eco [44], one of the
