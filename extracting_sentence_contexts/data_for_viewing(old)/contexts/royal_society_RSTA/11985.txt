When the third and fourth terms in K’ are predominant, the dispersion wil
usually be in the abnormal direction, as it is known to be for the great majority o
metals, a few of the more conducting ones being however exceptions ; and the val
of « will usually increase with the frequency, which is also in accordance with fact,

{Aug, 25.—The introduction of effective inertia into the equation of conduction, as
above, thus appears to be essential to the theory. For the actual negative value of ¢]
real part of K’ in metals cannot arise from dielectric polarity of the material medium
that, as has often been remarked, would imply instability and consequent destruction
of such polar structure. To make the other agency which is at work, namel
conduction, effective for that purpose, its equation must involve inertia: and the
influence of this inertia appears in fact also in other ways; thus the work done
the electric force on the ions in an electrolyte must be used up proximately in
accelerating their velocities, while the increased average velocity reveals itself as
Joulean heat. If there were a large number of dissociated ions along a wave-length,
which is indeed the condition that the above continuous aualysis be literally
applicable, it is easy to see by consideration of molecular magnitudes that th
effective inertia of an ion would have to be very much greater than its actual mass,
or else the effect would be excessive. But this difficulty is only apparent. Wher
the ions are more thinly scattered through the medium, there will be two sets of
waves propagated ; the waves of free wether modified somewhat by the presence of

intervening wther nearly in an equilibrium condition at each instant. The former
class alone would be sensibly excited by optical means: it may be formally repre
