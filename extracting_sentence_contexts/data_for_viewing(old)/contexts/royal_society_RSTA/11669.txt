that is, from Ag,Sb,. It would require the existence of a good deal of impurity in
the antimony to make Ag,Sb, the eutectic point.

The series, Table VIIIs., in which silver was added to antimony, gives us the same
eutectic point, namely, 41°5 atomic per cents. of antimony.

The short line, starting from the eutectic point and ending at 53 atoms of
antimony, was obtained with commercial antimony, so that the fact that it lies below
the rest of the curve needs no comment.

The temperature 629°49° which we obtained as the freezing or melting point of
antimony is almost identical with the number 629°54° that we obtained with quite
different thermometers a year before (‘ Chem, Soc. Jour.,’ 1895, p. 195). The same
sample of antimony was used in both cases, and in our earlier work we noticed that
this antimony behaved at its freezing point in the way peculiar to a pure substance.
We think it is almost time for the téxt-books of chemistry to abandon the statement
that antimony melts at 440°.
