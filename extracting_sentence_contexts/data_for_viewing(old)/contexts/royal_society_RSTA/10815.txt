the form of the corona and the relative lengths ot the four streamers. On this
negative the diameter of the sun is 0°05 inch, and the longest streamer, in the south-
west quadrant, extends 0°25 inch from the moon’s limb, Photographically, therefore,
this streamer was five lunar diameters in length. Another exposure of 10 seconds,
5 seconds after totality, shows the crescent strongly solarised, and a faint representa-
tion of the corona on the opposite side. |

A 5” x 4” folding Kodak, operated by J. Kearney, Leading Stoker 1st class, was set
in a position to include the corona and a portion of the wall of the fort in the field of
view. Three exposures were made for periods of 20 seconds each. The first began
just after totality had commenced, and gives a good representation of the corona—
the two longest streamers extending only one lunar diameter. The second photo-
graph shows clearly the lower corona, notwithstanding the fact that part of the sun
had begun to appear. During the third exposure the camera was slightly shaken, so —
that the image is duplicated.

Two cameras fitted with instantaneous shutters were set up with the view of
photographing the shadow passing over the landscape in case its boundary should be
sufficiently well defined. One was a 7$ X 5, and the other a half-plate, and they
were operated respectively by E. Gyneeut, A.B., and H. Cumps, Chief Stoker. It
turned out that the shadow on its approach appeared very gradually, so that the
plates exposed simply resulted in under-exposed photographs of the general landscape
with no features of interest.
