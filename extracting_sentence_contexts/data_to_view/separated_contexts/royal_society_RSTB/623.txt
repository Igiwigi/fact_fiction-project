In the case where the section of the cord was made at the level of the
third cervical, no movements could be obtained except shoulder movements. The extent of the lesions and the resulting degenerations are represented in
Plates 1, 2, and 3.


THE SPINAL CORD IN MONKRYS. 23

After careful examination of the spinal cords, especially of Case III., facts were
elicited with regard to degeneration, which in the main confirm those of previous
observers, Stvcrr,* Homién,t and Tooru.t

Case III. was the most complete hemisection in which the injury was limited to
one side (vide 4 and 5, Plate 1), A very small portion of the posterior median
column alone has remained, and this is in great measure degenerated. Plate %
illustrates this lesion, and the resulting ascending and descending degenerations. The comma-shaped degeneration, visible to the naked eye in the posterior column, on
the side of the lesion, for 0°5 centim.
