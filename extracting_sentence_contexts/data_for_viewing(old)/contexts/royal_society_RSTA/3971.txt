assumed to satisfy stick boundary conditions on the surface of the Janus particle. The potential
functions Wa through which the fuel and product species interact with the Janus particle have
a finite range. These interactions, in conjunction with the inhomogeneous concentration fields of
species generated in the vicinity of the motor as a result of the asymmetric catalytic activity, give : =
rise to body forces acting on the motor. Because momentum is conserved these forces generate 3
fluid flows within the boundary layer of thickness 5 where forces act, and the velocity field, :
0(R, 0) = 05(8), at the outer edge of the boundary layer, Rj + 5 = R, is the slip velocity, which takes nee)

where A => r(e— We) /keT _ e—-Wa/ksT) dy, In writing equation (2.1), we used the fact that the : 5
total number of A and B particles is conserved in reactions, so that the concentrations satisfy
co =Ca + cp, where cg is the total concentration of A and B.

Making use of the reciprocal theorem of hydrodynamics [35], the velocity of the Janus motor
can be obtained from the surface average of the slip velocity at the outer edge of the boundary
layer at R: V = —(vs). In order to compute the velocity, the solute concentration field at the outer
edge of the boundary layer is needed. To find this field for our system with bulk reactions
the reaction-diffusion equation, DV?cz — kocg =0, must be solved subject to the boundary
condition, kpR(dca(r,@)/9r)|r=r =koca(R,0)H(0). Here, ky and kp =47RD are the intrinsic and
Smoluchowski rate constants, and H(@) is a characteristic function that is unity on the catalytic
hemisphere (0 < @ < 7/2) and zero on the non-catalytic hemisphere (1/2 <6 <7). The solution
may be written as the series
