Another feature in which the spirodistichous systems of monocotyledons
differ from most spiral systems of dicotyledons is in the asymmetry of the leaves. This
asymmetry is not always obvious in the blade of the mature leaf but can usually be seen
in transections through the bud, where it appears that the morphological ‘median’
strand of the leaf divides the leaf into two lateral parts which differ in tangential extension
and sometimes in radial thickness,

From these facts it is clear that the hypothesis of the first available space cannot easily
be applied to spirodistichous plants. According to this hypothesis ‘each leaf arises in the
first space that becomes both wide enough and far enough below the growing point’
(Snow, M. & R. 1931, p. 16 and 1933, p. 360). This hypothesis is based on the theory of
van Iterson (1907) and has been supported by various experiments (Snow, M. & R. 1931,
pp. 33, 35).
