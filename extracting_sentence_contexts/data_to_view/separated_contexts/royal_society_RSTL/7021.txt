A great portion of the C and of
that part of the B which arose from horizontal force thus become dispelled. The symmetry which gives C its character ceases the moment the ship heels. An
addition is then made to C proportional to the angle of heel, and this addition consists
in fact of two parts, corresponding to the two parts of B which, as we have seen, do not
exist, in the original C, viz. a part consisting of transient magnetism induced by the
vertical force, and a part consisting of subpermanent magnetism induced by the same
force. These will be more conyeniently considered when we come to discuss the heel-
ing error,

'The semicircular deviation may be put under the form 4/B*+C*sin (£'+e), in which
VS B*+C represents the maximum of semicircular deviation, « (tana= 8) the angle to
the right of the ship's head of the force causing this deviation ; for convenience, these

two quantities are tabulated in the eleventh and thirteenth columns.

"The terms D sin 25'+E cos 2! make up what*is called the © quadrantal deviation.”

"This can only be caused by horizontal induction in soft iron. BE can only be caused by

horizontal induction in soft iron wnsymmetrically distributed, but of any shape; an

E may therefore be caused by the compass being placed out of the midship line and

exposed to the influence of spherical or cylindrical masses, such as the iron gun-turrets
of modern war-vessels. ;

D, which in ordinary cases is always +, is caused by horizontal induction in 8oft iron

arranged according to one or other of the following types —
