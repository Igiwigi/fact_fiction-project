The following are considerations which bear upon this great question (2576.)
of an original or an induced 8tate.

2580. In the first place, the bismuth carries off no power or particular state from
the magnetic field, able to make it affect a magnet (2504.) ; $0 that if the condition
acquired by the crystal be an induced condition, it is probably a transient one, and
continues only whilst under induction. The fact therefore, though negative in its
evidence, agrees, as far as it tells, with that supposition.

2581. In the next place, if the effect were wholly due, as far as the crystal is con-
cerned, to an original power inherent in the mass, we might expect to find the earth's
magnetism, or any weak magnet, affecting the crystal. It is true that a weak mag-
netic force ought to induce any given condition in a crystal of bismuth just as well
as a stronger, only proportionally.
