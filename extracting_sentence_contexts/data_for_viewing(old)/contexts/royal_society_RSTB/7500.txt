America that these basic proteins are much more widespread in their occurrence. They
have been extracted as sulphates from nuclei (Stedman 1944) isolated from various
tissues, including tumours, and in the form of nucleoproteins (Mirsky & Pollister 1942,
1943), or as components of thread-like structures which have been termed ‘chromosomes’
(Mirsky & Ris 1948), obtained directly from a number of tissues. While this work has
not embraced every known type of cell, there can be little doubt that basic proteins are
components of all cell nuclei in the higher animals.

During the course of this work, it was observed (Stedman & Stedman 1944) that the
nuclei of the liver cells and erythrocytes of the salmon differed from the sperm heads of
this species in containing histones. This was contrary to expectations, for, while protamins
were known to occur in the sperm heads of a number of species of fish, others, in particular
the cod, contain a histone. This, coupled with the fact that the two types of basic protein
have never been observed to occur together in the same cell, suggested that their bio-
logical functions are identical and that consequently the chemical differences which
distinguish salmine (salmon protamin) from cod histone are merely expressions in an
unusually marked form of the species differences which are known to occur between
homologous proteins of different species. Since, moreover, there was no reason for sus-
pecting cell specificity in the basic proteins of a given species, it was anticipated that the
nuclei of the somatic cells of the salmon would all contain a protamin identical with that
in the sperm heads. Not only did this anticipation prove to be incorrect, but there
appeared to be a difference, quite outside the limits of experimental error, between the
histones isolated from the nuclei of the erythrocytes and the liver cells. The presence of
a histone in the nuclei of the liver cells of the salmon has been confirmed in the present
investigation, but owing to the difficulties experienced in procuring specimens of salmon
