This series was repeated many times with the same results. Potato juice showed
the same behaviour (cf. Raper and Wormall). It was also observed repeatedly that
the brown intermediate phase of the Metridium extracts was, like the similar phase of
potato juices, readily reversible by the introduction of an active xanthine oxidase-
xanthine system, when the whole system was placed in vacuo in Thunberg tubes. In
the more advanced, black stage, the system was no longer reversible. These facts are
in agreement with other tyrosinase systems.

We are not yet able to state the reasons for the failure of white and red varieties of
Metridium to develop melanin in nature, and for its appearance in the dark forms.
Since the red and white varieties possess all the substances required for melanin
formation, the facts support the idea that we are dealing with an instance of ‘dominant
albinism’ in a genetical sense (Gortner 1911 @). The brown and the grey colour systems
differ from the white in that each permits deposition of melanin products in its special
way. We have already seen that these systems behave as though they were genetically
independent.
