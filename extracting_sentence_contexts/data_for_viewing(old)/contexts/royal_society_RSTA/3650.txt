the embodied materials in imported products. These high level, aggregate material measures do
not support claims of dematerialization; in fact, when imported material consumption is included
in the material footprint, the data indicate that materials use tends to go up.

In figure 4, we show the relationship between MF/cap and GDP/cap for 168 countries in 2008.
The size of the data points is weighted by the population size of each country. The plot shows
an apparent saturation in material usage, but at a relatively high value, in the vicinity of 25 tons
per capita, or about two and a half times the current world average. This information, coupled
with other studies on the limits of materials production improvements [16,25,42], suggests the
significant environmental consequences that a business as usual economic development strategy
could yield as more countries increased their per capita MF. And of course, the time-series data
shown in table 1 suggests that the MF for the developed countries could continue to rise.

In figure 5, HDI is plotted against MF. And two of the components of HDI, life expectancy and
