forms a suitable elementary solution, out of which to build the complete solution to our
problem. We assume
: o— i a(q) cosagxe~*V(?+9)¥ dq, (12)
0

Then, granted the possibility of differentiating under the integral sign,

dy =—af "/(p?-+ 4?) a(q) cosague-#v**eudg. ee

AEROFOIL THEORY. PARTS I AND II 333
The boundary condition (10) enables a(q) to be determined. We find in fact

sin agb

a(q) CT aq S(b)- (14)

Hence we have the solution
