It is of interest to notice that the inversion in the disposition of the dilatations and
constrictions of the notochord described by Grcenpaur and Frorier in 8-day chick
could not be observed in Larus at a corresponding age. * The fact that the chick hatches on the 21st and Larus canus on the 23rd day of incubation makes it
probable that the corresponding stages of development in both birds are almost simultaneous. This renders
the comparison of developmental stages in both hirds easier and the conclusion drawn therefrom more
certain. VOL, COXVI.—B. 2x

The stage of 3 dilatations and 4 constrictions described by GecENBauR and Frortep
in chick from the 9th and 10th day onwards is also represented in Larus, but it begins on
the 8th day of incubation—somewhat earlier than might be expected in comparison with
the chick.
