assume further that the motion is a simple harmonic one, then the maximum velocities at
the node are 47 times the above values, namely 2-31 and —0-66 cm/s for the epi- and
hypolimnion respectively. This gives a maximum velocity difference across the thermocline
of ca. 3 cm/s. The above velocities and displacements are of course mean values and refer
only to conditions at or near the node. As the ends of the lake are approached, horizontal
amplitudes decrease and vertical displacements become more prominent.

Internal waves in a three-layered basin

The above rough estimates of velocity may not be far removed from reality as far as the
epilimnion is concerned (see later discussion), but even a casual inspection of figure 10 will
show that the hypolimnion estimates are quite misleading. The hypolimnion is clearly not,
as assumed, a homogeneous layer. In fact this description can only reasonably be applied to
the portion below the 20m isobath. Between this and the thermocline—defined as the region
of maximum density gradient—there lies a band of intermediate water, which we may call
the metalimnion. The lower isotherms in this layer undergo large deflexions of complex
wave-form, which can only be the result of considerable water movement.

The interpretation of these deflexions requires a theory of internal waves in a basin with
more than two layers or, better still, a more general theory applicable to a basin in which
density varies continuously with depth. Such a theory has been applied to progressive
internal waves in the ocean by Fjeldstad (1933), but, as far as I know, it has yet to find
application to standing waves in enclosed basins. As an interim step it is instructive to
carry the analyses ofthe Windermere observations beyond thesimple two-layer hypothesis and
insert a third layer to represent an intermediate metalimnion. Makkaveev (1936) presents
