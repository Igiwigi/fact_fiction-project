Nickel sulphate heptahydrate is
a rhombic crystal ; its “ magnetic dilution ” is rather less than that of cobalt ammonium
sulphate. It was chosen also partly on account of the interesting deviations from the
Weiss law x (T -+ A) = C, which were shown by its mean susceptibility as determined
from measurements on the powdered material. I desire to mention that some of the work here described had been previously
undertaken at Leiden, conjointly with Prof. Kameriinen Onnes, by Dr. K. Hor in
1915-16, but owing to most of the notes of the observations having been lost during
the return of Dr. Hor to Switzerland, and to the fact that the measurements could not
at that time be made over the intermediate range of temperature between room
temperature and hydrogen temperatures, the work was entirely repeated by me. Where the notes are still available, I have added the results obtained by Dr. Hor to those
obtained later, so that a comparison may be made between the two. The apparatus
for the measurement of the crystals was made at Leiden for the research of Prof.
KaMERLINGH ONNES and Dr. Hor and a series of measurements with it on various
crystals was carried out, but unfortunately none of the notes containing the final
observations and results are now available.
