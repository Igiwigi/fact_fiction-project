ON THE ERUPTIONS OF THE

a full view of it (both of whom were eye-witnesses), elicited the fact that on
Friday, June 6th, disturbances were noticed more than once in the course of the
forenoon in the water about the entrance of the lagoon, the appearances being
described as a rippling or bubbling. Major Bayty had, in consequence, gone out to the spot that morning, when, by
using a thermometer, he ascertained that there was no rise of temperature in the
water. He was good enough to convey Dr. ANDERSON in a boat to the exact spot
where the rippling had been observed, when it was found to coincide with the
shallow bar across the mouth of the lagoon, over which the water had a depth of only
4} feet, which fact was verified by sounding,

Further inquiries from the chief boatman to the Customs elicited the fact that
on the morning in question, which was also that of one of the eruptions of Montagne
Pelée, the level of the water in the carenage rose and fell repeatedly, at intervals of
about 12 or 15 minutes, to a height of about a foot. We conclude that there is no reasonable doubt that the currents set up over the
bar by this small tidal wave were the cause of the disturbance in question, and
that it had no connection with any local volcanic manifestations. Dominica.—After our visit to Martinique we proceeded to Dominica, where it was
reported that anxiety had been felt regarding the condition of the Boiling Lake
and the Grand Soufriére.
