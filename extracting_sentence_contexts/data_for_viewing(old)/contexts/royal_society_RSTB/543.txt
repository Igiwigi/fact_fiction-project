tion for the losses of combined nitrogen which the soil suffers by the removal of crops,
and for the losses which result from the liberation of free nitrogen from its combina-
tions under various circumstances. In some cases, however, the object seems to have
been for the most part limited to an attempt to solve the admitted difficulty as to the
explanation of the source of the whole of the nitrogen of the Leguminose.

As to the losses which the soil sustains by the removal of crops, BertHetor for
example assumes that 50 to 60 kilog. of nitrogen will be annually removed from a
hectare of meadow (= 45 to 54 Ibs, per acre), and that as only 10 kilog., or less, of
this will be restored as combined nitrogen in rain, &c., there will be an annual loss of
from 40 to 50 kilog. per hectare (= 36 to 45 lbs, per acre); so that, if there were not
compensation from the free nitrogen of the air, the soil would become gradually
exhausted. Further, he considers that the fact of the fixation of free nitrogen, not
only explains how fertility is maintained, but how argillaceous soils which are sterile
when first brought into contact with the air, gradually yield better crops, and at
length become vegetable moulds. FRANK again, assumes that the average loss of
nitrogen by the removal of crops is 51 kilog. per hectare (= 45 Ibs. per acre).

â€˜ It is quite true, that a good hay crop may contain as much as 50 to 60 kilog. of
nitrogen per hectare, but it may safely be affirmed that, in ordinary practice, even in
the case of an unusually fertile meadow, such an amount is not annually removed for a
number of years in succession, without the periodical return of manure supplying
nitrogen; whilst, taking the average of soils, the annual yield will not reach the
