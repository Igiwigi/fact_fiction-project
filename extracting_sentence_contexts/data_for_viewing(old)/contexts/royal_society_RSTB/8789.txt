mation of solvent crystals at the low temperature, the NPs
were concentrated and suspended in 80% glycerol and 3% agar-
ose with a final concentration of 350 mg ml '. The solutions were
held in kapton capillaries (500 and 600 ym inner and outer diam-

correlations that dominate the sample CXS. We recorded three
sets of data corresponding to three different sample-detector
distances, and each set had unique detector artefacts.
Unprocessed estimates of the correlation function (2.6) in
the data we obtained are dominated by such systematic arte-

eter, respectively) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Kapton facts. To mitigate these effects, we apply a binary filter to the
and glycerol scatter into relatively lower angles and did not data (figure 2). We define the filter as follows: let {qnxi}m

Our goal was to record as many snapshots as possible, each (1 <m < 60). Let u,, and o,,, represent the average and stan-
one representing a different ensemble of particle orientations dard deviation of 1,(q) for all q © {qnx}m, respectively. Then

rotate the capillary 150° about its longitudinal axis, perpendicular
to the beam. Photon counts were read out and reset every 0.7 s as ng(q) = { 1 if n.(q) > Min + Om
the capillary rotated 0.3° under continuous beam irradiation, - 0 otherwise,

for each q © {nx}, we apply the photon count filter
