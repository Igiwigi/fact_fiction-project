increase to a certain small extent as the crystal is brought nearer to the prism, and
this is shown by Nos. 1-4 in Table IL, p. 500.

This indicates that the index of refraction only varies to a very slight extent, and
therefore that the solution is only slightly supersaturated almost up to contact with
the growing crystal.

It is clear, however, that this experiment does not really determine the index of
the liquid in absolute contact with the crystal, whereas the ultimate layer is precisely
that of which we require to know the composition, even if it be only a layer of
inappreciable thickness. Is it not possible, however, to make use of the natural
faces of the growing crystal as our totally reflecting prism? This, if feasible, appears
to be in fact the only method of deter-
mining the refractive index of this ultimate
layer of the liquid.

Preliminary experiments, in which the

â€˜square glass trough and an octahedron of
potash-alum were employed, presented
considerable difficulties, but ultimately
yielded a definite and clearly visible line of
demarcation in the field of view, and
showed that the method is a possible one.
