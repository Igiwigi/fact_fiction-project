And as uncertainty has been mentioned, I would like to quote from Hunt & Virgin [45]:

. we take great pride in the genealogy of our research supervision. We were both a
supervised by Michael, himself the student of Henry Chilver, who got his PhD from the {3B
University of Bristol under the supervision of Alfred Pugsley (1903-1998), the father of :3
structural safety to engineering in the UK over most of the last century. :f

Myself, I take great pride by my own research supervision, by Academician Vladimir Vasilievich al
Bolotin (1926-2008), who was the father of structural safety in Russia over most of the second :3
half of the last century and the beginning of the present one. The classic books of Sir Alfred 78
Pugsley (1903-1998) [46] (with whom I had a chance to correspond on matters of structural safety) :
and Bolotin [47] strongly influenced uncertainty analysis, worldwide. This above ‘genealogy’
of Michael perhaps explains the fact that he embraced the probabilistic approach—unlike
many contemporaries—and proposed the probabilistic theory of imperfection sensitivity [48],
independently of Bolotin. I am pleased to share this statistical ‘ancestry’ with Michael, in addition
to the broad themes of stability and nonlinear dynamics, albeit in different directions. Some four
decades later Michael returned to the probabilistic concepts in a paper with Jan Sieber [49].

Michael found very interesting applications of instability phenomena that extend to
bifurcational instability of an atomic lattice, identifying a small symmetry-breaking shearing
stress as an imperfection [50]. The results of his numerous pursuits appeared in the book
Instabilities and Catastrophes in Science and Engineering [51]. In his Foreword Sir James Lighthill
(1924-1998) wrote

Nobody could have been better qualified than Professor J.M.T. Thompson to prepare the
