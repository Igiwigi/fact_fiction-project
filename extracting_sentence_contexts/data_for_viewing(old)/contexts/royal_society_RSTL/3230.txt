shows a division of the sounding plate into parts, all of which vibrate isochro-
nously, and produce the same tone. 'This is the principal mode of division.
The fine powder which can rest at the places where the sand rests, and also
accumulate at other places," traces a more complicated figure than the sand
alone, but which is s0 connected with the first, that, as M. Savarr states, © the
first being given, the other may be anticipated with certainty ; from which it
results that every time a body emits sounds, not only is it the seat of many
modes of division which are superposed, but amongst all these modes there are
always two which are more distinctly established than all the rest. My object
in this memoir is to put this fact beyond a doubt, and to study the laws to
which they appear subject.”

5. M. Savarr then proceeds to establish. a secondary mode” of division in
circular, rectangular, triangular and other plates; and'in rods, rings, and
membranes. This secondary mode is pointed out by the figures delineated by
the lycopodium or other light powder ; and as far as I can perceive, its existence
is assumed, or rather proved, exclusively from these forms. Hence much of the
importance which I attach to the present paper. A secondary mode of division,
80 8ubordinate to the principal as 'to be always 'superposed by it, might have
great influence in reasonings upon other points in the philosophy of vibrating
plates; to proye'its existence therefore is an important matter. But its exist-
ence being assumed and supported by such high authority as the name of
