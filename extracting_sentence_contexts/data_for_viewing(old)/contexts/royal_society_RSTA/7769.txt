gives very strong confirmation of the belief that the primary standard has a wave-
length which is accurately reproducible and independent of the resolving power of
the interferometer used. This naturally applies also to the krypton scale. It is
extremely improbable that the cadmium line should exactly follow a mean change
in wave-length of a large number of krypton lines covering the whole visible
spectrum, and involving 20 different terms.

The lines which have been observed on one plate only are given to 7 figures only;
three of the adopted wave-lengths have been given to 7 figures only, because the
disagreement between the results from the various étalons does not justify the
retention of the eighth figure, although it appears improbable that the error exceeds
0-001A. The inaccuracy in the case of these lines, which are all faint ones, is due
to the fact that they were mostly measured on under-exposed plates, rather than to
any faults in the lines themselves.

The values of the systematic differences between the six different sets of observa-
tions made with six étalon thicknesses are given in Table V.
