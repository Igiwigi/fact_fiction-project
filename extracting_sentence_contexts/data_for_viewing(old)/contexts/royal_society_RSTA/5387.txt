surfactant mixtures have also been used to improve macroscopic sweep during WAG. In this
process, the gas mobility is further reduced by adding alkali and surfactant to the injected water
and thus creating a foam within the pore space [68,71,72]

Like polymer flooding, ASP flooding can significantly improve RFs [73-75] with incremental
costs quoted to be as low as $2.42 per incremental barrel for an onshore field [76]; however,
like polymer flooding, there are a number of difficulties which have limited widespread
field application, especially offshore [61]. Operational difficulties include the large volumes of
chemicals that have to be transported to remote sites and then stored on platforms where
space is limited. Additional produced fluid processing is needed as ASP flooding results in the
production of emulsions with droplets as small as 10,1m in diameter. Finally produced fluids
(containing the ASP chemicals) need to be disposed of without impacting the environment.
Technical difficulties include the fact that the chemical mix needs to be carefully designed for
the fluids to be encountered in the field. ASP flooding works best with relatively low-salinity
water (often optimal performance is achieved by the use of a salinity gradient during injection of
the different stages), but, offshore, seawater is the only source of injection water so desalination
or alternative chemicals may be required.

Despite these difficulties, ASP flooding was applied onshore in the early 1980s when the oil
price was high. There has been a recent resurgence of interest as oil prices have increased to the


point where the process is once again economic but the only recent large field-scale application
outside Daqing [73] in China is in Oman [75].
