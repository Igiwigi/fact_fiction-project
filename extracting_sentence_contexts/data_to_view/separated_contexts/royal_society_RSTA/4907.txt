This action is simply transitive (if 1,
y2€ Auti(F), we get y = nyt € Auto(F) with y2 = yy). This means that Auti(F) is either empty
or is a right coset Auto(F) of Auto(F). There is another extra property: if y € Auti(F), the fact that D(D(F)) ~F implies that ye
Auto(F). In particular? for a sheaf with Auto(F)=1 (e.g. a bountiful sheaf), there are only two
possibilities: either Auti(F) is empty, or it contains a single element & , and the latter is an
involution: 2 = 1. If this second case holds, we say that és is the special involution of F. (For
instance, we will see that for hyper-Kloosterman sums K ¢, with r odd, there is a special involution
which is x —x.)
