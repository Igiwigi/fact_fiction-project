of the tracheze, which can be seen where the section is oblique, with that of the free
roots. The primary wood is rather obscure, owing no doubt partly to pressure, and
partly to natural irregularity ; in two out of the four roots the general form of the
primary strand, and the position of the principal rays, point to triarch structure.

The roots are crowded together, and their outline is more or less irregular:
Between them are packed masses of tissue, some of which are of a different nature
from the roots themselves. Both these intermediate masses and the tissue bounding
the group of roots laterally, are continuous in places with the adjacent roots. This
tissue (J/.c. in photograph 22) shows, in longitudinal section, the structure of the
Medullosa cortex, including sclerenchymatous strands, gum-canals, and vascular
bundles with tracheides like those shown in Plate 12, fig. 15. The only possible
interpretation of the facts is that the section isa tangential one of the cortex of a
Medullosa stem, passing through the base of a group of adventitious roots.

By Mr. Wixn’s permission eight more sections of the specimen were cut for me by
Mr. Lomax, parallel to the first. These, as it proves, cut successively deeper

the roots and those of the parent axis. The peridermal zones of the various roots
