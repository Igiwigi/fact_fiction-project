It is, however, not within the scope of this
paper to enter into the question of the conditions of accumulation of the Downtonian
strata which have yielded the fossil plants under consideration here. This is a
general geological problem which is beyond my competence. The facts ascertained
regarding the flora will doubtless be included by geologists along with the palaeonto-
logical and other evidence. It need only be remarked that the transitional nature
of the formation which has often been emphasized by geologists is indicated by
the persistence of a few marine animals in the lower beds and by their general
absence in the higher plant-containing beds.* But the uniformity of the flora
throughout renders any view that it could be of marine origin in the lower beds and
of continental origin in the later beds out of the question.
