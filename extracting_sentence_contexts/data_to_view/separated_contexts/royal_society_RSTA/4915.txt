Let F be an ¢-adic sheaf modulo p. Then Auti(F) is either empty or is of the form & Autg(F)
for some € € N(Auto(F)) such that £7 € Auto(F). For Auto(F) = 1, we recover the fact that Aut(F) is either empty or contains only an involution;
if Auto(F) is equal to its normalizer, e.g. if it is a maximal and non-normal subgroup, then it shows
that Auti(s ) is either empty or equal to Auto(F), which means that 1 € Auti(s, ), or in other words
that

for some rank 1 sheaf £. This means that, in some sense, F is ‘almost’ self-dual. Proof.
