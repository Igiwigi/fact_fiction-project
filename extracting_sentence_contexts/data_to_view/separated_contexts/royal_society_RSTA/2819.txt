W. M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES. It is a remarkable fact also, and one which will probably be of importance in
throwing light on molecular constitution, that all those elements which do not
exhibit satellites have order differences depending on multiples of A, whereas all the
others (Al excepted) depend on multiples of the oun, é or d,. The elements without
satellites are Na, K, Mg, possibly Al, both series of O, and §. All these depend on
multiples of A, or A, None of the others do so, and it may be regarded as an
argument in favour of Rb possessing satellite series that its differences do not depend
on A directly.
