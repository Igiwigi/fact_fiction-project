reverse direction. I therefore take it from this fact alone that the blood, squeezed out of
the blood pump, does pass down the peduncle.

However, from the anatomy I have described, it is clear that there is no structural
hindrance to the blood passing out of the blood pump into the prosoma (figures 4 and 12,
and see also later, p. 121). There is no valve such as described by Nussbaum (1890, p. 44).
I must therefore demonstrate the existence of some means by which this passage of blood
is prevented. I believe it is brought about by high pressure produced in the prosoma by
the contraction of those muscles, some transverse and some dorso-ventral, which I have
described in the prosomal and trunk regions (p. 105). I showed that these muscles
formed a regulatory system controlling the internal body pressure which varies every time
the limbs are cast out. We are now considering the case when the limbs are not being
cast out, but this does not affect the possible activity of this group of muscles. In fact, it
simplifies matters, for they will be unhindered in their activity. They will simply contract
sufficiently to produce a higher pressure in the prosoma, and hence in the blood pump—

for these spaces are directly continuous—than occurs in the peduncular vessel. In this
case, the valve will open and allow blood to pass through.

On the peduncular side of the valve there is morphological evidence that the pressure
is always relatively low. The peduncular vessel itself is long and wide and shows no sign of
narrowing throughout its length. Its total volume will be considerable, and more than
