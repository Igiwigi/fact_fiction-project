The papillze show sometimes

in their longitudinal axis an infiltration of fine granules.

a Tn the deeper parts of the corium larger or smaller tracts present themselyes, formed
E partly by larger spherical cells and partly (sldom though) by a finely granular s8ub-
S 8tance. LuGINBUAL therefore makes the whole process start in the epidermis, and hence
S gradually to extend into the corium. These statements are, according to my obser-
©  yations of yariola of sheep, wholly inconsistent with the facts occurring in this latter
i= disease, which, as is well known, is in clinical and anatomical respects very similar if
& not analogous to smallpox of Man.

5 'The results of the examination of smallpox of Man obtained by Avserrz and Bascn are
= described by NEvManN®, who confirms fully the observations of these authors, in this
E way :—lIn papules, on the second day of their appearance, the epidermis is eleyated,
© apparently from the increased thickness of the rete Malpighii, the individual cells of

S] which are larger than those of the neighbouring normal parts; their nuclei are
VS enlarged. The vessels in the corium, those in the papillary region as well as those
"= beneath it, are distended ; on their walls are numerous small ronndish cells, and similar
FI cells are found in the stroma of the papille. The papillze and glands are unchanged.

= The structure of the vesicles and the pustules is thus described :—Under the stratum
£ comeum of the epidermis there is a layer of longitudinal cells, which merge uninter-
B= ruptedly into the roundish or flattened and distinctly swollen cells of the rete Malpighii
61 beneath this a meshwork is scen, which is nearer to the stratum corneum than to the
be corium, and occupies a great part of the breadth of the vesicles, but does not extend
E deeply. 'This mesh-like structure consists of transyerse septa of fine fibrous tissue, which
- are evidently formed of the compressed spindle-shaped cells of the hypertrophied rete

Malpighii; in its interstices pus-cells are imbedded, some of the large yesicles containing
ten or more 8mall cells.
