equivalent statements?). They found that left fronto-temporal
perisylvian regions were more recruited by linguistic than by
algebraic judgements, while the latter recruited areas such as
the IPS, previously reported for numerical [20,21] or spatial
[22,23] cognition.

A few observations have indicated that language-
related areas such as the posterior temporal/angular gyrus
region can be activated during the processing of number and
arithmetic. A general rule-of-thumb, however, is that these acti-
vations occur whenever subjects process numerical materials
in a rote manner, for instance when remembering exact
addition facts such ‘fifty-four plus thirteen is sixty-seven’ [4]
or when drilling multiplication facts [7]. Demonstrably, such
rote learning involves a language-specific memory code [4,5].
The inferior frontal region (‘Broca’s area’) is also activated
when subjects name complex numerals such as ‘three hundred
twenty-four’, in direct proportion to the complexity of the syn-
tactic structures involved [24]. A contrario, the bulk of the
evidence indicates that such language circuitry is not activated
whenever a deeper, semantic representation of numbers is
accessed and manipulated.
