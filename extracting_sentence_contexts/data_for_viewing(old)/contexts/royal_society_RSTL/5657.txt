Jud the expression for £ is obtained from the equation

2 4GE=(6,f, 7, 0X(J.F. 6,4, g, Ia, 9, 2Y,—(h, 6, 4,f, 1, FX, y.aY)"
Z —(a,b, of, g, h,7,5, k, IXLz, y, 2) (Ca+D),

bore the second line is in fact equal to zero, on account of the first factor, which
Sanishes. And C, D denote respectively quadric and cubic functions of (y, 2), which
Are to be determined 80 as to make the right-hand side divisible by a*; the rexulting
Imtve of £ may be modified by the adjunction of the evanescent term

(2zx+hy+92)(a, b, c,Ff\ g, h, i,, k, IL, y. 2),
hore a, g, h are arbitrary coefficients; but as it is not obvious how these coefficients
ould be determined in order to present the result in the most simple form, I have given
the result in the form in which it was obtained without the adjunction of any such term.
