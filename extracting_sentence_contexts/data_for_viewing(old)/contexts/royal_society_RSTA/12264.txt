2 aypeken with Instrument E has already been published,* and though the discussion is
&.not yet completed, it may be stated that the lines recorded in the spectrum are at
‘2 wave-lengths which approximate very closely to the lines of hydrogen, to flutings
% which appear in the spectra of compounds of carbon, to a fluting of magnesium at
5 5006, and to the longest flame lines of iron, calcium, and magnesium.
> The chromospheric line designated D, has been recorded in the visual spectrum of
= the Orion Nebula by Dr. Copmnanp,t and the observation has since been confirmed
Eg by Mr. Taytor.t
= The line which is always associated with D, in the spectrum of the chromosphere,
B viz., that at 44471 (Lorenzont’s f), is also shown in the photograph of the spectrum
8 of the Orion Nebula.
E The requirements of the hypothesis with regard to nebulz are therefore met in
fa every point so far considered by the new facts.
_ Dividing up the lines into the three groups of origins suggested, we have in the
tase of the Orion Nebula :—
