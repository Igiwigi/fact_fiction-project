constituted alkyloxy-benzoic acids (compare Jonrs and Rosrnson (1917)). Thus, the
carboxyl group of veratric acid is displaced by bromine but not that of a methoxy-
veratric acid, namely, gallic acid trimethyl ether. The displacement of the carboxyl
group occurs, apparently, most easily when methoxyl is situated in the p-position to
it. VIII gives an immediate precipitate of a neutral di-bromo-derivative (X), whereas
IX gave no precipitate under the same conditions.

The substance from VIII crystallised from ethyl alcohol, in which it is sparingly
soluble, in colourless prismatic needles, m.p. 168°-169° ©. (Found: Br, 51-2 per cent.
C,H,.0.Br, requires Br, 51-6 per cent.). It is therefore 2: 6 (or 2: 4)-dibromo-orcinol
dimethyl ether. On testing the acids III and IV in the same way, it was
found that no precipitation occurred when bromine water was added to a solution
of IIT in aqueous sodium carbonate; this fact, alone, suggests that III
must have the formula XI and excludes VII for the substance II. Clearly,
this requires that IV should be represented by the formula XII and should yield a

neutral bromo-derivative when bromine is added to its alkaline solution. Actually,
this was found to be the case, and the bromo-derivative (probably, 2 : 4-dibromo-6-
ethylresorcinol dimethyl ether, but it may also be a mono-bromo-derivative) crystallised
