The majority of the degenerated fibres of the middle peduncle terminate in th
grey matter of the opposite side of the pons; but a few of these fibres terminate i
the grey matter of the pons on the same side as the cerebellar lesion. No degenerated
fibres from this source were traced in the fillet and posterior longitudinal bundle te

the antero-lateral region of the spinal cord, or to the quadrigeminal region.

3. The Inferior Cerebellar Pedunele.

. As in the case of the other peduncles, so here, the degenerated fibres at firs
occupy a compact region, and are not widely scattered, they are in fact accurately
limited to the confines of the restiform body, on the side of the cerebellar lesion,
seen on transverse section (see fig. 9), and not a degenerated fibre is to be seen ir
any other region in such a section. On following these fibres in sections taken
at lower levels they soon begin to show a tendency to separate from each other, ani
while some pursue a more or less vertical course, caudalwise, others turn into the
gray matter in increasing numbers, at successively lower levels, until the few fibre
left in the peripheral region of the medulla are scarcely worthy of the name of a
tract. Another tendency which is evident in the degenerated fibres of the restiform
body, is for them to move more or less en masse ventralwards, so that they come to
lie more and more anteriorly, in the lateral region of the medulla, at successively
lower levels. Fig. 9, taken from a section at the level of exit of the eighth cranial
nerve, whose superficial root is seen coursing on the outerside of the restiform body,
