I
write thus strongly and definitely lest it should be imagined that T am dealing in vague
conjectures in connexion with this subject. If I am vague, the mechanical theory of an
ether must in reality bear the reproach. $0 far, however, from having a reproach to
bear, the whole body of facts is in complete harmony with this theory. Further, if, as all the facts declare, radiation and absorption are complementary acts,
the one consisting in communication, the other in reception, and the one being strictly
proportional to the other, no coincidence in period between the vibrations of a radiating
body and those of oxygen, hydrogen, or air, could make any one of these snbstances a
good absorber. The form of the atom, or some other attribute than its period of oscil-
lation, must, enter into the question of absorption. It is physically incapacitated from
communicating motion, and hence in an equal degree incapacitated from accepting
motion.
