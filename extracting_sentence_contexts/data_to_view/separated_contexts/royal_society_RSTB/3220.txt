C. SEWARD AND MISS 8. 0. FORD

60 to 80, The statement that the Eutacta species are characterised by canals below
the bundles does not hold good ; in fact, with the exception of A. Rulez, the canals
are seldom met with under the veins. A noteworthy characteristic of the genus is the rich development of transfusion
tracheids (centripetal xylem); as this tissue has already been described by more
than one author, we do not propose to deal with it in detail.
