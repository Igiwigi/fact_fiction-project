A third and most significant condition which affects the relative intensities of
spectrum lines is the pressure of the gas from which they are produced. In Helium,
as is well known, this is peculiarly conspicuous; the colour of the discharge, for
example, being green at low pressures. The existence of this phenomenon has, in
fact, been familiar for many years, and indeed was responsible at one time for the
erroneous view that Helium was a mixture of two gases. This misconception was
only removed by the demonstration that the effect in question was due to variations
of the pressure of the gas in the tube, but there has since been no quantitative
investigation of the nature of the changes which are known to occur. It is thus evident that there are a number of circumstances which modify the
distribution of intensity in the spectrum of an element, and that in order to obtain
further information it is desirable to investigate the simplest possible cases in which
the nature of any changes introduced into the method of excitation of the spectrum
can be followed in some detail.
