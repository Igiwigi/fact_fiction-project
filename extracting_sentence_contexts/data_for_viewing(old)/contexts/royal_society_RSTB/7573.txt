contractile vacuoles. The organism studied by the writer has only one such structure as
noted by Dobell (1914). This is one of the species of amoebae belonging to the new family
Hartmannellidae. It has been put in the genus Hartmannella Alexcieff em. Aut.

Morphology, etc.

The amoebae are very variable in size and in shape. In a rounded condition they are
approximately 15 to 30 across. Amoeba glebae, according to Dobell (1914), has a size of
12 to 20. The small size of Dobell’s organism is probably due to the fact that he used rich
nutrient liquid media and uncontrolled bacterial food supply. The species of amoebae
described in the family Schizopyrenidae have been found to be very active in young
culture and are readily able to produce the limax shape. Hartmannella glebae and other
species described in this genus are not very active and rarely produce the limax shape.
The movement of Amoeba lamellipoda, as described by Glaser (19124) applies to Hartmann-
ella glebae. The ectoplasm and endoplasm are very clear (figure 163a,b). The endoplasm
is usually full of food vacuoles containing bacteria. The amoebae are uninucleate, although
an individual with two nuclei has been seen on several occasions. There is a single con-
tractile vacuole.

The living cysts are rounded or spherical with a single wall (figure 163c,d). The wall
seems to consist of two layers in which no pores could be seen. The nucleolus is clearly
