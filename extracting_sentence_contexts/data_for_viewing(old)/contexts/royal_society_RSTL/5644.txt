& ence between eggs and buds above-mentioned, since he has proposed, deyeloping the
S idea of which we owe the germ to Dr. CARPENTER, to extend the use of the word © indi-
© vidual” to the whole product of one impregnation, and to designate as © zooids” the
E independent forms of the individualf. Prof. HuxLey, however, proposes this system of
S nomenclature merely as convenient, and not as expressing any fundamental, structural,
© or potential difference between eggs and buds.
2 T believe that the development. of the ephippial and agamic eggs of Daphnia now
= described is sufficient evidence of the fundamental identity of eggs and buds, or rather of
= their forming parts of one and the same series, a point on which T would particularly
D& insist, and the cases of agamogenesis in Cynips and many Lepidoptera are equally con-
= clusive.
Z If, however, S1EBOLD is correct in stating{}, that drones always proceed from unimpreg-
= nated eggs, and in fact that it is the presence or absence of impregnation which alone
£ determines the ex of the future bee, a statement not unsupported by careful observations
FB and experiments, I cannot imagine that even the most sceptical naturalists can retain
Z any doubts upon the subject.
Z Whether we retain the old nomenclature, or dropping the idea of unity in the term
= <* gndividual,” adopt the system proposed by Prof. HuxLey, we shall be met by great dif-
S ficulties and inconsistencies ; but I am not yet convinced of the superiority of the latter
= system, which would prevent us from knowing whether any given specimen of certain
5 animals, say for instance any Sphinz or Daphnia, was an individual or not, and according
A to which, if SteBOLD's assertions are correct, there are no male individuals of the Honey-bee.
