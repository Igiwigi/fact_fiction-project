In the preceding experiments it may be seen that by far
the greater number of the results are negative, or that the
readings of the micrometer for the most part gradually de-
crease. I felt much at a loss to account for this, and at first
supposed it to have been occasioned by the vicinity of the
lamp to the Y supporting the cross wires ; but I found on
trial that this was not the fact ; indeed in that case the effect
would have been the reverse of what was observed. I can
in no other way account for it than by supposing that as the
weather was very damp and cold, my approach to the stand
which supported the micrometer, caused the legs which were

next me to expand; a supposition which appears to be in
some degree corroborated by the micrometer giving an in-
creased reading on my return, after having been absent for
some time from the Observatory. Whatever may be the
cause, it constantly operates in one direction, and seems to
be the principal source of the errors which are-observable.
