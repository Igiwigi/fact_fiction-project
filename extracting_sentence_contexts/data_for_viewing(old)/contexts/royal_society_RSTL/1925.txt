submaxillary textures, of the sphincter ani and the tail, and of the heart, in these
several parts of the recently killed turtle, placed together upon the same table.
All continue vigorous for a considerable time, until the medulla oblongata or
the medulla spinalis be withdrawn, when the movements of that portion of the
respiratory apparatus which is attached to the head, or of the sphineter and
tail, cease in an instant.

'The reflex tunction of the medulla is most permanent and apparent to obser-
vation in those animals in which the respiration is lowest. The cold-hlooded
animals, the hybernating animal, and the very young of the warm-blooded, are
therefore the subjects in which this function can be best studied. It may be
retained, or restored, however, in the adult warm-blooded animal, by retaining
the respiration, or by renewing the respiration artificially,â€”a fact, which con-
stitutes another characteristic of the reflex function, and distinguisbes it from
irritability, and which is, in my opinion, one of the most remarkable in phy-
siology, and highly worthy of further investigation. These remarks will readily
suggest the proper choice of animals, and mode of experiment, for the display
of the reflex function. I now proceed to the detail of the various experiments
which I have made upon this subject, and shall then deduce the conclusions

which appear to flow from them.
