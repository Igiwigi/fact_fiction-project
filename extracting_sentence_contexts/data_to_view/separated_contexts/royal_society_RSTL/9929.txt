The © alternate difference,” such as 22,419 in the column of the clock record, is the
number of divisions passed over by the cylinder in the course of two geconds of time. If the cylinder rotated with perfect uniformity the quotient of these bwo numbers,
viz,, 22412 =9-2986, would be the number of hundreds of revolutions completed by
the toothed wheel in two seconds of time, and if we multiply this number by 50, we
get 46493 revolutions per second as the speed of the toothed wheel. But as a matter of fact the chronograph-cylinder is constantly accelerated by the
small weight, and retarded by the friction of the instrument. 'The total effect is
generally a retardation, gradually diminishing the velocity of rotation of the chrono-
