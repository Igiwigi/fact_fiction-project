There are horizontal canals in the secondary wood of the root that originate
at the canals in the primary wood and are associated with the vestiges of lateral roots. These continue beyond the buried remains of the laterals into the later formed secondary
wood and bast of the main root, and are so similar to the ordinary horizontal ones of
the medullary rays as to be readily mistaken for them. The fact that they occur often
in pairs, and at a very slight tangential distance apart, is helpful in establishing their
identity. On being traced inwards the pairs are often found to join just before the
primary canal of the main root is reached. 8. ConcLUsIONS.
