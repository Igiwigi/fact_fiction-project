These features—a word- structure (real or potential) of stimuli containing the

final coronal consonant (typically /d,t,s,z/) that agrees in inflectional rhyme pattern that produces the additional
voice with the preceding segment—we refer to as the activation. Further evidence for this comes from a
inflectional rhyme pattern. The fact that the patients were comparison between two sets of non-words—regular
