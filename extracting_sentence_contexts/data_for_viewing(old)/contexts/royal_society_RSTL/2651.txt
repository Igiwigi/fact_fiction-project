off its old skin as a larva, there is a cessation of its efforts for a few seconds. It then
makes a few slow but very powerful respirations, during which, as in every forced
inspiration, the abdominal segments are much distended, after which the longitudinal
layers of museles of these segments become very much contracted, and the segments
themselves shortened. While this is taking place the circulatory fluid contained in
the vessels of the abdomen is propelled forwards, and the wings, which at the mo-
ment of slipping off the old skin are scarcely s0 large as hemp-seeds, are distended
at their base, and at each inspiration of the insect are gradually enlarged by the pro-
pulsion of circulatory fluid into them, and are carried down over the lateral and under
surface of the trunk, and the ventral surface of the first two segments of the abdomen,
This is exactly what takes place in the Sphinz ligustri, as well as in Vanessa urtice.
From the fact of all the trachee being enlarged immediately after the insect has
changed to the pupa tate, it seems not improbable that this enlargement is occa-
sioned by the closing of the spiracles, and the expansion of the air within the tracheze
during the powerful respiratory efforts of the insect in effecting its transformation, â€”
that it results from the recession of the circulatory fluid from the yessels of the ab-
domen into the partially developed wings taking off pressure at the instant from the
tracheal tubes, which then become distended by the natural elasticity of the air con-
tained within them.
Professor Cavs attributes the development of the air-bags and dilatation of the
trachez entirely to the closing of the spiracles and the expansion of the contained
air, which he thinks is increased in quantity * during the development of the insect.
But it seems more probable that the formation of air-bags is occasioned simply by a
continuance of the same canse, the elasticity of the contained air, which produces
