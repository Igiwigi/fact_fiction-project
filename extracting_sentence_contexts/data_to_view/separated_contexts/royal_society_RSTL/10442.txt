Before passing to the description of the well-developed Tadpole, I must refer again
to the intermediate stages (ibid., Plate 55, figs. 3, 4, 5). On its way to the coronoid region of the mandible, the temporal muscle passes over
the palato-pterygoid bar, and under a leafy growth of the *suspensorium®—the *orbitar
process ” (or.p.). In Bufo vulgaris the apex of this leaf coalesces with the ethmoidal
cartilage, a rare character, This fact, and its nonconformity with what is seen in the
Tadpole of the Frog, were pointed out to me by Professor Huxuey five or six years ago. In other species (even of Bufo) I do not find this very peculiar condition of things,
but the process itself is well developed, even in the wide-mouthed laryw of the
