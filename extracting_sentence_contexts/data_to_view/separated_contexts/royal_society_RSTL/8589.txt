These
cells are no doubt s8wollen dropsical epithelial cells. The deepest stratum of the rete Malpighii is in a state of very active proliferation. This is evinced by the fact that the interpapillary processes grow to extremely large
dimensions, and that cylindrical processes composed of young epithelial cells penetrate,
7. e. grow, into the papille of the corium from them, the papillee themselyes being
longer and thicker than natural. These epithelial processes penetrate into the papille
in different depths and in different directions ; s0 that in sections many of them present
themselvyes as isolated patches, surrounded by papillary substance, in the neighbourhood
of the Malpighian layer. These, as well as the processes which in the section are not
severed from their natural connexion with the rete Malpighii, are composed of the
same granular substance as the deepest layer of the rete Malpightii, and contain spherical
nuclei at more or less regular intervals, which exactly resemble those of the epithelial
cells of the rete Malpighii.
