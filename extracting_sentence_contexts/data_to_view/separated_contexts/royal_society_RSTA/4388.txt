Further, if M, = M., formula (v.) is a quadratic equation to find M, ; substituting
“for M’,, oi, and 7, we have, on solving and taking the only admissible root, M, = 3°4626. dhen, applying formula (i.) to find M’,, we have :
°

& M’, = 5°660. a 'This is not quite as high as the observed value 5°856, but it suflices to show that
our theory expresses the main facts. In all probability we have not entirely freed
our results from weighting with fertility ; because, although every endeavour was
made to take only one from each family, it is possible that pairs of sisters have occa-
sionally crept into the record. (iii.)
