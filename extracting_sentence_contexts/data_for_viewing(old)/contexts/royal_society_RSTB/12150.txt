the group. This is certainly not the case in plants. Compe-
tition can rather be considered as an important tool in their
adaptive behaviour. For example, it enables the plant to
support the more promising directions of growth, and to
abandon the less promising ones ([4,10,11,19,33,57,94]
and figure 3b).

The subject of the present issue of the Philosophical Trans-
actions of the Royal Society B is the ‘solid’ versus ‘liquid’ nature
of networks. I think that plants represent an interesting
‘hybrid’ between ‘solid’ and ‘liquid’. They are solid in the
sense that the agents and links have fixed positions in
space.” The fact that the death of a link is irreversible also
causes some rigidity in the behaviour of the system. But,
despite of these limitations, the system is quite flexible. The
agents are born and die unceasingly. The death of links can
be decoupled from the death of agents. Flexibility is
enhanced by the functional variability of agents and links,
which also includes an opportunity for local specialization.
In summary, plants show many interesting features in
terms of gathering and processing information. Although
they do not have any brain, their body itself is network-
like, which enables complex kinds of adaptive behaviour.

Network theory has been applied on various levels of bio-
