There has atp8 and nad4L, but there are challenges with inferring the
been speculation of an ‘evolutionary ratchet’, whereby genes correct start codon in cases where there are multiple, closely
rearranging by inversions to be on a single strand would spaced alternatives. An inference must consider the possi-
eliminate the selective pressure to maintain transcription of bility of overlap with the upstream gene and the extent of
the other strand and, once lost, would make any further inver- evolutionary conservation of the ORF. This is confounded
sion of any gene immediately non-functional such that by the fact that molluscs employ the invertebrate mitochon-
reversion to a state of genes on both strands would be highly drial genetic code (NCBI Genetic Code 5) that allows for
unlikely [113]. Investigating mitochondrial transcriptional alternative start codons in addition to ATG, including ATA,
dynamics in closely related species (or M- versus F-type ATY, TTG and GTG (normally encoding for methionine, iso-
mtDNAs from the same species) that have inversions relative leucine, leucine and valine, respectively). Each of these
to one another might prove especially useful in understanding would provide a match to at least two nucleotides of the
how inversions are able to persist longer than other types trnM anticodon (CAU), which must do double duty in
of mitochondrial genome rearrangements.
