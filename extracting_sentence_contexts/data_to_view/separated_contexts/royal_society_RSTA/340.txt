In those early models, the dependency structure of the v; is fixed a priori (but see the extension
by Gruber et al. [42]). In more recent work, the dependency structure of the v; has been estimated
from data. The model in Hyvarinen et al. [40] in fact contains a parameter matrix that describes
the correlations between the v;, and one can estimate these parameters rather straightforwardly
[43]. A closely related formalism uses a generative model of the whole covariance structure of x
[44,45]. Another line of work defines a parametrized pdf that does not have an explicit representation
of the variance variables v; but attempts to model the same kind of dependencies [46,47].
