Similar to our calculation of the amino acid operations
per total energy of the biosphere, above we calculate that there are 2.54 x 107° (nucleotide
operations/s/biosphere) or 4.98 x 10!? (nucleotide operations per J), which agrees well with
the independent estimate from [94].

5. Discussion

Here we have shown that life maintains a roughly constant power usage as a function of
the age of the system’s evolutionary arrival, yet the overall scale and type of system have
strong implications for power usage: bacteria increase in power usage per unit mass for larger


cells, whereas multicellular life has a decreasing power expenditure per unit mass for larger
systems. In fact, multicellular life would be surprisingly more efficient than astronomical objects
if extrapolated to the same scales. Despite these shifts across the architectures of life, we find surprising consistency in
the efficiency of translation, one of the most universal types of computation carried out in
biological systems. Our analyses show that as bacteria become larger their overall translational
efficiency converges on that of a single ribosome.
