Curve E is the electromotive force curve of the machine when there is no current
in the armature. Re is the curve of electromotive force deduced from the potential
difference taken between the terminals of the alternator when supplying current
through non-inductive resistances. The curves E and Re have been integrated,
the corresponding integral curves being A and B respectively.

That the ordinary theory does not fully account for the facts is easily shown.
We have Ra = E — (Lz). Integrate both sides from any fixed epoch 0 to any time
t and we have

{ Re dt = [E dt — I, (a, — %).
0 0

Each term of this equation consists of a constant part and of a periodic part. The
constant parts must be equal and also the periodic parts. We have to deal only with
the periodic parts. The curves A and B, fig. 5, represent the periodic parts of each
