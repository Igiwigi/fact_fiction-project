At that time four pups were hanging from
the paper, to which nine larvae were also suspended. By 10.5 a.m., August 10, four
had pupated some hours, and two more quite recently, while the three remaining
larvee pupated at some time (unknown) later than 10.5 a.m. All these were marked
and compared on August 19, the following results being obtained :—

In this case it is seen that practically no effect was produced by the light, a fact
which I afterwards learnt was to be expected, for a strong light merely tends towards
the special coloration which follows from the illumination of the surroundings of the
pupa, if such surroundings are coloured by any of the tints for which the organism is
sensitive. In all the experiments with green cylinders I had in mind the green form

of V. Jo and the green form of so many other dimorphic species (Papilio machaon,
Anthocaris cardamines, &c.).
