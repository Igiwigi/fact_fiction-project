Fig. 22. Under this power the whole character of the ciliary motion is changed,
and it is seen that what before appeared to be a single cilium is in fact a wave of
cilia, and that their motion, instead of being in the direction of the circumference of
the disc, is at right angles to this. The ciliary phenomena are the most readily ob-
served when the gemmule is nearly at rest, or has become languid ; it then lies either
with the convex or the plane side uppermost, and with the cilia, which are of great
length, doubled in the middle upon themselves (fig. 21.)
