The Al—C bond, for example,
is just about as strong as the C—C bond, and the Zn—C bond approaches the C—C bond
in strength. The B—C bond, in particular, appears to be unexpectedly strong, and ap-
preciably stronger than the C—C bond. It is well established that the B—F bond, for
example, is considerably stronger than the C—F bond, a fact which is easily accounted for
in terms of electronic structure. In the case of the B—C bond, the extra stabilization
relative to the C—C bond is smaller. It is not so simply explainable in terms of the vacant
