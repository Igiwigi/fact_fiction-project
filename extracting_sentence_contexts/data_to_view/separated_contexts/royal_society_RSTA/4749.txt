Any interaction in the string would lead to gravitons interacting with it, and
these in turn would generate curvature in the background. One may suspect what all this means
physically: the lattice will feature local lattice defects of various forms; the strings may merge
with defect lines in some delicate manner, but all this has not been sorted out. What we did find is one rather astonishing fact, which seems to have been overlooked by
string theoreticians: the lattice size parameter a is fixed in our theory. There is only one lattice size
possible. It is exactly

{space-time = Qnva', (5.5)
where aâ€™ is the string slope parameter.

5We do note that the situation is not hopeless: the longitudinal string variables that need to coincide refer to points inside
the string world sheet.
