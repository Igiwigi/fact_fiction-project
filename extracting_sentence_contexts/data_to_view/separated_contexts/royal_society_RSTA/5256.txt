However, at individual locations in the ocean the 1 mm per year-level time span can range from 5
to 101 years. The longest time is associated with eddy variability in the Kuroshio extension off the
east coast of Japan. This result highlights both the power of averaging to decrease the uncertainty
in estimates of the trend as well as the fact that global maps of trends need to be viewed with : =
these spatially varying uncertainties in mind. :3
While the variability in the time series places certain limits on our ability to make statements
about the long-term trends, systematic factors also contribute to our uncertainty in the estimates eal
of sea-level change. These systematic factors particularly highlight the need for simultaneous :
observations by other systems, as well as the need for a stable realization of the reference system [4
for the measurements. aw
One important aspect of the altimetry is the need to correct for a variety of factors, including aes)
sea-state bias and wet tropospheric delay. These corrections vary between each satellite mission, aes)
must be independently evaluated and led to the requirement that the altimetry missions must ,
overlap [68].
