They are said to be seen regularly off the
Norwegian coast in May and June, and also to be quite common in the Pacific off the coast
of British Columbia, where there is a similar spring inshore movement. Nothing is known
of where the sharks may go when they leave the coasts, nor whether their migration is
horizontal or vertical, or both. The fish appear at all points along the coast at about the
same time and there is not a shred of good evidence to indicate any migration from south
to north, or in the reverse direction later in the season, although such migrations are often
spoken of, for example, by Darling (1947), as though they were ascertained fact. The account
given by this author is based upon the results of the 1946 fishing season, when the weather
was very bad and unsuitable for hunting or basking, during most of July and August. In
the 1947 season the weather was better and hunting was successful throughout the summer.
