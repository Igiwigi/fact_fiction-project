EXCITATION AND IONIZATION OF ATOMS 97

5, and sy have either of two values a and /, and they remain unaltered throughout the col-
lision. No special symmetry properties are associated with ‘. It is expanded in terms of
the complete set of eigenfunctions y,,,(r,) of the hydrogen atom; thus

¥(t,,02) = 2 ¥m(F2) F,,(T,)5 (11)

the summation sign including integration over the continuum. By substituting in (7) and
making use of the fact that y,, satisfies the equation

[¥8+2(En+;)| Yu (ts) = 0, (12)

by then multiplying by y* (r,) and integrating over the spatial co-ordinates of the atomic
electron it can be shown that

Hence using (11) again
