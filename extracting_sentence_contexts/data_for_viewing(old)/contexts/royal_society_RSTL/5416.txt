the ether with the velocity of light in extremely minute undulations of different lengths
and periods.

If then a sunbeam, fraught with a vast variety of such undulations, be incident
upon a medium $0 constituted that its particles are capable of vibrating in unison, or
even in harmonic consonance less perfect than unison, with some or other of the
ethereal vibrations of the incident beam, it must necessarily happen that one system
of vibrations will be called into existence by the other according to the laws of
reSOnance.

There may be a difficulty in explaining, but there can be no doubt of the fact,
that the vis viva due to such induced vibrations, like that which is due to the vibra-

tions of heat, may become more or less persistent in the medium ; producing at one
time the phenomenon of fixed chemical action, at another time that of permanently
latent heat, at another time that less permanently latent or retarded heat, at another
time that of coloration and absorption, at another time that of phosphogenie action.
The remarkable phenomena lately discovered by Professor SToxgs seem closely allied
