ate auditory object [68] (figure 1, C). The ability to hear two
objects when a harmonic is mistuned appears to emerge in
human infancy at around the same age as the ability to
derive pitch from sounds with missing fundamentals
[46,69], consistent with the idea that both are part of the
same process of ASA. Music often consists of more than
one sound at a time. As with the perception of pitch itself,
the ability to perceive multiple simultaneous musical lines
appears to be based on the evolution of ASA, again consistent
with musical structure being a consequence of the human
