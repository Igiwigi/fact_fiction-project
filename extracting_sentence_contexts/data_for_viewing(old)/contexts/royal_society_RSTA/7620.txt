surface where « is greater than 2-3 « 10°" e.m.u., and that, between this region and
the deeper and more highly conducting region, there is one where x is distinctly less
than 2-3 x 107! e.m,u. This, however, seems unlikely, especially as the measured con-
ductivity of surface rocks seldom exceeds 10- e.m.u. It seems more probable that the
oceans have an effect of the same order as that represented by the thin shells in d or ¢
above. An independent estimate of this effect, based on an investigation of the induced
currents in a suitable non-uniform thin shell, would obviously be of value in this con-
nexion.

11. THE DEPTH OF PENETRATION OF THE INDUCED GURRE

The inferences, which can be drawn from the above results as to the distribution of
conductivity within the earth, are of course restricted by the fact that the induced

currents will not penetrate (appreciably) beyond a certain depth. In the case of the
extreme theoretical distribution e the currents do not, in fact, penetrate below the
surface of the conducting core. In the other cases considered, the general character
of the induced current distribution has been determined qualitatively in § 6.
