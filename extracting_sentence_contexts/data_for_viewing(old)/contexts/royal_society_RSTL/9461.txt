Apparatus employed.

One of the objects I have had in view was to compare the spectra obtained by
photographic method with the thermographs obtained by Sir Joan Herscnr, and :
with the energy curves obtained by means of the thermopile. To do this it see
necessary to work under the same conditions as those under which these re
were obtained, and I attempted to do so0. After many experiments, however, I four

one prism that I have employed three prisms to obtain greater dispersion. The fi
prisms that were actually employed were of white flint glass of an angle of 629, wor!
by Mr. Apam HiGer. The length of the side of the prism is about 24 inches, w
the height 13. A motion for setting and keeping the prisms at the angle of minim
deviation for all rays was also made for me by the same optician ; the fact that ra;
very great comparative wave length were to be examined rendered this all the m
necessary. The collimator was 20 inches long, and the focus was adjusted for
lowest visible ray. The 8lit had jaws, both movable, which could be opened to
required extent by means of a differential serew motion. The lens at first attached

of 30 inches focus, and of about 3 inches aperture. A rather imperfect heliostat, b
one which sufficiently answered my purpose, was used to cas the beam of light Â©
