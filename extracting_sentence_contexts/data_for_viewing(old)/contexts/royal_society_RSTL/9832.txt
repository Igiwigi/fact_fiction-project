in fact was designed, to reduce the thickness of the film by evaporation, and would

- thus alter its constitution.

Liprcs, anticipating the objection that the effect observed may have been due to
the larger proportion of water absorbed by the older and thinner film, points to similar
results obtained with a decoction of Quillaja. He appears to have overlooked the fact
that if the experiments were performed in a dry atmosphere, the cold produced by
evaporation might have been the true cause in both cases.

The difficulty of estimating accurately what the magnitude of the effect of snch
a cause might be was much enhanced by the fact that no observations had been made
on the amount of water gained or lost by a soap film in a given time. The retrogression
of the colours, which, after indicating for some time a decrease, often show an increase
in thickness, had indeed been observed by PLateau. It was, however, impossible to
8ay how far this change was directly due to absorption. Considerable masses of liquid
are, as we shall hereafter show, often drawn into a film from the reservoir furnished
by the relatively thick portions in contact with its solid supports. An imperceptible
current of this kind might, whatever its cause may be, increase the thickness of the
film without altering the proportions of its constituents. On the other hand, films
thinning under the influence of gravity might, and, as our observations prove, often
do, absorb large quantities of vapour withoub any sign of retrogression in the colours.
Under these circumstances, the results of previous observers being in conflict, and 80
little being known as to the magnitude and rapidity of the changes of constitution
