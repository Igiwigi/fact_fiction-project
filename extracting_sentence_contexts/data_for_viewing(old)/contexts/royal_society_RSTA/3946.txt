fractionation model involving irreversible preferential removal of the light isotope of Zn by about
0.7%o (grey arrow, a =0.9993, see the caption for details of the calculation). Landing & Lewis
[65] present a modelling analysis of the equilibrium speciation of a number of metals in the
Black Sea water column and conclude that the dominant inorganic dissolved species of Zn in
the sulfidic zone is ZnS(HS)~, as opposed to a mixture of Zn?+ (major), ZnCl* and ZnCO3° (both
minor) in the upper oxic zone. Fujii et al. [66] used ab initio methods to calculate the magnitude
of Zn isotope fractionation between different dissolved species of Zn. These calculations suggest
A Zn792+-72nS(HS)- = +0.73%0 at 25°C. If the mix of species in the oxic Black Sea pool includes the
minor amounts of carbonate and chloride complexes suggested by Landing & Lewis [65], the A
value between the oxidized pool of Zn and the sulfidic pool is +0.64%o. Thus, the pattern across
the redoxcline is consistent with a shift in Zn speciation to sulfide species, partitioning of the light
isotopes into these species, and their partial removal from the dissolved pool. Apart from the
fact that nothing more complex than a simple Rayleigh model is required by the data, there are
also reasons to suspect that, once Zn is sulfidized, back equilibration with the non-sulfidized pool
stops. Daskalakis & Helz [67] note that the Black Sea water column may be close to saturation
with respect to sphalerite (ZnS) at the redoxcline. On the other hand, the sulfidized species of Zn
may be less stable in solution against scavenging.

The data in figure 6a from beneath about 130 m (orange) depart from the grey arrow defined
by an @ of 0.9993, and suggest further removal of Zn from the dissolved pool, such that deep
Zn concentrations ultimately reach about 5% of the water column maximum, with little further
isotopic fractionation. In the model calculations of Landing & Lewis [65] and Daskalakis & Helz
[67], sulfidized species of Zn are found to be dominant at dissolved sulfide levels equivalent to
