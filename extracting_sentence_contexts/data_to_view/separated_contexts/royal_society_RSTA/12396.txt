As vegunls the other constants of the formula, % and b are terme connected. with
the Keanperatnre variation of y. Tb is evident, however, from the appended table thal.
the magnitudes of these terme are nob stmply related to the chemical nature of Ue
anbatinces, Penizne and isopentane, for example, give different valves for these
constants, although the two experimental carves are ulmost superposable. This is doubtless due partly to the facts —

(1) That Stovre’s formula does vot express the inue law of the temperature change
of the viseosity, and

(2) That only three observations are used in deducing the formula; but mainly to
the cireumatance

(8) That the values of » and } ave intenlependent. so that different pairs of valwes-
af aud b way be found which give, with the same value of C, praotically the sane
viseosity cueve, and, from the inode of dedtwing these constants, the tudividual values
of w and b yre often affected by influences which fall within the lonils of experimentl:
