More generally, it is true that a rational
CULVE C241 of order 2m + 1, in [2m], has one (m + 1)-secant [m — 1]. This follows from the fact that
 Com+1 of [2m + 1] has one (m +- 1)-secant [m] passing through an arbitrary point not on the curve. } That is, we assume for quadries, and r = 4, k = 1, the theorem that if r — k primis of the same order

U, =0, ..., Ur-~ = 0 intersect in a locus of dimension & without multiple points, then every primal of

this order through the locus has an equation of the form
