and other ‘security risks’ [98, p. 118]. Cooper [98] suggests
this is a rational response to living in a country where risk-
minimization is now seen as an individual, rather than a
societal, responsibility, and where there is a perceived
threat of globalization to their offspring’s chances of econ-
omic success. One could also interpret such findings in
terms of a drive for relative status within a given reference
group (i.e. being a millionaire only makes you feel ‘poor’ if
your neighbours are billionaires); hence their decisions reflect
runaway investments in wealth and child quality (ie.
10 million dollars is not actually needed to minimize risk).
This interpretation is slightly complicated, however, by the
fact that Cooper’s respondents frame their reasoning in
terms of the absolute cost of the resources needed to mini-
mize risk for their entire family across the lifespan. That is,
while the amounts are specific to a particular lifestyle, these
appear to be realistic assessments of the cost of, for example,
US healthcare, and not some runaway process of keeping up
with the Joneses.

At the other end of the US socioeconomic scale, those
lacking material resources put their faith in family relation-
ships as a source of security (in line with theories proposed
by Draper [16] and Turke [17] that relational wealth may be
key), ‘downscaling’ what they consider as essential to their
