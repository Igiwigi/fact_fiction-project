the instrument in goZ minutes, it appears that the velocity with
which the heat was given off from the naked metallic surface,
was to the velocity with which it was given off from the same
surface covered with four coatings of spirit varnish, as 664 to
oZ, or as 10000 to 4566,

Without pursuing these computations any farther, at present,
and without stopping to make any remarks on the curious facts
they present to us, I shall hasten to experiments from the results
of which we shall obtain more satisfactory information. But,
before I proceed any farther, I must give an account of an in-
strument I contrived for measuring, or rather for discovering,
those very small changes of temperature in bodies, which are oc-
casioned by the radiations of other neighbouring bodies, which
happen to be at a higher, or at a lower temperature.

This instrument, which I shall take the liberty to call a ther-
moscope, is very simple in its construction. Like the hygrometer
of Mr. LesLiz, (as he has chosen to call his instrument, ) it is
compoxed of two glass balls, attached to the two ends of a bent
