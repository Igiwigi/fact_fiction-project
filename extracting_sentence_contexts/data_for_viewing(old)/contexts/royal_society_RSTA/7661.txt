be inaugurated without delay. The advantages of making organized observations may
not be seen for many years, but eventually they may lead to the saving of many lives.

APPENDIX

From the experience gained during the course of the expedition it is possible to
give an appraisal of the performance of the various instruments which may be of
value for future work either in Montserrat or in other places.

aâ€”The Wiechert seismograph

This instrument has given considerably more information than any other individual
instrument as a result of its much larger magnification and the fact that it registers
two components. For the specific problems to be met in investigating highly local
shocks it would have been a great advantage to have a more extended time scale,
and this could be obtained by simple changes in the recording mechanism. The screw

could be given a smaller pitch, so that the distance between the successive lines drawn
by the pens is reduced. The speed of rotation of this drum could then be increased
say fourfold by alterations in the governor mechanism, without making it necessary
to change the charts more than once in 24 hr., the normal period. Especially if this
