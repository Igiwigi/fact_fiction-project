Indeed, owing to the functional equation
satisfied by ¢ = ¢(s) (and thus connecting ¢(s) and ¢(1 —s)), it can be equivalently formulated
for all values of the underlying parameter (D in [3,4] and [5-7] or c in [8—12]). By contrast, the new
criterion for the RH obtained in this paper is asymmetric, in the sense that it is only stated (and
valid) for all values of the underlying parameter c in the open interval (0, 3). In fact, its counterpart
for all values of c in the symmetric interval (4,1) cannot be true, due to the universality of the
Riemann zeta function ¢ = ¢(s) in the right critical strip 3 < Re(s) < 1. More specifically, the main
new result of this paper is the following (see §5 and theorem 1.1): the spectral operator a = a-
is invertible (in the usual sense of the invertibility of an unbounded operator) for all values
of c in (0, 3) if and only if the RH is true. Again, this new asymmetric spectral reformulation
of RH does not have any analogue for the interval G, 1) because the spectral operator is not
invertible for any value of c in (Gs, 1).
