of temperature from 0? to 300* in the magnetic field.

3410. This tourmaline erystal (3377.) being hung between the poles of the great
electro-magnet, was raised by a spirit-lamp to a full red heat, and then set well with
its axis equatorially, though with diminished power; $0 that high temperature does
not take away its magnecrystallic character: on cooling it returned to its first higher
condition. On a former occasion I found that a like, short, thick, black crystal lost
part of its power by the heat of a spirit-lamp flame, but on cooling, the tourmaline
became very magnetic, pointed axially, and was strongly attracted. The latter
effects were traced to a portion of peroxide of iron on one part of the crystal, which
had been reduced to protoxide or even lower, by the vapour and heat of the spirit-
lamp: digestion in hydrochloric acid removed this iron and restored the crystal to
its first condition. The fact shows, that a temperature which takes away the high
paramagnetic condition of iron or its protoxide could not destroy the peculiar con-
dition of tourmaline as a magnecrystal,

3411. Carbonate of iron.—The crystal of this substance before described (3379.)
was suspended in an oil bath, and carried through temperatures varying from 4®
to 293%. Its upsetting angle was 96%. The results are in the diagram marked F.
In another set of experiments, results were obtained about 0? and 609, and are added,
being marked G, The whole forms a very consistent series of observations, showing
progressive loss of power with elevation of temperature, the diminution being much
greater at low than at high degrees; and, on the whole, very great for the range of
temperature employed. The loss of power about 0* and 32, is four times as much
as it is at 280* for an equal number of degrees. The whole power at 300? is 135 ;
