This demonstrates, that the' secondary notes do not depend
upon any interference of the vibrations of the air with each
other, nor upon any sympathetic agitation of auditory fibres,
nor upon any effect of reflected sound upon the chord, but
merely upon its initial figure and motion. If it were supposed
that the chord, when inflected into right lines, resolved itself
necessarily into a number of secondary vibrations, according to
some curves which, when properly combined, would approxi-
mate to the figure given, the supposition would indeed in some
respects correspond with the phaznomenon related; as the coef-
ficients of all the curves supposed to end at the angle of inflec-
tion would vanish. But, whether we trace the constituent curves
of such a figure through the various stages of their vibrations,
or whether we follow the more compendious method of EULER

'S to the same purpose, the figures resulting from this series of
2 vibrations are in fact s0 simple, that it seems inconceivable how
B the ear should deduce the complicated idea of a number of
BH heterogeneous vibrations, from a motion of the particles of air
z which must be extremely regular, and almost uniform ; an uni-
3 formity which, when proper precautions are taken, is'not con-
S tradicted by examining the motion of the chord with the assist-
E ance of a powerful magnifier. This difficulty occurred very
Ez strongly to EuLER ; and DE LA GRANGE even suspects some
a fallacy in the experiment, and that a musical ear judges from

previous association. But, besides that these squnds are disco-
verable to an ear destitute of such associations, and, when the
sound is produced by two strings in imperfect unison, may be
verified by counting the number of their beats, the experi-
ment already related is an undeniable proof that no fallacy

of this kind exists.
