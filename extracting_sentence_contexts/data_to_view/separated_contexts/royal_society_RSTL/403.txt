Read April 1g, 1815. Drzixs the interval of 21 years, since the Society did me
the honour to receive my Observations on the Current to the
Westward of Scilly, more facts relating to that current, have
been collected; as well as observations on its effects, in dif-
ferent parts of its course, between Cape Finisterre and Scilly:
the whole tending to a confirmation of the general system set
forth, in 179g; and, in one instance, affording, perhaps, a
clearer proof of the strength of the stream, in respect of its
northerly direction, than any of those, adduced on the former
occasion. In pursuing the detail of these facts and observations, I
shall begin, in the neighbourhood of Cape Finisterre, and pro-
ceed with the course of the current, along the Bay of Biscay ;
and thence, across the mouth of the British Channel, to Scilly,
and the entrance of St. George's Channel. The three first facts, regard the current from the open ea,
setting into the south side of the Bay of Biscay, and along the
north coast of Spain ; which current has been supposed, in
the former Paper, to be occasioned by the prevalent westerly
winds ; which force the water near the shore, into the Bay,
and along the southern coast of it.
