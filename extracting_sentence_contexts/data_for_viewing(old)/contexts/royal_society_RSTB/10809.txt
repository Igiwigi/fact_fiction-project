where « is the ‘target rate’ to which the moving average of the
postsynaptic firing rate should converge. Second, 7, cannot
be ‘too large’ compared with 1, because otherwise oscillations
or runaway activity occur [17,26,88]. In fact, the ratio 7/7
determines the stability of the model.

Oscillations and instabilities are generic to many non-
linear systems and not limited to the above models. Control
theory enables theoreticians to identify parameter ranges
that lead to stable behaviour and avoid instabilities
[25,84,89]. The control theoretic analysis of several plasticity
models relying on moving averages of the postsynaptic
firing rate shows that the response timescale of the compen-
satory processes is constrained from above [17,26,88,90].
In other words, the response time of the firing rate control
has to be ‘relatively fast’ compared with Hebbian plasticity.
