other inverse spectral questions in semiclassical analysis (see, for instance, [210-212]) which
concern integrable systems (or even collections of commuting operators) more general than
semitoric, and even in higher dimensions. All of them essentially make the same general claim:
‘from the semiclassical joint spectrum of a quantum integrable system one can detect the principal
symbols of the system’. A more concrete problem is

Problem 7.8 (A. Pelayo). What information about the principal symbols f,,.. .,f. of a quantum
integrable system T1;,...,T;,, can be detected from their semiclassical joint spectrum? For
instance, suppose that we know that a certain object—say, an integer z, or a matrix A—is a
symplectic invariant of (M,o,f1,...,fn). Can we compute this object from the semiclassical joint
spectrum?

An additional interesting problem, which is in fact closely related to question 2.5 is as follows.

Problem 7.9 (A. Pelayo). Can one detect from the joint spectrum of a quantum integrable
system Tj 7,...,T;,y that a singularity is degenerate?


The theory of semitoric systems provides a strong motivation for understanding the
connections between integrable systems and Hamiltonian torus actions. In view of this, we
conclude by discussing a possible quantum approach to counting fixed points of symplectic
S!-actions.

In view of Tolman’s recent work [213] constructing a non-Hamiltonian symplectic S'-action on
a compact manifold with isolated fixed points, the questions how many fixed points symplectic
