The diameters of M and m in a horizontal direction parallel to a radius of the
turntable measured by square callipers were

Temperature Correction.—Though the expansion of the masses was to be expected
of an unimportant amount, I thought it advisable to attempt to measure it, in case
there might be anything anomalous. One of the attracted spheres, B, was for this
purpose placed between two vertical levers, in a tank through which could be run a
continuous stream of cold or warm water. These levers depended from horizontal
rods which could rock or slightly rotate on fine point suspensions. This was, in fact,
akind of double Lavoisier and Laplace apparatus. The motion of each lever was
shown by another lever of about the same length, rising vertically up from each
horizontal axis, and serving as the moving support for a double suspension mirror
in which was viewed the reflection of a millimetre scale. Two telescopes and one scale
were used for the two mirrors, though it would not have been difficult to arrange
one telescope and two scales. The value of one scale division was determined by
inserting a piece of thin glass between the sphere and each lever inturn. The method
is exceedingly sensitive, but I have not been able to make it exact, owing to the
warping produced in the rods due to unequal temperatures.

The measures of the expansion varied between ‘0000214 and ‘0000277, both vertical
__. and horizontal diameters (in the position in the balance) being tested. The true value
