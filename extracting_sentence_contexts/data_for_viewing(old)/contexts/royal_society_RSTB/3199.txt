of these migrating cells (figs. 7, 9, 15 and 36).

2. The layer which is formed is very unlike an epithelium such as is found among
the higher vertebrata. It is sharply marked off from the sub-lying tissues at first,
but afterwards becomes continuous with it (fig. 38). It is clearly not an attenuation
of an ordinary epithelium.

3. The destruction of the epithelium is so violent and rapid that it seems improbable
that it should stop short while the active cause of the destruction is still in existence.

4, In the later stages this layer is being continually added to by the budding-off
from the trophoblast of the same elements—the binucleate trophoblast cells—up to
the time of birth. This last fact, which to my mind forms a very powerful argument
in favour of the view I take, I shall demonstrate later on.

The 25th Day of Pregnancy.
Dimensions: Length of the embryo, 15 millims. ; length of the two blastocysts,
joined together, 500 millims.
Each horn of the uterus is now completely filled by a blastocyst.
The general shape of the blastocyst is irregular, though rather less folded and
crumpled than in the previous stage. The commencing villous patches are visible
in the regions nearest the embryos, but less obvious towards the extremities.
