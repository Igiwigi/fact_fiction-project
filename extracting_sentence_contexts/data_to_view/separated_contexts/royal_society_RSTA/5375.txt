show that for a range of temperature
from 14°+4 to 0° our cell and Lord Rayteran’s cell No, 1 have the same E.M.F.

When the cell was put into the warm water on August 17 readings were taken of
the E.M.F. and temperature. About half-an-hour after being put into the bath the E.M.F. was 45 units below
the standard, the temperature was 31°, that of the standard 17°3. The readings
remained steady at this for five minutes,

This would correspond to an increase of only about 3°3 units per 1° C. instead of
43, and again emphasizes the fact that the E.M.F. of the cell is not a fixed quantity
at a given temperature unless the temperature has remained steady for some time
previously,

Most of our cells were compared with the standard at various temperatures
between 9° and 18°. The observations show that all the cells except those known to
be unsaturated have the same coefficient, and the average value of that coefficient
between 0° and 15° is 00076. Our experiments do not show whether the relation
between E,M.F. and temperature is linear or not.
