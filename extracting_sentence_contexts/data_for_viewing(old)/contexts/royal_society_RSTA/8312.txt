tudinal waves = 5-5 km. per second and 1 = 4b = 20 metres, and substituting in
equation (33), we find that the wall will execute 22 vibrations per second in the gravest
mode.

A seismograph of the Omori type was suspended from one of the walls of the Tower
in the Colaba Observatory, which is a stone structure of cylindrical shape, rising to a
height of about 40 feet above the ground. The instrument was allowed to work for
about 2 years, during which the records were almost always disturbed by small vibrations,
having periods practically equal to the free periods of the pendulum, which varied, from
time to time, between 20 to 30 seconds. This indicates that the quakes in the walls,
caused by the gusts of wind or other causes, were continually subjecting the pendulum
to execute small free oscillations of its own. It never recorded the free oscillations of
the Tower ; in fact, they were so quick that it could not. Theoretically, the free periods*
of vibrations of a cylinder of radius a, length 21 and thickness 2h, which is vibrating by
pure bending, are given by
