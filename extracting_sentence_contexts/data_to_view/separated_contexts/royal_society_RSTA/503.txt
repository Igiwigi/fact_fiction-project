However, according
to Vranjes & Kono [117], this result might be due to the assumption of neglecting the exchange
of momentum between ions and neutrals. However, one must be really careful with all these
results since the ionâ€”-neutral collision frequency has been calculated in a very simplified manner
and a proper treatment of the collision between ions and neutrals may provide different results
(see below). In fact, even in semi-empirical models, using different methods to calculate the ion-
neutral collision frequency provide very different values for the damping and ambipolar diffusion
terms [106]. Ambipolar diffusion allows magnetic field to diffuse into the atmosphere [118-120]. Since
neutrals move through the expanding magnetic field in the chromosphere, the magnetic field : =
lines lift less matter.
