of X* there exists a neighbourhood W of X* such that for all initial conditions X, ¢ W the
corresponding orbit X(t) € V for all t > to. Ina similar way, one defines negatively Lyapunov
stable for all f < fg and one says simply Lyapunov stable if the condition holds for all time.

For a Hamiltonian system M =2N, X = (q1,.--,4n/P1,--- Pn)",

F(X) =JVxH(X) and A(X*) =] 5(X*),

where Vx = (0q,,--«, Oqn, Opis + +7 apy), J is the usual co-symplectic matrix J = (So): and S(X*)
is the Hessian of H evaluated at the equilibrium X*. As a consequence, we can take advantage of
computing the eigenvalues of S—which by nature is always diagonalizable—to infer Lyapunov
stability and in some cases also linear stability, when JS has a special structure, as we shall
see shortly. For Lyapunov stability, given the fact that the Hamiltonian of the vortex system
is a conserved quantity, Dirichlet’s Theorem provides us with a sufficient criterion to deduce
Lyapunov stability from the definiteness of the Hessian matrix S:

Theorem 5.2 (Dirichlet). Let X* be an equilibrium of the autonomous system of ordinary differential
equations equation (5.1) that is, F(X*) =0. If there exists a positive (or negative) definite integral W of the
system (5.1) in a neighbourhood of the equilibrium X*, then X* is Lyapunov stable.

For autonomous Hamiltonian systems, the Hamiltonian is itself an integral of motion and,
therefore, it follows from the theorem above that if all eigenvalues of S(X*) have the same sign
the Hamiltonian is definite in a neighbourhood of X*, and therefore X* is Lyapunov stable.

Remark. Observe that even if in our case we have a relative equilibrium, equation (4.1), we can
