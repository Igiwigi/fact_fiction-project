Human communication is inferential [26]. Speaker and listener try to come to a shared understand-
ing of a situation, but not all meaning involved is
explicitly expressed. In fact, most of it has to be inferred
from the context, common sense knowledge and back-
ground information. For example, the sentence ‘I want
to come’ does not explicitly express that the action of
coming may take place in the future, but we can infer
this, because the speaker expresses a desire to carry out
the action, which implies that if it happens, it will be in
the future.
