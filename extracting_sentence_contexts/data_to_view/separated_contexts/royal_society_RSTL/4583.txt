Of the different irons tried in the preceding experiments on pillars, whether solid or
hollow, the external part of the casting was always harder than that near to the centre,
and the iron of the external ring of a hollow casting was very hard, the hardness
increasing with the thinness. Thus, in solid pillars 24 inches diameter of Low Moor
iron, No. 2, the crushing force per square inch of the central part was 29:65 tons, and
that of the intermediate part near to the surface was 34:59 tons, whilst the external

"ring, & inch thick, of a hollow cylinder 4 inches diameter, of which the outer crust had

been removed, was crushed with 39:06 tons per square inch ; and external rings of the
same iron thinner than half an inch, required from 49:2 to 51-78 tons per s8quare inch
to crush them. These facts show the great superiority of hollow pillars over solid ones
of the same weight and length. Tape VIIL. (continued). —Casting of larger dimensions than before used. To ascertain whether the internal strength of larger pillars varied in the 8ame manner
as that of smaller ones, a cylindrical casting was made 5 inches diameter and 15 inches
long.
