The inelastic scattering beamline is designed for a 17m radius :&

spectrometer arm and as such is housed in an external building. First users of this beamline are
eagerly anticipated in spring 2017. Finally, and as a complete contrast to the other beamlines, a versatile soft X-ray beamline,
VERSOX, is being built on a bending magnet source to take advantage of the fact that it is now
possible to perform XPS in non-UHV conditions. This beamline will allow experiments to be :
carried out on wet surfaces and will be of interest to researchers studying ice crystals in climate =
studies, to catalyst chemists and for studies of corrosion. Eventually, this beamline will develop a 3
strong industrial portfolio because more realistic surfaces can be studied.
