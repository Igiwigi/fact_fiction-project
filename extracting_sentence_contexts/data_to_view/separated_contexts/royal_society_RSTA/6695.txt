If R is numerically less than Tah By? B, will increase with depth due to scattering by particles suspended in the column of water
above the sea-bed. . Submerged rocks may in fact appear lighter in tone on vertical air photographs as their
depth increases. The brightness profiles shown in figure 4 demonstrate the same effect;
they were constructed from a photograph of black and white objects submerged at known
depths in a water tank, and it will be noted that both profiles have the same B,, value and
both give the same extinction coefficient for the water. Brightness profiles of dark surfaces have a relatively low (B)â€”B.,)/B., ratio and a relatively
low sensitivity to changes in depth.
