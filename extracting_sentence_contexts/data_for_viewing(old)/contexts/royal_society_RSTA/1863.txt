This review assesses the current state of knowledge

Accepted: 2 June 2020 of how the elements were produced in the Big Bang,
in stellar lives and deaths, and by interactions in
One contribution of 11 to a theme issue interstellar gas. We begin with statements of fact

and discuss the evidence that convinced astronomers
that the Sun is fusing hydrogen, that low-mass stars
produce heavy elements through neutron capture,

Subject Areas: .

that supernovae of all types produce new elements.
