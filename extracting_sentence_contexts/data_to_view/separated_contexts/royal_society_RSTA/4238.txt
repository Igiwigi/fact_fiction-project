If one sets up a molecular
dynamics simulation (with very general classes of atomic forces) for the atoms in y(Q’) but
determines the image atoms using the group H, just as above, so only the atoms in y(’) are
actually simulated, but forces on these from all the other atoms are accounted for, then it follows

that all the atoms satisfy exactly the equations of molecular dynamics. This is a special case of : &
the method of objective molecular dynamics (OMD [39,40]). In fact, a certain time dependence Dos
of the group parameter cj, can be introduced [39], which leads to exact molecular dynamics for : =
every atom, but which also includes a macroscopic motion. For the case shown in figure 6, this : yy
method could be used to study stress-induced transformation due to pulling the helix vertically 2
at a constant (assignable) axial strain rate. We note that this analogue between continuum-level : S
free-energy minimizers and exact solutions of the equations of molecular dynamics is sufficiently 22
flexible to allow for phenomena such as surface relaxation in either the continuum or atomistic a]
theory.
