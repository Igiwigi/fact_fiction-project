Acetone, C, Hy O,, isomeric with the former, boils at 56*
(Lizp16, Duwas, Kory). In cases like the last, the determination of the boiling-point of a compound, together
with an examination of the substances with which the compound 1s serially allied in
boiling-point, may be of great assistance in fixing its character, the type to which it
belongs, and the series of homologous bodies of which it is a term. The examples just
quoted of the fact that isomeric 8ubstances of different series possess different boiling-
points, may here again serve as illustrations. 'The boiling-point of the s0-called eugenic
acid (BRiNING, 248%; WiLLIAMs, 251*) shows that this substance, although represented
by the formula C,, H,, O,, cannot possibly be homologous to benzoic acid, C,, Hz O, (boil-
ing-point observed by Kore, 250?; calculated, Table VI., 253®), This result might be
inferred with the greatest probability from the boiling-point of the two substances, even
if cuminic acid, isomeric with eugenic acid, and the homologue of benzoic acid, were not
known. On the other hand, when the boiling-points of engenic acid and of hydride of
salicyl, C,, HO, (boiling-point 1969, P1R14), are considered, it becomes extremely probable
that these two bodies are homologous. ('To the difference in composition, C;H;=3C,H,,
corresponds in this case the difference in boiling-points 250—196=54=3 x 187.)

'The boiling-points of polymeric compounds are also different, and may serve to deter-
mine the formula representing a substance. Among the isomeric compounds, in the narrower sense of the word, acids and ethers
(of the common formula C, H, O,, for example), or alcohols and ethers (of the common
formula C, H,.., O,, e. g.), exhibit in all their bearings an esentially different character.
