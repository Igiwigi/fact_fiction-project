However, as is the case with heuristic optimization algorithms, the convergence
might not be guaranteed in all cases. In the original paper [35], it is proven that ADAM converges
to the global minimum in the convex settings. In spite of the fact that some errors in the original
convergence analysis have been spotted afterwards by Bock et al. [36], they managed to prove that
the algorithm converges.

5. Experimental evaluation on the solid-oxide fuel cell system

The dataset D, thoroughly discussed in [24], consists of over 100 signals acquired through
the installed instrumentation. For instance, the gas composition is measured at five different
locations, at the stack inlets and outlets, in the BoP before and after the fuel reforming, etc.
