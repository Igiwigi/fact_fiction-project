This interpretation as an effective dimension ultimately justifies the name ‘IPR’ as an analogous
quantity to the inverse of )°, Iw(x)|* for single-particle wave functions. Just like in the single-
particle case, the IPR could be energy dependent (or even yy dependent) and we always choose y
in the middle of the spectrum.

In the scenario a > ./1/2 discussed above, we expect that IPRo(w) increases by a factor of 2 for
each spin that is coupled to the Griffiths region (at least if O itself is in the Griffiths region). This
is indeed confirmed almost perfectly by the numerics (figure 7) for the case a = } > JT/2.

5. Critiques

Finally, let us comment on weaknesses of the above arguments. Regardless of the form in which
the ‘bootstrap’ argument is phrased, it inevitably relies on the fact that thermalized regions exhibit
some chaotic behaviour towards the distant LIOMs that are coupled to it. In the present §4, this
was apparent in the fact that matrix elements were computed by a random matrix ansatz. One
can certainly imagine scenarios in which the coupling of the first LIOMs would ‘kill’ the bath,
so that it would become unable to thermalize more LIOMs. Such scenarios go under the name
‘proximity effects’ (see [32,33], also explored in [34]). The easiest way for this to happen is if
the system localizes in the basis of the bath-LIOM coupling Hes-loc- However, this requires that
Hef-1oc dominates the term Hcg. For a realistic model of a Griffiths region, this is not the case, but
it can definitely happen in toy models. For example, this will occur if the parameter a introduced
above is taken too close to 1 without reducing Jo, because ||HGf-loc|| « Jo/(1 — «) (by summing a
geometric series).
