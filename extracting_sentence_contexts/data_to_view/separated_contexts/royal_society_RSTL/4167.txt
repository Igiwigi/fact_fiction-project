MR, BRODIE ON CEROTIC ACID. 155

A question 8uggests itself, If it be true that this acid is volatile, and it be also true
that it exists in the wax in an uncombined state, how has it happened that it has
never been discovered among the products of the distillation of wax which have been
80 often examined ? In truth, it is a remarkable fact, that while this acid, when heated in a nearly pure
state, as separated from the lead salt, distils over nearly unaltered, the same substance,
when distilled in an impure state, as separated, namely, by alcohol from the wax,
and mixed, as in this case, with other wax matter, which is decomposed by heat,
itself suffers decomposition. In the course of this investigation other examples have
occurred to me of similar facts. About 3 0z.
