He points out,{ that since many nyctitropic leaves

‘osed their stomata at night, the supposed increase of transpiration cannot take

ace during the night itself, but rather in the early morning. His view is that

“‘Byctitropism is especially an adaptation against dew. It was shown in the Power

Bf Movement that leaves fixed horizontally are found in the morning covered with
dew,§ while similar leaves, which had been allowed to sleep, were comparatively dry.

‘Phe fact was only used as an argument to prove the chilling of the horizontally

iixed leaves. Stan, however, finds in it the actual danger which the sleeping plant
avoids. He supposes that in the early morning the dew-covered leaves transpire

Sut slightly, while those which have been kept relatively dry by nyctitropism,

Branspire normally.
