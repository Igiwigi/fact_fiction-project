The first experiments were made with the apparatus shown in fig. 6, and were
pushed to very high temperatures. In fact, THE MAXIMUM CURRENT FROM THE
FILAMENT T0 THE ALUMINIUM ELECTRODE REACHED THE ENORMOUS VALUE OF
1°5 AMPERE PER SQUARE CENTIMETRE OF CARBON SURFACE. ‘These experiments were
made with a lamp which possessed a small air leak that had been stopped by
embedding in paraffin in the manner already described. When the greatest currents
were put on the lamp became hot so that the paraffin melted and the pressure inside
the apparatus rose to 1 millim.
