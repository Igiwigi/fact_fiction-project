Hence, the nuclear
components are also single-valued, and the single-valuedness of the Gaussian basis functions
does not pose any problem (in opposition to the adiabatic case). A method that is similar in spirit
was proposed by Meek & Levine [32], where the electronic states are Diabatized Gaussians on
Adiabatic Surfaces (DGAS), shares numerous features with MCA. The difference resides in the
fact that MCA employs crude adiabatic states that are rigorously diabatic, while DGAS employs
quasi-diabatic states. Using MCA states was found to properly account for GP effects in low
energy dynamics in adiabatic representation [44], where the extra GP-induced interference causes
appearance of a nodal plane in the adiabatic nuclear wavepackets [18,44]. On the contrary, the
MCA states were not yet tested in the regime of non-adiabatic transitions, where GP participates
in enhancing interstate population transfer in the adiabatic representation.
