At a” are fragments of two other contiguous
X 8porangia. Throughout the greater part of its extent the sporangium wall, a, exhibits
| the appearance of fig. 84, but here and there its flexures have caused it to be intersected
*S obliquely, as at a”, where it resembles fig. 83. Two of the macrospores are intersected
+8 nearly through their centres, the third one more tangentially, hence its apparent smaller
Z 81ze, The specimen from which this and other similar sections were prepared not only
Z places the vegetable nature of these Traquarie beyond the possibility of doubt, as
S well as demonstrates the fact that they are Lycopodiaceous in character, but from the
3 excellent preservation of the macrospores, throws further light upon their structure.
= That the specimens with tuberculated but unbranched spines (represented by figs.
= 40, 41, and 42, of the earlier portion of this memoir) are immature, whilst those repre-
F 8ented by figs. 45 and 46 are more matured examples, is now clear. I think there is
& no doubt but that in the young state there was a distincb outer exosporium and an
28 inner endosporium. At an early period the exosporium became differentiated into
& two layers.
