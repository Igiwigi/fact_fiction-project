Since we know (e.g. DrMeEREC, 1928) that reverse mutations of this type do sometimes occur with very
high frequency, it might be reasonable to suppose that the dextrals in EK broods were
attributable to the same cause or to an anomaly involving direct segregation within
a brood. This is in fact not the case: E broods are sinistral broods containing pheno-
typic dextrals, and they represent not a breakdown, but a modification of the system. Between the three types of anomaly there is this common bond, that dextrals, some
genotypic, some phenotypic, tend to appear where sinistrals would be expected.
