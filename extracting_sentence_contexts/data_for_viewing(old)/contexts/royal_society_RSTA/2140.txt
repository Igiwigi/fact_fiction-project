the enrichments in fluid-mobile elements (K, Rb) indicate low-temperature alteration. These
characteristics point to magma genesis from a locally enriched mantle source such as is abundant
in Pacific Plate seamount provinces, but absent in the Mariana forearc [57,58]. The paragenesis
of metamorphosed rocks of Pacific Plate origin collected from IODP Expedition 366 cores spans
the gamut of metamorphic facies from zeolite [43], to greenschist [59], to blueschist [40,50,60]
(figure 6).

(b) Limestone compositions

Limestone breccia and cherty-limestone fragments were also recovered from the IODP Expedition
366 cores [53]. Cores from Yinazao Seamount recovered the first pieces of reef material (figure 7)
from a subducted Pacific Plate seamount from one of the forearc serpentinite mud volcanoes.
The reefal cobbles recovered from Core U1491C-2H-CC-1-7 cm are, in fact, the first pieces of reef
material ever collected from a subducted plate seamount in the world (figures 1 and 5a,b). The
cobble analysed in detail is a Miogypsina rudstone with larger lithoclasts and coralline, red-algal
grainstone matrix. The matrix includes echinoderm, bryozoan and decapod fragments, small
benthic and a few planktonic foraminifera. The lithoclasts consist of packstone with large bioclasts
such as a Halimeda plate or a Porites fragment. The latter is encrusted by a sessile foraminifer and
