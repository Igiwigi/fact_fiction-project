58 SIR B. C. BRODIE ON THE CALCULUS OF CHEMICAL OPERATIONS.

with hypothesis «, but which are not discordant with hypothesis a*. In the former case
the units of matter cannot be expressed by an integral number of prime factors, either
on hypothesis «. or on hypothesis a*; in the second case the units of matter can be
expressed by an integral number of prime factors on hypothesis a?, but cannot. be 80
expressed on hypothesis «. 'The question has been (up to a certain point) discussed in
Part T. Section VIII., where a Table is given of these exceptions {Part I. Sec-
tion VIII. (3)].

I shall not enter on the former class of exceptions, not only for the reason that the
difficulties presented by them are not peculiar to this method, but also that these
obstacles are rapidly being removed by a careful scrutiny of the facts, and 80 many 8uch
obstacles have actually disappeared that the removal of the rest must be regarded simply
as a question of time and trouble. The second class of exceptions, however, stands on
a very different footing. They go to the very root of the matter, and no rational expla-
nation of these exceptions has (8 far as I am aware) been ever suggested from the
present point of view of chemistry. We will fix our attention on two salient examples,
the binoxide and tetroxide of nitrogen.

As8uming the gaseous densities of these substances as given by various observers to
be the true densities of homogeneous gases, it must be admitted that the ponderable
matter of two units of binoxide of nitrogen is identical with the ponderable matter of
a unit, of nitrogen and a unit of oxygen; and also it must be admitted that the ponder-
able matter of two units of tetroxide of nitrogen 1s identical with the ponderable matter
