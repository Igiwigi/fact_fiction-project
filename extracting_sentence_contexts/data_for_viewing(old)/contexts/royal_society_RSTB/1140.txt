“ Minimal” Stimulation.—In the first Cat (375) the “minimal” stimulation in the
lumbar region of the lateral and posterior columns on the side of the section evoked
no appreciable effect in the dorsal region, the negative result thus confirming our
previous conclusion, that the direct fibres in these columns are completely confined
to one side of the cord. This, it may be pointed out, is strictly in accordance with
the present state of minute anatomical knowledge, as obtained by the study of the
degeneration and developmental histological changes.

Average of Effects with Maximal Stimulation.—With the maximal stimulus, no effect
was evoked by the stimulation of the lateral column on the side of the interruption.
This contrasts with the fact that when the nerve impulses are propagated down the
cord, as in the previously described experiments, such stimulation evoked appreciable
effects.

The remaining columns gave average effects of

44 for the posterior column on the side of the section,
110 ~,, ~— lateral a " opposite to the section,
87 ,, posterior on the opposite side.

The posterior column thus contains indirect fibres which come into relation with
cells, but through these with fibres in the column on the opposite side of the cord, and
this connection is such, that apparently .it offers less resistance to the passage of
