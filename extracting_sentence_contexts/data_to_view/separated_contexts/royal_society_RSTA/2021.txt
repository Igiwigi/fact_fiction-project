Indeed, from equation (3.12), it follows that the memory function Â¢ 4(f) describes the mass flux
on the wall of the fracture when the concentration on it is equal to 1. Function y(t) defines
the relative deviation of the mass flux on the wall of the fracture from its steady-state value. It
is obvious that the delta-like behaviour of this function (property 3 in appendix A (d)), which
can be observed in formula (3.16), occurs due to the fact that in the initial moment of time, the
deviation from the steady state can be substantial, but with time it reduces and approaches zero. Moreover, for values of y close to 1, the deviation of the flux on the wall of the fracture, where
concentration is equal to unity, occurs only in a very small vicinity of the point t=0. This in turn
will result in major dependence of the mass flux from the fracture into the matrix on the value of
concentration in the fracture and the rate of its temporal variation at the given moment of time,
which is represented by expression (3.17).
