Z—> e+€~ or Wt > (#4). For larger Higgs masses around 160GeV, the most : 8

sensitive channel turned out to be Higgs production via gluon fusion (a quantum-loop-induced
process), with the Higgs boson decaying to a pair of W bosons, which in turn decay leptonically,

challenge is still huge. For example, in a sample of 1 fb~! of accumulated data before any further
event selection, the fraction of ZH > e+ €-bb events compared with everything else is 5 in 10/4! Therefore, efforts were focused on maximizing the signal acceptance and efficiency, in order not to
lose any signal event.
