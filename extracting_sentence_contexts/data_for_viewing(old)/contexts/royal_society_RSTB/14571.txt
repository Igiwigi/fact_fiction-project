In a nutshell, our conceptual analyses focused on the learning for group classification (e.g. autistic and non-autistic)
importance of studying interpersonal (mis)attunement in and feature selection (i.e. selection of crucial parameters for dis-
social interactions, describing second-person neuroscience and tinguishing between groups). Additionally, this step makes it
collective psychophysiology as a most promising methodology also possible to adopt an unsupervised scheme, i.e. learning
to this end. In the next section, we introduce the paradigm directly based on unlabelled information, allowing for a data-
of inter-personalized psychiatry, which will aim at the clinical driven identification of statistically meaningful sub-groups

and scientific assessment, monitoring and treatment of not without relying on a priori categorical assumptions.
