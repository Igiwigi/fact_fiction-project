with regard to 1Millepora have received only partial acceptation ; they have been uni-
versally adopted in America and Germany. CLaus and others have placed Millepora
with Hydroids in their zoological systems. M. M.-Epwarps, howeverf, did not accept, at
all events in 1860, Prof. AGass1z's resnlts, and more recently Prof. ALLMax has

i expressed his uncertainty in the matter on the ground of our ignorance of the genera-
S tive system of the Milleporidef|, and awaits the result of further researches. Although,
© most unfortunately, no evidence as to the structure of the generative system of Nille-
Z pora was obtained by the present investigations, the results obtained yield, nevertheless,
S I think, convincing proofs that this interesting form of coral is a true Hydroid. The
5 peculiar structure of the hydrophyton, the forms of the zooids, the absence of all trace
P of mesenteries, the apparent septa present in the tentacles, the presence of the thread-
>h cells of the form peculiar to Hydrozoa, and in fact every item of histological structure
E point irresistibly to the same conelusion. Professor AGa8s1z considered the Millepores
S to be allied to the Hydractiniz, and CLavs remarks on their resemblance in some points
E to the Corynide. Both Hydractinia and Podocoryne resemble Millepora in having a

2 hydrophyton which forms a continuous encrusting layer ; and in essential structure the

15 hydrophyton of these two genera seems closely to resemble that of Millepora. The
'Z genus Podocoryne (Sars) has a © hydrophyton consisting of a continuous adherent expan-
= sion formed by adnate inosculating canals, the deeper part, with its component canals,

| Z invested by a chitinous perisarc, while a layer of naked ccenoxarc 8preads over the free
< surface” h. In Millepora the canals are not adnate, being separated by the stout trabe-
