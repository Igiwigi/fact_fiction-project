SB. Spinal Cord.

Under this heading we will group the phenomena associated with the functional
activity of the system of bulbo-spinal centres, 7.¢., those in which the efferent paths
terminate. It may not be superfluous to add that the information furnished by the
graphic method does not differentiate the complex structure of a bulbo-spinal centre,
and that it can only yield a record of the combined action of mainly afferent and
mainly efferent corpuscles in the posterior and anterior divisions of the grey matter.
All methods of observation hitherto employed involve the activity of the whole
apparatus, and this must be borne in mind in considering the following facts.

* The tracing waves indicating the contractions are frequently summated. (Horstry.)
Quite recently the value of these waves as indications of rhythmical nerve discharges has been con-
tested. (Wepenski, Haycrarv.)
