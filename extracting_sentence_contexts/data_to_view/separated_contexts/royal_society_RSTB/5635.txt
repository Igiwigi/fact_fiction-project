In the portions which were treated with
. yeast, zero polarimeter readings were obtained after the yeast treatment, while the
results of the copper reduction tests were negligible, as shown in the table. It appears,
therefore, that the higher results by the SHarrer and HarrmMann method must
have been due to optically inactive reducing compounds, which are formed from the
glucose during the sterilization of the alkaline medium. This follows from the fact that
while the glucose used in the experiment was a pure sample giving concordant analytical

figures by both the polarimeter and the Suarrer and HarrmMann methods, the analysis
of the solution after sterilization and before inoculation was :—

Glucose— Per cent.

(2) By SHarrer and HarrMann .. 5 We bis i: 5-28

The results on the whole indicate that, provided that there are no interfering optically
active bodies except glucose, either method will give satisfactory results.
