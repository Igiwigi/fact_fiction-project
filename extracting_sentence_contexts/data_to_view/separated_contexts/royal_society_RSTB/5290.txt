This is supported by
regeneration experiments on the frog by Morean and Davis (1903), where it was found
that the tail was re-formed only when the notochordal cells began growing into the
papilla, and if part of the notochord was removed no outgrowth occurred until the
notochord had reached the cut surface. CoNnKLIN suggested (1905-6) that the advancing
tip of the notochord possesses an organising influence, and later that it may be identical
with the “ organiser’ of SPEMANN in the amphibia. This is supported somewhat by
SpreMAnn’s conclusion that the “ organiser ’’ is situated below the ectoderm, i.e., in
the meso-endoderm of the dorsal lip, and by the fact that the development of both
the ascidia and amphibia follows the same plan, even to the extent that the eggs of
both possess a mitochondrial crescent, which later forms tail mesoderm. Probably,
however, the notochord possesses a mechanical influence alone, in stretching the muscle
cells and stimulating the cells of the ectoderm to divide, for the amphibian “ organiser ”’
has a much more subtle influence, which is definitely non-mechanical (experiments by
SpeMANN, Bracuert and GEINitz). ConkLIN states that the interdigitation of notochord cells is not dependent on their
being crowded together from right and left sides, since it occurs normally when cells
of one side only are present, i.e., in lateral half-embryos.
