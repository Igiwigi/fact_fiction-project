For
radiation experiments it may be made more sensitive than the thermopile (cf. LANGLEY’s
Bolometer) ; owing to its great sensitiveness, it may be used to measure rapidly varying
temperature without inaccuracy ; this is often desirable, as in calorimetry by method
of cooling. There is, in fact, hardly any experimental investigation in which the
measurement of temperature is necessary, which may not be more accurately and
simply effected by means of a suitable platinum wire thermometer.

[The results of the investigation considered as a research on the resistance-
variation of metals tend to prove the existence of minute irregularities which

cannot be well represented in an empirical formula, The simple parabolic formula
(p), R/Ry = 1 + at + Be, corresponds exactly with (d) (p. 163), namely
t — pt = 8{(t/100)? — (t/100)},
where § = 10,0008/(a + 1008), and gives an accuracy of the 1°/, order through a range
of 600° C. Other formule may readily be found which give nearer approximations in
special cases, and through small ranges. For instance, the exponential formula
log R=at/(1 + At) corresponds to the dotted line, Plate 13, fig. 11, and exactly smooths
out the characteristic inequalities in the platinum-iron comparison-curve, agreeing
_With it far more closely than the parabola ; but in most other cases the exponential
formula has the disadvantage.
