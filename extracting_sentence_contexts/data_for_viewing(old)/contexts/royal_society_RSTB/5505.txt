It is to be noticed that the nasal capsule has as yet neither lamina transversalis anterior
nor lamina transversalis posterior, to which eventually the front and hind ends, respect-
tively, of the paraseptal cartilages will become attached.

A point of small importance which the specimen illustrated in fig. 23 shows, is that
the hind end of each ala hypochiasmatica has become attached to the central stem,

thus enclosing a small foramen, which, as a matter of fact, is devoid of significance.
This posterior attachment of the ala hypochiasmatica usually forms at a later stage.

It is in the splanchnocranium that the most interesting features of the stage under
consideration here are to be found. Two new paired elements have appeared in the
hyoid arch, ‘The ceratohyal cartilages are small structures on each side of the basihyal,
and they are destined to give rise to the anterior (or small) horns of the hyoid. Dorsally
in the hyoid arch, a bar of cartilage has appeared above the stylohyal, separated from
the latter by a narrow interval. This small bar is the laterohyal, and both it and the
stylohyal are merely independent chondrifications in the blastema of the hyoid arch,
which will eventually fuse to give rise to RetcuERt’s cartilage, and later form the
styloid process.
