two non-eutropie cases with surprisingly slight alteration of the morphology of the
crystals, the change, in fact, being almost n7/ when rubidium is the alkali metal
replaced by either ammonium or thallium. While no clear rule like that of eutropic
progression can apply as regards ammonium (or thallium), there are still very definite
relationships which have been established as the result of the research now completed,
which can best be stated separately for the various properties. Crystal Angles.â€”The monoclinic axial angle 8 of the ammonium salt of any group
(set of salts containing the same M-metal) is usually very close to that of the caesium
salt of the same group.
