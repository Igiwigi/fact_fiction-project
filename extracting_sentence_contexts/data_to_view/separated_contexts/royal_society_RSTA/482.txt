The comparison already recorded
between 1-(4'-dimethylaminopheny])-2-(1’-naphthyl)ethylene and the corresponding 2’-
naphthyl compound (table 8), is of special interest for the question of 4’-substitution. The
latter compound has no free 4’-position in the strict sense, but it is well known that in
naphthalene compounds the activation of an g-position can be relayed to other atoms in the
adjoining ring. From this point of view it is therefore noteworthy that the 2’-naphthyl
compound does in fact possess slight activity, although this is of course far short of that
exhibited by the 1’-isomeride. So far as concerns the biological activity of halogen derivatives,
a remarkable general similarity was noted between 2’-chloro- and 2’-methyl-4-dimethyl-
aminostilbenes; while the inductive effects of chlorine and methy] substituents are opposed,
it is recognized that the introduction of these groups often confers similar pharmacological
properties, owing no doubt to their comparable volume (cf. Pauling 1946).
