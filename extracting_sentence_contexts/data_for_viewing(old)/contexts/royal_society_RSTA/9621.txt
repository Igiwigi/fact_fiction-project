cracked in two places, one at each edge of the gun-cotton slab, and the portion
covered by the slab is blown out of the plate, sometimes whole and sometimes
shattered into pieces. The fact that no tamping is necessary suggests that the
duration of the process of detonation is of the same order as the time taken by sound
to travel an inch or less in air, so that during the conversion of the cotton into gas
there is not time for much expansion.* If this be so, the maximum pressure

* The velocity of detonation of long trains of gun-cotton has often been measured and is variously
estimated at 18,000 to 20,000 feet per second. If the same velocity obtained in the small primers they
would be completely converted into gas in about 2 x 10~® secs,
