y =0.01 was applied to enable a larger simulation time step. It was required for several particles
to diffuse two-dimensionally in or at the surface of a membrane (particles P1 and P6-P9).
In the iPRD approach, two-dimensional diffusion is achieved by assigning an effective three-
dimensional diffusion constant, D3,, to a particle moving under BD, that when constrained by
an attractive planar potential (see below), results in two-dimensional motion with an effective
diffusion constant, D3p. The value of D3, for Env3 (P6-P9) particles was chosen and tested by
preliminary simulations to yield a value for D3, compatible with experimental observations [48].
For matrix particle P1, no specific measurements were available. Therefore, parameters for D3p
were chosen that resulted in D3, values compatible with general experimental ranges for two-
dimensional membrane protein diffusion [47]. Particles that were always chemically connected
([P1-P2], [P4—P5,P11], [P6-P9]) were assigned matching diffusion constants. As the CS was
always chemically connected until elimination, it was assigned the same value as P1. To emulate
the fact that the immature capsid lattice is effectively locked, capsid-related particles (P4, P5
and P11) were assigned diffusion constants, D3), several orders of magnitude lower than that
for a single capsid particle in three dimensions, while geometry potentials ensured planarity
and spatial confinement (see below). With this choice of diffusion parameters, modulated P10
diffusion still strongly dominates that of other particles involved during the reaction. Thus, it
was not necessary to apply modulation factors to other particles.

Space exclusion was applied to all particle types using a harmonic pairwise repulsive (HR)
potential (PI1) with force constant kyr, centred on the sum of the corresponding pairwise
interaction radii (rj; = Ry; + R1j). The form of the HR potential is given by
