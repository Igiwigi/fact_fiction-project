have confirmed 8uch of my previous observations as required confirmation, from the fact
of their having been at variance with those of Dr. E1xer. I have continued to find that

are concerned, I have failed to detect the slightest evidence of spontaneity on the part
of the contractile zones. T am $till unable to say that the * secondary contractions *”

neither can I modify my previous statements as to the time during which these

secondary movements persist ; for instead of © generally ceasing after a few moments ” 1
or © hours,” they usnally last for several days—in fact until the tisswes begin to
decompose. I am able, however, to agree with Dr. Eter's statement that, other
things equal, the unmutilated tisswes preserve their irritability longer than those
from which lithocysts have been remoyed; and 1 am able to agree with his state-
ment that the rate of the natural rhythm has a tendeney to bear an inverse pro-
portion to the size of the individual, though I find that size is not the only factor
in determining snch rate. But his further statements with regard to the duration
of the natural pauses bearing a direct proportion to the number and strength of the
previous contractions, require, I think, to be taken with reserve; for both in Aurelia
and in Sarsia, although a general relation of this kind may be observed, T have not
found it to be s0 precise as Nr. Emer affirms. Similarly, although it is true that the
smaller segments of a divided Aurelia show a general tendency to contract less frequently
than the larger segments, I have not found evidence of the precise relation which Dr.
