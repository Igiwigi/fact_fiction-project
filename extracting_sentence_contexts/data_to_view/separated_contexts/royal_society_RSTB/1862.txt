We must suppose, in fact, that new threads have been
formed at the expense of the granular substance. Both male and female nuclei are seen in the stage just described to be already
preparing for the first segmentation division. In fact no resting fertilized nucleus is
ever formed. The composite structure seen in fig. 21 is the nearest we ever get to
it. But though the distinction is clearly quite arbitrary, we will, for the sake of
convenience, describe the succeeding stages in which the first segmentation spindle
is definitely beginning to be formed under the head of

Division oF THE FertitizeED NUCLEUS.
