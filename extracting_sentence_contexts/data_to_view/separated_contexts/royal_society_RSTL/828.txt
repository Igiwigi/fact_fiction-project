It is not unusual to obtain
it of a specific gravity so low as 1g; very frequently 15 or 17. In the first experiments, I suspected this lightness to be owing
to some air-bubbles ; but repeated fusion, and comparative ex-
periments upon platina, s0on convinced me of the contrary. The augmentation of weight also, which the platina never fails
of acquiring, proves that this metal has combined with some
ponderable substance ; and, in fact, the result of these operations


of a metallic Substance called Palladium. 305

is, an alloy which is a mean betwixt platina in its pure state and
what has been called palladium. It is, consequently, subject to
infinite variation.
