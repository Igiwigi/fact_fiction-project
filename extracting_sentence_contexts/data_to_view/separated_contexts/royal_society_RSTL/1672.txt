powers* is probably excelled by no refractor existing. Proof
of this will be found in the separation and measurement of
the most minute double stars, such as & and Â» Corona Bore-
alis, in its sharp definition of the double ring of Saturn,
and various other of the most delicate celestial objects. It is

strong piles of wood sunk deep into the earth ; and though
not quite exempt from tremors, is sufficiently so for the per-

measurements.
