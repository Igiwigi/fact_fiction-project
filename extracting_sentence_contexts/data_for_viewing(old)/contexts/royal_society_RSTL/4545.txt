AT THE MOMENT OF CHEMICAL CHANGE. 803

increases with the temperature. By increasing the mass of the oxide or chloride, on
the other hand, the velocity of the chemical action is relatively increased ; in this case
therefore we have a great reduction. Again, a substance in a fine 8tate of division
is decomposed more rapidly than one which is dense and compact ; here, therefore,
and in other similar differences, is the cause of the different results given by different
preparations of the peroxide *.

By the words contact and chemical, I mean to express no theory, and am indeed
drawing but a momentary distinction between facts, for I cannot believe that the
one of these portions of oxygen is formed according to one law and the other in a
different manner, that the one fact is a chemical synthesis and the other not. The
only difference between them I believe to be, that in the case of the action I have
called chemical, the peroxide of harium decomposes peroxide of lead, or oxide of
silver, or the like; and in the contact action one particle of peroxide of barium decom-
poses another particle of the same substance, the platinum, silver oxide or other
body causing that chemical relation between the particles which renders the decom-
position possible. The important question as to the nature of that definite relation
which these experiments indicate between the contact action and the chemical action,
I reserve for future inquiry.

I have made various experiments to ascertain whether the same kind of reduction
could be effected by means of other metallic peroxides, snch, for example, as the per-
oxide of lead or manganese, as with the peroxide of barium and potassium, but with-
