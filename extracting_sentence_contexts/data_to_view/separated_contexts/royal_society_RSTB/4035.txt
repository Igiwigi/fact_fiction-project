308 DR. J. C. WILLIS ON THE ENDEMIC FLORA OF CEYLON. dealing with the endemic flora of Ceylon I have endeavoured to prove that the
endemic species have not been evolved in any kind of advantageous response to local
conditions, and I have ealled attention* to the fact that they are much rarer than the
species of wider distribution that occur alongside of them. But only in the present
year have I completed the laborious task of extracting from the great Flora of Ceylon
by Tren and Hooker the statistics that are required. This Flora is beyond doubt
the most complete yet published for any tropical country, and thanks to 70 years’
work on this comparatively small island (25,000 square miles) by such men as
Garpner, Hooker, Tuwarres, TRiMen, and many more, the local flora is thoroughly
well known, and it is unlikely that further work will do anything more than add
half-a-dozen species or so to the list, without changing in any but a very few cases
the very useful indications given as to relative abundance.
