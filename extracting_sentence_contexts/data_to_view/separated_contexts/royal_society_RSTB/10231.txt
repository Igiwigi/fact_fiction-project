On the other hand, we might also ask if there S- app > BpB;, (2.1)
are other MTs associated with the potentially different MST uni- fal jal

verse. What is their nature and why are they absent in the

biological realm? No less important is the fact that MTs occur where ax, fj indicate stoichiometric coefficients associated
when a given set of preconditions is in place. Preconditions with the N, substrates and N, products of the reactions,
are relevant to our discussion because they imply the presence indicated by A; and Bj, respectively. However, too much
of a landscape of possibilities pervading the emergence of a chemical diversity can also make more difficult reacting mol-
major qualitative change.
