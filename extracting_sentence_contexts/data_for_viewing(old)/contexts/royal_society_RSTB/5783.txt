the second primordium (I;) always extended laterally into the region above the wound,
and often reached right across this region, so as to make contact with I, on the other
side, as in Nos. 377 and 235, figs. 6 and 5. On the other hand, after isolation of P,, the
edge of the second primordium (I,) was always found to be situated at a lower level in
relation to the wound, so that it made contact with the sloping side of the wound, which
seemed to have prevented it from extending farther, as in No. 240, fig. 3. None the less,
itis probable that even after isolation of P,, the edge of the second primordium extended
laterally a little beyond its normal position.

After isolation of I, in 14 out of 19 apices that were examined, the stipule of the
second primordium which extended across the region above the wound, was seen to be
larger than the other, so that the primordium as a whole was asymmetrical, as can be
seen from Table II. This fact indicates that the stipules of a primordium can to some
extent spread out into a space that is available for them, independently of the central
part of the primordium, from which the rest of the leaf originates. After isolation of P,
the stipules of the second primordium did not extend nearly so far into the region above
the wound, and only in one experiment out of 20 was this primordium slightly
asymmetrical.

(9) The Shapes of the Primordia and their Representation.

So far, only the displacement of the edge of the second primordium has been considered.
But it is necessary to consider also the displacement of its central part ; for, as has been
already stated, the central vascular strand of the second primordium was displaced
from its normal position, and this strand may be considered to mark its morphological
