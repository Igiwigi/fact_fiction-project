4. The concluding stages, during which the volcano sinks into more or less complete
repose,

These stages must be admitted to be more or less artificial and arbitrary. In some
of the eruptions they can alk be recognised as distinct, in others there is a tendency

for one or more to become inconspicuous or disappear, while occasionally the
preliminary stages of one eruption are continuous with the closing stages of another.
We have adopted them as convenient rather than as necessary, and as affording
merely an easy and simple method of classifying the observed facts.

1, The premonitory symptoms of the eruptions have been very noticeable at
St. Vincent, and much less obvious .in Martinique. They consist of numerous
earthquakes, not so violent as to damage houses, but so frequent as to awaken
apprehension. They have on more than one occasion been observed for a year before
the outbreak, That was the case before the eruption of 1902, and also, according to
Humeorpr, before that of 1812.* Before the eruption of 1718,t earthquakes were
frequent during the previous month. They have invariably been most violent around
the base of the volcanic cone, especially on the west and east sides, and have never
been conspicuous in Chateaubelair and Georgetown. They are not known to have
taken place before the eruption of May 18th, but in that case the area over which
they are felt had been completely evacuated. When the throat of the crater has
