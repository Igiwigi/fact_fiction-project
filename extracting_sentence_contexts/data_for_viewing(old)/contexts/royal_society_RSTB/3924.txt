particular horizon, have failed when the test is applied more widely. Again, in
the Armorican system of coalfields in the West of England, and also in the Welsh
Borderland coalfield of Titterstone Clee Hill, most of the rocks, which resemble
lithologically the Millstone Grits of the Northern Pennine fields, have been shown
on faunal evidence to be of Lower Carboniferous age. Or we may instance again the
red series of the upper portion of the Middle Coal Measures in Cumberland, the
Whitehaven Sandstone, which was mistaken by Sep@wick for Permian.t Many
other instances might be quoted, but these will suffice.

It is therefore no argument that, because the Sweet Coal Series of the Wyre Forest
consists of red-grey measures with Espleys, these beds must be the equivalents of the
beds of corresponding lithological character in the Southern Pennine and Midland
Coalfields. As a matter of fact they are not, as their flora clearly shows. The sole
test of horizon is paleeontology, and not lithology.

For many years past it has been apparent to those who are working out the
horizons of the British coalfields on the plant evidence that the continuous-sheet
theory of Gopwry-AusTEN and others is only exceptionally true. In many cases
the horizons found to be represented in neighbouring coalfields do not agree. But
I doubt if any previous consideration is likely to be more convincing than a study of
the Welsh Borderland system of coalfields. It appears quite impossible to imagine
that these areas, related as they are, once formed a continuous sheet{ of Coal
Measures from Shropshire, through Worcestershire, to Gloucestershire.
