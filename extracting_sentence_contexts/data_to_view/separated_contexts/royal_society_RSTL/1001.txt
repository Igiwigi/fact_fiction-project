Some general Observations on these Phenomena, and on the
Mode of Decomposition and Transition. It will be a general expression of the facts that have been
detailed, relating to the changes and transitions by electricity,
in common philosophical language, to say, that hydrogene,
the alkaline substances, the metals, and certain metallic oxides,
are attracted by negatively electrified metallic surfaces, and
repelled by positively electrified metallic surfaces ; and con-


chemical Agencies of Electricity. 29

trariwise, that oxygene‚Äù and acid substances are attracted by
positively electrified metallic surfaces, and repelled by nega-
tively electrified metallic surfaces; and these attractive and re-
pulsive forces are sufficiently energetic to destroy or suspend
the usual operation of elective affinity. It is very natural to suppose, that the repellent and attrac-
tive energies are communicated from one particle to another
particle of the same kind, s0 as to establish a conducting chain
in the fluid ; and that the locomotion takes place in conse-
quence; and that this is really the case seems to be shown by
many. facts. Thus, in all the instances in which I exa-
mined alkaline solutions through which acids had'been trans-
mitted, I always found acid in them whenever any acid matter
remained at the: original source. In time, by the attractive
power of the positive surface, the decomposition and transfer
undoubtedly become complete ; but this does not affect the
conclusion.
