On the other hand, it may refer to growth in the vertical
direction, when relative height is the basis. Again, both of these factors may be
entailed, when bulk will be the criterion. On the question of a correlation between the formation of resin canals and the
rapidity of growth in thickness, a glance over fig. 4 (p. 88) of Picea Canadensis will
present some interesting facts. Nos. 5, 6 and 7 of this figure represent three sections
through one yearâ€™s growth in height. These sections in the third annual ring from the
outside have 55, 34 and 24 resin canals respectively, in the second none, and in the
outside ring 11, 15 and 14.
