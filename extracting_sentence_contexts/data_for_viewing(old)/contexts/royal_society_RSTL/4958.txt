spot, and that too of an elevated form, on the egg of each of the Lissotritons. But
independent of the fact that the germinal vesicle has entirely disappeared from the
interior of the egg before it escapes from the ovary, this spot is shown not to be the
vesicle, both in the fact that in the egg of Rana temporaria the dark portion of the
yelk is unchanged, while in each case the spot is perforated, and leads into the canal
that passed originally to the vesicle. TI regard the spot as simply a protrusion outwards
of the edges of the canal while closing, after the vesicle has disappeared. I shall
presently show that a similar white spot is formed on the under surface of the egg of
the Frog s00n after deposition, and which might equally well be mistaken for the ger-
minal vesicle.

Mode of disappearance of the Yesicle—The mode in which the vesicle disappears
may be inferred from the facts of its structure. Being filled with a progeny of cells
which we may regard as of different periods of growth, and these again containing
others, it is fair to conclude that this process of cell formation is that by which the
parent vesicle is ultimately destroyed. At the time when the germinal vesicle has
nearly attained its full size, the peripheral cells are smaller than those nearer to its

» centre, while the yelk cells that surround the vesicle are till smaller than either, and

are of a dark colour. When, therefore, the vesicle has acquired its full size, by the

simple vegetative endogenous growth of the contained cells, we may fairly presume
that the death of the parent mother-cell, or germinal vesicle, takes place as the result
of their enlargement, by the diffluence of its investing membrane ; and the enclosed
