classical or stimulated one (figure 7). Each had its own way of calculating the resulting spectrum
for the Hawking emission. For the spontaneous radiation, we used the scattering matrix to solve
the mixing of Bogoliubov coefficients [11,35,44]. For the stimulated one, the pulse dynamics gives
the classical emission in nonlinear optics [12,61].

We would like to finish with a comment on the current state of the field of analogue gravity
in front of the scientific community: ‘All science is either physics or stamp collecting’. This
phrase is usually attributed to Ernest Rutherford. It is a controversial phrase, specially if it is
used by physicists. However, we would like to use it to counter an argument usually made by
physicists against the use of the name Hawking radiation to describe the so-called analogue
Hawking radiation, ie. a Hawking-type effect in analogue systems (figure 8). The naming of
physical effects is important to emphasize if they are related at all and how closely. In this
case, instead of collecting several related facts or ‘stamps’ and giving a different name to each
one—astrophysical Hawking radiation, aquatic Hawking radiation, sonic Hawking radiation,
optical Hawking radiation—we should generalize the concept of Hawking radiation. Yes, it was
discovered originally in astrophysics, but it is realized in the same way in all analogue systems,
as it was shown in the general derivation in §3. This phenomenon is nothing more than Hawking
radiation.
