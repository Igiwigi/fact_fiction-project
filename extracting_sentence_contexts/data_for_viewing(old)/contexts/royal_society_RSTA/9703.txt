P(), and using this as the limit the denominators for the P lines are calculated
direct from their observed values. This method, therefore, assumes the validity of
the relation P(c) = p(1) = VS(1). In the cases in question, as we have seen, this
has always been found to be the case. In the case of the alkalies, however, one of
the relations indicated does not hold unless we use the limit found directly from the
series (see Table IT., Part I.), and that accordingly has been done. Since, however,
the top lines in the alkalies are so ill determined the value of P() is used for
VS(1). CsS(2) is so uncertain that the value from the formula is also inserted.
RbS (2) is also from the formula, as Ber@mMann’s observed value is very considerably
in error. The difference between corresponding numbers are entered between
them.

Arranged in this way a number of facts emerge at once. Regarding Zn, Cd, Al,
and Tl, they all with one or two exceptions clearly indicate a general law that from
m = 2 onwards the denominators for the different triplets or doublets in each element
differ by the same amount, and that this amount is somewhere about ‘7 to “8 times
the corresponding difference for m= 1, which gives the values of A,, A,, or the
atomic weight terms. We may feel justified, therefore, in using this as a test to
apply to Pascuen’s allocation of the upper lines of the P series for Hg. The values
