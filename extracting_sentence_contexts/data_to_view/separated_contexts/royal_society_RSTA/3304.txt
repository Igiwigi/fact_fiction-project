Introduction

Enzymes have now been used for more than a
century for various applications in food, agriculture,
polymer synthesis, organic synthesis of fine chemicals
and flavours, and especially in the production of
pharmaceutical intermediates [1-6]. In addition to the
use of single (isolated) enzymes, the combination of
several enzymes in cascade reactions or in microbial
strains subjected to metabolic engineering [7-10] enables
the synthesis of more complex molecules and even
bulk chemicals. In fact, the area of biocatalysis has

undergone a tremendous development over the past 10-15 years, which was summarized in
