The Born-Markov approximation used above
implies some coarse-graining in time, i.e. averaging over a small time interval. Assuming
ergodicity, this averaging may be replaced by averaging over the random matrix ensemble. In
the case of the Gaussian ensembles, it is then enough to use the fact that (Veg Von) = 5jx5it (GUE)


or (Veg Von) = djx5it + 5ik5;1 (GOE) to arrive at the following very simple master equation:

ihdroe(t) = Hxoelt) — oelt)Hy — ih fect - tet} , (2.19)

The dissipation term of this equation had been obtained previously for a random matrix model
where the coupling matrix is a full random matrix in the product Hilbert space of the near and
far environment [14]. Note that equation (2.12) implies

fir (8) = troelt) = trel[M,(Hée(1)], My (t) = Uo(t)"U. (0). (2.20)

(c) Evolution equation for the generalized fidelity amplitude

To solve the master equation (2.19), we return to the interaction picture and separate off the
exponential decay from the solution,

rT

We now consider the corresponding integral equation
ret
Q(t) = 20) + Mm | dtM}(r)trel[Ma(t)2(c)], (2.22)
e Jo

and define
gar (t) = tre[M)(t)2(t)] such that fy,r(t) = eb, F(t). (2.23)

Eventually, we are only interested in the generalized fidelity amplitude f, r(t). It is then
convenient to derive an evolution equation for ¢,, (t) directly.
