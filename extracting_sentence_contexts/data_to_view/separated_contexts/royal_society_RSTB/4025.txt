As the numbers of endemic species increase from VC to VR, this would indicate
that they began at one or other end of this scale, and not somewhere in the middle. Now it is highly improbable that they began at the VC end, for this would indicate
that they are now dying out, and it would seem a most remarkable thing if species
actually developed in Ceylon should not even have enough local adaptation to
be able to survive there. It is far more probable that they began at the VR end of
the scale, and this is a view strongly supported by the fact that there are amongst
them a great number of species confined to one mountain top or to some very small
area. No fewer than 108 species* are thus confined to one mountain top or to small
areas in the mountains. Many of these only occur, as, for instance, those on the top
of Ritigala,t as a very few individuals; they must have been evolved on the
mountain top where they are found, as I have shown elsewhere ; and they can never
have existed as many more individuals than at present.
