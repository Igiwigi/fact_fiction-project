a year. There is, for instance, much greater variation in the type and amplitude of the
3 diurnal inequality in the five months November to March than in the five months
5 apr il to August. If we have at our disposal the data from a large number of years,
3 we can get smooth diurnal inequalities for individual seasons of the year a good deal
rg shorter than a calendar month. This is what we should naturally do if our object
& were to examine in very minute detail the mode of variation of the diurnal inequality
a = throughout the year. It is, however, open to the objection that it would produce a
= mass of detail which few readers if any could digest. The object in view moreover
E might be to some extent defeated by the influence of the sunspot relationship and
‘3 secular change effects. Considerations of space must also be borne in mind. Diurnal
3 inequalities for each of the 132 months of the eleven years—let alone shorter periods
F of the year—for H, V, N, W, T and I would have entailed printing an immense mass
& of figures. As a matter of fact, diurnal inequalities were calculated for H and V
2 from each of the 132 months, but not for the other elements. The H and V ranges
from these 132 inequalities are given later, but it was decided to publish for each of
these elements only four tables of diurnal inequalities. Thus, in the case of H, Table V.
gives the 12 diurnal inequalities obtained by combining all the months of the same
name in the 11 years, three diurnal inequalities for the seasons winter (November to
February), equinox (March, April, September and October) and summer (May to
August), and finally the mean diurnal inequality for the whole year. Table VI.
differs from Table V. only in that it is confined to the four years 1892 to 1895 repre-
senting large sunspot frequency ; for brevity, it is described as referring to sunspot
maximum. ‘Table VIL. is similarly confined to 1890, 1899, and 1900, and described as
