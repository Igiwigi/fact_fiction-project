It is rather badly preserved, but in
those features which can be made out it resembles Rhodostoma leptosoma. GREGORY
re-described P. sedgwicki in 1896 (9), and correctly described the L-shaped ridges,
crossed by a groove, seen on the actinal aspect of the arms. It is curious that he
does not mention the fact that the specimens labelled as type specimens belong to
two different species, and that he gives a description of the ossicles at the distal
end of the arms. The distal ends of the arms are broken off in the specimens having
alternating ossicles ; the specimens having opposite ambulacral ossicles agree neither
with ForBes’ nor Grecory’s description. Protaster sedgwicki, as represented by the specimens figured by Forxs, is an
Ophiurid with alternating ambulacral ossicles.
