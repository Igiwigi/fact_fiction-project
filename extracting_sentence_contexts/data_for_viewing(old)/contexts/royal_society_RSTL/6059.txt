I shall now briefly trace the posterior vesicular columns of the human cord from the
dorsal region downwards. At the upper part of the lumbar region, as in Mammalia, they
are larger than in any other portion of the cord (see fig. 13, M, Plate XXI.). They have
the same form and dark appearance as in the dorsal region, but contain more large cells.
As they descend, however, the dark masses diminish, and are frequently broken into
