The sockets of the scales are left on the surface of the skin in the dorsal region, and
for some distance below the lateral line, as somewhat rhomboidal areas bounded by
thickened bands in which black and yellow chromatophores are conspicuous. These
bands represent the outer layer of the skin which has been broken through by a large
aperture wherever a scale has fallen out. In the central parts of the scale-scars, that
is, in the skin beneath the scale, no chromatophores are to be seen. Along with the
chromatophores, and especially around the black ones, a little granular reflecting
tissue is to be seen, but it is insignificant in quantity. On the scales of the lateral
line which remain in situ the black and yellow chromatophores are more abundant
and uniformly distributed. Also when the few loose scales still adhering to the skin
are examined their outer sides are found to contain the same black and yellow
chromatophores. It is a curious fact that, although these yellow chromatophores
by transmitted light are always yellow under Zurss, A., or a higher power, and
appear dim yellow when the light is cut off from below, yet there is one condition
under which they appear distinctly green, namely, when seen with Appr’s substage
condenser and his centre-spot diaphragm. ‘The reason of this is probably that they
are then seen against a black back-ground.

When the internal layer of the skin in the dorsal-coloured region is examined, —

black and yellow chromatophores are seen closely crowded together. The black

bands are caused by the greater abundance of the black chromatophores and diminu-
