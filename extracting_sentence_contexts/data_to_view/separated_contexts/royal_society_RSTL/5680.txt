Thus, in one case, blood let
out; from a vein was part of it placed at; once on a glass plate, and part allowed to run into the angle
between the skin and limb. That onthe glass plate was not completely] coagulated for ten minutes; but
that in the other situation, having been left for twenty minutes, and then transferred to the plate, was &
consistent clot within six seconds, indeed as 800n as I could examine it. This fact 8eems to me to throw
great light upon the 8ubject of coagulation. The sudden ,transition from perfect fluidity to a eoagulum
can only be explained, I conceive, on the hypothesis that the ammonia had almost all escaped while the
blood lay in the angle; yet this escape had not caused coagulation. Hence it seems to follow, that am-
monia is in no way essential to the fluidity of the blood while it is surrounded by healthy tisxues.
