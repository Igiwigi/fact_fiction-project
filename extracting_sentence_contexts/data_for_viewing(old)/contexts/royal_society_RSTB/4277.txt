The Palatine Process of the Premaxilla.—The specimens of Perameles examined
add further proof to the statement that the palatine processes of the premaxille are
true processes of that bone, and are very definitely continuous with it. But it is also
interesting to note that they are in the same position as, and indeed replace in
position and function, the prevomers of the Reptiles. It should be noted that with the
relative decrease in size and importance of the paraseptals there is in the stages of
Perameles examined a corresponding increase in the palatine processes of the pre-
maxilla, (See Broom, 1.)

The Cartilages of the Larynx.—The cartilages of the larynx in the Marsupialia
are of special interest owing to the secondary changes which take place during
development. Though the specimens of Perameles, at present under consideration,
do not show any further peculiarities, they confirm the facts and theories already

known, and, so far as the writer is aware, it is the first series that has been figured.

These secondary changes, as already stated, are the fusing of the cricoid with the
body and also with the posterior cornu of the thyroid. This results in the stiffening
of the whole apparatus, rendering the larynx very inflexible. Symmveron and OppeL
(43 and 32) pointed out that this condition is correlated with the voiceless condition
of most of the Marsupialia.

Among the specimens of the Marsupialia examined, there is a striking difference
in the attachment or non-attachment of the hyoid to the base of the skull. As
described above, the hyoid of Perameles does not articulate with the skull, and the
