It is scarcely
necessary to remark that the notion of density is dependent on the dimensionality of the
element of volume dw: in passing from a spatial distribution, g dx . . . dz dw, to a snper-
ficial distribution, g dS, we alter the signification of g. In fact if, in order to connect
the two, we imagine the spatial distribution as made over an indefinitely thin layer or
stratum bounded by the surface, 80 that at any element dS of the surface the normal
thickness is dy, where dy is a function of the coordinates (7... 2, w) of the element 45,
the spatial element is =d» dS, and the element of mass g dz. . . dz dw is =g d» dS; and
