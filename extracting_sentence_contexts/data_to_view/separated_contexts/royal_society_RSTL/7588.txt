F.) for some time without ex-
ploding, while the latter inflames at a temperature of 150* C., yet a much smaller charge
(not more than 0-2 of the amount) of fulminate suffices for the explosion of unconfined
nitroglycerine than it needed for the detonation of gun-cotton. On the other hand, a
quantity of confined percussion-cap composition which, if it were pure mercuric fulmi-
nate, would be altogether inadequate for the detonation of gun-cotton, suffices for the
detonation of nitroglycerine. Although the foregoing facts appear to afford indisputable evidence that the direct
application of heat, from an exploding charge of detonating powder, is not concerned
in developing the violent action of gun-cotton or nitroglycerine, an attempt has been
made to devise 8ome experiments in which the detonation of either of those substances
by the agency described should be accomplished in such a manner as to interpose an
effectual barrier between the material to be exploded and the heated gases or flame

* 3:24 grms. (50 grains) of the fulminate heaped upon the gun-cotton-surface as in the above experiments,
but inflamed at the top of the heap, failed to explode or even to inflame the gun-cotton.
+ About 3-24 grms. (50 grains) of chloride of nitrogen, confined by water, are required for the detonation of
gun=-cotton, whereas 0-1 grm. (1:5 grain) of the chloride, similarly confined, suflices to detonate nitroglycerine.
