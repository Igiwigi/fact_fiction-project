This is the case chiefly in Hyrax, Elephas, Tapirus, Equus,
Myrmecophaga, Phalangista, Belideus, Petaurus, Perameles obesula, Hypsiprymnus
Dendrolagus, Capybara, Coelogenys, Cavia; i.e., summarised, in the majority of the
Marsupials, Perissodactyls, Edentata, and Rodentia. In some of these animals, notably
in Myrmecophaga and Capybara, these vessels are so minute and short that they
might almost as well be put into the first group. They are in fact intermediate
between, or transitional from, the anangiotic to the angiotic stage, and may be called
pseudangiotie.

IIL. Angiotic Type.â€”The retinal vessels are of varying calibre. They emanate
from numerous trunks situated at or near the periphery of the disc, and spread over
the greater portion of the retina.
