A further type
of microstructure formation occurs at very high cooling rates: the eutectic reaction is suppressed
as a result of partitionless solidification [4,15-19]. In [15-18], it was suggested that eutectic reactions in the liquid can be suppressed in
the eutectic systems, with the formation of supersaturated solid solutions after solidification. Experimental proofs of this fact with an analysis of the microstructure and composition were
obtained in [4,19]. Two studies are available in the literature where eutectic alloys and cooling
rates of up to 10Â°Ks~! were investigated [4,19]. Conclusions on partitionless solidification of
eutectic Al-35%Mg and Pb-11%Sb alloys are drawn, based on the observation of single-phase
areas that do not show the typical two-phase eutectic structure.
