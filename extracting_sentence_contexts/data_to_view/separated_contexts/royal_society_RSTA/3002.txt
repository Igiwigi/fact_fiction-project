The only aos

option, then, is for the set Vj.,5,, to be an objective basis for humans to perceive the present
moment and recall the past at all associated times t..°

There is a further implication for us in the distribution of the conditional states |Y\(to,o,))t
over time. The increase in t, for successive values of N is given by st§¥°* ~ /(a4VN) which is
less than 35tmin [10], where d5tmin is the temporal resolution limit, and hence the set of values
of the clock time f, are physically indistinguishable from a continuous range. The fact that the
spread in time Af, given by equation (5.1) is independent of N, whereas 5f$"°° + 2/(aA/N)
decreases as N increases implies that the conditional states |Yy(fo,o,A))t for sufficiently large,
successive values of N will overlap in time. A given clock time ft, will, therefore, be associated
with the ordered collection of conditional states such as {|Ynr(to,o,A))t: fe — t| < Atc} where
t= (20 /o)/N’. In other words, any particular clock time value f, is associated with an ordered
collection of conditional states.
