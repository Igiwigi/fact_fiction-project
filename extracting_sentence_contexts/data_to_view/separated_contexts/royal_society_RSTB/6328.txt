The in-
effectivity of progesterone is also of interest in so far as it indicates that this hormone
cannot be concerned in the embryonic differentiation of the female reproductive
tract. Whether or not the hormone that is concerned is an oestrogenic substance is
yet to be determined. It is difficult to believe that it can be in view of the fact that
these substances are not sex specific in their action. As has been implied above, the monhormonic hypothesis of sexual differentiation
would not conflict with the fact of the reactivity of the uterus masculinus and of the
hydatids of Morgagni to oestrone if it were assumed that these regions of the primordial
female reproductive tract became fully differentiated and determined during the
sexually indifferent phase of embryonic life. The strength of such an assumption
would, however, necessarily depend on the strength of this particular hypothesis, into
whose experimental basis it is not necessary to enquire here.
