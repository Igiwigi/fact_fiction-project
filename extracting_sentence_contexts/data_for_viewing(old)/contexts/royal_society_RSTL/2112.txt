8 be wondered at, when the novel and extraordinary nature of
E the whole class of galvanic phenomena is considered.

= It was in the beginning of 1806* that I attempted the solu-
E tion of this question ; and after some months” labour I pre-
2 sented to the Society the Dissertation, to which I have referred
S in the beginning of this Lecture. Finding that acid and
Z alkaline substances, even when existing in the most solid
Z combinations, or in the smallest proportion in the hardest
4 bodies, were elicited by Voltaic electricity, I established that
Z they were the results of decomposition, and not of composi-
S tion or generation ; and referring to my experiments of 1800,
S and 1801 and 1802, and to a number of new facts, which
E showed that inflammable substances and oxygen, alkalies
EZ and acids, and oxidable and noble metals, were in electrical
= relations of positive and negative, I drew the conclusion,
S that the combinations and decompositions by electricity were re-
E ferrable to the law of electrical attractions and repulsions, and
= advanced the hypothesis, © that chemical and electrical attrac-

ton were produced by the same cause, acting in one case on parti-
cles, in the other on masses ;** and that the same property, under
