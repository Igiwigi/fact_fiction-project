© 50. In a very interesting paper communicated to the British Association during its
last meeting, Mr. Janes TromsoN has explained the freezing together of two pieces of
ice at 32* in the following manner :—— The two pieces of ice, on being pressed together
at their point of contact, will at that place, in virtue of the pressure, be in part liquefied
and reduced in temperature, and the cold evolved in their liquefaction will cause some
of the liquid film intervening between the two masses to freeze.” I am far from denying
the operation under proper circumstances of the vera causx, to which Mr. TuoMs0N
refers, but I do not think it explains the facts. For freezing takes place without the
intervention of any pressure by which Mr. 'TwowsoxN's effect could sensibly come into

lay. It is not necessary to squeeze the pieces of ice together; one bit may be simply
I id upon the other and they will still freeze.
