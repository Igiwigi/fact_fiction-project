both the positive ions and the negative ions subsequently produced give rise to
others by collision, in the hope that it might be applied to the further elucidation of
the above experimental results. The expression obtained, however, is so complex
that its manipulation, so as to fit the observations, did not seem likely to greatly
advance our knowledge of the subject. There does not, however, so far as one can
see, seem to be anything in these results contrary to the view that the positive ions
from hot metals have about the same power as the positive ions produced by Réntgen
rays in air of producing other ions by collisions, and that the other ions so produced
consist, in any given case, of an ordinary positive ion together with a corpuscle.

§$ 4. Hysteretic Relations between Current and Electromotive Force.

The numbers given in Table 4, § 3, exemplify the curious fact that in some cases the
current increased with diminishing potential difference. The case cited was not
found to be an isolated instance, as the following numbers, obtained at a temperature
of 826° C. and a pressure of 074 millim., testify :—
