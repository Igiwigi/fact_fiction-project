These two last values
are those which match the critical point to the experimental one obtained with equations (2.3)
and (2.5). We can see that, given these constraints at y =0 and at py =. =34 s_!, the theoretical
curve is quite different from the experimental one. In fact, the theoretical model is based on
a progressive shear thickening before the DST transition because the jamming volume fraction
(a) decreases continuously when a increases, which results in an increasing viscosity with o. On the contrary, the experiment (purple curve in figure 10) can be represented by the Bingham
law up to the transition point, meaning that the fraction of percolating contacts remains low and
suddenly increases at the critical stress. As in the experiment, above the critical stress, we obtain
