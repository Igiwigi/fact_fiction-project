branch nearest the air-sac occurs in al] the tubes. The ultimate branches end blindly
in a blunt point (fig. 13).

The point can only be made out clearly in a fresh specimen, as in preserved animals
the ends of the tubes are completely clogged with blood corpuscles. The ends of the
tubes, as already mentioned, either project into the blood in the pericardium, or
penetrate the spaces in the fat body: in either case they are bathed in blood.

The tubes are clothed with cells which resemble those of the hypodermis, and are,
in fact, a continuation of the latter. Their appearance is shown in figs. 9, 12, 13.
The blood corpuscles can be distinguished from the clothing cells of the tubes by the
following characteristics :—Their nuclei are quite round, and stain more deeply than
do the nuclei of other cells. The cell-body is quite round and not irregular in shape,
as in the case of the clothing cells. An example of the two kinds of cells is shown in
fig. 3.

The Fat Tissue.—The peculiar form of tissue known as “ fat body” in the Myriapods
is of great importance in this class of animals. It packs the organs and enters into a
peculiar relation with the heart and pericardium. In all Myriapods with which I am
acquainted it pierces the pericardium, and parts of it lie within the latter. In a
former paper (1) I traced the origin of this tissue in Julus terrestris, and found that
it originated from mesoblast cells which remain in the yolk and give rise to the heart,
