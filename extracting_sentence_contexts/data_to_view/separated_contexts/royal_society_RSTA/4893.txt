The simplicity
of such reduced models is that they satisfy a number of exact constraints that facilitate the
development of an intuitive understanding of the turbulent dynamics. Although these constraints
do not strictly hold under more general plasma conditions, often the behaviour observed
in the simplified system persists, at least to lowest order, in the more general system. For
example, we employ here our understanding of the nonlinear energy transfer between counter-
propagating Alfvén waves in incompressible MHD to argue that the anisotropic cascade of
energy ubiquitously observed in magnetized plasma turbulence is due to the facts that only
counter-propagating Alfvén waves interact nonlinearly and that the nonlinear term is greatest for
interactions between perpendicularly polarized Alfvén waves. Although the constraint that only
counter-propagating waves interact ceases to hold strictly when compressibility or kinetic effects
(dispersion due to finite Larmor radius effects) are introduced, the anisotropy of the turbulent
cascade persists.

plasma turbulence enables further simplifications.
