Finally,
section 11 shows the decreased depth of the calcarine fissure at its lower extremity. The rudimentary condition of the area of special lamination in this case is very
interesting in view of the opinion expressed by Brissaup, that the visuo-sensory
area lies below the calcarine fissure. The fact also, that this area in its rudimentary
condition still occupies the lower lip of the stem of the calcarine fissure is of
importance, owing to the statement made on developmental grounds by CUNNINGHAM,
that the “stem” of the calearine fissure belongs to the calearine suleus and not to
the parieto-occipital. From a survey of the six cases which have been described the following conclusions
may be drawn :—

1. The “occipital” lamination in the region of the calearine fissure is a well
defined cortical area.

2.
