are much wider in the Berriasian compared with Tithonian,
implying that an increase in the true richness across this bound-
ary cannot be excluded. Lower sampling rates during the
Berriasian across all dinosaur clades and regardless of
whether species- or genus-level data are used, suggest that
this ‘clear diversity loss’, might be an artefact of sampling
bias and that the ‘major extinction’ of dinosaurs across the
Jurassic—Cretaceous boundary [25,26,44,48,49] might be less
severe than previously thought (see also [45,46]).

The current view is that not only is there no longer
term (i.e. epoch-level) decline in richness prior to the end-
Cretaceous extinction, there is in fact a sharp increase in
richness for the final two stages in the Cretaceous [50]. The
latter is not corroborated by our estimates: while the two
final stages of the Cretaceous are high in raw species counts
for all clades, estimated richness in Campanian and Maastrich-
tian are well within confidence intervals for earlier stages in
the Cretaceous for sauropodomorphs, and also partially for
ornithischians and theropods. Rather than the two final
stages exhibiting elevated richness levels, TRiPS estimates
that a similar level of richness was reached in the previous
stage (Santonian), at least for Theropoda and Ornithischia.
Ornithischia do seem to have a real trough in the Coniacian
(89.8—86.3 Ma), but sauropodomorphs and theropods seem
