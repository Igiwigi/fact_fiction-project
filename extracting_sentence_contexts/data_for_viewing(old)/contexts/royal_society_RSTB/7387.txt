These were associated with numerous twigs which had bark varying in colour from light
grey to dark brown. In some cases the bud-scales were still attached to the twigs. All
apparently were Salix, though which species it was not possible to say.

Ficure 15. Salix sp. Leaves from Hawks Tor. a to ¢, site 42A, 100 to 98 cm.; d, ¢, site 36, wood layer
of lower peat (not the peat monolith series). a, c, d (magn. x 6); 6, e (magn. x 3).

Leaves (figures 7 and 15) of at least two species were collected from a woody layer at
site 36 (not that of the peat monolith) and also from the extreme base of site 42A (100 to
98 cm.). These also probably belong to a small-leaved species of willow, but the fragments
were not adequate for a certain identification, in view of the fact that the species that come
within the size range, such as S$. repens and S. myrsinites, are extremely variable in leaf
form.

Saxifraga cf. granulata L.

Three seeds of a saxifrage from the lower layers of the lake mud at site 42B, 300 to 298,
298 to 296, 292 to 290, 280 to 270 cm., may be referred tentatively to S$. granulata. From
comparison with recent material available, two of the seeds agree with S. granulata in size
and in tubercle pattern, which consists of numerous distinct small tubercles between
regular rows of large ones (figure 97). But it is possible that there are other species—
for example, in the hypnoid or even the caespitose group—which have this character.
The third specimen has crowded tubercles of only the small size; this might suggest
