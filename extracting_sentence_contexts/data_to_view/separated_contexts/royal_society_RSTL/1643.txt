in execution those parts of the plan which were most difficult
and most decisive. The results of the first measurements made of different
arcs on the meridian of different parts of the world, were
found to be perfectly conformable to the expectations of
Hvuycnens and of NEwrTon, and also with experiments made

6 Science,

S At the commencement of the French revolution, men of
5 science took advantage of the general impulse which the hu-
A man mind received in favour of every species of innovation, or

change, and they proposed making a new measurement of an
arc of the meridian in France, for the purpose of establishing
a new system of weights and measures, which should be per-
manent, as being founded on-the nature of things.
