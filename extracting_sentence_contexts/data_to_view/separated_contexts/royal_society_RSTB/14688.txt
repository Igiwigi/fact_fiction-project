Throughout this article, we refer to these elements as the
anterior median interparietal (AMI) element, posterior median
interparietal (PMI) element and left and right (paired) posterior
interparietal (PI) elements. Some cetaceans only show a single
median element, which we interpret to be the AMI. This assump-
tion is supported by the fact that the PMI is infrequent, smaller
and always occurs in the presence of the AMI. The AMI is the unpaired bone commonly identified as the
interparietal in cetacean osteology [12,13]. The AMI corresponds
with ip.1 described in [19] and IA in [20].
