Note on the preceding Paper. By W. Es80x, M.A4., F.R.S., Fellow of Merton College, Oxford,

Is January, 1882, Mr. Dixox sent to me the results of the experiments recorded on
P. 659 of the preceding memoir, and asked me to discover if I could the relation
between the quantities of the gases ab the beginning and end of the explosion. The
facts already discovered by Mr. Dixon (1) that the union of carbonie oxide and
oxygen does not take place except in the presence of steam, and (2) thab carbonic
oxide is oxidized by steam at a high temperature, led me to conjecture tha the first
effect, of the explosion was to combine all the oxygen present with the proper amount
of hydrogen to form steam. An action was then set np between the steam and
carbonic oxide resulting in the formation of hydrogen and carbonic acid, and

simultaneously a reverse action took place between the hydrogen and carbonic acid
resulting in the formation of steam and carbonic oxide.
