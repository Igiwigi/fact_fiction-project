Now the Table shows that the East-
erly extreme about 8 A.M. must be considerably more than doubled by the occurrence at
the same hour of a large easterly disturbance-deflection, and that at 2 P.M. the Easterly'
disturbance-deflection has become 80 large as to far more than compensate the effect
of the usual amount of the solar-diurnal westerly maximum belonging to that hour,"
making the joint deflection at that hour a considerable easterly one. It will also be'
8een that when the two Kinds of variation are left unseparated, their joint effect produces
a large nocturnal maximum of westerly deflection, which disappears in the solar-diurnal
variation when the disturbances are eliminated. Solar-diurnal Variation.—The almost extreme difference in the normal direction of
the magnet, geographically considered, at Port Kennedy and Point Barrow, gives a more!
than ordinary importance to the comparison of the facts of the solar-diurnal variation
at the two stations, rendering it an apt illustration, in an almost extreme case, of the
laws by which this class of phenomena is regulated. Magnetically speaking, the mean'
direction of the magnet is necessarily the same at the two stations; that is to say, the
mean pointing of the marked end of the magnet, which we usually term its north pole, is
to the magnetic north; but in a geographical sense this direction is at Port Kennedy
about 35* to the West of South, and at Point Barrow about 41* to the East of North. The localities afford therefore in this respect a contrast nearly as great as can exist in
any part of the globe; since magnetically the directions are the same, whilst geogra-
phically they want only 6* of being 180? apart, or diametrically opposite.
