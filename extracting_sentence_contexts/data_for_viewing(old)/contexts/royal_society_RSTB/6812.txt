Further selective inoculation yielded a pure X°.

The pure X° line has been maintained through a large number of passages, in all
of which inoculum punched out from the green tissue has either given an X® or a
completely negative reaction.

SEPARATION OF X¢ FROM X4

Separation of the two strains in a condition of approximate purity was both easy
and rapid; the complete isolation of X? from all admixture of X° is not so. The weaker
strain X° has appeared without specific selection after the fifth passage on an ap-
parently pure line of X%, and again in the 2lst passage. Reference has already been
made to the fact that during the season 1937 it was found difficult to maintain X” at
its normal standard of reaction in tobacco, the line apparently reverting to a weaker
and more G-like type.

The X” type, with the exceptions noted above, assumed a stable and characteristic
type of reaction which remained unaffected throughout some thirty generations of
unselected culture. During this period seven selections were made from the green vein-
banding areas and the central yellow ones respectively, with the object of separating
any X® strain which might be present. The resultant infections, however, showed so
little departure from the normal that it was assumed that there was no appreciable
quantity of X° present in the X¥ cultures.
