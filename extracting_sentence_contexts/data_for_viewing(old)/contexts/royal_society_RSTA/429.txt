he general problem of understanding and quantifying how aerosols impact the
climate system [14,15].

General circulation model (GCM) simulations suggest that, if the droplet
number concentration in marine stratocumulus could be increased to several
vundred per cubic centimetre in a significant fraction of the stratocumulus sheets,
hen—subject to satisfactory resolution of various problems mentioned later
a negative forcing could be produced, sufficient to balance approximately the
warming associated with carbon dioxide doubling, and maintain the polar sea-ice
coverage at roughly current values. However, the computations of Rasch et al. [6]
indicated that the negative forcing required to hold the Earth’s average surface
temperature at the current value would be different from that required for average
sea-ice coverage maintenance (which would in fact be different at the two poles).
Latham et al. [5] outlined observational studies that give some support for the
viability of MCB, but it cannot be regarded as definitive.

Current major problems regarding MCB, which may or may not be capable of
resolution, are

— we do not yet have a spraying system capable of producing sea water

particles of the size and in the copious quantities required;
— even if we succeeded in producing such a system, we would still need

to ensure that it would function satisfactorily at sea for long periods
