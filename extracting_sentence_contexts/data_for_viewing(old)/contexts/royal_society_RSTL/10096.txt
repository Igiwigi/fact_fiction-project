yet the whole outer aspect of the ganglion in like manner receives numerous fasciculi,
which form a complete medullated investment over its outer surface. This medullated
investment being augmented by fewer fibres, and yet fewer at lower levels, eventually
thins off into an insignificant tract (Plate 49, fig. 10, B)>( Now it is by no means
improbable that a certain number of minute fasciculi in the Rat pass from the s8ub-
divisions of the posterior olfactory fasciculus upwards along this medullated tract. TI
have repeatedly imagined that I could trace such a connexion, and if this turns out to
be correct then we have here a distribution similar to although far more restricted than
what I have assured myself is the case with the Rabbit's brain, The position of this
posterior olfactory fascieulus from the anterior commissure in its course through the
corpus striatum is parallel to the base of the lenticular wedge, lying in fact betwixt its
two main divisions, as may be clearly 8een in horizontal sections taken ab the proper
plane, in which will also be very evident the fact, that whilst these fibres run directly
backwards, the majority of the projection fibres of the corpus striabum pass directly
outwards or forwards to the cortex (Plate 49, fig. 9, A-C). The olfactory fagciculus,
prior to the formation of the anterior commissure, measures in its shortest diameter

"78 mm. to *87 mm. ; the fasciculus emerging from the commissure, as 1 leaves the
e corpus striatum, measures but *52 mm. This reduction
