* We
may expect that the critical electron densities are actually given by the points A and B
in fig. 7 since dq/0 N is infinite there, and we proceed to prove that this is in fact the case. It will follow that the levels of reflexion of the magneto-ionic components in fig. 8 are
aand b, not d and e.
