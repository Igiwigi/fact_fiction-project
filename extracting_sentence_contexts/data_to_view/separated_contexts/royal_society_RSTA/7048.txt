Also

bie = aba! = b
and du = (by 1c" -1bh ec’) pz = bebe = 1. Hence the relation corresponding to (21-5) is also satisfied, even as a consequence of the more

stringent d’v = 1. The mapping y then generates a homomorphism of H into G; but this is
in fact on to G, because a, b?, c generate the whole of G. Thus we have shown:

Tuerorem. The groups G and H defined above in terms of three generators with two and three de ining
relations, respectively, are not isomorphic, but are homomorphic maps of each other. (21:6)

Ifwe combine the homorphisms of G on to H and of Hon to G, we obtain an endomorphism
of G on to itself.
