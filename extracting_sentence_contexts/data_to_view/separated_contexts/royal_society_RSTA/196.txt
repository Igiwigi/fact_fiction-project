Much of the logic of living systems
ies beyond DNA. To save the program metaphor therefore we would have to say
hat the ‘program’ is distributed between the tape and the machine. This would,
incidentally, explain an important fact. Virtually all attempts at cross-species
cloning fail to develop to the adult (Chung et al. 2009). A possible explanation
is that the egg cell information is too specific (Chen et al. 2006).
