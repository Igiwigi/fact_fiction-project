On the seventh day the egg which had been segmented
had produced an embryo. From these results, then, it appears that while the spermatozoon at a mean tem-
perature of the atmosphere of 55* FanR. usually loses its vitality, and is inert in less
than four hours, and but rarely is efficient at a longer period after immersion in
water, the egg retains its reproductive property for a very much longer time, especially
if not removed from the body of the dead animal, only losing it at twenty-four hours
after the death of the parent, and occasionally retaining it for forty hours. The experiment No. 4, in which the latter fact is shown, is interesting, from the
cireumstance that the same results are produced by the living vibratile spermatozoon
on the yelks of the dead eggs, as the majority of these were, as that which is occa-
Sioned by the application of dead and decomposing spermatozoa to the envelopes of
the living one, as shown in No. 6 of the preceding set ; and further, that these results
80 closely resemble in appearance the first effects produced on the yelks of living eggs
by the application of strong solution of potass ; thereby showing not only that powerful
endosmic action takes place rapidly through the coverings of the egg, but also that
the influence of the spermatozoon on the yelk, whatever may be its precise nature,
is direct and immediate. 4. ENDOSMOSIS OF THE EGG IN RELATION TO ITS VITALITY. It-has before been shown that the endosmic action of the envelopes of the egg, on
immersion in water, is closely connected with the act of fecundation ; and we bave
now further proof of this in the fact that the vitality of the egg may be preseryed for
many hours if the envelopes be not brought into contact with water; 80 that the
insusceptibility of the egg to become impregnated, after a lengthened period of
immersion, is due to a diminution of the expansive.
