But this opinion cannot, I conceive,
be maintained with justice. It is well known that all the mathematical solutions of
the problem have confessedly gone upon suppositions very remote from the real facts:
Newrox and BerNnouLL, for instance, have assumed the form of the fluid spheroid,
under the influence of the sun and moon, to be the form of equilibrium : LayLace has
supposed the whole globe to be covered with water of an uniform depth. It is in no
degree clear, that investigations conducted on such assumptions will give us eyen an
approximation to the true result; and the only way in which the assumptions could
be justified, would be by our finding, from observation, that the laws of the facts are
Such, or nearly such, as these hypothetical calculations give. If this agreement were
