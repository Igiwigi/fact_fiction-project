Plugging the adjacency matrix in (2.5) one obtains

m=42, (bj, 4c) = (1,1), (-13, 5), (—29, 21), (41,41) for j= 0,1, 2,3. (2.8)
Using definition 1.1 (or (2.6)), one obtains that

which is indeed a false theta function of weight 1/2. The fact that Zcs((2,3,7)) is given by the
above function by taking the limit

was first established by Lawrence & Zagier [19].

(b) False, mock and quantum

As we have seen, a pre-requisite for a q-series to play the role of the quantum invariants Z,(M3)
is to have a specific behaviour when taking the radial limit, so that it gives the WRT invariants
via (1.4). This is demonstrated in the ©(2,3,7) example in (2.10). This leads us to the concept
