& We have now before us the facts relating to the various spectra which have been
photographed at Kensington, and the next thing to do is obviously to attempt to
“a trace the relationships of the various sub-divisions to which reference has been made,

2 Two Series of Spectra. S One important fact comes out very clearly, namely, that, whether we take the
varying thicknesses of the hydrogen or of the lines of other substances as the basis for
@the arrangement of the spectra, it is not possible to place all the stars in one line of
temperature. For example, in the stars of Table A, Sub-division «, the hydrogen
lines are of the same average thickness as in the stars of Table A, Sub-division 8, but
zthe remaining lines are almost entirely different ; and the two sub-divisions cannot be
"3 placed i in juxtaposition. It is, therefore, necessary to arrange the stars in two series.
