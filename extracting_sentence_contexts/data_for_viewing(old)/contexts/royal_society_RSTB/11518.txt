anyone in everyday life (e.g. physiology; [9,24]). This means
that people’s everyday ideas about individual-specificity
underlie assessment-derived models, rather than any biologi-
cal individual differences as often assumed. Taxonomies of
individual-specificity in physical, behavioural and psychical
phenomena, often conceived as personality, are still largely
missing [2,4,9,25].

(ii) Taxonomies for compositional structures and process

structures
Decontextualization enabled by language shifts researchers’
and raters’ focus away from the facts that, in humans and
other species, individuals behave differently in different nom-
inal settings and that these within-individual variabilities often
differ among individuals in temporally reliable ways. This indi-
vidual-specific context/situation specificity (context-dependence)
entails that, on the sample level, cross-situational consistency
is often only moderate [3,26]. Individual-specificity also
occurs in the specific behaviours of similar function and mean-
ing that individuals show in given contexts (e.g. different
anxiety-related behaviours); this individual-specific behaviour
specificity entails that internal consistencies are often only
low [27-29].
