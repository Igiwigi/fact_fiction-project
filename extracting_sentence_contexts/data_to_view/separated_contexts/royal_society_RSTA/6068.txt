The local
determination of Ho (which is around 40 away from the corresponding Planck 2018 value based
on the CMB) is the origin of the so-called Ho tension [70-72]. Taking into account that the
type I and II RRVM’s have one and two more parameters, respectively, when compared with
the ACDM, a fairer model comparison is achieved by computing the numerical differences
between the deviance information criterion (DIC) of the ACDM model against the RRVM’s:
ADIC = DIC cpm — DICRrvn. These differences will be (and in fact are) positive if the RRVM’s
fit better the overall data than the ACDM. The DIC is defined by DIC = VO)+ 2pp [146]. Here,
po= x — x°(@) is the effective number of parameters of the model, and x and 6 the mean of the
overall x? distribution and the parameters, respectively.
