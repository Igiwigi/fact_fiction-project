They consist of a thick series of ashes, agglomerates,
and slates, with abundant associated igneous rocks of various kinds, the majority
intrusive, but some perhaps extrusive. The Charnian ridge strikes north-westâ€”
south-east, and although sinking under the Trias, it evidently continues in a south-
eastern direction for a considerable distance under comparatively shallow cover. This is proved by the fact that the Charnian rocks were pierced in a boring at Orton,
Northants (see p. 93), while igneous rocks of a type common in Charnwood Forest
actually appear at the surface at Croft, and at various other points in South
Leicestershire,

To the north-east, however, the plane of junction between the Charnian rocks and
the overlying Trias is very irregular, and it often dives rapidly underground, so that
the Charnian rocks soon become buried beneath a considerable cover. Therefore
