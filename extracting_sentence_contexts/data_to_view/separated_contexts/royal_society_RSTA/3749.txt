In each case the last cycle is indicated by isolated points; when the
positive load is increasing a + is used, and when the positive load is decreasing a X
is used. In their general forms the curves due to the last cycle for 20 and 50 turns of
permanent set resemble those obtained after several comparatively rapid cycles of
torsion for 25 and 50 turns of permanent set in ยง62. Any close comparison is
impossible on account of the fact that the curves of ยง 62 do not form closed figures. Tn the case of 6 turns of permanent set, the curves for the last cycle differ widely
from those for 5 turns of permanent set in the experiments of ยง 62. The part of the
curve which corresponds to a decreasing positive couple now lies always above that
part which corresponds to an increasing positive couple instead of crossing it.
