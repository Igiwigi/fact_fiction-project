the cell walls of many fungi the existence of chitin strictly comparable to that which
occurs in animal tissues. The method he adopts for its detection is as follows:
Sections of alcoholic material are heated in concentrated potash to 160° C. for two
hours. After cooling they are washed into 90 per cent. alcohol and then stained with
iodine and sulphuric acid. If chitin be present a beautiful pink stain is given to the
hyphee, while the cells of the host take on the usual blue colour of cellulose. In this
way WissELINGH has shown chitin to be present in. Myxomycetes, Phycomycetes, and
numbers of other fungi, including some members of the Ustilagineze, but he did not
find it in any of the Bacteria which he investigated.

When applied to sections of Leguminous nodules this method gave no trace of pink
colour ; we may, therefore, probably conclude that chitin does not enter into the com-
position of the matrix of these tubes—a fact which supplies additional evidence
against the theory that the organism should be classed with the Ustilaginez.

All I am able to offer concerning the matrix enclosing these rodlets is, therefore, of
a negative character—that it contains nothing of the nature of cellulose or chitin, nor
probably of mucilage.

The staining of the tube in the root-hair I found to be a very difficult matter, owing
to the collapse of the hairs when the roots are transferred from one liquid to another,
but I succeeded nevertheless in obtaining with strong hematoxylin and with aniline
blue results which showed that here the tube consists of a chain of rodlets exactly
like those present in the tubes within the tubercle cells (fig. 12).
