Caenorhabditis elegans’ sinusoidal locomotion depends on
smooth contraction and relaxation of its body wall muscles. For many years, it was thought that unlike vertebrate skeletal
muscle, which exhibits action potentials, C. elegans body wall
muscles have only graded potentials. However, in 2011
researchers reported that worm muscles do in fact have
calcium-dependent action potentials [87], and that synchroniza-
tion of action potentials depends on gap junction coupling
between muscle cells [88]. The authors used ChR2-mediated
stimulation of excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABAergic
motor neurons to generate specific neuromuscular inputs
during electrophysiological recordings from body wall muscles. Many aversive stimuli, including head touch, induce a
response consisting of a brief reversal followed by a sharp turn
during which the animal forms an ‘omega’ shape.
