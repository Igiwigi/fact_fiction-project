The nonlinear restoring force fx, is available as it can be computed from the filtered temporal
series through

Ri = ft — mii* — cir* — KE ut, (4.3)

and its phase-space representation is given in figure 7a. The two-dimensional section
corresponding to u* =0 represented in figure 7b highlights the cubic nonlinearity induced by
the thin lamina: fNL = Kyu. In fact, a one-term harmonic balance approximation u~u* =
Usin(t + 5,) means that

Ro = Kn). (4.4)

A nonlinear coefficient Ky = 2.507 x 10? Nm~$ is then obtained by filtering the signal uw

and solving equation (4.4) by a least-squares method, which provides an excellent fit with a
normalized mean-squared error equal to 0.4%. Furthermore, from equation (2.7),

fi (it =0) =P Kui, (4.5)

which is the cubic approximation represented in figure 7a,b.
