velocities for the upper bound. That the lower bound goes through to the no-slip case is clear.

Let us briefly discuss the strategy of our proof. On the one hand, we must explain why
no enstrophy-constrained velocity having (|Vu|?) = Pe? can lower (|VT|?) significantly beyond
Pe~*/3. At the same time, we must construct a sequence of admissible velocities to cool within
a logarithm of this bound. The challenge is to find a way of computing heat transfer that at the
same time shows how it can be optimized. We follow the approach of our previous articles on
maximizing transport across an externally heated fluid layer [43-45], the key difference being
the presence of the internal source f(x, f). We show it is possible to bound (|VT|), and in fact to
compute it exactly in the steady case, by a pair of variational problems. These problems recall
Dirichlet’s principle for Poisson’s equation, but are non-local due to the mixed character of the
operator u - V — A. That there exists a non-local Dirichlet-like principle for the effective diffusivity
of a periodic or random fluid flow is well-known in homogenization [46,47]. Our idea is that
(\VT/?) should behave like an effective diffusivity upon optimization. This is very much in the
spirit of the general connection between homogenization and optimal design (see, e.g. [48-50)]).

The bulk of our work goes into constructing the ‘branching flows’ behind the upper bound in
theorem 1.1. In general, we envision an unsteady, tree-like, multi-scale flow whose features refine
from the bulk to the boundary as in the bottom of figure 1. To achieve it, we piece together a family
of convection roll-like flows, with the number of rolls in the azimuthal direction 6 depending
on the radial coordinate r. A similar, albeit steady, branching flow was used in [43,45] to prove
