'= that connect Baffin's Bay with the American polar sea, but I never had an opportunity
E of making comparative analyses of the water from that but seldom visited part of the
ocean. Colonel SCHAFFNER had the kindness on his voyage between the eastern part of
< Iceland and the south part of Greenland to take a number of samples, which I have
SZ analyzed, and the result of which will be found in my fourth region, the Kast Green-

A Colonel ScnavyxER (three by Captain Gra), is 35:278 per 1000 alt. where one analysis

region. In comparing this mean number with that of the North Atlantic Ocean (35-391),
there will hardly be found any difference in the quantity of salt the two contain ; while
there is a great difference between these and the real polar current of Batffin's Bay,
which is 33:281 per 1000, or of the Patagonian polar current (33-966). I think we may
infer from this fact, that the Fast Greenland current is a returning branch of the Gulf-
stream, and that the east coast of Greenland proportionally gives very few icebergs and
very little glacial water to the sea. For comparison's sake I shall mention here that the
Sea about midway between Norway and Spitzbergen contains 35:222 per 1000. I found
the water taken on the 8outh side of that island to contain 35:416 per 1000, while that

Seems to be real polar water, while all the water that flows between Norway, Spitzbergen,
