conditions of the same insect. The observation was first made on the larva of Sphinx
Atropos, LaxN., and on that of Pygara bucephala, STEPn., as will presently be
shown.

During the time I have been engaged in preparing the present communication
I have become acquainted, through the kindness of Dr. ForBxs of Chichester, with
the recently published views of Dr. BzrTHoD, of Gottingen, who has made a series
of observations on the temperature of cold-blooded animals*, and among them several
on insects, 80mewhat similar to those which I now have the honour of submitting to
the Society. But excellent as are the views of that gentleman, he does not appear
to have paid sufficient attention to the conditions of activity or rest in the insects at
the time of making his experiments, and consequently has omitted to observe the
important fact of the existence of a distinct temperature of body in individual in-
sects-f, and also those circumstances which augment or lessen its amount, and has
estimated the temperature by placing many individuals together, which, as will pre-
sently be seen, is open to several objections. Dr. BzrraoLD has, however, anticipated
me in the expression of one opinion, unto which we have mutually been led by our ob-
servations, viz. that at all events the higher classes of invertebrated animals ought not
to be considered as cold-blooded, since it is found that under certain conditions they
have a temperature of body higher than that of the surrounding medium. HausManxt
made an observation as long ago as the year 1803, which ought to have led to a proper
understanding of the nature of the temperature of insects. He placed a perfect spe-
cimen of Sphinx Convulvuli, LaNnN. in a 8mall glass phial when the temperature of the
atmosphere was 17% Rzavun. (70%25 Fans.), together with a small thermometer, and at
the expiration of half an hour the temperature of the phial was 19? Reaun. (7 4*75
