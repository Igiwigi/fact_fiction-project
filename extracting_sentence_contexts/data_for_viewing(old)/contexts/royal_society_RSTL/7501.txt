latter; and with none better than the Jaw of the little Corn-Crake, Crex pratensis. The
whole shape of the © articulare,” and the manner in which the © coronoid” turns obliquely
upwards on the inside of the large open space, thus dividing it into two, these are per-
feetly ralline, and make it very probable that these are figures of part of the mandible
of the Great Rail (Notornis casuarinus. Owen, sÞp.). With regard to the curve of the
Great Notornis's bill, I think a few comparisons will make the matter clear. Let the
rele: put beside this large skull that of Porphyrio poliocephalus, and of the semiralline
Psophia ; if one straight line be drawn from the tip of the bill to the end of the zygoma,
and another from the commencement, of the zygoma to this ideal basal line, he will
have ot following results, viz. that the vertical line is one-ninth the length of the basal
. the P orphyrio, and one-seventh in the other two. The curve downwards in the Great
Notornis and in the Psophia is equal, is smilar, and in the latter only wants the robust-
ness of the former to make the likeness striking. This accords with the fact that the

Psophia agrees with this huge bird in another point in which the latter diverges from
the ordinary Rails, viz. in the perfectness of the interorbital septum.

Professor OwEN (op. c. p. 351) was somewhat staggered at finding the sulcus where
the coronal suture had been in the Great Rail's skull, © behind the relative position
of the persistent coronal suture in the skull of the Palapteryx.” A very early stage
of the Gallinule's skull explains this; for this and many other water-birds have the
parietals very narrow, and the frontals extending far back ; whereas the < Struthionide,”
