wet method, and never dried in air at any period during the preparation of the slide,
shows conditions very closely resembling the live picture, and utterly different from
the version given by the usual Giemsa method, All fixation is probably a choice of
error, but it stands to reason that, if a delicate and highly flexible organism
occupying three dimensions is swiftly flattened out into two, quite regardless of its
attitude at the time, disasters are liable to occur. In dry preparations the nucleus
has simply been burst. There is nothing wrong with this method so long as the
observer remembers that he has destroyed this important structure, and does not
proceed to describe it as though he had respected its integrity. The criterion of
fixation must be the relation of the fixed material to the live picture, and, judged by
this standard, the wet fixation and passage into some mounting fluid is greatly to be
preferred. The criticisms that may be urged against the wet method are slight
shrinkage of the protoplasm of the body, and the fact that, as the attitude in three
dimensions has been very closely preserved, it is almost impossible in many cases to
get an accurate microscopic measurement of the length of the animal. The ordinary
methods of measurement supply no means whereby the elevation towards the eye of
the observer can be accurately estimated in the case of small objects of irregular
shape. Another drawback to the wet method is that all the parasites in a drop of
fluid may not adhere to the cover-slip ; it is clear that in certain kinds of work this is
“a very serious disadvantage.

The trophonucleus is of a type very common among flagellates, and is characterised
by a large central karyosome, in which almost all the chromatic material is con-
centrated. This is surrounded by a clear space, which is in turn bounded by a
faintly staining membrane or nuclear boundary—the word membrane is convenient,
