That this is so may easily be

recognised by imagining all the sunspots to have the same duration, each spot
also keeping the same area during the whole course of its life. It is obvious that
in this case the period having a length equal to the life of the spots would be
totally absent.

* A simple period is one represented by a circular function,


PROFESSOR A. SCHUSTER ON THE PERIODICITIES OF SUNSPOTS. 79

When we come to periods which are near to that of the solar rotation, periodicities
appear, owing to the fact that some of the spots persist during more than one rotation. This effect will, however, disappear when the period is well above that of the solar
rotation. When the periods come near to 1Â°5 years, the sub-periods of well-ascertained
periodicities make their presence felt.
