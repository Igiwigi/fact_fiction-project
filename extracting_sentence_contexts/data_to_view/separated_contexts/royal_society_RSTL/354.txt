What has been aid also explains why those, who have en-
deavoured to influence the heart by stimulating its\ nerves or
the parts of the brain from which they seem chiefly to origi-
nate, have failed. When indeed the connection of the nerves
of the heart is considered, it will be found to derive its nervous
influence'from every part of the neryous system, and not very

remarkably from any one part; a circumstance which par-
ticularly corresponds with the result of the foregoing experi-
ments. From the same facts we explain, why the heart is stimulated
through the nervous system after the power of this svstem
is 80 far weakened as no longer to convey the effect'of the
stimulus to the muscles of voluntary motion. As these obey
stimuli applied to only one part of the nervous system, if the
change in this part is not strong enough to produce the effect,
it cannot be assisted by any other. Thus I have found by
experiment, that a blow which affects the brain generally,
without materially injuring it, produces comparatively little
effect on the muscles of yoluntary motion, because no one
part suffers greatly, but it produces a great effect 'on the
heart, because it feels the sum of all the impressions.
