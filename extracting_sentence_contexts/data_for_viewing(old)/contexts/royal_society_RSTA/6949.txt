obtain dW/dI, = 1-28 and dW/dI, = 0-20 when J, = 4-25. Assuming that the value of W/dI,
remains constant, we can calculate the values of (dW/0J,)/(@W/d1,) for the whole range of
values of J, covered by the experiments. The results are given in table 9.

TABLE 9
1/r’ 0-5 0-6 0-7 0-8 3 5 7 9 ll
A 4:25 3-69 3:35 3-14 9-67 = 25-4 49:3 81-2 121
(AW/al,)|(AW/al,) 016 0:26 033 0:39 O12 0:06 0:04 0:03 0-035
It is seen that the manner in which (0W/d1,)/(@W/01,) varies with J, is very similar to that
indicated by the experiments described in §§ 2 to 10. The more rapid fall of (9W/01,)/(@W/a1,)
with increase of J, at the lower values of J, than that obtained in the previous experiments
may well result from the fact that the test-pieces used in the present experiments were
prepared from a different rubber specimen than those employed in the earlier experiments.
In calculating the values of (dW /dJ,)/(@W/0I,) given in table 9, we have taken over the
value of this ratio at J, = 4-25 from the experiment on pure shear conducted with a test-piece
which has a different formulation. It isshown, however, in appendix 5 (§ 24) that a somewhat
different choice of the value of (9W/0J,)/(0W/I,) at I, = 4-25 has relatively little effect on the
values of this ratio calculated from the experimental results for very different values of J,.
