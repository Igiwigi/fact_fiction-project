A similar anomaly is visible at the North Station ;
there is a deflection to the south of 6"*5, which is considerably more than that due to
the mass of the hill, as will appear hereafter. It is clear, therefore, that there is some other disturbing force acting at each of
these stations besides the attraction of Arthur's Seat, and which appears to produce
a general deflection to the south of about five seconds. The comparison of the observed and calculated latitudes of the observatory on the
Calton Hill serves to corroborate this fact. The latitude of this observatory, as
determined by observation, is

55* 57" 28-20. The latitude of the Trigonometrical Station on this hill, when referred to the same
spheroidal surface we have before mentioned, namely, that agreeing most nearly with
all the astronomically determined points in Great Britain, is 55* 57' 1751 : the
difference of latitude of these two points (taking the centre of the Altitude and Azi-
muth instrument of the observatory as the point whose latitude is above given) is 0-06,
80 that the calculated latitude of the Calton Hill observatory is

552/67" 1757,
which is less than the astronomical by 5-63; showing a deflection to the south of
that amount in existence at the Calton Hill.
