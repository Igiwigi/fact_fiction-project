A. A right and a left vena cava superior. B. A right yena caya superior and a left azygos venous trunk,

C. A right vena cava superior and a left cardiac venous trunk or coronary sinus,
the veins from the substance of the heart terminate, and which will then be recognized as the great coronary
vein, This is the condition in Man and in most Mammalia. In fact, in no mammalian does the left canal of
Cvy1xx entirely disappear. Even in cases where by far the largest portion of it is obliterated, that part which
runs along the posterior transverse furrow of the heart remains as the trunk of the cardiac veins.‚Äù I have

yeins in animals.
