Most of these previous attempts focused on correcting aberration on the emission detection
path of SIM systems. Some work has also analysed and corrected the aberrations of light paths
within the microscope, such as IsoSense. On the other hand, more detailed analysis regarding
the SIM illumination path, such as the effect of scattering and absorption of the complex thick
sample on the illumination pattern, are still required. SIM depends on tightly focused lights that
interfere with generating the grid-patterned illumination, which would be destroyed in a deep
sample. This issue is best demonstrated in figure 1a: when the incident light illuminates the
sample, scattering occurs and produces aberrations due to the inhomogeneous sample with a
different RI. Due to the aberrations, the illumination pattern projected inside the sample becomes
distorted, which will distort the reconstruction of SR images to misleading results.

Dong et al. developed SR fluorescence-assisted diffraction computational tomography (SR-
FACT), which combines label-free three-dimensional optical diffraction tomography (ODT) with
