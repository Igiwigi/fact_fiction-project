The caseI have now recorded, however, expunges of course
for ever from our books of physiology such an hypothesis, and
leaves us to discover a more plausible reason for. this peculiar

It moreover puts. to rest our doubts respecting a- pheno-

I allude to the fact of the ova of twins, and those of different
