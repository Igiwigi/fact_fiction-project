The resistance of both larvae and pupae of the three species of rat-fleas to cold is not
considerable, which is also supported by the experiments of Bacot (1914, p. 643) with
X. cheopis. They are extremely non-hardy like the early stages of insects infesting stored
products, which is in accord with the assumption that in ‘insects living under equable
conditions’, such as fleas, even a ‘moderate lowering of the temperature for a long period
only results in death’ (Uvarov 1931, p. 12). The fact that these stages cannot survive cold
storage of 2° C even for a few days can be utilized for the control of these rat-fleas. In these
closely allied species there are slight specific differences in the cold resistance of their
larvae and pupae. (b) Thresholds for the development of larvae and pupae and for the pupal
and the adult emergence

The theoretical developmental threshold taken is the average of values obtained by the
mathematical expression, K £5 (see Uvarov 1931, p. 23), where ¢ and 7 are the
different temperatures in degrees centigrade, d and D are the average number of days
required for the completion of development at the corresponding temperatures; their

reciprocals (developmental units) lie on the straight line, and K is the theoretical threshold.
