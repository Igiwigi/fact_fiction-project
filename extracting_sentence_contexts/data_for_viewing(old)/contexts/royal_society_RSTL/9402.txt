give the values of © — TI the obliquity increages from 0? to 90% The scale at the ide

of each figure is @ ws of degrees per hundred million years—e.g., if we had e=30®
and 7 about 57*, the obliquity would -be increasing at the rate of about 3* 45' per
hundred million years.

The behaviour of this family of curves is 80 very peculiar for high degrees of
viscosity, that I have given a special figure (viz.: Plate 36, fig. 3) for the viscosities
for which e=40®, 41%, 42?, 489, 44®.

The peculiarly rapid variation of the forms of the curves for these values of < is due
to the rising of the fortnightly tide into prominence for high degrees of vigcosity.
The matter of the spheroid is in fact 80 stiff that there is not time in 12 hours or a
day to raise more than a very 8mall tide, whilst in a fortnight, a considerable lagging
tide is raiged.

For e=44* the fortnightly tide has risen to give its maximum effect (6.e., 8in 4e"=1),
whilst the effects of the other tides only remain evident in the hump in the middle of
the curve. Between e=44* and 45* the ordinates of the curve diminish rapidly and
the hump is 8moothed down, 80 that when e=45* the curve is reduced to the
horizontal axis.

By the theory of the preceding paper,* the values of « when divided by 15 give
the corresponding retardation of the bodily semi-diurnal tide—e.g., when e=30* the
tide is two hours late. Also the height of the tide is cos 2e of the height of the
