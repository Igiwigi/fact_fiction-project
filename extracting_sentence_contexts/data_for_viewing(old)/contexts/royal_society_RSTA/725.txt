Figure 4 illustrates the influence of film thickness f on the wrinkling pattern at a constant
prestretch of [/Lo =2.25. The critical wavelength of primary wrinkles 4‘ increases with
increasing film thickness t from left to right. When the film thickness exceeds a certain threshold,
the failure stretch of the substrate material is not high enough to induce buckling.

Figure 5 compares the experimentally determined critical wavelength A“ as a function of film
thickness f with analytical and computational predictions. Our results confirm that the critical
wavelength linearly depends on the film thickness. Both analytical and computational models
agree well with the experiment. The linear perturbation analysis accounting for prestretch in the
substrate [15] slightly underestimates the critical wavelength. The computational model predicts
the correct relation between wavelength and thickness, but we observe a slight offset on the axis
of the ordinate. This can be attributed to the fact that we are limited to a finite size of elements.
Thus, the computational approach presented here cannot capture the behaviour towards the zero-
thickness limit [37].

In addition to the experimental results in the model problem of an elastomeric bilayer, we plot
the wavelength versus the thickness of all dehydrated fruits shown in figure 1. The data suggest
