Third, the distribution function of ellipsoidal aggregates
is significantly lower than that of spherical ones at the same time. In addition, it is shifted
toward larger values of crystal volumes. This is again explained by the fact that ellipsoidal
particles of the same volume with spherical particles have a larger surface area. Therefore, a
larger heat of crystallization is released from such a surface, and, as a result, ellipsoidal particles
grow faster and more quickly compensate for the supercooling. Under conditions of lesser
supercooling, the nucleation of new ellipsoidal particles is inhibited, which leads to a decrease in
the distribution function (as compared to spherical particles) and its shift towards larger values
of the dimensionless volume s.
