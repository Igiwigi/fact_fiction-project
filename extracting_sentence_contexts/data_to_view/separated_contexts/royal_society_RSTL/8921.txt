On the other
V hand, a very large proportion of the mustard-seeds boiled for thirty seconds germinated. i= The time of exposure in the case of this seed was doubled, trebled, and quadrupled,
z leaving till a residue of life. The fertile mustard-seeds gradually diminished in number
= as the time of boiling increased, but even after two minutes' boiling many of them
= germinated.
E And now comes a fact which I deem of some importance as regards the present inquiry. £ When the calico bag was abandoned, and the mustard-seeds were placed loosely in
£ water, 80 as to ensure not only the free communication to them of its temperature, but
| 5 free diffusion between the s0luble portions of the seeds and the surrounding liquid, not
A one of them escaped the ordeal of thirty seconds' boiling. In the first series of experi-
ments, the bag which held the seeds together not only exercised a protecting influence
1 itself, but it enabled the outside seeds to act as shields to the inside ones.
