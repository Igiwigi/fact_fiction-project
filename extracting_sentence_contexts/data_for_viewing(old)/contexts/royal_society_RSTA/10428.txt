errors of observation; it has thus been possible to measure with accuracy the
octahedron angle of potash-alum, although the faces of the octahedron are not
themselves present. It is not necessary to multiply examples: other crystals led to
3 the same result as that just described: namely, that the octahedron angle of potash-
alum is not liable to any variation, but that the octahedron faces themselves are
absent and their place is supplied by vicinal planes belonging to triakis-octahedra
which are liable to continual variations.

(6.) Tae Navure or tHE Vicrnat Faces on PorasH-ALUM AND AMMONIA-ALUM,

In the course of the present research many attempts were made to discover some
regularity in the angles or in the indices of the vicinal faces. That they possess
rational indices is rendered possible by the established fact that they lie in certain
well-defined zones, but the indices are in that case very complicated. A very well-
defined set of faces, for example, on one crystal represented a triakis-octahedron
inclined at 6’ 7” to the octahedron; its symbol would, therefore, be (hh), where
A = 1:00378, or something approaching (251.251.250); but it is impossible to say
whether these are the indices to be adopted, or some other numbers having nearly
the same ratio. Clearly the indices cease to be of much use when they are such
