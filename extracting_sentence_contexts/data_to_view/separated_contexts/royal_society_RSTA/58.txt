Moreover, the above assumption
of the boundedness |.A*pt| over B implies the one of r. The assumed boundedness of the first
integral implies the one of the absolute value of the right-hand side term, so that we can apply
the standard procedure adopted for the traction t [12], obtaining a non-standard action-reaction
principle (6.4). We find, in fact,

p(x,n) = —p(x, —n),

ie. :3
(y — yo) x (t(x, 1) — t(x, —n)) + A*(t(x,) — t(x,—n)) =0, : =

so that from (6.3) we find (6.4). 12
Not writing explicitly time for the sake of conciseness, we can use a tetrahedron type argument nee)

to show the linearity of p with respect to n, namely we show the existence of a second-rank tensor eae
A(x) such that a]
p(x,n) =A(x)n(x). a

Then we find : S
(y(x) — yo) x t+ A*r = (y(x) — yo) x P(x)n(x) + A*t = A(x)n(x),

so that
A*t(x, 1) = A(x)n(x) — (yx) — yo) x P(x)n(x),

which implies the linearity of r(x, ) with respect to n because A* does not depend on n. The localization of the integral balance of forces, namely equation (6.12), which is possible due
to the arbitrariness of 6, gives rise to the local balance (6.6). By contrast, the localization of the
integral balance (6.2) implies

A*(DivS + pt) =eP* — (Dv)*S,

which indicates the existence of a covector, say z, satisfying equation (6.7) with constraint (6.8).
