Eliminating time from the pair of relations m(t) and q(t) = qo cos wt, it is not difficult to obtain the
equation for the magnetization curve of an AFM nanoparticle in weak fields

Clearly, this is the equation of an ellipse, whose lengths of the semiaxes and the angle of Ds
inclination are determined by the real and imaginary parts of the dynamic susceptibility. 3
The magnetization curves of an AFM particle in strong fields can be obtained only by : Pe
numerical integration of the complete set (3.8). The results of calculations for the field amplitude :8

At high temperatures, the magnetization curves, as expected, have an equilibrium shape: they a)
are exactly described by formulae (2.12)-(2.14). Evidently, this is due to the fact that foro ~1
all relaxation times are of the order 19 (figure 5a), and, therefore, in the considered frequency
range wty <1 these relaxation times are much shorter than the period 27/w of the exciting field. Notably, the spin-flop transition under intense thermal fluctuations is completely smeared. A decrease of temperature leads to the so-called dynamic magnetic hysteresis: at o = 10 and
20, the magnetization curves turn into loops, provided the particle has a spontaneous magnetic
moment, see lines for 6 4 0.
