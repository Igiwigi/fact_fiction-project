The measurement
process that selects a system in the state b’ and produces it in the null state, _

M(O,b") = 9(0), (326) i=

can be considered as the annihilation of a system in the state b’; and the production of a system in a)
the state a’ following its selection from the null state, a

M(a’,0)=0(’), (3.27) Dy

can be considered as the creation of a system in the state a’, if the null state is understood as a sort [8
of ‘vacuum’ state. Thus, M(a’, b’) is indiscernible from the compound process of the annihilation a
of a system in the state b’ followed by the creation of a system in the state a’: ae)

M(a’,b')=Va')o(V’). (3.28)

The extension of the measurement algebra to include the null state supplies the properties of the
w and ® symbols:

wa’) =o’) (3.29)
and
o(V')' = 00). (3.30)
Furthermore,
wa )w(b') = O(a’) O(b') =0,  M(a', D') O(c) = Va’) M(0',c’), (3.31)
whereas
Ma’, bw (c')= (b' |c)wa’),  Wa')\M(0',c’) = (a |b’) @(c) (3.32)
and
G(a')h (b') = (a |b')M(0). (3.33)

Schwinger views quantum state disturbance in measurement as objectively significant
‘because at a higher level of classical measurement, disturbances produced by a measurement
can be admitted if they are known and therefore could be compensated for’ [15]. He viewed the
difference in the quantum case as due to the fact that

the measurement act involves a strong interaction [at the atomic level]. I repeat: on the
microscopic scale it is necessarily strong because we cannot cut the strengths of the charges
in half; we cannot change the properties of these fundamental particles; we must accept
them as they are—and so the measurement unavoidably produces a large disturbance,
which we cannot correct for in each individual instance, for we cannot control what
happens in each individual event in any detail... the program of computing what the effect
of the disturbance was and correcting for it is, in general, impossible. Accordingly, the
two basic tenets of the theory of macroscopic measurement are both violated.
