It has been shown that this male-like behaviour is probably due to the secretion
by the ovaries of male sex hormone (Bullough & Carrick 1940). This secretion also results
in the change of colour of the beak to yellow, a feature which is really a male secondary
sexual character (Witschi & Miller 1938). The degree of maleness, which is probably merely
an expression of the amount of male sex hormone produced, varies considerably in different
females, a fact which is shown in two ways. In some females the beak begins to turn yellow
early (October) and the change proceeds rapidly, but in others the beak may still be
entirely dark at the beginning of January. Similarly, some females, which in all cases had
partly yellow beaks, sing hard while others appear not to sing at all.
