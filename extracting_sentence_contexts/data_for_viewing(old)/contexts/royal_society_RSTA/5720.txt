The central idea of this review is to consider quantum field theory models relevant for
particle physics and replace the fermionic matter in these models by a bosonic one. This
is mostly motivated by the fact that bosons are more ‘accessible’ and easier to manipulate
for experimentalists, but this ‘substitution’ also leads to new physics and novel phenomena.
It allows us to gain new information about among other things confinement and the
dynamics of the deconfinement transition. We will thus consider bosons in dynamical lattices
corresponding to the bosonic Schwinger or Zz Bose-Hubbard models. Another central idea
of this review concerns atomic simulators of paradigmatic models of particle physics theory
such as the Creutz—Hubbard ladder, or Gross-Neveu—Wilson and Wilson—Hubbard models.
This article is not a general review of the rapidly growing field—it reviews activities related to
quantum simulations for lattice field theories performed by the Quantum Optics Theory group
at ICFO and their collaborators from 19 institutions all over the world. Finally, we will briefly
describe our efforts to design experimentally friendly simulators of these and other models
relevant for particle physics.
