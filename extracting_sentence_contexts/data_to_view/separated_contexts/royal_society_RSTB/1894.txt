We obtained very good results by making up these fixatives in
50 per cent. sea-water. When the projecting papilla are about to enter on their first stage of division the
nucleolus is seen to become vacuolated, although it does not disappear till just before
the grouping of the chromosomes in the equatorial plane, at which stage we could
no longer distinguish it. But the fact must not be lost sight of that it loses part
of its contents at a very early period of the karyokinetic process.
