cubic inches of silicated fluoric gas, and 60 of volatile alkali
(barom. go, therm. 60) in. a small glass jar over mercury,
being carefully collected and introduced into water, afforded
five grains of pure silex, weighed after being well washed and
heated to redness,

The saline solution, since part of the silex of the silicated
fluoric acid gas is separated during its production, appears to
be a subsilicated fluat, or a combination of subsilicated fluoric
acid and ammonia. Another mode of making it, more directly
proves that-this is its composition. When ammonia is added
to the subsilicated fluoric acid in -excess, this salt is formed
without any precipitation. From these facts, it may be con-
cluded, that independent of water, which appears to be essen-
tial to its existence, 100 parts of it consist of

28.34 ammonia
71.66 acid

Subsilicated fluat of ammonia has a pungent saline taste, It
Just perceptibly reddens litmus paper. Slowly evaporated, it
forms small transparent and brilliant crystals. The largest I
could obtain, appeared to be tetrahedral prisms. The solid salt
