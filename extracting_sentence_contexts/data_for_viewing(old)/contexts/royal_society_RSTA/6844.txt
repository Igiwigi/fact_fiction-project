PART III. THERMAL PROPERTIES VARYING WITH TEMPERATURE

8. THE EQUATIONS OF HEAT CONDUCTION WHEN THERMAL
PROPERTIES VARY WITH TEMPERATURE

As already mentioned, the thermal properties of steel vary considerably with temperature,
and one of the main objects of the present work was the development of means of evaluating
solutions of the equations of heat conduction in which this variation of thermal properties
could be adequately taken into account.

The thermal properties of steel are not even functions of the temperature only, but depend
on the way it is and has been changing. This is shown, for example, by the fact that the
transformation which occurs in the neighbourhood of 720Â° C is observed to take place ata
temperature which depends on the previous thermal history of the material, and not at a
fixed temperature.

The present work, however, is mainly concerned with the treatment of the variation of
thermal properties in so far as they can be regarded as functions of the temperature only,
and this restriction will be understood unless the converse is explicitly stated. In practice,
this restriction is not a severe one in the present state of knowledge, since the data at present
available on the thermal properties of steel are inadequate to enable quantitative calcula-
tions to be made on any more accurate basis, and a practical method of taking into account
continuously the variation of the thermal properties with temperature is already a very
substantial advance on previously available possibilities, An outline of some possibilities of
