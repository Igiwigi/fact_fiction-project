However, it is
helpful to clarify the meaning of ‘suffices to deceive it’. In par-
ticular, the relaxed selection hypothesis does not rest on the
assumption that the differences between mimics and
models are unnoticed. In fact, it has long been known that humans are capable of
probabilistically detecting even the smallest of differences
(such as whether a weight is lighter or heavier than a 100 g
standard [25]). Instead, we should recognize that it is not
what the receiver believes, but how it acts that shapes selection
on the mimic’s phenotype. Why would a predator ever act against its beliefs?
