above indication is omitted, and the height is said to be 83 feet 24 inches above a, fixed
mark on Waterloo Bridge; or © above the mean level of the sea (presumed about)
95 feet.” The discordance between the 81 feet and the 100 feet is easily accounted
for by the fact that the old barometer, prior to 1823, was fixed up in the Council-room
of the Society, or the contiguous ante-room : but when Mr. Daxtz1's barometer was
finished, at the end of the year 1822, it was fixed up in the closet adjoining the library,
on the floor which is immediately over the Council-room : the assumed difference in
the elevation of the two floors (namely, 19 feet) having since been ascertained to be
correct.

With respect to the new reference of altitude, namely, the fixed mark at Waterloo
Bridge, much doubt has frequently been expressed about its existence, since no person
had been able to discover it. The fact is that there is no mark, in the common ac-
ceptation of the term; but the intended reference is nevertheless more conspicnaous,
more durable, and more convenient than any mark that could have been inscribed by
bands. This standard mark, or leyel, was fixed on by Mr. Bevan in the year 1827,
at the request of the Council of this Society : and the same gentleman also ascertained
the difference of level between that mark and the floor of the council room. As his
Report on the occasion has neyer yet been made public, and will throw the best light
on the subject, as well as be interesting to many persons, I shall here subjoin his
letter to the Council, detailing the whole circumstances of the case.

© GenTLEMEN,—Pursuant to the order I had the honour to receive at the close of
« your last-Session, I have selected a permanent and definite point of reference, or bench-
* mark, for heights at Waterloo Bridge; and have determined the difference of level
