often radially symmetrical. Thus there remains only the pinnate insertion of the
septa, and this is not a constant generic feature in certain Rugose genera.

The conservatism in favour of upholding an Order, M. rugosa, is a paleontologist’s
prejudice. He wants, for convenience, a general title under which the Paleozoic
genera can be classified, and so long as it does not make much disturbance in the con
ceptions of Paleozoic genera, he is not unwilling to admit a few Mesozoic genera
under the same title. But he finds it impossible to recognize systematically that the
paired development of the mesenteries in the embryo of recent types, and their
pinnate insertion with respect to the embryonic “ main” and “ alar” invaginations of
the body-wall, is exactly the same feature as was shown by Palaeozoic septa.

Nevertheless the fact is there, and the embryonic development of Astroides repeats
in rapid stages the phylogenetic history of its race. Few more beautiful examples
can be aftorded of this general evolutionary truth.

Pinnate insertions of the radial invaginations in which septa were deposited may
therefore be regarded as a primitive character in the Madreporaria, which, ag time
went on, gave place to cyclical insertion of the septal invaginations. It was a change
attained at quite different periods in nearly related genera.

Systematically, I would erect no order, no family, sub-family, or genus on this
ground alone. But when pinnate insertion in the mature calyces of certain Paleozoic
genera is correlated with a number of other systematic features, which give a general
character to the corallum differing from that of any subsequent form, there is reason
