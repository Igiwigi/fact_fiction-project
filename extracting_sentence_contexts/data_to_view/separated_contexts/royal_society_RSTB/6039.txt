One of
the characteristic features of the Primate brain is the caudal extension of the pons
to include the entering trigeminal nerve within its fibres. In the highest Primates
the pons even covers the corpus trapezoideum so that the six, seventh, and eighth
nerves are attached immediately against its caudal border, and their fibres pursue
a horizontal course dorsal to its posterior extension. This fact appears to have been
pointed out for the first time by Hep (1893), who regarded it as characteristic for the
chimpanzee and Man. The Edentates, whose life so closely resembles that of
Echidna, have also a marked retro-trigeminal pontine development. In the Monotremes the only pons present lies wholly behind the fifth nerve, and
in Echidna it covers the anterior part of the corpus trapezoideum, so that the sixth,
seventh, and eighth nerves are attached immediately against its posterior border,
