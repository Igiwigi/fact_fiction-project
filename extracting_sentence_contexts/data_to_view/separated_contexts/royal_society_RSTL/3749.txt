These are points on which, perhaps, at present we cannot form a decisive opinion. But. the fact that the ellipticity, to whatever cause it may be due, undergoes the
changes just mentioned, affords an interesting comparison with theory, and may aid
future advances towards a knowledge of the nature of the action which produces
elliptic polarization in these cases. Apparatus and Method of experimenting. The arrangement of my apparatus was, essentially, as follows : the light was polar-
ized by transmission through a Nicol-prism ; this was attached to a small graduated
arc, 80 that it could be adjusted to throw the polarized ray at any required incidence
on the sarface under examination ; and could he turned about its own axis, 80 that
the plane of polarization might be inclined to that of incidence.
