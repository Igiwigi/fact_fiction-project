The nature of the oblique growths or departures from the normal varies in the
ditferent regions. In the skull the changes are obviously due to pressure or stresses ;
apart from their tendency to grow, the structures are quite passive. ‘The eye is not
pulled into its new position by the frontals or its own muscles; it is demonstrably
pushed over by the growth of the subocular ligament or the prefrontal. These again
are constrained to grow obliquely by outside pressure. Where rupture of the tissues
is apparent, it is not due simply to the structures growing apart ; they are definitely
forced apart (e.g., frontals in Bothus, frontal and prefrontal in Pleuronectoids and
Rhomboids, vomer and ethmoid in Solea). The parasphenoid, the trabecular and
ethmoid cartilages are diverted from their ordinary longitudinal and vertical
directions of growth, not by mutual pressure or internal interference, but by
external forces. In fact, it is impossible to give a satisfactory description of the
asymmetries of the skull without reference to the external pressure and com-
pression. The ordinary course of development provides no motive force or forces
for the disruptive changes we see in the skull of Flat-fishes.

Extra-eranially the oblique growth results from tension or strains ; an active force
or factor is discernible. For example, the upper jaw and structures connected there-
with are pulled to one side (¢.g., in Solea and Symphurus) and the oblique tension is
so great, that both the muscles conveying it and the structures under tension are
displaced and may be ruptured (e.g., cheek muscles on one side, separation of pre-
maxillaries, loosening of palatine attachments, and re-formation of jaws in Solea and
Symphurus). The base of this tension lies along the hyomandibular arch, which is
not a fixed structure. Throughout metamorphosis this arch through its connections
