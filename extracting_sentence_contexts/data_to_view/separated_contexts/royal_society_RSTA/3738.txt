Moreover, direct numerical simulations suggest that the THG response takes place at the
MD resonance of an isolated silicon disc, whereas at the ED resonance the nonlinear signal
appears to be rather weak (figure 4). The calculations provide the same value of the TH intensity
enhancement from the nanostructured area in comparison with the intensity from the substrate,
which is observed in the experiment (figure 2b). A significant enhancement of nonlinear process
efficiency is also predicted at the MQ resonance; an experimental verification of this fact could
be interesting for ultraviolet photonics applications. An apparent red spectral shift of the TH
signal with respect to the spectral position of the MD mode-associated dip is consistent with the
integrated electric field in figure 3.

4. Conclusion

We have studied the THG from silicon nanodiscs at their Mie-type ED and MD resonances.
