coming from the spores. They are, as he records, pyriform and uniflagellate. The
second kind of gamete, the very small one, we consider to be the product of the
zoosporangia which develop in the root hairs. Jones thinks both types are true
gametes, and therefore that both are capable of fusion to form zygotes. According
to the life eycle which we believe takes place, such a conclusion would entail two fusions,
one prior to infection of the root hairs, and another in the subsequent infection of the
plant tissues as a whole. If this is true, at some stage in the life cycle two separate
reduction divisions would be required.

It has previously been pointed out by Marre and Trson (33) (34) (35), OsBornz (48),
Wince (64), and others (6) (32), that the young organism found in freshly-infected
roots was not larger than the swarm spore which emerged from the spore, and this
fact presented a grave difficulty against the conclusion that this structure was a zygote
derived from the fusion of two swarm spores. We have never been able to satisfy
ourselves that the swarm spores did fuse in pairs, though at one time we felt that this
could be the only way in which a doubling of the chromosomes could occur. P. brassice
presents a new aspect of the problem.


AND METHOD OF INFECTION OF PLASMODIOPHORA BRASSIC#. 301

We now believe that the swarm spore enters the root hair without fusion, forms a
small plasmodium, and then develops into a comparatively small number of zoo-
sporangia. These zoosporangia are larger than the spores, but superficially resemble
them. â€˜The original nucleus of the zoosporangium divides mitotically and several
