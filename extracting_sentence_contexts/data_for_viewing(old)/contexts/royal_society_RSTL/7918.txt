tron.—This metal in combination with cyanogen in the ferrocyanide and ferricyanide
of potassium has apparently a higher equivalent than in the compounds where it plays
the part of a base.

Manganese—This element exists in a highly oxidized condition in permanganate of
potassium. If O be taken at 2:9, the refraction-equivalent, of manganese will be 26:2.

Chromium. —This als exists in combination with oxygen in the chromates and bi-
chromates. There it has a refraction-equiyalent of about 23.

* In cstimating metals from their chlorides, the equivalent 9-9 has been taken where the chloride is decom-
posed by water, 10-7 where it is soluble without decomposition. This arbitrary distinction seems to haye a
foundation in fact.

In the oxychloride (Table IIT.) it seems to have about the same power as in the
chromium salts, viz. 16-5.

Mercury.—This metal presents greater difficulties in the estimation of its refraction-
equivalent than any other in the list, and a comparison of its value, as deduced from all
its compounds, only increases the difficulty.
