The writer has also made experiments on the change produced in the ionisation at
the outside surface of a platinum tube in air when hydrogen was allowed to diffuse
from the inside of the tube. A brief abstract of the results obtained has already
been published? ; the present section gives a more detailed account of the experi-
ments. These platinum tube experiments, in the opinion of the writer, settle
decisively a number of questions which have been, or might be, raised with regard
to the origin of the ionisation produced by hot platinum. For instance, H. A.
Wusont has suggested that the negative ionisation produced by hot platinum in
air is due to traces of occluded hydrogen which are retained by the wire in a very
persistent manner. If this were the case, the small negative leak in air would be
enormously increased by allowing any considerable quantity of hydrogen to diffuse
out of the wire from inside. As a matter of fact, when hydrogen was allowed to
diffuse out of the walls of the tube at a rate corresponding to 2 cub. centims. at
