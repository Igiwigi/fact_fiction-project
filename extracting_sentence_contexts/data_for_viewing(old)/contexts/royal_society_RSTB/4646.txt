shorter anterior regenerations and longer posterior regenerations, as measured by the
number of segments in each, than those regenerated from four segments, which agrees
with the view that regeneration proceeds until the original segments are restored to
the position which they occupied in the parent worm.

If the figures for the percentage of tail regeneration are considered in connection
with the total number of segments in the specimens, it will be seen that, on the
whole, the larger specimens with most segments have the highest percentages of

segments in the posterior regenerations, which would naturally follow from the fact
that the posterior regeneration continues to grow after the anterior one is complete.
Thus, amongst specimens from four original segments, there are seven specimens in
which the total number of segments exceeds forty, and, for all of these, the relative
number of segments in the posterior regeneration exceeds 48 per cent. In those
derived from three originals, there are only two specimens with more than forty
segments, in one of which the posterior regeneration is 53 per cent., in the other
28 per cent.

At the same time, specimens with a high percentage of posterior regenerated
segments are quite as frequent amongst the smaller specimens as they are amongst
the large ones, as the following figures show :â€”
