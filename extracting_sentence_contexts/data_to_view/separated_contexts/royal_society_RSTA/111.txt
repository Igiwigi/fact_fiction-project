It is true that the definition of event used in figure 6 is also based
on a threshold, namely ¢, however, looking at the interevent times for avalanches S > Sy, we
retain the same definition (i.e. the events for which ¢(t) > #) while neglecting the computation
of tw avalanches smaller than Sj,. Thus P[t»|S¢,] and Pltwlex] refers to two different statistical
properties of the system that are not related to one another. This example highlights the fact
that the scale transformation e, — A€, cannot be considered a coarse-grained transformation in the

interevent times between consecutive events where €(t) > €,. where €(t) is the rate of energy dissipation and e,, is defined
