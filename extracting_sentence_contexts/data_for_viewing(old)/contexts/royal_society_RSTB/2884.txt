relation to them. The actual connection of these series by descent must remain open,

+ Considerable importance is attached by Jerrrey and by LANG to the presence or absence of the basal
cell of the archegonium as a comparative feature, and their view is based on the constancy of this character
in Lycopods and Ferns ; but in Aquisetum (CAMPBELL, ‘ Mosses and Ferns,’ p. 430) “usually, but not always,
no basal cell is formed.” Again, in Lycopodium the biciliate form of spermatozoid is not constant: there
may be three cilia. (BRUCHMANN, /.c., p. 32; GorpeL, ‘ Organographie,’ p. 887.) These facts may in
some degree affect the comparative value of such characters.

t Compare ENGLEr’s ‘Syllabus,’ p. 65, where this position is assigned to them, though others may
prefer to give them a still more isolated position, as approximating more towards the Filicinean series.

§ The Psilotacew are placed in the Lycopodiales Eligulate in ENGLER’s ‘ Syllabus’ (p. 64).

|| Compare ENGLER’s ‘Syllabus,’ p. 63, where they are placed as a third series of the Filicales. I prefer
to give them a position independent of the Ferns altogether. This independence of the Ophioglossales will
harmonise with the anatomical results (FARMER and FREEMAN, ‘ Annals of Botany,’ vol. 13, p. 421-444).
