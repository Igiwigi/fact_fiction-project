-2 mentation of the sound, such as occurred with the greatest distinctness on various
E gubsequent occasions during violent rain.
2 The influence of © beats” was tried on June 3, by throwing the horns slightly out
S of unison ;-but though the beats rendered the sound characteristic, they did not seem
z to augment the range. At a distance from the station curious fluctuations of intensity
E were noticed. Not only did the different blasts vary in strength, but sudden swellings
& and fallings off, even of the same blast, were observed. 'This was not due to any variation
65 on the part of the instruments, but purely to the changes of the medium trayersed by
S the sound. What these changes were hall be indicated subsequently.
During the inquiry various shiftings of the horns and reeds were resorted to, with a
Q view of bringing out their maximum power. The range of our best horns on June 10
was 82 miles. The guns at this distance were very feeble. 'That the loudness of the
sound depends on the shape of the gun was proved by the fact that thus far the howitzer,
with a 3-lb. charge, proved more effective than the other guns. In the axis of the horns
the sound manifests its greatest strength, falling sensibly off as the angular distance
from the axis is augmented. Now the whistles have no such axes, but send their
s0und-waves with equal strength in all directions. Hence, as the horns pointed
8eaward, near the line joining the Foreland and the South Sand Head light-yessel on
the one hand, and that joining the Foreland and the Admiralty Pier on the other, the
whistles were sometimes more than a match for the horns.
