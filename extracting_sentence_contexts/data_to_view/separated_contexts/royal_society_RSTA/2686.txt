The latter bifurcates from the UV fold as it must,
given the wavenumber of the background oscillations at location A. Observe also that this branch
undergoes several large excursions prior to termination. However, throughout these oscillations
the number of identical peaks on the half domain remains at 13 (the three peaks near x = 0 are
taller) despite the fact that the wavelength of this periodic part changes along the branch thereby
squeezing the taller peaks. The number of these back and forth excursions grows with the domain
size. By L=20Ar (figure 5b), the branch develops a notable Maxwell point that appears to be
associated with the formation of a homoclinic connection between the PP state that bifurcates
from the UV fold (cyan curve) and itself.
