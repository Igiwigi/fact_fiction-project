MR. MALLET ON THE TRANSIT-VELOCITY OF BARTHQUAKE WAVES. G6T9

— a view to the interesting question of the relation between the theoretic velocity of

- transmission, if the rock were all solid and homogeneous (v= V 2q HS £ being that

r modulus), and the actual velocity found by the preceding experiments.

— Tn their direct relation to Seisxmology the interest of the foregoing results is not as
- great as when some Fears since I commenced these experiments. At that period no
knowledge whatever existed as to the relation that subsists in nature between the
velocity of transit and the velocity of the particles in wave-movement in actual earth-
 quakes. Geological observers, in fact, did not appear to be aware of any such physical
D distinction ; and those who were 80, presumed that the velocity of the particles was like
Sthat of transit, extremely great, and that some simple relation would probably be found
gbetween them.
= The first determinations of velocity of the particles in wave-moyement that have ever
Sheen made, namely, those by myself of the great Neapolitan Earthquake of 1857, have
Sdissipated this notion, however, and proved that the velocity of the particles in even
Sthe greatest shocks, is extremely small, not exceeding 20 feet per second in very great
Zearthquakes, and probably never having reached 80 feet per second in any shock that
has occurred in history. No simple relation appears as yet between the transit-velocity
Sand that of the particles; and, however interesting and important both to general physics
Sand to Seisgmology may be further determinations with exactness of the former, it is to
*Zthe observation and measurement of the latter, by the methods pointed out in the Report
