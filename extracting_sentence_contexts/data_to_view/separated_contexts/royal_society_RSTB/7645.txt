Holotype: length 10-4 mm.; height 9-6 mm.; thickness (both valves)
7-5 mm. Remarks. Although the hinge is not seen, and although the shell is less trapezoidal-in
outline and the umbos not so large as in Cardium hatchetigbeense Aldrich from the Eocene
of Alabama (the type species of Schedocardia), the Pakistan species is referred to the subgenus
Schedocardia on account of the nature of the ornament (evidently an important criterion in
the classification of the members of the Cardiidae), and of the fact that it is a little wider
than high. Stewart (1930) states that ‘the name Schedocardia is probably better used only
for the American species and possibly species from the Burman and Japanese Eocene
mentioned under P. brewerii’. The Japanese species is Cardium mitkense Nagao, and the
Burmese species is C. thetkegyinense Cotter.
