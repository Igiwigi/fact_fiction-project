The above was made with young bark whose liber contained parenchymatous as well
as woody cells. In older bark the difference would be still more marked. The fact, of
the quinine being contained mainly in the exterior cellular tissue is in harmony with its
occurrence in newly forming structures, as detailed above.

T have never yet succeeded, although many attempts have been made, in conyerting
quinine into cinchonidine, or vice vers@, Nevertheless many phenomena in the living
plant point to the conclusion that a real change of quinine into cinchonidine occurs
therein. The order of the appearance of the alkaloids in renewing bark, the compara-
tive absence of quinine in the highly organized liber, the changes produced by sunshine
and heat, all point to 8uch conversion as a legitimate hypothesis; it is one that is not
contradicted by a single fact, and is in harmony with observyations made with very diverse
species of cinchona, and with the chemical similarity in the behaviour and properties of
the two substances.

Influence of Sunlight and Heat on growing Cinchona-bark.

PasTEURÂ® first pointed out that quinine, cinchonine, &c. are converted, under the
influence of a high temperature, into the isomeric uncrystallizable alkaloids, quinicine
and cinchonicine. He also showed that the same change was effected by exposing the
salts of the alkaloids to sunshine. On these grounds he asserted that the plan of drying
cinchona-bark in the sunshine, as practised in South America, is injurious to its quality.

Many experiments made during the last two years have amply corroborated these
