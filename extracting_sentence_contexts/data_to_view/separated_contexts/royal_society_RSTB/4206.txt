length, it is triradiate, the two dorsal radii running parallel and ventral to the
prearticular, while the third arm, which persists in the adult together with the
posterior dorsal portion, forms a semicircular rod of bone with the concavity towards
the back of the skull. Palate and Upper Jaw. The palate, beyond the fact that the palatal plates of the maxilla now meet in the
mid-ventral line, is little changed. The anterior palatine foramen is seen bounded
posteriorly, and for the most part laterally, by the palatal plates of the maxille, The
posterior palatine foramina are seen bounded by the maxille and the palatines ; they
are very different in appearance to those of the adult, as they are small and some
distance from the middle line. Also, the palate being much arched laterally, they
open inwards and not downwards as in the adult.
