In the cuttings which stood in their
natural position, vegetation proceeded with most vigour at the
points most elevated; but, in the inverted cuttings, it grew more
and more languid as it became distant from the ground, and

height of four feet. The new wood also, which was generated
by these inverted cuttings, accumulated above the bases of the
annual shoots, as in the preceding instances. These facts appear to prove, that the vessels of plants are not
equally well calculated to carry their contents in opposite di-
rections ; and, I think, afford some grounds to suspect that the
vessels of the bark, like those which constitute the venous
system of animals, (to which they are in many respects analo-
gous,) may be provided with valves, whose extreme minuteness
has concealed them from observation. The experiments, and still more, the Plates, of HaLts, have
