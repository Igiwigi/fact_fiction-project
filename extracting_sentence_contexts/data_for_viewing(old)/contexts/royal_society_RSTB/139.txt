be quite possible, if not highly probable, that it does, we cannot dismiss this as an
impossible cause of the migration of the sexual cells until we have some definite
grounds for saying it is not.

The Ova.â€”The pseudopodia and the peculiar stalk of the ova of Millepora are not
altogether unknown in other types. Thus, the ova of Hydra (11) and Halisarca (17)
possess pseudopodia, and, according to WEISMANN, the ova of some Tubularian Hydroids
wander in the colony in an amoeboid manner.

The stalk of the ovum of Millepora, to which a similar structure exists in Myrio-
thela (3), simply serves to keep the ovum in its proper position in the canal. It seems
to be sometimes completely withdrawn when the ovum migrates, and to be re-formed
when the ovum comes to rest. It is, in fact, simply a pseudopodium modified to keep
the ovum in its position in the endoderm.

The Maturation and Impregnation of the Ovum do not offer any striking pecu-
liarities. The formation of the nuclear spindles was difficult to observe, as my
specimens were not specially prepared for this kind of minute histological investigation ;
but from what I was able to observe in well-stained specimens, with a high power, I
should think that the history of the formation of the nuclear spindles does not differ
materially from what has been described by other authors in other ova.

That the two polar globules are not always seen at the same point is not peculiar
to Millepora (cf: Carnoy (6), vol. 2).
