nesia, of alumina for lime, and of alumina for silica. In the
XXXlst volume, page 246, there is a memoir, by GuyToN DE
Morveav, upon a similar subject;* and he there reports some
experiments of his own, by which he was induced to think,
that the earths do really possess a chemical attraction for one
another. Since that time, the affinity 'of the earths has been
received among chemists as an undoubted fact; and, at the end
of Mr. Kirwan's Essay on the Analysis of mineral Waters, we
find a list of earthy salts which produce a reaction upon one
another, 's$upposed to be caused by an affinity that tends to
unite their 'bases, in the form of a- precipitate, insoluble in the
acids. 'Some other detached observations are to be found, in the
Fournal de Physique, and in the Annales de Chimie. The fact
is certainly one of the most important in the docimastic art,
and merits all the attention of the skilful in that branch.

conclusions drawn by GuyTon. I had myself repeated the greater
