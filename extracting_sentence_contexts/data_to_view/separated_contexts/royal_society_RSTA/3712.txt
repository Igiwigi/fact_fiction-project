The variation of the streamwise velocity in these LMPs and HMPs
could differ by as much as 20% from the spanwise-averaged mean velocity. The variation of the in-plane velocities of the counter-rotating vortices was not nearly as severe,
having magnitudes of approximately 2% of Uso. This value is in fact comparable to the turbulence
intensity, uâ€™/U>o, which ranged from 1.5% in the free stream to 10% at the wall. This means that,
while the secondary flows dramatically alter the streamwise velocity magnitude, they would not
severely impact the mean flow angle. The generation of secondary flows has serious ramifications for flows over arbitrary surfaces
as even apparently random surfaces can develop secondary flows [33].
