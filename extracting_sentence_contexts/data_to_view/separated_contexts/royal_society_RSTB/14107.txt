This review focuses on methods to investigate visual
opsins, as they are the most comprehensively studied to
date. Nonetheless, these methods have the potential to be
easily extended to examine the functions of extraocular
opsins. In fact, HeAS was primarily developed to evaluate
the light-dependency of vertebrate non-visual opsins
expressed in the brain [28]. Similarly, heterologous systems
expressing the non-visual Rh7 opsin were used to characterize
their role as circadian photoreceptors in the brain [133,134]. Other non-canonical functions of opsins in thermosensation,
hearing and taste are more challenging to research, although,
in principle, these in vitro systems could be adapted with
other recording assays to test a range of ligands and responses.
