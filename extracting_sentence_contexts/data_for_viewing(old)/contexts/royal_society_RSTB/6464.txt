disposition that the function of the multipolar ganglion cells is to discharge the
stimuli received from the primary sense cells into the longitudinally running fibrillae
of the subepithelial plexus. The presence of a centripetal dendrite and of the
characteristically orientated pair of dendrites suggests very strongly a polarization
of the ganglion cell, the impulses travelling from the centripetal to the longitudinal
dendrite to be discharged into the fibrillae of the radial cord. In the deeper parts
of the cord, the function of the association ganglion cell is more restricted. There
is no longer any necessity for the development of a centripetal fibre, for the body
of the ganglion cell is far removed from the primary sense cells. The sole function
of the bipolar element is to transmit impulses along the length of the cord, for which
purpose bipolarity of the cell would be induced.

The Neurofibrillaa—Reference has already been made to the fact that the greater
part of the thickness of the radial nerve cord is made up of the subepithelial plexus
of neurofibrillae. Most of these fibrillae belong to the association ganglion cells,
but the central fibres of the primary sense cells contribute, to some extent, to the
total fibrillar substance.

One may say, in general terms, that the fibrillae of the radial cord run in a
longitudinal direction although, as has been seen, the central fibres of the sensory
cells, in the first part of their course, run at right angles to this axis. A series of
horizontal sections through the cord (figs. 4A, 4B, 4C) shows quite clearly that there
are three distinct zones within the fibrillar substance. We may distinguish these
as follows :—
