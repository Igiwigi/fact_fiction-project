that is interior als is lined by vibratile epithelium ; that its contents are chemically
and morphologically identical with those of the visceral cavity of the same animal.
It may be mentioned here as a remarkable fact, that in the Sipunculidz (at Jeast
such is the result of my examinations repeated with the utmost care upon many scores
of living specimens) the vessel which rests upon one side of the cesophagus is not
accompanied by a venous correlate on the opposite aspect of the cylinder, nor by
one parallel to itseIf on the same side. It is a single channel, which cannot be traced
to a distal system of capillaries.

In the Sipunculide there are no © Polian vesicles” attached to or developed from
this vessel, The appearance of © vesicles” arises from the bulged knots into which
the vessel irregularly contracts under the stimulus of the air at the moment of laying
open the general cavity. To these facts, as illustrative of the singular conditions
under which © the circulation of the blood ” is first evolved in the ascensive progres-
sion of animal structures, the highest physiological interest attaches.

After this short historical introduction, the several characters of these three systems
of fluids may be more carefully examined.

Blood-proper in the Echinoderms.—In the Asteriade and Echinide this fluid is
colourless, and charged only with irregularly organized corpuscles ; when placed under
the microscope, it is quite impossible to distinguish these latter from those found in
the peritoneal fluid, or in the water-vascular system of the same individual. In Uraster
papposa, as already stated, the circular vessel and the radial trunks are s0 large and
accessible as to be readily injected. Two methods may be adopted to determine the
