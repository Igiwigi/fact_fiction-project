adheres very firmly to the apex of the rostellum. It is not acted upon by iodine
beyond being faintly browned.

The membrane of which the walls of the loculi are composed is excessively thin
and transparent, and presents a beautiful appearance under the microscope ; each line
marking the position of the septa being bordered with a band, which is composed
of excessively fine, straight, oblique or wavy striz, which are placed at right angles
to the septa.

The position and function of this glandular secretion naturally recall the theory
once proposed to explain the impregnation of Orchidew, which assumes that ope-
ration to take place in many species of the Order through the glands at the base
of the pollen-masses; I therefore sought diligently for any facts that might coun-
tenance such a supposition in Listera, but in vain, I was unable to detect pollen-
tubes in the glandular body at any period; and I repeatedly spread the pollen
over the viscous matter when under the microscope, but without any effect ; on the
other hand, those pollen-grains that were placed on the stigma emitted boyaux
abundantly.

In a morphological point of view, the exact nature of this complicated and highly
organized rostellum is not very evident ; but it may be remarked, that its position
would suggest a theoretical relation with the two undeveloped stigmata of the natural
order, whose position may be snpposed to coincide with that of each half of the
rostellum. The blending of the different suppressed organs forming the column of
Listera is, however, 80 complete, that in the present state of our knowledge it is
