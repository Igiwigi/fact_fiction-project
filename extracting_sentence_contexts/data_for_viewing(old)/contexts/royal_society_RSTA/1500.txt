that there is no error in the true value and the only uncertainty is the emulator prediction
uncertainty to simplify the demonstration, though in practice the additional uncertainty from
the observational error and model discrepancy will simply expand the size of the space that has
not been ruled out.

An example of the samples that have been not ruled out yet (NROY) for the observed value of
58 m km is shown in figure 4 projected into the normal and shear/normal ratio plane of parameter
space. We use a plausibility threshold of 3 s.d. from the mean to rule out points. We note that the
NROY space is fairly clustered along a specific curve in this space. At high compressive normal
stresses, this seismic moment is produced for shear/normal stress ratios of around 0.16, while
at lower normal stresses the shear/normal stress must be slightly higher near 0.2 to produce the
known value. At very low shear to normal stresses, there is a region that cannot be ruled out,
though the fact that this occurs near the boundary of the space suggests this may be an artefact
of our original sampling. Designs with 50 sample points do not exhibit this feature. We note that
the projection shown in figure 4 was found to capture most of the structure in the space, and
suggests that the additional normal stress component is less important for predicting the final
seismic moment in our simulations.

The implausibility metric used to determine the NROY space (equation (2.4)) is shown in
figure 5. As we can see, most values that are ruled out have implausibility metrics much greater
than 6, indicating that we have a high degree of confidence that they can be ruled out. This
knowledge allows us to focus further simulation effort and analysis on a much narrower part
of parameter space, so that future computational effort is focussed on the most likely parameter
values to improve our understanding of the problem and make predictions.
