(9) The stomatal index in relation to habitat.—Owing to the time required to make
numerous determinations of indices, a large number of leaves have only been examined
from, this point of view in the case of a few species, but a small number of leaves have
been examined of plants from various habitats and these indicate tentatively that a
low index is characteristic of aquatics, whilst plants of drier habitats are characterised
by higher indices. This result is in harmony with the fact that submerged aquatics
tend to have few or no stomata whereas their land forms bear numerous stomata, and
also with the results obtained from Scilla grown in moist and dry air. For a low stomatal
index shows that a lower proportion of stomata are formed as distinct from diminution
per unit area, consequent upon growth of the epidermal cells. The fact that some

submerged aquatics form stomata upon their leaves when well nourished, whereas
under conditions of malnutrition stomata may be absent (e.g., Stratiotes, of. ‘ Montesantos
Flora,’ Bd. V., pp. 1-32, 1913), shows that nutrition probably plays a large part in
determining the value of the stomatal index, perhaps associated with the higher osmotic
pressure.
