Already, however, the three first plano-convex glasses that have
been made for me by TuLtey, only for preliminary experiments, the shortest
of them of 0.7 inch focus, have produced at an aperture of 50? the most distinct
microscopic vision that I have yet met with; and I anticipate no serious im-
pediment to the carrying defining power much further. These statements are intended only as a notice, for practical purposes and

wholly detached from theory, of facts that have heen in part yery recently
ascertained. In investigating them I have depended chiefly on magnified
measurements and diagrams, which, though not strictly correct, may perhaps
be as well adapted as other far more exact but difficult methods, for construct-
ing the minute and complex object-glass of a microscope. It is to this that
the observations made particularly apply ; and should they bring more within
reach than previously, the requisites which have been enumerated, I trust
they may not be unacceptable to the enlightened optician ; especially if in this
department he unite, like TuLLey, the zeal of the amateur with the skill of the
superior artist.
