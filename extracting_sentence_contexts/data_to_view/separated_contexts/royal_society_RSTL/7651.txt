As I do not doubt but the Royal Society would
have ordered ſome mention of Mr. de Courtivron
upon the ſame ſubject, if an account, ſufficiently cir-
cumſtantiated, of his book had been read before that
illuſtrious body, I hope a ſhort expolition of the
queſtion will not be amiſs. Both of theſe gentlemen thought of accounting
for the difference of refrangibility, by the difference
of velocity in the rays of light; which, if it really
agreed with the obſervations, would give a great
ſiwplicity to the theory of refraction, as reducing it
under the ſame laws as the theory of gravity :
whereas in the hypotheſis, wherein the particles of
light are endowed with tendencies different from one
another, one is obliged to multiply the properties of
matter,

Meſſieurs de Courtivron and Melvil-went fo far
the ſame way, as to examine, whether the immer-
fions and emerfions of Jupiter's ſatellites could not

afford 'the! means of diſtinguiſhing the difference of
velocities between! the rays of ſeveral colours,

In fact, if, according to. that hypotheſis, the red
rays were ſwifter than the others, -3t poſſibly might
happen, that the ſatellite would appear of a reddiſh
colour in the beginning of the emerſion ;, I mean
before the full time required for the whole tranſ-
miſſion of light from the ſatellite to us: As to the examination of the number of ſeconds
between the propagation of the red and violet rays,
the two authors differ widely; and I cannot help
aſſerting, that Mr. de Courtivron's calculations are
more ſurely grounded than the other's.
