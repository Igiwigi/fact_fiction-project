The observations of Hanvny (17) upon the effect of N/250 NH,OH and
N/250 NaOH upon the museular and nervous mechanisms of Oassiopea afford
striking evidence to show that weak and strong bases differ in their action on the
cell. When the ectodermal granules of the Meduse are stained with neutral red,
and the animals are placed in the above solutions, muscular and neural responses
continue after sufficient NH,OH has entered to affect the colour of the granules, but
they cease in N/250 NaOH before the granules are affected. This fact points very

* Also an extremely minute trace of atmmonia should have the same effect as a solution of 50 c.c.
van't Hoff’s solution +0°5 c.e. NaOH, which is not the vase. +
