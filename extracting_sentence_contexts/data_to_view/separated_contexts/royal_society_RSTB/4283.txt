The Supratemporal.—tThis bone, as is so commonly the case with Ichthyosaurus
skulls, is missing. When present its relation to the adjacent bones is precisely that
of the outer bone in the Lizards which is called squamosal by Huxtey, Parker, and
others. The subject has lately been treated by Watson,} who argues that it is the
inner bone, called supratemporal by Huxiry and Parxer, which is in fact the
squamosal ; and the evidence for this seems to me overwhelming. But when WarTson
proceeds to identify the outer bone with the quadrato-jugal, I think he is on less
certain ground. The reason alleged is that “no other bone ever lies outside
the squamosal,” with the remark in a footnote, “except perhaps in Ichthyosaurus.”
