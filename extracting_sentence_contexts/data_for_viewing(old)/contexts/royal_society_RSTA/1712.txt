Since the range of B strictly contains the state space X (this is because D(A) N ker(A — Aim) = {0}),
we have
Duis iF T_1(t — s)Bu(s) ds € X_4.
This implies that the state of the system (2.5) (hence (2.1)) satisfies x(t) = T(f)x + ®)u € X_) for any

t>0, xe X, and ue LP(Rt, U). We need a class of control operators B for which the state of the
system (2.5) takes values in the state space X. This motivated the following definition, [19].

Definition 2.1. The operator B ¢ £(U, X_1) is called an admissible control operator for A (or
(A, B) is admissible) if for some fo > 0 we have #;,u € X for any u € L?(Rt, U).

In what follows, we assume that (A,B) is admissible. In this case, the closed graph theorem
shows, in fact, that

, € C(LP(R*,U),X),  VE=0.

Hence x(t) € X for any f> 0 and u € LP(Rt, U).
The first obstacle is that the map t+> Mx(t) is not well defined as D(M) =Z Cc X and x(t) € X.

The second obstacle is that the equality u = Mx should be in LP (Rt, U) as by assumption u €


Lh, -(R*, U). In order to overcome these obstacles, we follow the following strategy: we define an

operator
