Place the carapace, which formerly exhibited only two small spines (figs. 13 & 14, 2),
shows now six acute processes, two of which are situated in the front line between the
two horns, and two others, a smaller and a larger one, on each 8ide. These processes
are not spines, in 80 far as they are not closed at the top; they have an opening there,
and the chitinous substance is pushed in a little into them up to the point where it
meets the duct of the glands, which are to be seen at the base of all these processes.

'These glands are as yet unicellular, the same as they were in the last stage. Dourx
Says, in describing his Navplins, that he suspects the ramified glands to have been

appendages show as yet no change, nor do the tail and its spine, in which there are as
yet only two of the large secondary movable spines (Plate 11. fig. 14).

On both sides of the eye, between the two tentacles or feelers, there is a granulated
substance, which I thought at first was the brain ; but afterwards I found the ganglia
underneath it (fig. 14, cer), and have never been able to make out what this granulated
band represents.

The upper lip now not only includes the cexsophagus, but also two glands or cwca
(fig. 14, coe), in the place of which we saw in the last two stages an assemblage of
Slightly granular cells. There are now two strong spines on both sides of the edge of
the labrum, which has very much the form which it retains during the whole Nauplius
