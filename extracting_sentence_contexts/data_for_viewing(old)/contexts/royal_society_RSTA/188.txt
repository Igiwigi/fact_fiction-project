4. Neural networks and proteins

Multi-valley landscapes are not always a nuisance—in fact, they can be very
valuable. A good example is found in Hopfield’s (1982) simple model for biological
neural networks where the valleys provide storage for memories and where
dynamics within the valleys represents memory retrieval. In this model, one
imagines the ‘brain’ as made up of a very large number of neurons, firing to
different degrees, connected by a large number of ‘synapses’, both excitatory
and inhibitory, the former such that a firing efferent neuron tends to make the
afferent neuron fire, and the latter such that a firing efferent neuron tends to
reduce the firing of the afferent neuron. If the synapses are symmetric, the
collective dynamics of the neurons can be envisaged as dominantly downward
motion on a high-dimensional landscape whose structure is determined by
the collection of synapses. Many valleys allow for many memories, a clear
requisite for a useful brain, and many valleys require frustration. That these
