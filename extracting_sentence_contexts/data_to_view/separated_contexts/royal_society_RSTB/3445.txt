It has already been stated that in its main features the structure of Lapworthura
is typical of Silurian and Devonian Ophiuroidea, and that for this reason we propose
to institute a new group, Protophiuroidea, to include all Silurian and Devonian
Ophiuroidea with the exception of Eucladia and its ally, Euthemon. These genera
were placed by one of us (2, 1899) in an order of Ophiuroidea, the Ophiocistia. Batuer (3, 1907) has recently made the very probable suggestion that the structures
regarded as muscular arms are, in fact, gigantic scale-covered tube-feet. Thus the
Ophiocistia, as far as we know them, agree with Ophiuroidea only in the possession
of an actinal madreporite and of a buccal armature ; these characters alone are not
sufficient to justify the inclusion of these fossils in the Ophiuroidea. The Ophiocistia
are, therefore, regarded as a class of Echinodermata, possibly allied to the
Ophiuroidea.
