Having thus shown the origin of the negative achromatic lens, I may be allowed
to state the motives and reasonings which guided me in the computation of the
curves, and what appears to me to constitute the advantages it is found to pozess. Notwithstanding the extreme difficulty there is in constructing an achromatic obect-
glass, yet with perfect materials the difficulty is only in the manipulation ; and this
being overcome, there is not 80 great a natural impediment to perfection in this 2art
as in the eyepiece, —for we know that it is impossible to make a perfect positive
power *; and if the same aþsolute impediment does not occur in the negative eye-
piece, yet the thicknesses of the Jenses render the task very difficult, not only to ee-
cute, but to compute the proper curyatures to ensure perfection. If this view of the
case be correct, we ee at once the advantage of magnifying the object as muct as
possible before we apply the eyepiece ; and this, in fact, is the whole theory of the
negative achromatic lens : that is, supposing the rays to be rendered achromatic by
the object-glass, they are intercepted by the negative lens before they cross, which,
being itself also achromatic, extends them to any length, and thereby produces the
effect of lengthening the whole focus in the same proportion, and consequently the
power of the telescope, the eyepiece remaining unaltered. In the conclusion of my letter to Mr. DoLLoxD, I have offered a suggestion, whither
it would not be possible to retain the same eyepiece for all powers by changing only
the negative lens.
