twenty of these observations were made for the front and then a second series of
twenty for the back of the brake, in which case the load on the back had to lift the
lever from its mean position.

On taking the difference of the means of these two series of observations, the
friction is eliminated and the resulting moment represents the error of balance of
the brake.

Since in the course of a trial the lever oscillates a little from its mean position,
the brake will, when in motion, be working against the resistance offered by the
linkage connected with the regulating cock, When at rest, however, this resistance
will not affect the load at all. In view of this fact, two determinations of the error
in balance were made, the first with the brake working free of the linkage, by
allowing the small motion to take place in the slack of the pin-joints, the second
with the brake working against the resistance of the regulating apparatus. The
results obtained were

Tn the first case, error in balance = 45째5 ft.-lbs.
In the second case, error in balance = 41째73 ___,,

A mean of these two quantities would probably be approximately correct, viz.,
43째615 ft.-lbs.

The lead balance weight previously mentioned, and weighing 13째97 lbs., was
