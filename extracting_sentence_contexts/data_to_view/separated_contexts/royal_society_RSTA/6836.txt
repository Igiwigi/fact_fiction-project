Let f and f, be two integers such that f>f,>1 and let

m = [10In/]. If ais a positive integer, if ay, ay, ..-5 4, are non-negative integers, and uf further

It is not difficult to deduce from this theorem a less precise but simpler one involving only
the rational approximations to In (//f,). Denote by a,/a, where a>1 and a,>0, a rational
approximation to In(///;) satisfying the inequality

it is obvious that this condition is satisfied as soon as a,/a is sufficiently near to In (f/f,.) We
use the fact that in f

theorem remains true if the value of 7 is increased.
