the identification of orcein purple. Absorption (â€”logR) together with fluorescence emission and
excitation spectra correlate well with the data obtained for the orcein-dyed silk reference (Lasallia
pustulata). In fact, purple paints are characterized by absorption maxima between 575 and 578 nm
with a shoulder at 540-545nm, similar to the dyed silk reference, with absorption maxima at
580 nm and a shoulder at 540nm (figure 5 and table 5). In turn, the purple paints absorption
matches well the excitation spectrum, which is well resolved, as depicted in figure 6. On the
other hand, the emission spectrum is characterized by a broad band with maxima between 590
and 600nm, which compares well with the 602nm value for the dyed silk reference (table 5).
The identification of orcein by Raman spectroscopy in situ was not possible owing to the high
fluorescence observed.

(ii) Winter Breviary

Based on the very good spectral correlation with our reference database, it was possible to assign
the pink/carmine colours to a brazilwood paint and the purple to an orcein proteinaceous paint
