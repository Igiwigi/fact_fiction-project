The author has found that the symmetrical river-drift implements with two
eutting edges which still retain the rostro-carinate profile are even more numerous
than the so-called “side-choppers.” The late Sir Joun Evans in his well-known
book “ Ancient Stone Implements of Great Britain,” second edition, figures five such
