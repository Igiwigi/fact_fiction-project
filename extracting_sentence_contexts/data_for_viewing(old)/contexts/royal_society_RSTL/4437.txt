the return of the vyessel to the Thames, which had been ordered by the Admiralty,
and was fully designed to have taken place by Sir James Ross, was also omitted
It appears therefore that in every instance in which the proper experiments were
made, the disturbances were found to be consistent with the hypothesis of an induced
magnetism conforming gradually to the changes in the terrestrial magnetic pheno-
mena occasioned by the changes in the ship's geographical position, but not changing
simultaneously with those changes.

But whether the hypothesis of a gradual conformity of a part of the ship's iron,
instead of an instantaneous conformity of the whole, to changes of the terrestrial
dip, be or be not the true explanation of the facts which have been thus pointed out,
the facts themselves are highly deserving of consideration by those to whom the cor-
rection of compass errors is of consequence ; the anomalies which present themselyes
to any previously entertained systematic view are of too large amount, as well as too
consistent on the different points, both in the observations at sea and in harbour, to

has been given to them on this occasion will not be misplaced, if it should serve to
impress upon those who have the power of carrying out practical snggestions, the
