52 MR. A. CAYLEY ON THE EQUATION FOR A FUNCTION

The equation in 0 is thus (9—6Y(0+12)(f+108)=0, or multiplying out it is
(1, 0, 0, +432, —11664, +466560, 1)'=0,

which in fact (observing that x 0 =36) is what the preceding formula becomes for
the equation (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1'v, 1''=0. | ;

The analogous verifications for the cubic and the quartic equations are as follows ;

16. For the cubic, if the assumed equation is v*+v*+v+1=0, the roots whereof are
—1, 7, — (P=—1), then we should have Tis, B, y)=/ —O=4, which will be the
case if «, 3, y=—1, 7, —7, respectively, and the roots 3—y, y—«, «—P of the equation
in 0 then are 27, —i+1, —#—1, 80 that the equation in 0 is (F+279—2)(9—2)=0, or

(L, 0, 2, 4s Fo, 1Y=0,

which (observing that v4 O=4) is what the formula for the equation in 9 becomes for
