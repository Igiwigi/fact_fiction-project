Modern zoologists will hardly be interested in his theories of the homologies of parts
of the skull with parts of a neural arch.

The next important advance in our knowledge of these skulls was made by
Nerwron,|| in a remarkably successful study of fossils from the Elgin sandstones, in
which the bones are represented only by cavities in the rock. Gutta-percha casts of
these cavities were made, and it was often necessary to make separate casts of the
various parts and piece them together. NrwTon was the first to show convincingly
the existence of a rudimentary secondary palate; he was not able to speak with
great definitencss of the bones which enter into it, owing to the lack of sutures
(pp. 440 and 447).
