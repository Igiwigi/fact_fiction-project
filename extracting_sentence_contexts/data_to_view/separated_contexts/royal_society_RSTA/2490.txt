4 contrasts the diurnal inequalities for the seasons and the year
derived from the whole eleven years and from the sunspot maximum and minimum
groups of years, as given in Tables [X., X., and XI. The V inequality data are not
quite so smooth as those for H, especially in winter. The fact that the H curves
were smoothed, while the V curves were not, presumably partly accounts for this. The variation in the type of the inequality throughout the year is less in V than in
H. In some months two distinct maxima and minima are visible in V, but the
principal maximum always occurs in the afternoon between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m., while
the principal minimum, in the forenoon, is as uniform in its time of incidence as the
corresponding minimum in H.
