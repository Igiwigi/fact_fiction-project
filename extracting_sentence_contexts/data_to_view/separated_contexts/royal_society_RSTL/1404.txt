Gay Lussac and 'THENARD have detailed an extensive series of
facts upon muriatic acid, and oxymuriatic acid. . Some of their
experiments/are similar to those I have detailed inthe paper
just referred to ; others are peculiarly their own,,and of a very
curious kind: their general conclusion is, that muriatic acid gas
contains about one quarter of its, weight of water ; and that
oxymuriatic acid is not decomposable by any substances but
hydrogene, or such as can form triple combinations with it. One of the most singular facts that I have observed. on this
subject, and which I have before referred to, is, that charcoal,
even. when ignited to whiteness in oxymuriatic or muriatic
acid gases, by the VoLTaic battery, effects no change in them ;
if it has been previously freed from hydrogene and moisture
by intense ignition in vacuo. This experiment, which I have several times repeated, led
me. to doubt. of the existence. of oxygene- in. that substance,
which has been s8upposed to contain it above all others in a
loose and active state; and to.make a more rigorous investi-
gation/than had been hitherto attempted for its detection. If oxymuriatic acid gas be introducedinto a vessel exhausted
of air; containing tin/; and the: tin be. gently heated, and the
gas in sufſicient quantity, the tin and. the gas disappear,
and a limpid fluid, precisely the same as Libavius's liquor is
formed;—it occured to me, that if this substance is a combina-
tion of muriatic acid and oxide of tin, oxide of tin ought to be

it was absorbed with great heat, and no gas was generated; a
solid result was obtained, which was of a dull white colour ;
some of it was heated, to ascertain if it contained oxide of tin ;
but the whole volatilized, producing dense pungent fumes.
