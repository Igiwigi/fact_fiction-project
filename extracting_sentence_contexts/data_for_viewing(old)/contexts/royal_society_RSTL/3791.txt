98 DR. MARTIN BARRY ON FIBRE.

I am acquainted with. This body, sketched in fig. 118, was composed of flat filaments
(3, 7), and had a loop-like termination, to the very extremity of which, —that is, into
the loop itself,—the filaments in question were continued, and which indeed they
formed. Nothing was seen in this object besides filaments, longitudinal and spiral,
for no membranous covering could be discerned. A remarkable crossing of the fila-
ments of opposite sides («), was noticed between the trunk of this object and its loop.

Facts observed in the Formation and Structure of Muscle.

41. In May 1840, I offered to the Society some remarks on the origin of museleF,
in which it was mentioned that I was then unable to state the mode of formation of
the fibrillae within the cylinder. Subsequent observations, to be presently detailed,
seem to throw some light upon that snbject. In the mean time, however, a memoir
by W. Bowmax has been read, * On the Minute Structure and Movements of Volun-
tary Muscle$.” This cireumstance would have inclined me not to return to the snb-
ject, but for its essential connection with researches previously begun by myself:
namely, those © on the Corpuscles of the Blood :” and in recording the results, I per-
ceive with regret that in the main points they are at variance with the observations
of the author just mentioned.
