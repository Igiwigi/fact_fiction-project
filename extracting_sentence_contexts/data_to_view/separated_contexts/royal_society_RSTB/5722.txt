Any attempt to arrest water from the canals by trap drains, which was actually tried
by the senior author in 1912, is evidently entirely futile; the true-scale section of
fig. 29, p. 362, exemplifies this. In spite of all the evidence obtained from this area, it is clear that any attempt to
fit a drainage scheme to it would still be largely a process of trial and error, on account
of the fact that we have merely scratched the surface with one observation at 13 m.,
one series at 6 m., two dozen at 3 m., and 200 at 14 m. In any intelligent planning
a knowledge of the “ surface-geology ” to much greater depths would be needed, and
herein we see no hope except from geophysical methods. The one thing quite clear is
that a lining to the canals would deepen our available soil appreciably. A little more can be extracted from our data with respect to the direction of water-
