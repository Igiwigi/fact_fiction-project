To conclude without
further argument that the number itself is the numeral ‘201’
is to confuse the representation with what is represented—a
quite common mistake. Berkeley did have further arguments,
but they are unsound. Numeralism has the advantage that it appears to escape the
problem of cognitive access: people are satisfied with the fact
that we can see written numerals. But a serious disadvantage
is that a common core of basic arithmetical information can
be expressed using different numeral systems or natural
language number words:

12+9=21 (base 10).
1100 +1001 = 10101 (base 2). Twelve plus nine equals twenty-one.
