of its water ; if, therefore, the heat penetrated the mass of air
from the centre to the surface, or passed through it from particle
to particle, in the same manner as it is probable that it passes
through water, and all other unelastic fluids, by far the greatest
part of the air contained in the bottle would part with its heat,
when not actually in contact with the glass, and a proportional
part of its water being let fall at the same time, and in the same
place, would necessarily descend in the form of rain; and,
though this rain might be too fine to be visible in its descent,
yet Lwas sure I $hould find it at the bottom of the bottle, if
not in visible drops of water, yet in that kind of cloudy cover-
ing which cold glass acquires from a contact with hot steam
or watery Vapour. But if the particles of air, instead of communicating their
heat from one to another, from the centre to the surface of the
bottle, each in its turn, and for itself, came to the surface of
the bottle, and there deposited its heat, and its water, I con-
cluded that the cloudiness occasioned by this deposit of water
would appear all over the bottle, or, at least, not more of it
at the bottom than at the sides, but rather less; and this I
found to be the case in fact. The cloudiness first made its appearance upon the sides of
the bottle, near the top of it; and from thence it gradually
spread itself downwards, till, growing fainter as it descended
lower, it was hardly visible at the distance of half an inch from
the bottom of the bottle ; and upon the bottom itself, which
was nearly flat, there was: scarcely the smallest appearance of
cloudiness. These appearances, I think, are easy to be accounted for.
