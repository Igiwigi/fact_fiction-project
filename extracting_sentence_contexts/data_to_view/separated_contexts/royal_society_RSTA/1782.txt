These are
all regions identified as having high N deposition by 2030 [103], which highlights the need for
improved understanding of O3-N interactions in unmanaged systems [24]. Importantly, these risk assessments conducted for agriculture, forests and grasslands suggest
that policies represented by the more optimistic scenarios do not always lead to a reduction in the
spatial extent of O3 risk. In fact, for some regions, particularly in Asia, the extent and magnitude
of risks are likely to increase in the future [24,93]. Coupled with these increases in O3 risk are
changes in other stress factors such as enhanced N deposition [103], climate change and elevated
COz [102], which modelling suggests can have substantial impacts on modifying the sensitivity
of vegetation to O3 damage.

5. Future ozone trends and implications for vegetation

There are essentially two options available to reduce the damage to vegetation resulting from
elevated O3, the first is to reduce the concentrations of O3 pollution in the atmosphere via


mitigation, i.e. a reduction in O3 precursor emissions, and the second is to develop adaptation
measures that reduce the adverse consequences of O3 pollution.

(a) Mitigation

The changes apparent in the global distribution of O3 (see ยง3) clearly show a shift of O3 precursor
emissions towards Asia where the lower latitudes are expected to differentially increase the
tropospheric O3 burden due to the greater convection, reaction rates and NOx sensitivity of
these regions [56].
