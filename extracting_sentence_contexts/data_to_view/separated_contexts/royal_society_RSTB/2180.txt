In support of this theory I have found
that if the four cerebral arteries be tied before the cortex of the dog is exposed, then,
in such case, the operation is bloodless, while the cortex is as a rule most excitable
immediately after exposure. This result shows that the cortex is not paralysed by
operative insults, but is rendered excitable by a diminution in the velocity of blood-
flow. The increased excitability may be due either to a chemical change, e.g.,
increase of CO,} in the motor cells of the cortex, or to the fact that the power of
resistance to activity (Hemmung) ceases owing to the blockage of association path-
ways and the sensory projection. The sensory stimulations normally stream into the
cortex and there revive memories, which together with the present sensations now
inhibit and now exalt each other and so control the discharge of the motor cells. Method of Experiment.â€”The animals were anzsthetised with chloroform and ether
and subsequently with ether alone.
