Such
elements, for example, as phosphorus or sulphur, are modified by the action of heat,
and not by the electrical discharge. It is true, at the same time, that the destruction
of ozone, or, on the allotropic view, its reconversion into oxygen, by exposure to a tem-
perature of 270* C., is apparently analogous to that action of heat whereby common
phosphorus is converted into the red variety. Without rejecting the allotropic constitution of ozone, although the results of our
volumetric experiments are certainly difficult to reconcile with it, it may not be unin-
structive to consider whether the facts already known admit of a different explanation. As ozone is formed from pure and dry oxygen by the electrical discharge, if it is not an
allotropic form of oxygen, the latter must be either a mechanical mixture of two or more
gases, or it must be a compound gas. It is perhaps scarcely necessary to consider the
former hypothesis, according to which, oxygen, in its ordinary state, would be a mecha-
nical mixture, as atmospheric air is a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen.
