The latter observation is crucial for
understanding the analytical and computational challenges. Standard techniques for evolution
equations are not applicable in the analysis of mean-field games, e.g. the question of local-in-time
existence cannot even be posed reasonably. On the other hand, variational approaches suffer from
missing coercivity, convexity and the fact that as usual in differential games a fixed-point operator
needs to be formulated on top of the optimization problem. Novel developments coupling
variational principles and viscosity solution techniques for the adjoint problem can be found
in recent literature [42-45] as well as solutions with advanced probabilistic arguments [46,47]. With respect to the numerical solution, there is no simple forward integration, but the huge
coupled systems in space-time need to be solved.
