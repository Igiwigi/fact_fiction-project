It appears that each plate is physiologically completely severed from
Bll other plates, In order, therefore, to secure the simultaneous response of a whole
-yolumn, either the nerve trunk supplying the column must be excited or an induction
â€œghock must traverse all the septa of the column. 2 Experiments referring to Excitation by the Voltaic Current. +s The use of the rheotome has thus revealed the fact that the passage of an induction
Seurrent through a strip of organ excites the tissue. In no single instance was such
-Ean excitatory phenomenon found to be absent. This being the case, it is evident that
Zunless care is taken to exclude this excitatory effect from influencing the galvano-
ie the passage of an induction current in opposite directions must be attended by
Sunequal galvanometric deflections.
