retard the contractions of the heart. In that of the Puff Adder temporary stimulation
was produced by strong solutions, while with Rattlesnake venom in very strong
solutions the contractions of the heart were somewhat weakened for a short period,
but in no case was it rapidly stopped. It is possible that a small part of the rapid
circulatory failure may be due to a direct effect of the Rattlesnake venom in its
passage through the heart, but it would immediately become diluted in the blood
stream to such an extent as to lose this effect, while the continuance of the heart
beats for long periods shows conclusively that the circulatory failure cannot be due to
failure of the heart’s action.

2. Paralysis of the Central Vaso-Motor Centre.—As the circulatory failure cannot
be explained as due to any direct action of the venom on the heart itself, we must
consider how far an effect on the vaso-motor mechanism will explain the facts
recorded. Capillary clotting having been excluded by transfusion of the portal,
pulmonary, and systemic circulations after death having demonstrated that there was
no obstruction in them; we find that a paralysis of the central vaso-motor centre will
fully account for all the phenomena met with. ‘Thus, the increased excursus of the
pulse, so constantly seen in the tracings, indicates diminished peripheral resistance ;
the pumping-up of the fallen blood pressure on the occurrence of respiratory
convulsive efforts, which has formed such a remarkable feature of some of the charts
of each of the venoms dealt with, can only be explained as the result of a mechanical
aid to the circulation brought about by pressure on the dilated portal circulation,
while the good effect of abdominal pressure is also accounted for on the same
hypothesis; the remarkable Traube-Hering curves so frequently met with, and
persisting as long as the central vaso-motor centre is not too completely paralysed to
