quantity of metal in the spark.

When zine electrodes are moistened these very short lines become somewhat,
lengthened.

When aluminium electrodes were employed to obtain a photograph of its spectrum
(Journal of the Chemical Society, vol. xli., p. 90), a number of short lines were
exhibited which did not appear in the spectra of solutions of the chloride. The wave-
lengths of the aluminium lines as seen in solutions are the following : 39609,
39434, 3612-7, 3601'2, 3584-5, 3092-2, 3081-5, 3056'8 (faintly), 28156, 26598,
2651:7, 26310 (a group of five lines), and lastly 25675.

Nearly all the remaining short lines are caused by the presence of iron, a fact
which may be easily ascertained by prolonging the exposure of the photographic plate.
Commercial aluminium may contain as much as 2 per cent, of iron, and as the iron
lines are strong, this quantity modifies the appearance of the gspectrum to such a
degree as to give ib a considerable resemblance to that of iron, but there is the widest
possible difference between the spectra of the two metals. J. L. ScaoNnN, who
; examined the ultra-violet spectra of geveral metals with Iceland spar prisms and a
2 fluorescent eye-piece, has remarked on what he believes to be a similarity between
the aluminium and iron spectra (WIEDEMANN's Annalen, vol. ix., p. 483; vol. x.,
P- 143). It is possible that the likelihood of iron being contained in the aluminium
> had escaped his notice, or that he was nob prepared to recognise the iron lines when
2 they were somewhat altered in appearance by the metal being present in small
