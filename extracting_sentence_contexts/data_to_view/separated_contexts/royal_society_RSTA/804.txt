As the 4(y) entries were much smaller than the /(x)
entries in the 7<3-0 calculations, larger intervals in y were used (0-05, 0-1 or 0-2—
an interval of 0-2 was used throughout the integration for 7> 8-0), the range of inte-
gration being subdivided into parts so chosen that contributions to the integral sum
from fourth and higher order differences were small and negligible respectively. No
difficulty arises in the application of the central difference formula (3-1) in the y — 0
region, as the table of 4(y) entries can be extended to negative values of y; but in the
y — 7 region, the second and higher differences of ¢(y) increase rapidly, and equation
(3-1) cannot be applied without error. This is due to the fact that when y — 7 and
x — 2n the two functions ¢(y) and f(x) (¢(7) =f(2y)) do not join smoothly; for (y—y)#
behaves near y = 7 like xt near x — 0, and the ¢(y) curve shows a “spur” in the neigh-
bourhood of y — 7. This spur is apparent in curve 38a of fig. 1, and is shown on a larger
scale in curve 3b.
