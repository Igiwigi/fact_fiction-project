Again, an apparently complete liquidation of residuals may prove to be incomplete
when advance is made to a finer net. In such circumstances (cf. ยง 34) a multiplying
factor may be used to ensure that the residuals, on the finer net, have a zero total: then
positive and negative residuals will be equally common, and relatively little further
relaxation will be required to liquidate them. Finally, advantage can often be taken of the fact that (since the governing equation
is linear) solutions can be superposed. As remarked in ยง 1, biharmonic analysis would be
(relatively) simple if the boundary conditions permitted us to determine V2w as a
first stage in the solution, because the deduction of w can be effected without difficulty,
once V*w is known, by the methods of Part III. Similarly, ifwe have V2w approximately
(from a solution effected by the methods of this paper), then we can without difficulty
deduce a solution w which satisfies very closely both the governing equation and either one of the
two boundary conditions.
