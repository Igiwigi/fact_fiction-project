figs. 59-67, the large unsegmented mass must contain a number of fully formed
nuclei, since it breaks up almost at once into several s8pheres. Hence the delay is
caused, apparently, by some obstacle in the vitellus, which we may suppose to be an
especially great amount of dentoplasm in one half of the egg, as is normally the
case in the entodermic pole of an epibolic gastrula. It is possible in this case also to
8uppose that the delay is due to tardy multiplication of the nuclei, but this explana-
tion s8eems less probable than the other. In 8ome cases the small spheres are gradually
constricted off from the unsegmented part, and the egg may pass into a resting stage,
leaving a number of spheres only half formed (see figs. 59, 60, 63, 64). This fact
strongly indicates that there is some resistance to be overcome in the vitellus, for there
can be little doubt that the half-formed spheres contain fully developed nuelei.

There are a number of other facts which point in the same direction. The first
formed cleavage furrows penetrate very slowly towards the centre of the ovum and,
in 80me cases at leasb, do nob reach the centre during the first stage of activity. The
segmentation is ab firs, therefore, of the type which Barrour has termed centrole-
cithal, the egg consisting of a peripheral layer of partially-formed cells and a solid
central yolk-mass. The egg differs somewhat in structure, however, from a typical
centrolecithal oyum ; for the central yolk-mass, 80 far as can be determined, does
not contain at this period a greater proportion of deutoplasm than the peripheral
parts, though it does 80 at a later stage. The failure of the cleavage furrows to reach
the centre of the egg seems to be due either to the resistance being greater in the
central parts, or to the exhaustion of the energy of the protoplasm before the inertia of
the entire mass of deutoplasm has been overcome.
