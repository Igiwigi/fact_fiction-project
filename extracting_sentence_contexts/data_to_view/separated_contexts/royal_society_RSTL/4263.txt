The proportion of carbon is also s0mewhat different. Still the differ-
ence in composition is not yery considerable, although decidedly marked ; it is not
however sufficient to cause any obvious alteration in their general properties. In
fact, there is an attached impurity, probably a cyanide of iron, which cannot now be
removed by crystallization, precipitation, digestion with nitric acid, or any of the
ordinary means of purification. This impurity, if it be one, remains 80 obstinately
attached that all methods of purification have quite failed to remove it. This cireum-
stance, before it was understood, had thrown the greatest difficulties in the way of
the inquiry, and protracted it to a most tedious length by preventing the attainment
of accordant results.
