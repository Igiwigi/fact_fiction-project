Since this was the first heating cycle, there was considerable drift in
sample pressure. Subsequent heating at higher starting pressures did not show this large a drift and typically remained within
approximately 2 GPa. (Online version in colour.)

irreversible process modifies the volume of the sample. A close inspection of the MgO diffraction
peaks in figure 2a shows that the thermal expansion is clearly evident and, coupled with the fact
that this is a powder mixture in which the only absorber of the IR laser is ByC, assures us that,
(a) the mixture is homogenous and (b) that the two components have comparable grain sizes. MgO was hence used to obtain the thermal pressure at high temperatures. A total of nine starting
pressures in the range of 8-50GPa were chosen, and diffraction data were collected between
ambient and 2500K.
