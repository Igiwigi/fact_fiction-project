velocity, v, and v, using the value 1-78 for the ratio v,/v,. The value so found is
2:1 km./sec. for the P waves. This value depends on the assumption that the focus
was 31 km. from Plymouth, the distance of St John’s, Antigua, to Plymouth being
37 km. The value should be regarded as an upper limit.

13—GENERAL REMARKS ON THE EARTH MOVEMENTS

Hitherto, in discussing the results we have referred to the first shock and the main
movement observed in the record of one of the local earthquakes as the P and S waves
respectively. Do these wave motions correspond in actual fact to the waves similarly
designated in the description of the seismograph record of a distant earthquake? There
is no doubt that they do correspond to two different types of wave motion propagated
with different speeds. Apart from the clear evidence provided by the “distant”
shocks there is a general tendency for the duration of the fore shock to increase the
farther the distance of the focus from the seismograph station in the case of the
“local” shocks in Montserrat. But are what we have called the P waves longitudinal
compressional movements similar in type to sound waves? Secondly, are the S waves
transverse movements similar to those propagated through the body of the earth from
the focus of an earthquake to a distant observing station or are they surface waves?

The restricted time scale of the Wiechert seismograph and the uncertainty as to
the precise location of the foci makes it difficult to decide this question from the
