On examining the results given by the subject, it will be seen that no mistakes at all are
made in colour recognition at a visual angle of 30 cone units. At 12 cone units, the reports
might have been those of a person with normal colour vision. At 6 cone units, blue still
retains its colour, while red and orange have largely lost their colour; both these effects
are unusual. With normal-sighted persons, blue would have been replaced by black, while
red and orange would have been unchanged. The replacement of yellow by white is, of
course, quite normal. At 2-5 cone units, colours have become largely monochromatic,
except for blue, which continues to retain its colour in a very unusual manner. The fact
that this observer is normal-sighted at large visual angles suggests that his photoreceptors
are normal, and that therefore he is not at all colour-defective in the ordinary sense. Like
normal-sighted persons, his colour vision deteriorates with decrease in visual angle, but in
an unusual way. The changes observed could be accounted for by supposing the subject
to possess abnormal red and blue response mechanisms: a ‘red’ mechanism which changes
at too large a visual angle, and a ‘blue’ mechanism which changes at an angle which
is too small. It is not easy to explain these deviations from the normal in any other
way.
