Proof. Define the vector with exponential elements y(y,t)=e”'x(t). Differentiating y with
respect to time and using (2.3) into the result yield
HW) = (In + Ay t) + Be”"'y(y, t= hy, (2.8)

whose characteristic equation coincides with (2.6). Furthermore, the Schur’s theorem [29]
guarantees the existence of a unitary matrix U € R’*", such that L= UuTU# holds, where T is
an upper triangular matrix whose diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of L. Under this unitary
transformation, and recalling that A = —kpL and B = k;L, we introduce the change of coordinates
y(y,t) = UE (y, t), which transforms system (2.8) into

E07 t) = (vIn — kpT)E(y, #) + br T e”"E(y, t - h). (2.9)

The fact that the coefficient matrices in (2.9) are upper triangular implies that the characteristic
equation of system (2.8) is equivalent to the product of n factors of the form

FinlV8,h, kp) =8 — y + dmkp — Amkpe’ eS", m=Tyn, (2.10)
which is the right-hand side of f(y,s) in (2.7). a

Remark 2.4. On the one hand, analytical treatment of ‘sheer’ stability in (2.10) is relatively
easy since in this case one must set y =0. A large body of the literature can guide one in this
effort, see [27,30-38]. In this regard, we also refer to [28] where decomposition ideas and a similar
form of fin with y =0 has been thoroughly studied. On the other hand, the analytical treatment

2Minimization of the spectral abscissa may be achieved numerically [8]. The key difference in this manuscript is that we tune
the spectrum analytically.
