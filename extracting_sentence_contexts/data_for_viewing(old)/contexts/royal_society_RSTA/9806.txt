observed is 94 and 43 = 106, 94 can be 106 within limits. D,, gives in the same way
800 for m = 8, the same as observed and 1468 for m = 4 instead of 1380. The last
may be the same as the observed within limits, but as 52) = 1381°6 and 55d = 1462,

it is possible there may be this difference and VD,, (4) is not VD,, (4) as in the typical
cases. The real difference may be any multiple between 52d and 55d. In fact 0 is so
small that there is not absolute certainty.

AID has proved itself the most intractable series to bring into any simple formula
of the ordinary kind. It was, in fact, the difficulty with this element which first led
me to seek another solution—on the lines now being considered.

It will be seen that it lends strong support to the theory suggested. The table is
arranged with ¢= 2°66. The exactness of the relations there shown is very
remarkable, and when it is remembered that A is a large number like 1754, the
practically exact multiples referring to the first five lines must carry very great
weight in the argument that AID at least is subject to a modification of successive

_ denominators by multiples of certain units. The objections to the arrangement are
two: (1) that € = 2°66 is outside the error limits of S(), and (2) the denominators
appear to go on diminishing without reaching a limit. A slight alteration, however,
in A will get over the first. For instance, if A = 1754—"5, é would be about °5 less,
