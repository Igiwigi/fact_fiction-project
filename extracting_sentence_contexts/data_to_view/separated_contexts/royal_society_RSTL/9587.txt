the cell-substance stains more deeply than during rest. In the cesophageal
glands the tint of staining is nob in 80 constant a relation to the amount of secretion
produced as in some other glands, the extent to which the tint deepens seems to vary
as the stimulation is produced by digestible food or by mechanical stimulation. These
and some other apparent causes of variation have not been closely determined, but the
main fact of an increase in the depth of staining has always been obvious,

It was stated by SEWALL and myself* that absolute alcohol added to the fresh
teased-out gland altered the normal appearances; and I have said above that the
granules are in part dissolved. Nevertheless, alcohol specimens of cesophageal glands
taken during digestion show the two zones in the gland-cells ; the non-granular zone
stains with carmine, and thus specimens can be obtained (Plate 77, fig. 8), which,
except for the smaller size of the cells, closely resemble similarly prepared specimens of
the pancreas.
