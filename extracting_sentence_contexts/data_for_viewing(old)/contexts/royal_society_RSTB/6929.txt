as in the simple colour type. There is, however, some evidence that where the red
pigment develops best the brown pigment develops least, as in the stomodaeum.

These colour types are connected by innumerable intermediates in which the in-
tensity of each pigment and its extent over the body vary. Nevertheless, in all these it
appears that the pattern is founded on the presence or absence of three systems of
pigment, red to orange lipochrome, brown melanic pigment in the ectoderm, and
black granular melanin in the endoderm. If all are absent we have the white form.
If only one is present we get red, brown or grey forms. If two or more are present we
get the other varieties. In combinations, each pigment retains the distribution it has
in the corresponding simple form.

These facts suggest that we have here a genetical phenomenon in which the
presence or absence of each pigment is an independent heritable quality. There is no
doubt that the colour of a variety is inherited, at least during the common asexual
reproduction, and that under natural conditions it is not due to accidental environ-
mental influences such as the consumption of a particular food. Metridium appears
to feed on coarse plankton (Stephenson 1935). The different colour varieties occur side
by side in identical situations, and all varieties accept the same kinds of animal food
when it is offered to them. Moreover, Gosse (1860) himself was struck by the occur-
rence of the animal in asexually produced colonies in each of which the animals
maintain the characteristic colour. The constancy of the colour both in the parent and
in the asexually produced young can be seen in the aquarium under a variety of con-
ditions of feeding and starvation.
