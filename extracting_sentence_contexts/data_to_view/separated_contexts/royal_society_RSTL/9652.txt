$ 7. Numerical data and deductions therefrom. Although we are thus brought to admit that it is difficult to construct any problem
which shall adequately represent the actual case, yeb a discnssion of certain numerical
values involved in the solar system and in the planetary s8ubsystems will, T think, lead
to some interesting results. The fundamental fact with regard to the theory of tidal friction is the transforma-
tion of the rotational momentum of the planet as it is destroyed by tidal friction into
orbital momentum of the tide-raising body. Hence we may derive information concerning the effects of tidal friction by the
evaluation of the various momenta of the several parts of the solar system. Professor J. C. Apans has kindly given me a table of values of the planetary
masses, each with its attendant satellites.
