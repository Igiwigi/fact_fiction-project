It was also observed previously in the cardiorespiratory
coherence function, although the corresponding significance levels were not always estimated
reliably (see [53] for discussion and references therein). We have observed a decrease with age


in the respiratory peak WPC (not shown: p = —0.38 for males and p = —0.35 for females with
p < 0.001 for both). Coupled with the fact that the respiratory frequency and its standard deviation
do not depend on age (figure 1b), this suggests that RSA becomes more unstable with age. In the respiration-IHF WPC, there is also a significant peak at the cardiac frequency, which
could not have been observed using the earlier ME- or IPFM-based methods of IHF extraction. It suggests that IHF and respiration share a cardiac component.
