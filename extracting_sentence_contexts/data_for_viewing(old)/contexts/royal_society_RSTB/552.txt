106 SIR J. B. LAWES AND PROFESSOR J. H. GILBERT ON THE

soil, there is not evidence of coincident and corresponding restoration of nitrogen from
the free to the combined state.

In the case of agricultural production for sale, without restoration by manure from
external sources, a very important condition of the maintenance of the amount of
nitrogen in the surface soil, or of the diminished exhaustion of it, is the growth of
plants of various range and character of roots, and especially of leguminous crops.
Such plants, by their crop-residue, enrich the surface soil in nitrogen. It is, as a rule,
those of the most powerful root-development that take up the most nitrogen from
somewhere; and this fact points to a subsoil source. But independently of this,
which obviously might be held to be only evidence of the necessity of obtaining water
and mineral matters from below, in amount commensurate with the capability of
aequiring nitrogen from the air, the experimental results recorded in this paper can
leave little doubt that such plants obtain at any rate much of their nitrogen from the
subsoil. The question remainsâ€”whether or not the whole of it is derived from the
soil and subsoil? At present it is not proved that it is. It is equally not yet
conclusively proved that it comes from the atmosphere. It may be safely affirmed
that, in the case of our gramineous, our cruciferous, our chenopodiaceous, and our
solaneous crops, atmospheric nitrogen is not the source. If, therefore, it should be
proved to be the source in the case of the Leguminose, it may be that the development
of the organisms capable of bringing free nitrogen into combination within the soil is
favoured by leguminous growth and crop-residue, as there can be little doubt is the
