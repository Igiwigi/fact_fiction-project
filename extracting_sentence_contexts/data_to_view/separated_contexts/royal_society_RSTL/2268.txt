In the same manner associations of s/rong and weak pairs of plates should
be carefully avoided. A pair of copper and platina plates arranged in accordance
with a pair of zinc and platina plates in dilute sulphuric acid, were found to stop the
action of the latter, or even of two pairs of the latter, as effectually almost as an in-
terposed plate of platina (1011.), or as if the copper itself had been platina. It, in
fact, became an interposed decomposing plate, and therefore a retarding instead of
an assisting pair.

1046. The reversal, by accident or otherwise, of the plates in a battery has an ex-
ceedingly injurious effect. It is not merely the counter action of the current which the
reversed plates can produce, but their effect also in retarding even as indifferent plates,
and requiring decomposition to be effected upon their surface, in accordance with the
course of the current, before the latter can pass.
