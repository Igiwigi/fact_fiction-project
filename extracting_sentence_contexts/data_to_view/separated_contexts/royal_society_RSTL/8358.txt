We thus see that the quantities a, 3, s must be proportional to X, Y, Z, and that the
conditions to be fulfilled by L, M, N are precisely the same in both cases. 4. On the component wrenches about 8x 8crews of reference into which any wrench may
be resolved.â€”The properties of the virtual coefficient enable us to calculate with faci-
lity the magnitudes of seyen wrenches about seyen screws which equilibrate, or, in fact,
to resolve a wrench into six wrenches about six given screws* [art. 46].
