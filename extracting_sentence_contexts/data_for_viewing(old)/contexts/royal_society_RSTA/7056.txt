(Lesavre & Mercier 1947), concerning which we shall have more to say in § 10.

The reader may wonder why the list of truncations does not include t{3, q} (¢ = 5 or 3).
In general, the faces of t{p, q} are {2p} and {q}; but when p = $ the truncated face {2p} = {42}
is a repeated pentagon. In fact, t{3,5} consists of three coincident dodecahedra, while
t{3, 3} consists of two coincident great dodecahedra along with the icosahedron that has
the same vertices and edges (Coxeter 1931, pp. 209-210).
