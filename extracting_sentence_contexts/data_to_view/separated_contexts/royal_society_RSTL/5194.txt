Now in the Mollusca, as has been already stated, the neural side of the embryo is
the last to be developed, and the neryous system does not make its appearance until
the animal has taken its characteristic form. Contrast this with the Vertebrata; in them the neryous system is the first to be
developed, and it is, of consequence, the most fixed and unchanging feature in the
whole of their organization. On the other hand, the separation of the abdomen or post-abdomen from the body
is one of the earliest facts in molluscons development, and it has a corresponding
influence over their whole organization. The Archetypal Vascular System and its modifications —It may be questioned
whether the © archetypal” heart has a single or a double auricle, but it is certain
that in proportion as the symmetry of the branchial apparatus and of the whole body
is preserved, we approach to the form of heart with a double auricle. Thus we have
a double auricle in Chiton and Haliotis, and a close approach to it in Tethys, Janus,
and the Folide.
