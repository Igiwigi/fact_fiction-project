Theoretical—(A) The new explanation of detonation to which the cumulative
evidence of our researches has led may now be amplified with the aid of fig. 8,
which has been constructed from photograph, fig. 5. It represents diagrammatically
the state of things at each of twelve successive instants, 1/100,000 second apart,
in the explosion of a moist 2CO + O, medium starting from a point in the pre-
detonation stage 1/50,000 second before the auto-ignition occurs. The shaded
areas in the diagram indicate flame, the relative luminosity of which is approximately
shown by the density of the shading. The vertical lines indicate compression waves,
and the curved lines flame-fronts. The numerals inserted are velocities in metres
per second at the positions shown. At the outset, 1, the strongly radiating flame-
front A is seen approaching a compression wave BB’ (composed of a condensation

* ‘The lowness of this resultant velocity of 320 m/sec is due to the fact that the wave concerned is
travelling through a medium which is moving as a whole in the opposite direction; the two
component velocities being about 1100 and 780 m/sec.

B and a rarefaction B’ behind it. In 2, the flame-front is now closer up to BB’,
and in 3, when it is only 6-4 cm from it, the radiation from A, on absorption by
the compressed medium in B, both raises its temperature and strongly excites the
