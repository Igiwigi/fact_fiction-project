Berkshire outcrop, it does not consist of a monotonous plateau, but of variously dissected
hills, rising from 100 to 150 ft. above the general level of the Oxford Clay plain. The form
of these hills bears a direct relation to geological structure.

The only geological map published hitherto is that of the Geological Survey, Old
Series, sheet 34, by Epwarp Hutt, published in 1857, revised in 1859. Much of the
misleading nature of this map may be ascribed to the limitation imposed on the
surveyor by the inadequate subdivision of the rocks. Of the three old divisions (Lower
Caleareous Grit, Coral Rag and Upper Calcareous Grit), only the two first were considered
to enter into this area, and it is obvious that the surveyor drew the boundary at different
horizons in the Berkshire Oolites at different places.

This does not account, however, for the fact that, within the scope of three adjacent
fields on Red Down, Oxford Clay, the whole sequence of the Corallian formation, and an
outlier of Upper Calcareous Grit clay and possibly Kimeridge Clay, 25 ft. thick, are all
mapped as Lower Calcareous Grit.*

* At W(101) on the map a deep boring was sunk in 1904, passing right through Red Down. For
detailed account of strata penetrated, see ‘ Wilts. Arch. Nat. Hist. Mag.,’ vol. 44, pp. 43-45 (1927).
