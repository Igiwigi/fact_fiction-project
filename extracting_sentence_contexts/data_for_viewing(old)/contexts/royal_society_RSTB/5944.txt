(2) The symbols in brackets denote the leaves which arose in the angles after which they are placed.

(17) Positions and Sequence of I,a, 1,k and 1, in Sub-group 2.

In the three experiments of sub-group 2, I,a was joined to I, as well as to Ik. These
three leaves must therefore have arisen nearly simultaneously. But there is evidence
that I,a and I,k arose slightly later than I,. For in the section of No. 30 shown in
fig. 19, D, La and I,k appear to be inserted at a higher level than I,, which has already
separated from the stem. The same thing was seen in a low section of No. 29 (not shown
in fig. 18), though here the difference in level was very slight. The sections of No. 31
were too oblique to show the sequence of these leaves.

The explanation of the fact that I,a and I,k arose sooner after I, in sub-group 2 than
in sub-group 1 may quite probably be that in sub-group 2 the operations were made
earlier in the plastochron. For if so, then it is to be expected, for reasons similar to
those given previously (1931, p. 18), that the effect of the shift of the growing-point
was greater in sub-group 2, and consequently that there was a greater increase in available

space above the wound. Unfortunately the size of P, at the time of operation was not
noted in sub-group 2. But this suggested explanation is supported by the remaining
experiment, to be described in section 20, in which the operation was made very early
in the plastochron, and I,a arose before I.
