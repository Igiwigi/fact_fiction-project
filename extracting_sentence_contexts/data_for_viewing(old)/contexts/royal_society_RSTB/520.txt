rich in nitrogen as the Rothamsted subsoils, but in the most extreme case, that with
the strongest acid, and a temperature of 100° C., nearly one-third of the total nitrogen
of the soil was dissolved. Hence, although their results are of great interest as
indicating the character of the nitrogenous bodies existing in soils, and of the changes
to which they are subject when acted upon by acids, they, like those of Loces, have
only an indirect bearing on the question whether by the action of the organic acids of
the root-sap, the insoluble organic nitrogen of the soil, and especially of the subsoil,
is rendered available as a source of nitrogen to the plant. Supposing this to be the
case, as already said, the further question still remains—whether the dissolved amide is
taken up as such, or whether it is subject to further change within the soil before
serving as food for the plant ?

The fact that the formation of ammonia seems to be an essential element in the
reaction, points to the conclusion that at any rate part of the nitrogen liberated from
the insoluble condition is available in other forms than as soluble or dissolved amide ;
and, as our experiments show that nitric acid, as well as ammonia, is a constituent
of the root-sap, the question arises—whether the. liberated ammonia is oxidated
into nitric acid before being taken up? Then, again, is the soluble amide taken up
as such, or subjected to further change, perhaps first yielding ammonia, and this again
nitric acid ?

On this supposition we are met again with the difliculty as to the sufficient aération
of the subsoil for such a purpose. It has already been pointed out, that such evidence
as exists on the subject clearly shows that the amount of oxygen within the soil at
any one time is totally inadequate for the nitrification of the amount of nitrogen taken
