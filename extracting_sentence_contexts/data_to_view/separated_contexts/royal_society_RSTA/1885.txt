This shows that the currents are
carried by electrons emitted from the drops. The object of the present investigation has been to obtain quantitative information
about this interesting phenomenon, and, more especially, to ascertain the magnitude of
the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons and the mode of its distribution among them. The importance of the subject lies in the fact that it is the only way, so far as | am
aware, in which any information at all can be made available as to the distribution of
energy among the individual products—molecular, atomic, ionic or electronic—of a
chemical reaction. The majority of the experiments have been directed towards obtain-
ing the curves showing the relation between the chemical electron current and the
applied electromotive force for the case of a small spherical source concentric with a
large spherical electrode. If the currents are small and the gas pressure is low, so that
the motion of the liberated electrons is determined entirely by the applied electric field
and is interfered with neither by the molecules of the gas nor by the fields of force arising
from other electrons, we should anticipate that these electron currents would exhibit
saturation with zero applied potential difference ; subject to the additional proviso
