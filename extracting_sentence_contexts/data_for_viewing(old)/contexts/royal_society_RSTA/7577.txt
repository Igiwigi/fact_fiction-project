the precipitation of calcium carbonate in industrial processes, sometimes in undesirable
locations or in unwanted form, has led to renewed interest in the subject. Recent investiga-
tions have had an advantage over the older work in the availability of the X-ray method of
phase identification, which has led to some clarification of the early results and has revealed
new complexities. A slowly deepening understanding of the mechanism of crystal growth,
which a century ago was an entirely speculative matter, is another modern development,
which allows us nowadays to penetrate rather further into the fundamental processes
involved. But even now itis not possible to make a quantitative approach to an explanation
of one of the most interesting features of the precipitation of calcium carbonate under
a range of conditions, which is the nucleation and growth of metastable phases. In this
paper some of the relevant agreed data concerning such phenomena are reviewed, some
new facts are presented and a qualitative approach is offered to the problem of metastability
which explains the facts observed.

The known phases of calcium carbonate and its hydrates

Three forms of anhydrous calcium carbonate are well recognized, namely calcite,
aragonite and vaterite or z-calcium carbonate. Calcite and aragonite occur in nature as
well-defined minerals and have been extensively examined in the past. Their properties,
including crystal structure, are well known and are described in standard works on
chemistry, mineralogy and crystallography. Vaterite has also been clearly recognized as a
distinct form of calcium carbonate which can be obtained by precipitation in the laboratory.

Calcium carbonate hexahydrate has been known for more than a century. A common
