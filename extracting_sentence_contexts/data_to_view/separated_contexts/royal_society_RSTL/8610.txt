There does not appear to be any room at all for doubting that cells keep on passing
off from the surface of these folds of the inner capsular membrane into the yelk, just
as cells keep on passing away as scurf from the surface of the human epidermis. It is
a very different question as to whether they retain their vitality and individuality after
passing into the yelk. This question is now one of the very greatest importance in
embryology generally; and without discussing the views of Professor His or his oppo-
nents, who haye made the egg of the hen and of osseous fishes their study, I desire to
draw attention to the facts observed in the case of the Cephalopods Sepia and Loligo. Of the cells which pass off or are proliferated into the yelk, s0 to speak, by far the
majority are undoubtedly metamorphosed and broken down into a condition chemically
lower than that of living protoplasm before they have long been there. Hence there
is not such a wide distinction between this third mode of the egg's nutrition, which I
$hall call © corpuscular,” and the earlier form of inceptive nutrition, which may be
distinguished as secretional.
