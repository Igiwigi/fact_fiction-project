and does not include lines (other than those of He and H) which are not present in
the dark line spectrum.

The most important point remaining open for discussion is the relation of the
intensities of the bright lines to those of their dark line equivalents, for on this
point turns the question whether the flash spectrum layer is in truth the stratum -
which by its absorption gives rise to the Fraunhofer spectrum.

In discussing the results of the flash spectra obtained in India in 1898,* I stated
certain conclusions leading to the belief that the flash spectrum does, in fact,
represent the upper more diffused portion of an absorbing stratum which, taken as a
whole, produces the Fraunhofer lines. The conclusions relating to the relative
intensities of the lines I now recapitulate in the following three paragraphs :â€”

(1) The relative intensities of the lines of any one element in the flash spectrum
are practically the same as those of the same element in the solar spectrum.

(2) The relative intensities between groups of lines belonging to different elements
are widely different in the flash and in the solar spectrum.

(3) The apparent intensity of the radiation from an element in the lower
chromosphere is determined by the extent to which that element is diffused above
