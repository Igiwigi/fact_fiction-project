SV. From the whole therefore of the above mentioned pro-
perties, it evidently appears that guaiacum is a substance very
different from those which are denominated resins, and that
it is. also different from all those which. are enumerated
amongst the balsams, gum resins, gums, and extracts : most
probably it is.a substance ' distinct Jin. its nature from, any of
the above, in consequence of certain peculiarities in the pro-
portions and chemical combination of its constituent ele-
mentary principles ; but as this opinion may be thought not
sufficiently supported by the facts which have been adduced,
we may for the present be allowed to regard guaiacum as
composed of a resin modified by the vegetable extractive

* This substance was found by ProvsT to be insoluble in water nd soluble in
alcohol, When treated with oxy-muriatic acid, it assumed the colour of a withered
leaf, acquiring the resinous properties in greater perfection. Vids Tromson's
