Strongylocentrotus 3 hybrids are much more readily obtainable in
the summer months than in the winter ones. One would accordingly expect that
the maturity of the Spherechinus ova was also less in the summer months. As we
have seen above, this view is favoured by the fact that very much smaller numbers
f the summer ova developed to plutei than of the winter ones, but disfavoured by
She absence of any diminution in the size of the summer larvie. The balance of
gvidence may perhaps be held to point to a slight diminution of maturity during the
‘summer. In any case the variations in the maturity of Spherechinus ave very much
idess than in the case of Strongylocentrotus, and similarly the variations in capacity for
“®ross-fertilisation of the ova with season are also much less marked.
