B. maximus and B. Gibsonianus being from the same restricted locality and
geological horizon, being known only from a single specimen each, and being in such
different stages of development, it might be concluded by someone not working on
them that they are really the same species. I must emphasise, therefore, the fact
that CARRUTHERS undoubtedly was correctly inspired when he, without any
examination of the internal parts, diagnosed B. maximus as different from
B. Gibsonianus. The vegetative characters, particularly the absence of gum canals
and the presence of the peculiar “ transfusion” cells, isolates B. maaimus vegetatively
further from B, Gibsonianus than any of the other species of the genus, in all of
which gum canals are common.
