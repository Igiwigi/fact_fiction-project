insight of the tobacco industry was that you ‘could use normal scientific uncertainty to undermine
the status of stabilized scientific knowledge’ [39, p. 3]. In this article, she describes how a new
case study involving the political battle over electricity generation in the early decades of the
twentieth century highlights the efficacy of uncertainty-based messaging and the ideological
driver behind those messages. An understanding of the history of those contrarian activities


is valuable to understand—and ultimately counteract—similar efforts currently underway with
respect to climate change.

Beyond their ability to forestall regulatory actions, uncertainty-based campaigns can have
further psychological, cognitive and political implications that have largely escaped notice to
date. In fact, we suggest that those largely overlooked consequences of uncertainty may be at
least as harmful as the more overt political consequences analysed by Oreskes in this issue and
others (e.g. [40,41]).

At a cognitive level, recent research has shown that people’s perception of probabilistic
information is determined in part by their motivations. Specifically, when people are motivated
to arrive at a particular outcome, they detect more variance in probabilistic information. This
desirability bias increases when the probability range is wider rather than narrower [42]. In other
words, a climate-sensitivity range of 1.5-4°C may elicit more wishful thinking than the range :
2-4°C. This human tendency for wishful thinking stands in contrast to the actual implications of :=

the extension of the range of sensitivities as noted earlier [23,26]. Sy
