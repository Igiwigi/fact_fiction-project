the problem of estimating with the help of sample surveys the area and yield of a number of —
crops like paddy and jute in Bengal and wheat and sugar cane in the United Provinces. The
work has to be done on a large scale covering tracts of land fifty or sixty thousand square ©
miles or more in extent. The question of costs is therefore of great importance, and my aim _
has been to develop a sampling technique which would supply, at any given cost, a final
estimate with the lowest possible margin of error.

2. It is the object of the present paper to give a general account of the work relating
to the estimation of crop areas. The basic principles are not new. These were enunciated
concisely but with characteristic precision by Professor R. A. Fisher who stated that the
object of such sample surveys was ‘to give the maximum precision in return for the labour
expended’ (J. R. Statist. Soc. 1934, p. 615)—a point of view identical with that adopted in
the present paper. In fact, in one sense what has been done is to develop Fisher’s ideas in a
systematic way in the light of experimental studies of large-scale field surveys.

3. As already mentioned a characteristic feature of the work is its large scale of operations.
This introduces many special problems on the theoretical as well as on the applied side.
Four or five hundred investigators are often employed in the field survey; and they have to
work, not in a compact group, but scattered over the whole country covering fifty or sixty
thousand square miles in area. Preparatory and tabulation work has to be organized on
an extensive scale; in the jute survey, for example, it involved handling over 200,000 sheets
of village maps. The whole task thus partakes of something of the nature of an engineering
project; and this is why the present paper may be described as dealing with a problem of
statistical engineering.
