For m=1, the double tangent has the two coincident real intersections y=0, or it is
in fact a triple tangent.

For m<1>0, the double tangent has with the curve two real intersections, viz. they
are the points where the double tangent meets the circle a*+4*=1.

And finally, for m=0, the points in question unite themselves with the points of
contact, the double tangent z=0 being in this case the common tangent at the two

cusps z=0, y==+1.
