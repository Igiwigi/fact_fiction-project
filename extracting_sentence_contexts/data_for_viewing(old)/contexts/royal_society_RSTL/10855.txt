bove the value it had after the wire was demagnetised by reversals. The action is,

fact, analogous to the augmentation of magnetism which occurs (through the
uence of hysteresis) in a magnetised wire which has been tapped, by applying

and removing a load (see IF 78, 85).

—— Here there is no visible magnetism for the stress to act on, but we find evidence
of the fact that a load has been applied and removed in the augmented state of
snsceptibility in which it leaves the wire.

Moreover, jus as in the more obvious manifestations of hysteresis already dealt
QOwith, the effect of vibrating is to remove in great part the traces of previous
voperations. The augmented susceptibility, which is found after loading and unloading,
Sdisappears if we vibrate the wire before magnetising, just as when a wire hanging in
