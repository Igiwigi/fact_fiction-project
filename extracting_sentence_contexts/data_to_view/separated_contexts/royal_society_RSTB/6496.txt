In the light of the existing knowledge of gastropods, the theories of torsion which have
been favourably received have sought for the cause of the twist during the adult life
ofa hypothetical primitive mollusc (BUTscHit 1887, LANG 1891, PLATE 1896, FLEURE 1902
and NaeF 1913). Others are of opinion that torsion was not primarily developed in
the interest of the adult, but is a larval adaptation; those who seek for ontogenetic
evidence are BouTan (1899), ROBERT (1902), PELSENEER (1911), GARSTANG (1928). How
far ontogenetic facts can be used in relation to phylogenetic theory is problematical. If only from the point of view of their possible bearing on the existing theoretical
views, such facts may be enlightening, for as DRumMonp (1902) remarked, knowledge
of the organogenesis of gastropods is so meagre, that a study of the development of
even a single type is helpful. From the embryological point of view it has been shown by Crampton (1894) that
asymmetry is foreshadowed in the cleavage of the ovum, since in sinistral forms there
is a complete reversal of the cleavage planes as compared with dextral gastropods.
