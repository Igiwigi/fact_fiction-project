bifurcation. Roll patterns feature an integer number of maxima along the azimuthal direction,
and correspondingly, the spectra are characterized by spectral lines spaced by the same integer
number of FSRs. At threshold (o = 1), this number is the closest integer to [2(a — 2)/ By'/2. Tt was
shown by Lugiato & Lefever in [1] that these rolls are super-critical when a < ¥, and sub-critical
otherwise. The stationary sub-critical patterns are essentially bright cavity solitons and soliton
molecules, which correspond to bound solitons complexes. They should therefore not be confused
with states where isolated solitons coexist in the cavity without mutual interaction (distance much
greater than the soliton pulsewidth). The stationary patterns in the anomalous dispersion regime
are displayed in figure 3. At the experimental level, numerous demonstrations of roll patterns
(e.g. [21]) and solitons [22] have been reported in the literature.

In the normal dispersion case, dissipative patterns can only be generated in a very limited area
of the parameter space. In fact, Turing rolls only arise marginally here, in a very narrow band
just above the Hamiltonian—Hopf bifurcation when a is strongly detuned (> 1). As displayed
in figure 4, there is another narrow band in the hysteresis area where solitonic solutions are


stable, and more precisely, dark solitons and platicons/flaticons [18,23]. These patterns have been
experimentally demonstrated in [24].

4. Non-stationary dissipative structures

Depending on the pumping conditions, the dissipative patterns can become non-stationary and
display an explicit time-dependence. Indeed, the temporal dynamics of the intra-cavity field
will have the timescale of the photon lifetime, and will therefore be slow. These non-stationary
