the consequences of an accident disastrous, it was decided not to exceed half this limit.
The second enclosure was alone used for higher pressures, it being, as we shall see, of
stronger construction.

Apart from the effect of actual pressure, that of the sudden impact or blow given
by the more rapid explosives has to be considered. As will be seen below, some
mixtures of compressed coal gas and oxygen develop their full pressure in something
like one ten-thousandth of a second and, in fact, occasionally detonate. It is diffieult
to estimate the actual strain produced by a force so suddenly applied.* When we
consider that the present work comprised the repeated explosion of such mixtures, it
will be seen that exact calculation becomes impossible. In all probability, during the
course of the first few explosions of this kind the part of the material nearest the
inner surface is strained to beyond its limit of elasticity, and therefore yields. In the
case of steel, like the present, having a fair elongation, the first effect is actually to
strengthen the enclosure; the inner layers of the steel having been thus permanently
elongated are under an initial compression which will help them in resisting further
deformation. Aided, however, by the extremely rapid variations of temperature, this
effect will in time cause surface cracks. Under successive strains the cracks will
deepen to an extent that may become dangerous. Being on the inner surface of the
chamber, the extent of the damage cannot be clearly ascertained. In the present
