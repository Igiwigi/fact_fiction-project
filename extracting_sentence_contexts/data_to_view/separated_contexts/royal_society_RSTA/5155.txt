In the context of RCP 2.6, however, abrupt termination results in less than : 5

half that rate of warming [52]. Thus, the study that focuses only on RCP 8.5 omits a crucial piece
of information: in the context of aggressive mitigation, the abrupt termination of SRM poses a far
less serious problem than it does under a high-emissions scenario. Conversely, a study that only
considered RCP 2.6 would omit the even more important fact that abrupt termination would be
catastrophic under a high-emissions scenario. Similarly, studies that focus only ona single method
of climate engineering will omit information about alternative methods; studies that focus only
one level of climate engineering (e.g. the level needed to offset all anthropogenic warming) will
omit information about alternative levels (e.g. the level needed to partially offset additional
warming) and so on. It is impossible, of course, to consider all alternatives in a single study.
