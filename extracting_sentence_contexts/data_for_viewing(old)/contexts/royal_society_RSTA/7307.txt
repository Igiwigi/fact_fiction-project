sign error in the limit of an integral) was first pointed out by Norton (1935) and shown by

Burrows (1936, 1937) to be in amount just the ‘surface-wave’ term contributed by the residue

of the pole P,. Epstein held that the subsequent controversy concerning the ‘existence’ of
this surface wave had never been resolved, a view not unsupported by the text-books (e.g.
Stratton 1941, p. 585; Schelkunoff 1943, pp. 430, 431), and his paper inspired a number of
others on the same subject (e.g. Kahan & Eckart 19480, 6, 19494, 4, 1950; further papers
have appeared more recently). These have been criticized by Bouwkamp (1948.4, b, 19504, },
1951) and it has been established that Epstein’s suggestion is incorrect. The essential error
(in the present author’s opinion) made by Sommerfeld has, however, been overlooked in
this revival of an old controversy: namely, that (in the notation of his 1909 paper) he put
a — ./p when 2 was real and positive, instead of —/p, as his choice of branch-cuts in fact

demanded. This explanation was given by Niessen (1937).

3:4. Some distinctive features of the analysis

With reference to the foregoing analysis, it is worth emphasizing several points, an
appreciation of which will help to clarify the subsequent work.

(1) A method of solution which is physically straightforward is to express the incident
cylindrical field as an angular spectrum of plane waves, choosing a path of integration which
is such that the individual plane waves are essentially ‘down-coming’, thus avoiding any
ambiguity in deriving the corresponding reflected field. The resulting integral is con-
