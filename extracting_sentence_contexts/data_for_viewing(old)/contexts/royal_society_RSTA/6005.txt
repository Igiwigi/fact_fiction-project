The proof is straightforward but long and is provided in the appendix.


Remark 4.12. Regarding this theorem, the blowup of the infimum of the stretching rate y is
always accompanied by a collapse of the out-of-plane vorticity @ to zero, thus providing an
example of theorem 2.10 on the conservation of zeroes of the symmetry 9 defined in (4.3). By
contrast, the blowup of the supremum of the stretching rate y is not always accompanied by a
blowup of @, as the case 0 < 4 shows.

(f) Remarks on the spatial structure of the blowup

The blowup of the infimum of the stretching rate y is stronger than the blowup of its supremum.
In fact, for the exact three-dimensional Euler solution case 4=0, the supremum blowup is
marginal: the denominator is going to infinity logarithmically, making this blowup milder than
the infimum blowup. In the case 0 < 4, the exponent in the supremum blowup is always smaller
than in the infimum blowup. In the case —1/2 < 4 < 0, the exponent is the same for both infimum
and supremum, but the prefactor is always larger for the infimum blowup.

Nevertheless, when considering the spatial structure of the blowup, the value of the stretching
rate does not matter as much as the spatial profile of the blowup region. Because y = —Vj, - uy,
considering the two-dimensional flow on the z=0 plane an interesting pattern emerges: a
blowup of the infimum of y corresponds to a positive-divergence flow, where the particles are
repelled from the singular point. This makes such singularities ‘thick’, and therefore amenable to
numerical simulations, and when considering the third dimension, the flow is towards the plane,
and as the out-of-plane vorticity tends to zero, the helicity is negligible near these singularities.
