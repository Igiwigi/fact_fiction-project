But even amongst these there is only one
combination where the mother is 7 years older, only 6 where she is 6, and 15 where she is 5 years older. In consequence of the scarcity of these cases, we could extend our calculation over all age combinations,
including even those where the mother is older. Referring to the quoted facts, we may thus venture to
say that the Galton formula holds good not only for the eases of older husbands, but also for those
families where the husband is about 5 years younger than his wife. MDCCCXOV.â€”B, 58
