Twelve others did not
change course, but came down and settled on the gravel within 15 m. of the cloth after
passing over it. None of the hundreds that passed over the cloth above 3 m. descended, but
about twelve flying at 5 to 10 m. came down and settled 3 to 5 m. short of the cloth. The fact
that higher fliers responded before passing over the cloth but lower fliers afterwards, is
contributory evidence that the response was visual, for the higher fliers would see the cloth
sooner than lower fliers. The cloth was spread again later on that day, but locusts were fewer and flying rather
higher, while the background was less suitable. It was a light sandy patch in a dry river
bed, but nearby and along the locustsâ€™ flight route there were many patches of contrastingly
darker ground, and the sun was obscured.
