The central part of the transverse section (Plate 14, fig. 14, @) resembles the Petticur
plant in consisting of numerous clusters of tracheze aggregated into a large axial mass,
into the composition of which many parenchymatous cells enter. That these cells may
have become carbonised is probable from the fact that, when examined under a higher
power, the appearances shown in fig. 15 are observed. Two of the clusters of trachez,
enlarged 75 diameters, are here represented.
