A. HIRST ON THE VOLUMES OF PEDAL SURFACES. 19

In like manner the pedal of a tubular surface would, in general, consist of distinct
sheets which would coincide when the primitive degenerated to a line. Although the
pedal gurface, therefore, still exists when two dimensions of the primitive are supposed
to vanisch—being, in fact, still the envelope of spheres whose diameters are the radii
vectores of the curye—its volume must be regarded as eyanescent. The case is otherwise, however, when one only of the three dimensions of the primi-
tive is 8upposed to vanish. Such a surface (S') would consist of two coincident sheets,
and would, therefore, enclose no space; to the eye, in fact, it would not be distinguish-
able from some definite portion of an ordinary surface.
