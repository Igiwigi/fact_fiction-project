2343. 'Trt magnetic characters of iron, nickel and cobalt, are well known ; and
also the fact that at certain temperatures they lose their usual property and become,
to ordinary test and observation, non-magnetic; then entering into the list of dia-
magnetic bodies and acting in like manner with them. Closer investigation, how-
ever, has shown me that they are still very different to other bodies, and that though
inactive when hot, on common magnets or to common tests, they are not 80 abs0-
lately, but retain a certain amount of magnetic power whatever their temperature;
and also that this power is the same in character with that which they ordinarily
POSSESS.

2344. A piece of iron wire, about one inch long and 0-05 of an inch in diameter,
being thoroughly cleaned, was suspended at the middle by a fine platinum wire con-
nected with the suspending thread (2249.) 80 as to swing between the poles of the
electro-magnet. The heat of a-spirit-lamp was applied to it, and it s00n acquired a
