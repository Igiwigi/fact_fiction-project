nodal displacements are extracted. The mesh size was designed to provide the same number
of data points that could be obtained experimentally employing a grid method, considering a
perfect grid of 1mm pitch that is usually employed in the experimental procedure. In order
to obtain corresponding numerically simulated fields, the time increment was reduced to 1 ns,
whereas the displacements were stored every 500 ns (200 steps over 100 us) to simulate a 2 Mfps
acquisition rate that allowed having 500 iterations between every two output step frames that
ensured the stability of displacement fields. Furthermore, the obtained fields were considered to
be independent of the FE mesh, i.e. the chosen elements were sufficiently small, so that any further
refinement would not result in notably different displacements. The loading boundary condition
was considered as a distributed pressure pulse with the temporal distribution obtained from an
actual experiment [16]. Rather than simulating the whole experimental set-up, the spalling sample
was modelled by directly applying the loading pulse on the bar—specimen interface based on the
fact it has been numerically shown that two approaches are fairly similar [58]. This is mainly due
to the fact that the dispersion effects of the smoothed wave travelling through small diameter
