The different parts do not, however, appear to have the same morphological significance
as those in the mesonephros.

Judging from the analogy of Teleostei, the embryonic structure of whose pronephros
is strikingly similar to that of Lepidosteus, the two pronephric chambers into which
the segmental ducts open are constricted off sections of the body-cavity.

With the formation of the convoluted duct opening into the isolated section of

We feel fairly confident that there is only one pronephric opening on each side, though we haye

single serics of sections sufliciently complete to demonstrate this fact with absolate certainty.

& body-cavity we may speak of a definite pronephros as having become established.
The pronephros is placed, as can be made out in later stages, on the level of the
opening of the air-bladder into the throat.
