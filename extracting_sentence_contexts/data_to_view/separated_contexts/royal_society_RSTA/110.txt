Upon denoting the event duration by 1(k) = t¢(k) — ti(k), the probability distribution
of S(k) can be obtained from the probability distribution of €(r(k)) = Se ‘e e(t) dt constrained by
the previously mentioned conditions on e(f). Furthermore, €(t(k)) should be computed in the
dissipation range and its fluctuations are correlated (with some non-trivial lag time depending on
t(k)) to the probability distribution of the large-scale velocity fluctuations, i.e. to the kinetic energy. In summary, besides the fact that the statistical properties of S(k) depend on the inertial range
fluctuations in a complicated way, the probability distribution of P[S] should be self-consistent
with the fluctuations of the kinetic energy. Thus, the knowledge on the statistical properties of

Figure 4. In the figure, we show a two-dimensional map for the PDF of both log(S) and log(t,y).
