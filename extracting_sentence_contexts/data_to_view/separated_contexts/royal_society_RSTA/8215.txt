For if we project from a point
of ¢s, this curve projects into an elliptic quartic c, in ordinary space ; and I projects
into the quadric through ¢,, generated by those chords (uw, v) of c, for which w +- v = &. Hence there ure «: cubic ruled surfaces containing the curve cs, and these generate
the whole locus of chords M,°. Also it is in fact to these very surfuces V that the
generating lines of F.§ correspond. For being generated by chords of cs, they correspond

only to curves of = lying on F,° ; and since a -quadric meets each of the surfaces in
c, and therefore in only one chord of ¢; beside, the curves must be the generators of
F, as stated.

* The order of the surface in question is just the number of lines which meet six planes in [4]; and this

is known to be five. See Seare ‘ Rend.
