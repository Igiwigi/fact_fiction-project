=~ (0, P|dyde D)* + Ie (Wy P|I.) + Ay (Ip Pde ®) — Iu (IvPldr®). (6.2)
Taking the real part, we find
2Re (Iu P| dy Ir P) = Ir (Suv + ApAv) + Av(Sur + ApAr) — Iu(gvr + AvAr)- (5.3)

With this identity and equation (5.1), we obtain

1 1 1
Dut = ~ 5 9rS uv - 9 Our + 3 n8vr- (5.4)
Thus, Dyvr has been expressed in terms of g,,,. In fact, we have
Dyvt = —Tvt, (5.5)

where I,yr is the Christoffel symbol of the first kind in classical Riemannian geometry. Turning to C,»7, we find the expression

Cuvr =Im (0p, |0)9. ) — Ap Svr — AvSur — ArSpv — ApAvAr. (5.6)

This is also symmetric with respect to the interchange of the second two indices. However, due
to the presence of the irreducible third-order quantity Im(d,,%|)0;®), Cy.vr cannot be expressed
in terms of lower-order geometric quantities and their derivatives.
