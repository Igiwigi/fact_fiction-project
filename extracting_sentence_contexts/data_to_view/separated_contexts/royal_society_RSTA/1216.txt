The second paper, by loxrBE and SaKkat§ gives the results of an experimental investiga-
tion of the variation with temperature of the elastic and viscous coefficients, and contains
a full account of previous work on this subject. The experiments were made on the
damping of the vibrations of torsional pendulums. The slight discrepancies between
the observed damping and that predicted by the viseo-elastic hypothesis were supposed
to be due to dissipation of energy at the point of fixation, and to the fact that the
amplitude of the twist was excessively great. The “real” logarithmic decrement was
obtained by a method of interpolation. The tangential viscosity of a solid was found
to increase with increase of temperature, in general; but in the case of iron (which
has a high melting point)
