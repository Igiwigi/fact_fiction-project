networks on successful detection and transmission of weak signals. In this context, complex
network models derived from graph theoretical analysis of neuroimaging data provide a useful
environment for the computational study of these two resonance phenomena.

In this review, a coalescence of recent intriguing SR and VR studies in neuronal media is
presented. More precisely, our focus is on weak signal detection via both phenomena in complex
neuronal networks in the light of experimental and theoretical findings. We have tried to make
it as comprehensive as possible to guide further research. After briefly introducing these two
phenomena and their neural interpretation, the remainder of this review is organized as follows:
In §2, we emphasize the significance of connectivity and complexity in the neural system. In §3,
we present a representative mathematical expression of resonance behaviour and widely used
metrics for evaluating it. Then, in §4, we discuss in detail recent SR and VR studies investigating
the effects of various biophysical facts on the weak signal detection performance in neuronal
networks. Finally, we summarize the review with concluding remarks in §5.

2. Significance of neuronal connectivity

In line with the technological advances across recent decades, the knowledge on neuronal
connectivity has been advanced with different neuroimaging methods including functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS), arterial spin labeling (ASL), functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
and magnetoencephalography (MEG) [27-29]. The term ‘connectivity’ in neuroscience refers to
patterns of links between distinct units within a nervous system. It can be defined with individual
neurons and their synaptic contacts at microscale, with groups of neural circuits at mesoscale and
with interconnected brain regions at macroscale. From an anatomical point of view, these refer
