direct effect on selection but also by the fact that it is correl-
for a population to increase by a factor of Ro ated with other traits that are directly associated with
selection. Therefore, to estimate the direct force of selection
associated with a given trait, it is necessary to control for
the correlations between traits.

The direct force of selection for a trait is given by its selec-
tion gradient, 8; It is equal to the partial regression
coefficient from a multiple linear regression of relative fitness
on all of the traits. For present purposes, we can simply state
that 8; can be expressed as the ratio o,,/0; multiplied by a
term based on the correlations among the traits, and the correl-
ations between each trait and relative fitness [19]. As before, it is
