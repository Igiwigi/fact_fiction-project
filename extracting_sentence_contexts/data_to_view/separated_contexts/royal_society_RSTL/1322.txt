Davy's Lecture on some new analytical Researches

proper proportions, they both entirely disappear ; a white salt
is formed, and a quantity of pure hydrogene gas evolved,
which equals about one third of the original volume of the
gas. By eight grains of potassium employed in this way, I ef-
fected the absorption of nearly twenty two cubical inches. of
muriatic acid gas; and the quantity of hydrogene gas produced
was equal to more than eight cubical inches. The correspondence between the quantity of hydrogene
generated in cases of this kind, and by the action of potassjum
upon water, combined with the effects of ignited charcoal
upon muriatic acid gas, by which a quantity of inflammable
gas is produced equal to more than one third of its volume;
seemed to shew, that the phenomena merely depended upon
moisture combined with the muriatic acid gas.*

To determine this point with more certainty however, Td
to ascertain whether or no the appearance of the hydrogene
was wholly unconnected with the decomposition of the acid; I
made two comparative experiments on the quantity of muriate
of silver, furnished by two equal quantities of muriatic acid,'one
of which had been converted into muriate of potash by the ac-
tion of potassium, and the other of which had been absorbed
by water; every care was taken to avoid sources of error;
and it was found that there was no notable difference in the
weight of the results.

* When the Vo.Taic spark is taken continuously, by means of points of charcoal
in muriatic acid gas over mercury, muriate of mercury is rapidly formed, a volume
of inflammable gas, equal to one third of the original yolume of the muriatic acid
gas appears, The acid gas enters into combination with the oxide of mercury, 0

that water enough is present in the experiment to form oxide $ufficient to absorb the
whole of the acid.


on the Nature of certain Bodies. 93

There was no proof then, that the muriatic acid had been
decompounded in these experiments; and there was every
reason to consider it as containing in its common aeriforny
state, at least one third of its weight of water ; and this con-
clusion we shall find warranted by facts, which are imme-
diately to follow. Inow made a number of experiments, with the hopes of
obtaining the muriatic acid free from water. I first heated to whiteness, in a well luted porcelain retort, a
mixture of dry sulphate of iron, and muriate of lime which had
been previously ignited; but a few cubic inches of gas only, were
obtained, though the mixture was in the quantity of several
ounces; and this gas contained sulphureous acid.
