S 25 per cent, with, the potass.

a Thus, notwithstanding there was even rather more nitrogen annually taken up on
S plot 10 over the 14 years during which the potass was excluded from the manure,
= there was much less hay produced, and much less mineral matter taken up, than on
= plot 9, where the application of potass was continued. There was an average annual
> deficiency of more than 700 lbs. of hay, and of about 60 1bs. of mineral matter ; the
© former representing a deficiency of carbon assimilated averaging about 230 Ibs. per
& acre per annum in the removed produce, to say nothing of the second crops, the
:2 roots, &c.

S The deficiency of total growth on plot 10 compared with plot 9 was not manifested
SZ in any marked degree until after the first five years of the 14 ; in fact, during the
> firs 8ix years of the 20, a total of about 900 1bs. of potass per acre had been applied to
= each plot, and the total amount taken out in the crop was much less than this. It is
S to be supposed, therefore, that there was a considerable residue of the supplied potass
Z poxbly available for the succeeding crops. How much, however, ib is impossible to
= decide absolutely; for, in the first place, we do not know whether as much, or more,
f or less, was given up from the s0il itself in the presence of the liberal artificial
A gupply than was taken up without manure, or by the ammonia-salts alone, or by the
© mmonia-salts and superphosphate of lime without potass or soda ; nor, in the second
S place, do we know how much of the residue of the supplied potass would enter into
S such combinations within the oil as to remain either unavailable, or but lowly
Q available to succeeding crops.
