174 DR. A. MATTHIESSEN ON THE ELECTRIC

tures but solutions of one metal in the other, may be deduced from the fact of their
fusing-points being generally lower than the mean of that of the volumes taken. Secondly. To what is the rapid decrement of the conducting power due ?

The only answer which I can at present give to this question, is that most of the
other physical properties of the metal are altered in a like manner; for on looking at
the alloys made with the metals of Class A. with one another, we see that most of their
other physical properties are not at all altered ; for amongst them, for instance, we find
no brittle ones; they appear, in fact, to take an equal share of the properties of the
metals composing them. But now let us examine the alloys of the second class, and
we immediately discover great differences ; alloy gold, the most ductile of all metals,
with small per-centages of tin, lead, or zinc, and it becomes as brittle as glass. Again,
alloy silver with small per-centages of the above metals, and its properties are much
altered.
