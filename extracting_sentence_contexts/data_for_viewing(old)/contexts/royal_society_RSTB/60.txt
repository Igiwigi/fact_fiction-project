ACTION OF THE EXCISED MAMMALIAN HEART. 225

we could roughly estimate excitability by the greater or less energy with which a
mechanical stimulus is required to be applied to provoke contraction ; with what we
have termed “acute” excitability, the lightest superficial touch was sufficient to
discharge a beat; with “ obtuse” excitability, pricking or scratching with a needle
was required to produce any effect ; between these two extremes we could and did
test gradations which justified our statement. To the second feature, viz., length of
latent period, we paid particular attention; a summary of our results is given in
Table E, from which it appears that the latent period is prolonged with prolongation
of the heart’s contraction. There is a rough relationship between the two magnitudes,
the former being to the latter about one-tenth; but the relationship is only a rough
one, owing to the fact that when the contraction is very prolonged it is impossible to
determine where it ends on the tracing, and its true time-value cannot, therefore, be
exactly given. But the chief point is unmistakably clear: the latent period of
stimulation may be extraordinarily prolonged, a very usual length being about ‘5 sec.,
and an exceptional maximum being as great as 2 secs. (see Tracing 8). This, as far as

Rabbit's heart ; effects of cold and heat on latent period ; in the cooled heart the latent period is about
2 seconds, the ventricular contraction rises slowly to its maximum; in the case of the warmed heart
the latent period is very short, and the ventricular contraction very rapidly reaches its maximum ;
the decline is in both cases gradual, most so in the case of the cooled heart. The heart was placed
in a porcelain capsule and cooled or warmed by being surrounded by ice or with water at 40° C.
