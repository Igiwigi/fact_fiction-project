Traced up the main axis, pp Vries found these to increase in
number and extent and then decrease. And Tiyné Tammes(10) has shown that
these changes do not synchronise with those in the internode-length. The rule
propounded by DE Vries does not hold exactly for the occasional leaf-displacements

that I observed, but this may be due in part to the paucity of the specimens of one
species that I examined, and in part to the fact that some of the axes I examined
were not main ones. Indeed, analogy with the displacement-curve of the cheno-
podiaceous branches leads me to suggest that pe Vries’ rule will not hold good for
the anomalies on branches, but that on some branches inserted high up the plant the
anomalies will be found either to be most marked near the base of the branch and
decreasingly so towards its tip, or to show two maxima. Although pe Vrres’ rule adds strength to the view here propounded in regard to
the significance of the displacement sub-curve in Chenopodiaces, its application may
not be general.
