It means that, in
a liquid chloroform sample, for instance, only a tiny fraction of the molecules will
actually be two-qubit quantum computers, with a huge background of isolated
'H contributing to the NMR signal. Fortunately, 8C-enriched chloroform (and
other C-based samples) can be purchased! The two main facts about NMR-QIP are the following. (i) Thermal equilibrium
density matrices can be transformed by means of RF pulses and average
techniques to the so-called pseudo-pure states,

l-e
pb + Wl, (1.3)

where |W) is a pure state and e%hw/2nkT, n the number of qubits and T
the equilibrium temperature. The measured NMR signal from such a state is
proportional to the nuclear magnetization,

M* x Tr{o* ly) WI}, (1.4)

therefore behaving as a pure quantum state. (ii) The second point is that RF
pulses implement nearly ideal unitary transformation. By exploiting a fine pulse
control and free evolution with J-coupling, a universal set of quantum logic gates
can be designed.
