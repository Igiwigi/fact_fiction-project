The system is the simplest one after the
Euler system of a perfect gas. It is evident, however, that such an RET theory with only one relaxation process has limitations
to its applicability. In fact, we have many experimental data on sound waves [4,5,37] showing
that the relaxation time of the rotational mode and that of the vibrational mode are quite
different to each other. Therefore, in a case with a high temperature where both rotational and
vibrational modes exist, more than one molecular relaxation process should be taken into account
to have a more realistic RET theory. The purpose of the present paper is to construct such a
realistic RET model of dense gases, and thereby to extend the applicability range of the theory
in the previous papers [31,35,36,38].
