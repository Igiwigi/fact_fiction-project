which is identical with (1), if the zero in that equation is meant to signify the
position which the thermometer would take up if plunged into ice for a considerable
time,

If the observations are made with English glass of recent manufacture, the
identity of equations (1) and (2) does not hold, as the depressions of the zero are
nearly proportional to the squares of the temperatures. It then becomes of import-
ance to define clearly how a temperature is taken, Thus WreseE finds that ther-
mometers made of English glass read Jower than the air thermometer by as much as
0°-047 at 40°, while Rowranp states that all thermometers examined by him,
including those of English manufacture, read higher than the air thermometer. The
two statements are not contradictory ; the discrepancy is explained by the fact that
Wreee refers all temperatures to the zero observed directly after each reading, while
at the time RowLanp’s work was done, this practice, which alone converts the
thermometer into an instrument fit for scientific research, and is now uniformly
adopted, had not yet come into use.

It is an essential point in thermometrie measurements that the work done by ,
different observers should be comparable, and some uniform scale should be adopted.

For the present we cannot do better than use thermometers made either of standard
