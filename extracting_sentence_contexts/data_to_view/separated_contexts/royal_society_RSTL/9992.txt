Tf there are persisting funnels of the mesonephric segmental
tubes in adult Sturgeons, some of them ought to be situated within the genital ducts,
if the latter are not Miillerian ducts ; and naturalists who have the opportunity ought
:Salso to look out for such openings. ,
Z The mode of origin of the anterior part of the genital duct of Lepidosters appears to
Sus to tell strongly in favour of the view, already regarded as probable by one of us,*
'Sthat the Teleostean genital ducts are derived from those of Ganoids ; and if, as appears
Bto us indubitable, the most primitive type of Ganoid genital ducts is found in the
= Chondrostei, it is interesting to notice that the remaining Ganoids present in various
2 ways approximations to the arrangement typically found in Teleostei. Lepidosteus
Zobviously approaches Teleostei in the fact of the ovarian ridge forming part of the
Ewall of the oviduct, but differs from the Teleostei in the fact of the oviduet opening
Z into the kidney ducts, instead of each pair of ducts having an independent opening in
the cloaca, and in the fact that the male genital products are not carried to the
Dexterior by a duct homologous with the oviduct. Amia is closer to the Teleostei in
Þ the arrangement of the posterior part of the genital ducts, in that the two genital
E ducts coalesce posteriorly; while Polypterus approaches still nearer to the Teleostei in
& the fact, that the two genital duets and the two kidney ducts unite with each other

before they join; and in order to convert this arrangement into that characteristic of

the Teleostei we have only to conceive the coalesced ducts of the kidneys acquiring

an independent opening into the cloaca behind the genital opening. The male genital ducts. —The discoyery of the vasa efferentia in Lepidosters, carry-

ing off the semen from the testis, and transporting it to the mesonephros, and thenee
through the mesonephric tubes to the segmental duct, must be regarded as the mos

important of our results on the excretory system. It proves in the first place that the transportation outwards of the genital products

of both sexes by homologous ducts, which has been hitherto held to be universal in
