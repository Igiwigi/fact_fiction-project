The papille are much more distinct in the corium of the pock than in that of the
neighbouring healthy tisue ; they appear broader and longer. The blood-yessels of

the corium are somewhat distended ; in the small veins and capillaries the endothelium
is seen with much greater distinctness than in those of the healthy tisxue. Exspecially
in transverse sections through small veins and capillary blood-vessels it is found that the
endothelial cells are swollen, distinctly granular, and their nuclei enlarged. Accordingly
the wall of these blood-yessels appears thicker and altered. This is in so far an
interesting fact, as Conxnei, by the aid of experiments (see his latest researches on
Inflammation, Berlin, 1873), arrived at the conclusion that the walls of the blood-yessels
must necessarily in inflammation undergo some changes to cause the exudation of the
fluid and the formed parts of the blood, which, as is well known, represent very material
