temperature was much lower and the weather cloudy and dull.

In the two earlier experiments, after two or three days, the under sides of the
leaves were densely covered with large outgrowths which caused the leaves to curl
strongly upwards. In the later experiment, after about ten days, only some of the
leaves had a few outgrowths, some on the upper and some on the lower side (¢/.
pp. 170-172).

But though light and heat are essential, it seems probable that, given the necessary
moisture in the atmosphere, the other two factors may be interdependent, viz., that
in a strong light outgrowths will form at a lower temperature, while in a poor light,
great warmth is required. That a certain minimum of light is required is proved by
the fact that outgrowths never form in darkness. Also, the minimum temperature
> at which assimilation will take place cannot be very low in a tropical plant like
Hibiscus. That direct sunlight of full intensity is not necessary is shown by the
formation of outgrowths under whitewashed glass, or in a warm shaded green-
house ; that it promotes their formation is suggested by their more rapid develop-
ment under the clear glass of a bell-jar.

If the light and temperature are inadequate to promote the necessary assimilation,
the plant becomes starved, and dies without producing any outgrowths, as was the

ease with the plant grown in the cool and dimly lighted Filmy Fern house.*
