(2.) Contrary to what might fairly be expected if so complicated a structure as the
Weberian mechanism is an accessory to heaving, there is absolutely no evidence of the
existence of exceptional powers of hearing either in the Siluridse or any other
Ostariophysem.

(3.) Finally, it nay be stirmed that there is an alternative view of the fonction of
the Weberian ossicles, whieli is in perfect harmony with the facts of structure, and is
open to none of the objections which can be reasonably tirged against Werner's theory,
and also, at the same time, has an important beating on the locomotor activities of
the Fishes concerned. With the reservation which the entire absence of direct experimental evidence
renders absolutely necessary, it may be affirmed that the arguments set forth im the
preceding paragraphs are distinctly adverse to the theory that the Weberian ossicles
are in any way related to the function of andition, even to the subordinate and
qualified extent tacibly suggested by Hasse and Ramsay Waren; and the solution
of this dificult problem must be looked for in some other direction,

Dismissing sound production, equilibration or orientation, respiration and audition
from all physiological connection with the Weberian ossicles, we may now consider
the sola remaining alternative view—that the ossicles are accessory to the hydrostatic

function of the air-bladder. But before dealing with this aspect of the problem it
will be advisable to state what is actually and experimentally known asto the bydro-
static function of the air-bladder in Fishes in general.
