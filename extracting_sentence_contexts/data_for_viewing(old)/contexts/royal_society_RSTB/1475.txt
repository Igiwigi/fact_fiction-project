as a corollary, that the influence of the oxime group is in each case the same, This
influence is that of a nitrite, as it was also found to be in the case of the aromatic
aldoximes. The only discrepancy arises in the actions of acetoxime and of isonitroso-
acetone on voluntary muscle. They both give rise, when present in strong solution,
to the development of some contracture, a phenomenon which cannot be ascribed to
acetone. .

During the course of this research it has been sought to explain the nature of .
muscle contracture, and it has been determined that the phenomenon is probably due |
to direct irritation of the nerve end plates, the irritant in the case of these oximido-—
bodies, being an aldehyde, or, perhaps, more accurately, the COH group.

In support of this contention several facts may be here adduced. . |

It is an active process associated with an increased formation of heat.

The development of contracture is prevented by curare. .

A primary increase of irritability in the nervous path of muscle-nerve preparations
can be traced to the end plates. .

This irritability, better expressed as exalted ‘conductivity of the end plates, |
becomes more marked as the power of the aldehydes to cause contracture increases.

The decline of contracture is synchronous in its onset with the loss of conductivity —
