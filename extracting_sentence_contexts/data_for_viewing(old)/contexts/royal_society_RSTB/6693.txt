Our analysis has up to the moment been concentrated on the sulci around the
occipital pole. When the medial surface is considered in the next section it will
become patent that the problem becomes one of comparison between the amounts
of expansion of whole areas of the brain. In the Chinese brain a well-developed
sulcus lunatus is often found, better, practically always found, with well-expanded
parietal, precuneal, frontal, and temporal regions. In the Australian the primitive
pattern of the sulcus lunatus is accompanied by ill-developed parietal and precuneal
regions. The problem must be deferred until the examination of these interesting
brains is concluded.

THe ASYMMETRY OF THE OccIPITAL REGION

In many of his writings ELtior Srru has called attention to the fact that the sulcus
lunatus is a more prominent feature on the left hemisphere than on the right. The
analysis of the figures for the aboriginal Australian shows that it does not hold for
them. The largest forms have both been found on the right hemisphere and in
the remainder there are approximately the same numbers for the right and left

In the Chinese the figures show that there are slightly more lunate sulci on the
left side ; but on closer analysis it is seen that, when the question of type is con-
