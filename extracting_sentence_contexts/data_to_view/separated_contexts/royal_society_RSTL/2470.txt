When in a till pond the water
nearest the bottom has been cooled below the general temperature by contact with
the solid materials cooled by radiation, it is displaced by the heavier warmer water
above. Hence ice forms first on the surface by the meeting there of both the cold
of radiation and that acquired by contact with the incumbent cold atmosphere. M. Araco's illustrations also furnish us with a satisfactory explanation of the
curious facts, that the ground-gru makes its first appearance in the more rapid and
agitated parts of the stream, and begins to show itself on the bottoms of the stiller
parts, and to accumulate there in quantity, only after a longer continuance of the
clear frosty weather. In the rapids the hydrostatic order is overturned, and the
colder, which is also the lighter, water not only mixed with the warmer below, but,
at the whirls of the greatest rapids, brought suddenly, without much mixing, into
direct contact with the bottom, cooled till lower than itself by radiation. If the
water is at the temperature of 32* Fan.
