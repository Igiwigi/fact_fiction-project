Unfertilised eggs similarly treated do not burst, but merely swell and alter
their appearance. Tn most cases only one antherozoid succeeds in penetrating the egg, but we have
seen, amongst several thousand preparations, three cases of polyspermy (fig. 23) in
which two antherozoids had effected an entrance. This rare occurrence of polyspermy
under the conditions such as are normal for the plants concerned, makes one feel
rather doubtful as regards those cases of polyspermy reported for animals ; not that
the facts are disputed, but as to whether the occurrence in those recorded cases may
not be largely the result of the prevalence of abnormal conditions at the time of
fertilisation. We have never succeeded in obtaining satisfactory evidence to show that unferti-
