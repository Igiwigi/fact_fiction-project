ST IvTRODUCTION. ELHE origin of the tendency among the earlier morphologists to draw a sharp distine-
Zion between stem and leaf may most probably be traced to the fact that vegetable
-Znorphology was firsb pursued as a science in regions where deciduous trees prevail. Seeing the leaves of 80 many plants fall off as a whole, while the scar left was almost
direct continuation of the external gurface of the stem, doubtless gave rise to the
-Fiew that the two should be regarded as radically distinct members. E As the science of morphology progressed it became necessary, if this distinction
Frero to be maintained, to define more clearly how members belonging to these two
Sategories differ one from another.
