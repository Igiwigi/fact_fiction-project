Again, from figure C, we see that the number of lines which do not cut the duad
26, 27 is 10. Each of these ten lines has the same relation to the duad ; take any
one of them, say 5. Such a set of lines as 26, 27, 5 is called a “ triad.”

Again, from figure C, we see that the number of lines which do not cut the triad
26, 27, 5 is 6. Each of these six lines has the same relation to the triad ; take any
one of them, say 2. Such a set of lines as 26, 27, 5, 2, is called a “ tetrad.”

Again, from figure C, we see that the number of lines which do not cut the
tetrad 26, 27, 5, 2, is 83: the lines which do not cut are 9,10,and 13, These three
lines, however, have not all the same relation to the tetrad. The lines 9 and 10 have
cach one common line of intersection with the tetrad: in fact, the line 4 cuts the lines

26, 27, 5, 2, and 9, and the line 3 cuts the lines 26, 27, 5, 2, and 10; whereas both
the lines 8 and 4 cut the lines 26, 27, 5, 2, and 13.

Such a set of lines as 26, 27, 5, 2, 9, is called a “ pentad.”

Again, from figure C, we see that there is but one line 10, which does not cut
the pentad 26, 27, 5, 2, 9.
