27. It is extremely interesting to find that where the top of
the sac in this case is in contact with the lower wall of the one above it, not
only are there no embryo-sac-tubes, but all the nuclei have fused, and the
compartments which under ordinary circumstances would have contained free sexual
nuclei have become uninucleate endosperm-cells. The significance of this receives
emphasis from the fact that a few peripheral compartments of the micropylar region
of this sac (which being more advanced is broader than the upper one) still retain
their free nuclei and some of them are in an early stage of tube-formation (fig. 39,
e.s.t.). In other words, where the micropylar end of the lower sac is subjected to
a vertical pressure, the compartments have become endosperm-cells by the fusion of
their nuclei; where, as at the periphery of this region, there is little resistance
to upward growth, this has occurred, and the nuclei are still free and have
all the characters of the functionally sexual nuclei of a normal sac. This is
regarded as confirming the opinion already expressed (p. 348), that the less crowded
condition of the micropylar nuclei which normally precedes septation (fig.
