Materials..-The germanium used for this work was kindly presented by Professor
Dennis, of Cornell University ; it was described as the purest available, and no indication
of impurity was found during the chemical analyses. Nine grams of metal were set
aside for this research.

Preparation of Alloys._-The alloys were prepared, in the usual way, under charcoal.
The greatest difference between the intended composition of the alloy and that deter-
mined by analysis was 0+23°,, and in 11 out of 15 cast alloys the difference was within
0°1%.

Analysis.—Kor the analyses the alloys were dissolved in nitric acid, the solutien
neutralized with ammonia, made faintly acid with nitric acid, after which the copper
was separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended to
carry down a little germanium, the copper was redissolved and redeposited, then dried
and weighed. The combined filtrates and electrolytes were evaporated and ignited to
constant weight in a weighed silica crucible, Since the oxide, GeOg, is very hygroscopic,

the weighing must be rapid. The oxide was tested for copper, and any traces of this
metal estimated colorimetrically. ‘Twenty-one determinations were carried out, and
the extreme values for the sum of the percentages of copper and germanium were 99-80
and 100-10, whilst in twelve determinations the totals lay between 99-95 and 100-06.
In one alloy the germanium had to be determined by difference owing to an accident in
