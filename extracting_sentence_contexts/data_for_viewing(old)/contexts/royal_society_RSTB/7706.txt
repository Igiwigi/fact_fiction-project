permitting locusts that have taken off to stay warm enough to fly on.

Height of flight. Waloff (19466) and Rainey & Waloff (1948) have produced some direct
and more circumstantial evidence that Desert Locusts reach considerable heights with the
aid of thermal up-currents. On this assumption and in the light of an analysis of the
meteorological data, they were able to work out, â€˜with an impressive degree of plausibility,

how certain long-range swarm movements over the sea could have been brought about.
Swarms are sometimes seen pillaring upwards rather like cumulus clouds, in a way that
suggests the locusts are in fact at the mercy of strong thermal convection. Such convection
requires strong solar radiation to heat the ground, and it would seem to follow that locusts
would be found flying higher, on the average, in sunny than in cloudy weather, and so
higher in the hot dry seasons than in the rainy seasons.

The evidence of such an effect of temperature on the height of flight is so far fragmentary.
Regnier (1931) observed swarms of Schistocerca gregaria rising vertically during the warmest
part of the day, an act which enabled them to cross the Atlas Mountains. Bruzzone (1936),
who claims to have kept a single swarm of S. cancellata Serville (=paranensis Burmeister)
under continuous observation during a whole month, stated that the greater strength of the
sun the higher rose the swarm. A similar impression was formed during the present
studies.
