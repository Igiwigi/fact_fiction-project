But it is maintained by some gentlemen that the same effect may be
produced by a mechanical agent*. They have related sevyeral experiments
which appeared to them to prove, that when after a part of the eighth pair of
nerves is removed, and thus the due secretion of gastric juice prevented, it may
be restored by mechanically irritating the cut ends of the lower portions of
the divided nerves. If such be the fact, it must materially influence our views
both with respect to the function of digestion and the other secreting processes
of the animal body. In judging of the result of such experiments, several things must be taken
into the account which appear to have escaped the attention of those gen-
tlemen. At the time the animal is fed, in preparation for the experiment, there may
be some food in the stomach, from previous meals, more or less digested, and
there is always some gastric juice ready to act on any new food which may be
presented to it.
