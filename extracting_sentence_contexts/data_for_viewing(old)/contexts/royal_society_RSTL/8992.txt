S The circumstance that, in the statement of the results of Experiment 42, both potas-
= sum_ oxide and sulphur are separately included is therefore explained by the above

fact. The larger proportion of the © sulphur ” specified in the several analyses existed
as potassium polysulphide, and may therefore be styled free sulphur, as it did not take
_ part in the chief reactions.

The carbonate, like the suIphate, differed decidedly in amount in the residues
furnished by the R. L. G. powder exploded in the smaller and the larger spaces: in
the former it was equal to the lowest result furnished by the pebble powder; in the
others its proportion was about 10 per cent. higher than in the pebble-residues, excepting
in one of them produced at the highest pressure. In the products obtained by the

explosion of the smallest-grain powder (F. G.) the variations in the proportions of
