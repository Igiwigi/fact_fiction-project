The weighbar method practically eliminates the difficulty as far as the measurement

of the load is concerned. This method was probably first employed by Kennepy*
and has since been used by Datsy, Ropertson, and others. It consists simply of
measuring by means of an extensometer, the elastic extension of a steel bar placed

| in series with the test specimen. The device
i forms, in fact, a spring balance of the greatest
stiffness that it is possible to obtain. It can be
made as sensitive as desired by refinements in
the extensometer, and it can be calibrated
readily by dead load in a testing machine. The
arrangement used by the author is shown dia-
grammatically in fig. 4. The weighbar B and
the test-piece A are held accurately in line by a
connecting nut. The extension of the weighbar
and consequently the load on the specimen is
measured by the angular movement of the mirror
C and any error due to displacement of the
system as a whole is avoided by using a second
