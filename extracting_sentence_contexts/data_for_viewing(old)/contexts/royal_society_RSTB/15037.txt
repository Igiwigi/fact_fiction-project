from colonization and extinction dynamics, but do not expli-
citly consider dispersal. Briscoe et al. [35] found that SDMs
made more reliable spatial predictions, but DOMs provided
superior temporal predictions of occupancy dynamics. Our

results corroborate and generalize these findings, showing
that dynamic population models which explicitly consider
demography and dispersal can provide more accurate predic-
tions of range and population dynamics than other currently
used approaches. Still, SDMs provided better spatial predic-
tions of occupancy and our IBMs improved the temporal
predictions over DOMs only for a few but not all species.
In part, this can be explained by the fact that our IBMs
used fewer predictors and instead imposed structure through
specific assumptions on the causal demographicâ€”ecological
processes. Its predictions are therefore expected to fit less clo-
sely to training data and in turn perform better on
extrapolation. Further, the underlying heuristic habitat
maps were based only on published trait data of main habitat
preferences and may be overestimating the amount of suit-
able habitat. The preferences were given in terms of coarse
habitat classes, such as deciduous or coniferous forest,
while the true habitat preferences may be much more specific
and met in only a smaller subset of the identified habitat
areas. Lower predictive accuracy compared to DOMs could
