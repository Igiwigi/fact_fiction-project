The results of calculations of the deformation ¢ versus time t are presented in figure 8. Note that at a short-term period of time t, the curvature of the experimental dependence of ¢
versus f is negative (figure 2), whereas the calculated one is positive. This disagreement can be
explained by the fact that the simple phenomenological relation (3.21) corresponds only to large
enough time intervals ¢. Analysis of the small time after the sample loading requires the detailed
microscopical study of the internal mechanisms which affect the macroscopical time-dependent
elastic modulus G.
