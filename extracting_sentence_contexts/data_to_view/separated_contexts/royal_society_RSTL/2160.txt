That the center is the moſt healthy part of the city;

that a leſs proportion die annually here than in moſt

country villages; and, as far as obſervations have hitherto
been made, that it is probably as healthy as any ſpot
upon earth, are ſurprizing fa&ts: yet theſe faCts are

diſtricts taken on a medium of ten years. Some conjec-
tures, ſupported by a few facts, are hazarded concerning
the cauſe of unhealthineſs in the ſuburbs. Future ob-
ſervations of a like kind, in different ſituations, will con-
fute or confirm theſe conjectures, which, if true, may
be of great importance to ſociety by diſcovering and
ayoiding the ſource of diſeaſe.
