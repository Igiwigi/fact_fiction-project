The different time-lags show variation of the (a) variance (V) of the distribution
of height changes (false colour scale: 0 < V <2nm) and (b) kurtosis (K) (non-Gaussianity) of the distribution of the height
changes (false colour scale: 2.5 < K < 5.0). Adapted from [73]. (Online version in colour.)

as is the case if phase transitions occur, or as a molecular clock that ticks at the pace of ageing
of collective phenomena. As a matter of fact, some molecular trajectories detected in living
cells, described using the formalism of continuous-time random walk [76], which considers a
continuous distribution of waiting times between trajectory steps, could be due to the diffusion of
the molecules in a glassy state [77]. Future experiments may allow us to observe other properties
of glassy systems, such as ageing, that may lead to the description of the membrane as a glassy
mosaic model.

(iv) Protein self-assembly during fission membrane remodelling

The potential of HS-AFM technology transformed our understanding of protein self-assembly in
membranes. During membrane remodelling, there are—generally speaking—two sorts of events,
fusion and fission, which give rise to topological changes.
