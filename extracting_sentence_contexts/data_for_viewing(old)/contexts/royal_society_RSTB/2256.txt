whether those divisions were of segmental quality, or, like other peripheral nerves,
functional rather than morphological entities.

It is then clear that in the hand, as in the foot of Macacus, the extent of
overlap of the skin-fields of the peripheral nerve-trunks, even on the exquisitely
sensitive plantar and palmar surfaces, is much less than that of the cutaneous areas
of the nerve-roots ; it is, in fact, not so great as may be the overlap of the fields of
nerye-roots three segments distant one from another. If fig. 7, p. 102, be compared as
in fig. 13 with fig. 11, p. 106, it will be seen that in the palm the region of triple
overlap marked in the latter is greater than the medio-ulnar overlap in the former ;
and similarly in the fingers, if we set aside the communication between ulnar and
median in the forearm, which is of only exceptional occurrence in Man. It is also
notable that the region of triple overlap, which is the central region of double over-
lap, strikes a line on the palm which leads to and includes the medius digit, whereas
the peripheral nerve-trunk overlap strikes a line leading to and taking in part of a
different digit, namely, the annulus. This, again, points to there being no real
correspondence between the two systems of overlap.

The answer arrived at to the question set is therefore that where examined an
