The available evidence, therefore, points to the origin of the
oil in outgrowths as a product of degeneration, and to the importance in this process
of diminished respiration.*

The succession of events may be stated briefly as follows: carbohydrates form
organic acids, organic acids cause turgescence, turgescence gives rise to hypertrophy
of the cells, so that an intumescence is formed. Three more questions may be considered in relation to assimilation, namely,
(1) the age of leaves forming intumescences, (2) the effect of wdlwmination, and (3) of
temperature.

(1) As before stated, intumescences form most readily in young but mature leaves,
not only because in such leaves the powers of assimilation are greater than in
developing or degenerating leaves, but also because old tissues lose their irritability,
and therefore their capability of response to stimuli. There are, however, some
exceptions to this rule, as, for example, in Vitis and Solanum in my own experi-
ments, in the Pelargonium brought to the laboratory in November, in the case of the
vine observed by SoravER,t and of the pinks described by Priumux.}

SorAvER, in fact, regards the formation of intumescences as a sign of depressed
vitality, and therefore of reduced powers of assimilation, and PRILLIEUX is inclined to
agree with him. The case of the pinks cited by Prim.ieux is peculiar because the disease
appeared in plants in the open, towards the end of summer, in August and
September. The author gives no figures and does not say whether the disease
appeared in wet or dry weather, though he notes that the plants had been freely
watered.
