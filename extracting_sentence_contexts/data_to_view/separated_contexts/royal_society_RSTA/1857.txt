Broadly, hypothesis or supposition’. This is the sense in which Scalia and the proponents of
creation science use the word. To Scalia and others, evolution always carries the epithet of ‘just
a theory’, meaning that it is mere speculation rather than fact. I am reminded of the way Homer
always referred to Greek gods, heroes and peoples with an epithet, such as the grey-eyed Athena
or the horse-taming Trojans. Evolution’s epithet is ‘just a theory’.
