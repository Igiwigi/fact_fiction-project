Moreover, : =
there is a region with complex dynamics and additional saddle-node and torus bifurcation curves :2

that entered the frame at large values of c above 7 = 1. These are caused by the state dependence
— large c values mean large amplitude, which leads to larger fluctuations of the delay time t,. In
fact, the scaling relationship between c and 1, as a result of equation (2.6) implies that these curves
will diverge off to c—> 00 as n- — 0; similarly, they move closer to the other bifurcation curves
as nc increases. The existence of non-trivial dynamics for large values of c is in stark contrast
to the dynamics in the constant-delay case, where solutions for sufficiently large c are trivially
dominated by the periodic forcing. Figure 4b, now for nc = 0.22, shows a considerably more complicated bifurcation set compared
with figure 4a.
