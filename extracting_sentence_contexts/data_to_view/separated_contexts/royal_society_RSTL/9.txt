I; Tra#s, confiting of po porter about th: SALTNESS of the
SEA: An Account of a Statical HIGROSCOPE and its Uſer;
together with an Appendix about the FORCE of the AIR'S
MOISTURE : And a Fragment about the NATURAL and
PRETERNATURAL STATE of BODIES : By the Honorable
R.Boyle, To all which is premiſed, 4 Sceptical Dialogue about
the POSITIVE or PRIVATIVE NATURE of COLD: By a
Member of the R. Society. London, 1673. in 89,

He Dialogue about Cold preſenting is ſelf firſt in theBody

of this Book, though it be named laſt in the Title-

page, we ſhall firſt of all take notice of the ſame in the Ac-
count we intend togive of theſe TraQs,

One of theſe Dialogiſts therefore having taken occaſion
from Mr, Boyle's Hiſtory of Cold to exprefs his wonder, that
that Noble and latelligent Author had in that Hiſtory omit-
ted to tell the Learned world, whether he aflerts Cold to be
a Poſitive quality, or a bare Privation of Heat ; and another
of them having conjeur'dithe principal reaſon of that ſilence
to be that Author's unwillingneſs to. deliver io abſtruſe ſub-
jets a poſitive opinion before a compleat Hiſtory of the Phe-
nomena be deliver'd; it being much ſafer to reſerve that for
the latter end, when the Nature of the thiog inquired into
may of it ſelf reſult from the Conſiderations, ſuggelted by the

recedent matters of fact ſurveyed aud compared together :
heſe two, 1 ſay, having thus made an Introduftion to this
Diſcourſe, the Author of it maketh it his buſineſs to examine
all the weighty Arguments, alledged by Gaſendus, ſeeming
ſtrongly to maintain the Poſtzve vature of Cold z but yet, in
ftrift ratiocipation found to be not cogent, Where the Author,
among other particulars,ſhews,that thoſe Bodies muſt be Cold
as to ſenſe, whoſe parts are leſs agitated thao thoſe of our
Hands,and conſequently Metals,Stone, Wood,and other Solid
bodies, as alſo all unmingled Liquors we know, being hea-
ted by the fire, will grow cold again of themſelves, becauſe

receſs of the igneous corpuſcles, or the imparting of the ex:
tratieous agitation to the Air or other contiguous bodies, the
Stone or Water,8&c, will again have ſo much fainter an agita-
tion, than that of a man's Senſory , as to be by him judged
Cold, And if this already impaired agitation be ſtill more
and more leſſen'd, the Body will (till grow colder and cold-
er without the help of any Poſitive cauſe ; till at length the
apil parts, that keptit warm or fluid, bciog quite expelled
or diſabled, the form of the liquor, for example, comes to be
exchanged for that of Ice,

Several conſiderable Experiments of Mr,Boy!e7 being in this
Diſcourſe occaſionally refer'd to, one of the Interlocators
mentions not only the particular ſcruples, but alſo divers phe-
omena of Experiments, that kept the ſame Gentleman from
declaring himſelf about the Niture and Cauſe of Cold,

Tothis Dialogue are annexed three ſmall pieces by Mr,
Boyle ;

The firſt contains two Problems about Cold; grounded on
New Experiments; whereof one is, How upon the mixture of
two or three Bodies there ſhould manifeſtly enſue a great and th»
multuary agitation of ſmall parts, and yet even during this con-

flift, not any ſenſible Heat,but a conſiderable degree of Coldbe pro.
duced, and that even in the Internal parts of the mixture 2 The
other is, hence the vaſt force of freezing water proceeds 2
Theſecond, delivers an Attempt to manifeſt and meaſure the
greatExpanſive force of Freezing water,by threeExperiments,
The th:rd,recites a NewExperimenr about the Produdion of
Cold by theConflict of bodies appearing to make anEbullition,
From theſe Particulars this Book proceeds to another Tra®,
containing 0bſervations and Experiments about the Saltneſs
of the Sea.

[2 itthe Author, not being ſatisfied with the opinion of the
Peripateticks, who derive the Saltneſs of the Sea from the Adu-
ſtion of the water by theSun-beams,and having abſwered the
arguments alledged for that opinion (where, upon oceafion,

| many conſiderable Obſervations and Experiments do occur,)

be ſupplied not oply from Rocks and other Maſſes of Salt

from.Subterraneal Steams and from the Salt, which the rains,
rivers and other waters diſſolye in their paſſage through di-
vers parts of the Earth, and ſo carry aloog with them.inco the

Joined to the $3ltneſs of the Sea-water thentakes notice not;
only of the differing Colors and other Qualities of the diffe-
riog parts pj Sea, arguing, that 'tis not every where of an
Uniform ſubſtance.z but alſo of the Sea-waters capableneſsof
PurefaQion : To all which he ſubjoins divers Obſervations
about the various Degrees of the Saltneſs of the Sea, and what
himſclf obſerved and tried conceroing the Saltneſs of our Sea
and the Gravity of the Sea-water between England and France;
concluding this whole Diſcourſe with two ſuſpicionsz the
one, that,at leaſt, in many places, the Saltneſs of the Sea may
continually though but (lowly, increaſe not only by the accel(-
fion of that Saline matter;that is imported by Salr-ſprings, and
that which Rivers and Land floods do rob the Earth of; but
alſo by the Saline (teams plentifully aſcendipg into the Sea
from Subterraneal Fires : the other,that Sea-water may be ren-
der'd much more ſalt to the taſte by volatil Salts, and yet be
very little heavier,

Upon this argument follows aSe@jor,that ſhould have been |
ſubjoined tothe Relation about the Bottom of the Sea, formerly
prioted,but was not then ſeaſonably deliver'd to the Printer ;
And therein is contained an Inquiry about theVegetation and
Growth of Plants in ſub-marine Regions z where occur ſome
Oberyations, made chiefly of that Stony, plant, Corall, as alſo a
ſort of Laurel-trees growing about 1/anar at the bottom ofthe
Sea, and the famous 2/a/divia Nut, born by a fort of Coco-
treesthat grow ſo likewiſe, and are thence either torn off by
the agitation of the water,or gather'd by the Divers. Atter this follows a Paradex of the Natural and Preternatural
State of Bodies,eſpecially of the Air.
