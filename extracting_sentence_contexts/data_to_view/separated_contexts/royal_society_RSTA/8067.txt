As a result of his experiments, Kenvin found that :—

(1) In any series of experiments, with the same torsional pendulum, for small
amplitudes of vibration, the logarithmic decrement of the amplitude per vibration was
constant.

(2) In similar experiments, but with different vibrators, the logarithmic decrement
was not quite that expected according to SroxEs’s viscosity law, which predicts that
the logarithmic decrement per vibration would be inversely proportional to the period
of vibration. The logarithmic decrement was found to be greater for the longer periods
than according to this law. Ketvin also found certain fatigue effects in wires that were kept vibrating con-
tinuously, but some doubt was thrown on the value of his experimental results by
THompson.§ Maintaining the vibrations by an electrical device when investigating
fatigue effects, he found that neither the logarithmic decrement nor period of vibration
depended on the previous elastic history of the wire; and suggested that the wires
must have been excessively twisted in Ketvin’s experiments—a reasonable suggestion
in view of the fact that some of KeLvin’s experiments were performed by students. On the assumption that the action between two particles is only transmitted at a
