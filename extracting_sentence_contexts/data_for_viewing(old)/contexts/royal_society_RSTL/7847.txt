'The complete intersection with the cubic surface is made up of the lines (Y=0, X=0),
(Y=0, Z=0), (Y=0, W=0) (the axes) each twice, and of a sextic curye which is the
spinode curve; o'=6.

The spinode curye is a complete intersection 2X 3; the equations may in fact be

written
Y*+Y? (X+Z+W)+4aXZW =0,
3Y?+4Y(X+2+W)+4(XZ+XW+Z2W)=0;
the nodes D, C, A are nodes (double points) of the curye, the tangents at each node
being the nodal rays.

Each of the transversals is a single tangent of the spinode curve; in fact for the
transversal YZ +X=0, W=0, these equations of course satisfy the equation of the
cubic surface ; and substituting in the equation of the Hessian, we have Y(X—ZY=0.
But Y+Z+X=0, W=0, Y=0 is a point on the axis W=0, Y=0, not belonging to
the spinode curve; we have only the point of contact YE+X+Z=0, W=0, X—Z=0.
Hence B'=3.

Reciprocal Surface.
