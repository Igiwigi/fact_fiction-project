four equations just mentioned are identical with those obtained by the method of the
variation of parameters for determining the eccentricities and longitudes of the
apses. It is worthy of remark, that in both methods the changes of the eccentricities
and of the longitudes of the apses which are due to the disturbances; are taken into
account in calculating the changes themselyes, so that the approximation does in

fact extend beyond the first power of the disturbing force, s0 far as it relates to these
two elements.

If the approximation be made to include generally the 8quare of the disturbing
force, and the values of 7 and 0 in art. 16, and the like values of r' and 0, be nsed
for that purpose, terms may arise containing coefficients which bave 2 for a factor.
'These terms may be converted into periodic functions of the time by the application
of the principles exhibited above, but in that case the differential equations by which
E, E', IT and IT are found will be of the second order, and the periodic functions
will be more completely determined.

"The inferences (1), (2), (3) and (4) respecting the secular variations of the elements,
