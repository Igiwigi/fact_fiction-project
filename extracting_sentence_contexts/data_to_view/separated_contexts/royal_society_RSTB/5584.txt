RAISTRICK ON

Summary. The biochemical characteristics are described of two species of Penicillium responsible
for the rot of citrus fruits, viz., P. digitatum Saccarvo (P. olivacewm Weumer) and
P. italicum WeEMER. P. digitatum Saccarpo is unique amongst species in our collection in the fact that
it produces from glucose considerable amounts of ethyl acetate. In addition it also
produces ethyl alcohol and a new polysaccharide which gives rise to glucose on
hydrolysis. P. italicum Wexmer produces from glucose a new metabolic product which is
characterized by its colour reactions with ferric chloride and bleaching powder.
