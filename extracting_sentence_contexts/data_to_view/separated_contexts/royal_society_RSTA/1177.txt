This ring-pattern formation was maybe a consequence of a
heterogeneous thermalization along the nanometric patch and cooling progressed from the edges
that exposed the largest surface to the cooling bulk. It could also be a consequence that the
bending and edge formation of the lipids at the patch border represented favourable nucleation
spots for ripple phase reformation, or both. In fact, throughout cycles of heating/cooling, the
ripple phase pattern changed every time, suggesting that the thermal history of the bilayer
was erased in the fluid phase. Based on the vanâ€™t Hoff expression, the representation of area
fraction of each phase as a function of the temperature provides estimations about the transition

enthalpy and the cooperativity of the lipid molecules during the process. The cooperativity of 8
each process also accounts for the order of the transition, more cooperative processes relate to : =
first-order transitions, where the latent heat is required to change the phase, while in second- : =
order transitions heat is also necessary for changing the temperature.
