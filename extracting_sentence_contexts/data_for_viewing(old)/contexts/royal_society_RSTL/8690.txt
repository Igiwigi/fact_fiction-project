4. Let us now consider the prepotential of the remaining portion of the surface ;
every part thereof is at a distance from P exceeding, in fact far exceeding, R; 80 that,
imagining the whole mass ſe dS to be collected at the distance R, the prepotential of
the remaining portion of the surface is less than

viz. we have thus, in the case where the mass ſz as is finite, a superior limit to the
prepotential of the remaining portion of the surface. This will be indefinitely small in
comparison with the prepotential of the disk, provided only #* is indefinitely small

compared with R***, that is # indefinitely small in comparison with R'**s. The proof
assumes that the mass ſg dS is finite; but considering the yery rough manner in which
