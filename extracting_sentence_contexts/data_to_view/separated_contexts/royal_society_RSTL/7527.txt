We have thus a sextic surface, and two quadric surfaces ;
the sextic is a developable surtace or torse, having for one of its generating lines the
line a=0, þ=0, and for the tangent plane along this line the plane a=0; the two
quadric surfaces meet in a quartic curve passing through the two points (4=0, b=0,
3ce—24*=0), which are points on the torse; it is to be 8hown that each of these points

count three times among the intersections of the torse with the quartic curve, the
number of the remaining intersections being therefore 24—6, =18; and in order thereto
it is to be shown that each of the points in question (a=0, b=0, 3ce—20*=0) is situate
on the nodal line of the torse, and that the quartic curve touches there the sheet which
is not touched by the tangent plane a=0; for this being s0 the quartic curve touching
one sheet and simply meeting the other sheet meets the torse in three consecutive points,
or the two points of intersection each count three times. The torse has the cuspidal line

S=ae—40d+3af=0, T=ace+2bed—ad—be—&=0,
and the nodal line

and the equations'of the nodal line are satisfied by the values (4=0, b=0, 3ce—24*=0)
of the coordinates of the points in question. To find the tangent planes at these points,
starting from the equation S$*—27'T*=0 of the torse, taking (A, B, C, D, E) as current

coordinates, and writing
d=Ad,+Bd,+Cd.,+Dd,+Ed.,

then the equation of the tangent plane is in the first instance given in the form
$9S—18ToT=0, which writing therein (4=0, b=0, 3c&—20d*=0) asxumes, as it
should do, the form 0=0; the left-hand side is in fact found to be 9&(3ce—24?)A. Proceeding to the second derived equation, this is $9*%S+28(dS)*—18'Td*T—18(dT)*=0,
or substituting the values of the several terms, the equation is
9(AE—4BD+3C?)
+ 3e@(eA—4dB+6cC)
+18{e(AC—B?)+24(BC—AD)+c(AE+2BD—3C®)}
— 9 {(ce—@P)A+20d4B—3f0}*=0 ;
the terms in BC, BD, C* yanish identically, that in B?* is (48—36=)120%d*—18c%,=
—6@(3ce—24?)B?, which also vanishes; hence there remain only the terms divisible by A,
giving first the tangent plane A=0, and secondly the other tangent plane,

the equations of the tangent planes are L

e( ” )+o( » J+*( ” )=0,
in all which equations we have 3ce—2d*=0 ; and if to satisfy this equation we write
e:d:e=2: 3B: 3, then the equations of the tangent planes become
P(AB—8B)+8(308'—4D8+2B)=0,
2(30B*—4D8+2B)+(oP+r)(AB—8B)=0,
e( ” )+(sÞ—7( » )=0,
or the three tangent planes intersect in the line AB—8B=0, 30F—4DB+2E=0,
which completes the proof. Reverting to the sextic locus,
