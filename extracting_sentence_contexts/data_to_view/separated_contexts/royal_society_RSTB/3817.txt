It is not possible to place a contact upon the node itself, this structure being
buried. Nevertheless, if the node received the excitation wave by some special path
and this wave spread immediately to the surrounding auricular muscle, as Eystrr and
MEEK (3) suppose, then we should anticipate an early appearance of the wave in the
region from which we lead. As a matter of fact we fail to find it. But this negative
answer does not entirely preclude a quick line of conduction, for it is conceivable that
there may be no spread to auricle from A-V node but only spread to ventricle once
the excitation wave has reached the node. Having this in mind, we have used an
entirely different method of estimating the transmission interval between the two
nodes.
