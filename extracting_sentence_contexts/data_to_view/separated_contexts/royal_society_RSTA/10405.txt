Thus, in the case which we are now considering, a vibration of frequency p = 0
is equivalent to a configuration of limiting equilibrium. It is not hard to see that
this results from the fact that the particles of which the nebula is composed are
physically indistinguishable. This very fact, however, introduces a further complica-
tion into the question. It will be noticed that, although the value of € has been
found at every point of the nebula, it is impossible to determine the separate values
of Aand B. On the other hand, the physical vibration must have’ a definite limiting
form when p= 0.
