reduced to small dimensions if care be taken that the full air stream is not turned on
before the apparatus has come to the bath temperature; on the other hand, we found
that taking the apparatus out of the bath without any preliminary treatment*
caused a large error owing to the fact that the connecting tubes (and other air
spaces) cooled more rapidly than the liquids, and so acted as condensers on which
moisture was deposited ; this trouble was eventually overcome by running cold water
into the bottom of the bath (so as to displace the hot water) until it just reached the
level of the vessels. In this manner the liquids were caused to cool earlier than the
connecting tubes.

Another Possible Source of Error is that Due to Diffusion—A small amount of
diffusion of water vapour from the solvent to the sulphuric acid takes place during
the time the apparatus is being set up and taken down; the total time taken for
these operations is roughly about four hours, and calculation shows that at 12° C.
not more than 0°0002 gr. of water would come over.
