Although, therefore, increasing brittleness, no doubt, has an important effect in
tending to prevent any further increase in tenacity after the temperature of liquid air
is reached, this is not an entirely satisfactory explanation, which remains to be sought.

Owing to this failure of liquid hydrogen temperature to further increase in general
the tenacity, especially high tenacity figures are not a feature of the results. Only one,

namely, 146-4 tons per square inch for 3671 steel (0-°35% C, 0-18% Si, 0°56% Mn,
071% Cr, 334% Ni), is, in fact, worthy of special mention, as approaching the high
figure of 157-2 tons per square inch recorded for the steel “ K” (0-41% ©, 0° 13% Si,
0-96 Mn, 19-91%, Ni), in the Report of the Alloys Research Committee (loc. cit.), in
a test in liquid air.

Effects on Hardness.—In only one specimen, namely 1449A with 31-4% nickel
associated with 0-70% carbon, is the hardness appreciably and permanently increased,
and this result was to be anticipated in view of the knowledge that this steel is
already capable of being transformed in liquid air, and other low temperatures much
higher than that of liquid hydrogen. Thus, among the materials tested there is no
new and surprising discovery of critical points at temperatures below that of liquid
air. Except for the one material mentioned, therefore, it would appear that the
