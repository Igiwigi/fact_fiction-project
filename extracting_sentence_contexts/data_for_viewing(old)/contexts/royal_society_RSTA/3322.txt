be a consequence of the fact that only one CESA subunit is being used and may not reflect the
situation in vivo where three different CESA isoforms that may form heterotrimers are being co-
expressed (figure 3a). The same criticism also applies to the study on OsCESA8Cat, which appears
to associate to form a dimer [35]. This would suggest that there is sufficient uncertainty and
contradictory data that, by itself, this work does not provide an unambiguous answer regarding
CESA organization. It is likely that these issues will only be resolved with the availability of
higher-resolution structures of either a complete CESA protein or the entire CSC.

microscopy

The large size of the CSC should make it directly visible using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). However, to date, there are no such reports despite the fact that these complexes are
concentrated in the plasma membrane at sites marked by cortical microtubules. Despite using a
wide variety of different methodologies, including high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution,

hetero (left-hand side) or homo (right-hand side) trimers of CESA proteins. (b) Freeze fracture TEM of the plasma membrane
showing the CSC as six-lobed rosette. A large number of images taken suggest that the lobe might represent a unit of the CSC
and, at various stages, the lobes may be displaced from the hexameric rosette to varying extent. The image is reproduced from
