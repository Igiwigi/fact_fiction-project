last occurrence, changes in relative abundance and community composition,
and morphological changes. In particular, these studies demonstrate the
marked non-randomness of fossil occurrences as a result of the processes that
govern sedimentation and their effects on the resulting sedimentary record,
known as stratigraphic architecture. These studies have led to probabilistic
models of fossil occurrence that reflect the underlying controls on the fossil
record in local sections [10], and they improve upon ones that assume uniform
preservation. These models show, for example, that the difference in age
between when a species first appears locally in the fossil record and when it
first appeared in the region can often be up to a million years or more [11].
Similarly, the stratigraphic record can cause the last occurrences of species to
be clustered at particular layers in a pattern that might lead one to interpret
it as a mass extinction, when in fact that clustering is controlled by processes
of sedimentation [12]. These modelling studies and numerous field studies
