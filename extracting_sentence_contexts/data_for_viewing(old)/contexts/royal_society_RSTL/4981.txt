asci, immense numbers of the bodies drawn in fig. 23, Plate XXVI. These
ies are shaped like the spores in the genus Cryptosporium, and if the perithecia pro-
ducing them, had existed singly, or if a number of perithecia in one group had pro-
duced nothing but similar bodies, the plant would have had to be classed with the
Cryptosporia and not with the Sphzriz. But in the specimens upon which my observa-
tions were made, the same stroma produced contiguous perithecia, of which some Pro-
duced the regular asci and sporidia, others the Cryptosporium fructification. 'The origin
of the latter is, I think, sufficiently obvious : it seems to arise from an arrest of growth
taking place in the asci, by which not only do the latter not acquire their usual size.
but the endochrome, instead of breaking up into separate portions and forming sporidia,
Amains united in one mass which is uniformly distributed through the ascus. The real
Aature of these bodies must depend upon whether they possess the power of germina-
Son, a fact which I have not yet ascertained. If they have s8uch power, they would

m2. Spheria lanciformis, FR., and Hendersonia polycystis, B. & Br.—There is, as 1
Fre stated above, a prevalent opinion amongst mycologists, to the effect that certain
Eungi, including those of the genus endersonia, are only Spherie in an imperfect con-
tion. The species just mentioned (Zendersonia polycystis) was first described by
— BgrKELEY and BROOME in their notices of Britich Fungi in the * Annals of
atural History,' and it may be found figured, though under a different name (Myzo-
gelus confluens), by FRESENIUS in his © Beitrige zur Mykologie.” It is remarkable for
Ae beauty of its spores, which are club-shaped, multicellular, and of a deep olive-
Town colour, with the exception of the pedicel-cell, which is hyaline and colourless :
