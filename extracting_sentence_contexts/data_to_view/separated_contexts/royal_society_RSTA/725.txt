Figure 12 shows the sensitivity of convergence rate of C3t0 to m, i.e. the amount of retained
correction pairs used in the update for the Hessian approximation in the L-BFGS-B algorithm. It
can be seen from Figure 12 that m = 3 converges more slowly than m = 5,7 or 9. The fact that using
more Hessian correction pairs, i.e. 1 =9 over m=7, does not always lead to an improvement in
convergence rate can be attributed to the irrelevance of gradient information from many iterations
earlier. In the remainder of this work, we choose m = 5, as this proved to be an adequate parameter
