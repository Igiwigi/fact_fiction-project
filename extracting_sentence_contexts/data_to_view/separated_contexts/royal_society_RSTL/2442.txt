Read May 12, 1825. As the principles on which phenomena depend can only
be discovered by a careful investigation of the circumstances
attending every new fact which presents itself, its import-
ance must not; in the first instance, be estimated by the
magnitude of the effects produced; but by their peculiarity. However minute may be the effects, an inquiry into the laws
which govern them, if unattended by any other, will have
this advantage, that these laws will serve as an additional
test of the correctness of the principles advanced for the ex-
planation of the more striking phenomena, firmly establish-
ing their truth, if the consequences of those principles, or
being incompatible with them, pointing out their fallacy. Thus the severest test that the principle of gravitation has
been subjected to, is the explanation of the minute irregula-
rities in the planetary motions ; and the coincidence of the
observed irregularities with those deduced from the applica-
tion of this principle would have established its truth beyond
dispute, had any doubt previously remaitied.
