Ta Jit,
Using a Taylor series approximation for the ratio Po /Pr, the variance thereof can be expressed in
terms of statistical quantities of its numerator and denominator (e.g. [32]) as

var (72) ~ E(Po)? see _ ycov(Po, Pr) + ee (C3)

Pr)  E(Pr)* | E(Po)? ~— E(Pr)E(Po)~—-E(Pr)?

where var, cov and E denote the variance, covariance and expected values respectively. Since P= (oN, PIA)/N, the variances in equation (C3) can be written as var(P) = var(P™)/N. Furthermore, combining properties of the covariance operator with the fact that mean powers in
different optimization windows can be assumed to be statistically independent, the covariance in
equation (C3) can be rewritten as

(ox Po) oe 1? Pei)

cov(Po, Pr) = cov N N (C4)

Finally, since E(P) =P, equation (C3) can be readily evaluated in terms of quantities that can
either be directly obtained from total time-averaged powers Po and Pk, or calculated from the
distribution of window-averaged powers PY and Pi as

leading to a standard deviation o = (var(Po/P))!/2. Note that, even though Po and Pp are
normally distributed, the ratio between them is not.
