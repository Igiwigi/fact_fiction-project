The agreement between the torsion and cylinder tests will be seen to be very close.
The flexure tests give only slightly lower values, and the impression is very strong that

shear stress is, in fact, the determining factor in failure. Itremains, however, to consider
why the above ratios are greater than unity, in other words why the shear stress at
failure should be greater when the stress distribution is not uniform.

It has already been stated, in the introduction, that the idea of reinforcement by
understressed material is not convincing, as it involves an action, prior to elastic break-
down, inconsistent with the theory of elasticity. The results rather suggest the
possibility that the initial dislocation resulting in elastic breakdown takes place within
the body of the material in preference to the surface ; that, whilst having the same
elastic properties, in other words offering the same resistance to elastic deformation,
the surface material may possess a greater resistance to the dislocation by virtue of
its being at the surface, as distinct from any mechanical or heat treatment it may receive.
Tt is important to notice that such a property, if it existed, would not be revealed by
