It is interesting to study the differences exhibited by these curyes B, C, and D. The
Curve C, representing the pressures obtained with R. L. G., denotes tensions not far
removed from the theoretic curve, while the densities are till yery high; before the
volume is much increased, the two curves slide into one another and become almost
coincident.

'The Curve D, on the other hand, is at first very considerably below both the R. L. G.
and the theoretic curve. It is still considerably lower eyen when the R. L. G. curye is
practically coincident with the theoretic curve, and it retains a measurable though slight
inferiority of pressure even up to the muzzle of the gun.

These differences are without doubt due to the fact that with the R. L. G. powder,
at least under ordinary circumstances, the whole or a large proportion of the charge
is consumed before the projectile is greatly removed from the seat of the shot. With
the slower-burning pebble powder, on the other hand, a considerable quantity of powder
remains unconsumed until the projectile approaches the muzzle; and the curve indicates
in a very striking way the gradual consumption of the powder, and the portion of the
bore in which the slow-burning powder may be considered practically burned.

It might perhaps be expected that the difference between the theoretic Curve B and
the observed Curyes C and D near the muzzle would be greater than is shown, since the
Curve B has been obtained on the supposition that the expansion has taken place in a
vesse] impervious to heat.
