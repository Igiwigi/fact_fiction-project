Now the: coeflicient of
the highest power, of @ in both-[q, q4...q,] and in [q; q4..-9,-1] is positive, but-as to
[quer-++qu] and [quza:+-q,] is of contrary signs in the! two, viz. negative in that one
of those cumulants which contains an odd, and positive in that one of the two which
contains an} even number of 'elements. Hence by virtue of Lemma B, L and any
quantity greater than L substituted for » will make [q; q2.-.q,| to have always the
same 8ign, and in like manner-it may be shown' that A and any quantity less than A
substituted-for z will also canse [q1qz...q,] to retain always the! same-sign.. Hence

from the fact of the leading coefficients in ;_ and þ;41 heap according to the powers of” tid the
same 8ign, it follows that when #=o, þ;-; and ;41 bave the same sign, but they have contrary signs
when 2=k ; but ;-1 does ndt change its sign between z=0 and z=k, hence ;+, does change its sign be-
tween z== and z=k,, and therefore a root of V;+ lies between « and k,; in like manner precisely it may
be shown that a root of þ;+1 lies between — and k;; and since þ;-z changes its 8ign between k, and k,,
between k, and k,....k, and between 5; and ki, 4,41 must likewise change its 8ign between one and the other
extremity of each of these intervals, and hence the roots 7, 1,.... {41 are intercalated between 92, k;, ky,.....k;,
—®=, or which is the same thing, k,, k,,....k; are respectively intercalated between 7, 7,,...l;41 ; consequently,
if the theorem is true up to 4, it is true for i+1, and therefore true universally ; but is manifestly true when

theorem contained in Lemma A.

The greatest and least, roots of [q, q2---4,] X [qu+1-+-4qz| evidently satisfy the-con-
dition to which L and A are subject, and may. be taken in place of L and A
respectively. They will accordingly be superior and inferior limits to the cumulant

Again, by virtue of theorem (B.) it may readily be shown that

but so that this sign changes in passing from one series to another, it is easily seen,
by the same reasoning as in the preceding case,. that the two positiye and two nega-
tive products on the right-hand side of the equation all give the same sign to the co-
efficient of the highest power of x, and consequently that if L and A be superior and
inferior limits to

and consequently by Lemma A, to
Lor A substituted for x will canse [q, qa.-:q,] to retain always the same sign, and
will consequently be superior and inferior limits thereto,; and 80, in general; whence
it follows, returning to the theorem to be. demonstrated,, that the greatest and least
