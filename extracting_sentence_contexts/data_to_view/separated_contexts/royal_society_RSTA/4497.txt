The calculated date of this new work is eighteen years after the coming of
the Hellenes. From the star Â« Arietis being thus connected with the orientation,
it may be inferred that these two temples were dedicated to Jupiter. The fact that
the achievements of Hercules had formed the subject of the metopes of the earlier
temple by no means invalidates the supposition that the temple itself may have been
so dedicated. The temple A falls well in the Hellenic period, and the architectural
character, both of this and of temple D, appears to be in keeping with the astronomic
dates. Temple B is extremely small, and is apparently parallel to the neighbouring
temple C, but I did not examine it particularly.
