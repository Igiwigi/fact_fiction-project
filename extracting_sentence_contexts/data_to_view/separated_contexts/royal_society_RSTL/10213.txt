The ovaries of polyps which had
recently spawned were usnally found to contain considerable quantities of immature
eggs. Hence it 8eems probable that there may be several 8uccessive broods of egg
in a single year, 8ince the spawning season extends over two or three months. It is a rather eurious fact that the eggs are always laid at very nearly the 8ame
hour of the day, viz., about 6 A.M. Large numbers of Renillas were kept in aquaria,
and the act of spawning was several times observed. In a single case only the
spawning took place as early as half-past five and it was never observed to occur later
than 7 A.M. This regularity appears to be independent of temperature, although this
has a very important influence on the rate of development ; for the hour was the same

Sm cold and warm days, Tt is not unlikely that marine animals are more regular in
Bnch habits than has been suspected.
