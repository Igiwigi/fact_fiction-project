assume that the extra field is the dark matter or dark energy. Both can be (in principle) coupled
to matter. For dark matter, the description in terms of a background field is valid for bosonic
candidates of masses m < 1 eV (e.g. [33]). For dark energy, a description in terms of field variables
is applied to many models beyond the cosmological constant [34]. In both cases, the background
field may be time- and space-dependent, which means that new ideas to test their coupling to
matter and antimatter (if the matter effects cancel) may be possible.

Other fields beyond those of the cosmological model may have (xj) #0 even in the vacuum. In
other words, one can consider that Lorentz invariance is broken spontaneously.® This possibility
opens new directions for antimatter—-matter interactions.

In both cases, the couplings that I mentioned in the previous section will now modify the
kinematics of (anti)particles. In fact, one does not require a mediator to generate an effect, and one =

This term modifies the inertial mass of particles and antiparticles in opposite directions. As before, |
one can try to cancel the effects on matter fields, and it seems to me that most of the caveats of :
