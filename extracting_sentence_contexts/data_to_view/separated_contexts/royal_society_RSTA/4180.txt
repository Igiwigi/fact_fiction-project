Furthermore, we are aware that brain— :=
heart dynamics might be further mediated by psychological factors like mood, anxiety or
personality traits that we did not take into account in this study. Future works should account
for all these aspects in order to achieve a more detailed and precise brain-heart model, also nee)
accounting for the evaluation of brain-heart coupling directionality, as well as for the brain— :
brain, and ANS-ANS interactions [65]. MIC, in fact, is unable to assess how much the past a]
samples in one series affect its future values or the future of the other time series (like in DNS
Granger causality measures). However, is important to point out that these issues has a limited area
impact on our results. We were interested in assessing the coupling between EEG oscillations and [5
heartbeat dynamics, tracking their changes despite external elicitation.
