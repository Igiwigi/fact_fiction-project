does not involve the probable error of other ratios, would be cateris paribus more
exact. Again, the closing of the chain between hydrogen and chlorine with
reasonable accuracy would permit the accidental errors to be distributed and prevent
their accumulation at the unconnected end. The accumulated “probable error” in
CriarKr’s recalculated value for chlorine is +'0048 ; the “ probable error” of our nine
experiments is +°0019.

The suggestion to carry out this work was made to us by Professor Epwarp W.
Mortey, who happened to visit our laboratories when pure chlorine was being
prepared by the electrolysis of fused silver chloride. He suggested that we should
burn weighed hydrogen and chlorine in a closed vessel, just as he had burnt weighed
hydrogen and oxygen. After some discussion we decided to make the attempt—an
attempt which was rendered possible by the fact that one of us was enabled, by a
research scholarship, to devote his whole time to the investigation,

A year was spent in designing, making and testing the several parts of the
apparatus. In the second year we put together the pieces and carried through
preliminary experiments, which led to some modifications and further trials. In the
third year the apparatus was got into working order and the determinations made.
After the three years’ work we are painfully aware how far our attempt falls short of
the precision of Professor MoriEy’s own determination, but the relation we have found
between hydrogen and chlorine seems worthy of record on account of the directness
of the method of comparison.

Our method was, briefly, as follows:—Chlorine prepared by the electrolysis of
