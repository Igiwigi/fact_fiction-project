The EST, and the reduction in Rhox5 expression is less
mechanism(s) by which AR ablation in SC affect(s) pronounced than in the SCARKO. Taken together,
Leydig cell development remain(s) elusive. Known these data suggest that in this model the knockout of
SC-derived growth factors such as platelet-derived the AR in SC is less complete, conceivably owing to
growth factor alpha (PDGF-A) (decreased production the fact that Cre-mediated inversion is in principle
in SCARKO) as well as unknown factors probably reversible.
contribute (Tan er al. 2005). Two other models with an SC-selective ablation of the
AR have been described. The first one (the S-AR‚Äù (c) Selective ablation of the AR in germ cells,
mouse) strongly resembles the SCARKO model peritubular myoid or Leydig cells
(Chang et al. 2004).
