Notice in particular that the
plateau is exponentially flat. In that field regime, as we have already remarked, all couplings
of x are exponentially suppressed so that the theory flows to a Higgsless SM. Higher-order
radiative corrections to this potential have received much attention [113-116,127] and a proper
calculation must deal with the complication that the theory is in fact non-renormalizable, as we
discuss next. Like any other non-renormalizable effective theory, the SM with a non-minimally coupled
Higgs scalar (in Jordan-frame language) comes equipped with a cut-off scale A beyond which the
effective theory (EFT) description breaks down. A simple way to find out what is the cut-off A is to
analyse what is the smallest scale that suppresses the non-renormalizable operators of the theory.
