compelled to use, in the calculation of «V", the total concentration instead of that of
the unassociated substance.

It is also possible that more than one type of electrolytic compound is formed in a
given solution, as, for example, the compounds ABCD and (AB),CD; in which
case the total conductivity will be the sum of the conductivities due to the ionisation
of each of these compounds. In such a case as this extremely complicated curves
might result. Moreover, we cannot strictly apply the equation to the concentrated
solutions, since for these the active mass () of the solvent is no longer constant.

The fact that the curves, as a whole, are so analogous to those for a simple
electrolyte in aqueous solution appears to indicate that, as a general rule, the main
effect is due to the ionisation of a single substance.

The equation «V" = ¢K’ should also be applicable to abnormal solutions in other
solvents. This is the case for the solutions investigated by PLornrKorr (‘ Zeit. Phys.
Chem.,’ 1904, 48, p. 224), who found very abnormal variations of » for antimony
tribromide and phosphorus pentabromide in bromine. The experimental figures for
antimony tribromide lead to the following values for V and «V" :—
