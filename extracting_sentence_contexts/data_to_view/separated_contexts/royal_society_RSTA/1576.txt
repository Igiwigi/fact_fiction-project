In figure 1b,c, we can observe the amplitude variation with t for the damping
parameter values 4. = 0.02 and py = 0.04. As in the case 4 =0 described above, a similar pattern
of regions for the amplitude versus t is observed, though for higher values of Â« the dynamics
changes. As a matter of fact, we can see how the high-amplitude oscillations, corresponding to
Region IV, either disappear and the system remains at rest at a low energy as in the case 4 = 0.04
or it happens for a few t values as in the case jz = 0.02. To stress out this damping effect, we show
in figure 1d a zoom of Region IV for the 4 = 0.02 case. In order to provide analytical support for the numerical results presented above, we perform a
linear stability analysis [17,18] for the fixed points x* = x, = +3.606.
