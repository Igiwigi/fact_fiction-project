VOLUMETRIC RELATIONS OF OZONE. 117

the spark or silent discharge. When this operation was finished, the vessel was replaced
in the calorimeter, the siphon tubes were opened, and the leyels of the acid in the two
vessels again read.

In order to examine the effects of heat, the reservoir of the vessel was placed in a sort
of air-bath, formed by suspending a long copper cylinder aboye a LzsLIE's gas-burner,
the siphon tube being outside the cylinder, fig. 6. In this way a temperature of 300? C.,
which was sufficient to destroy in a short time all the ozone reactions, was readily
obtained, This temperature was estimated without difficulty, by observing the amount
of compression of the air in the outer leg of the siphon tube. Our apparatus, with a
slight modification, might, in fact, be employed as a thermometer for all temperatures
below that at which glass begins to soften.

It will probably tend to perspicuity, if we state, before going further, some of the
general results of our experiments on the action of the electrical discharge on pure
oxygen.

I. When the silent discharge is passed through pure and dry oxygen, a contraction takes
place. This contraction proceeds, at first rapidly, but afterwards more 8lowly, till it
attains a limit, which, in one of our experiments, amounted to oth of the original volume
of the gas.

II. 1f a few electrical sparks be passed through the gas in this contracted state, it
