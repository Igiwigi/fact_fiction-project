At a later period (1849*) I suggested that the sea might
Serhaps have once entered the valley and exerted a denuding power, an opinion which
did not maintain in later editions of my two treatises on geology, and which I entirely
Abandoned after visiting Madeira and the Canary Islands in 1854, when I became aware
f the prodigious excavating and removing power which torrents and rivers can exert on

Subarial yolcanos after their completion.
