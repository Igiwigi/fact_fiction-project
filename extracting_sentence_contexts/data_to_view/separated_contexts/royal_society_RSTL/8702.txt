in the equation 3"=0, then the terms involving @, 3, .. in (18) all
vanish. But I have not as yet fully investigated this question. Turning to the second view of the case, which is in fact the more interesting, viz.
that in which (18) is to be considered as a relation between the coefficients of U, we
have for every point of contact four equations, viz.

U=0, ®,U: ®,U : ,,U=d,V : ®,V : d,V, V=0,
or their equivalents; 7. e. for p points of contact 4p equations, viz. p equations inyolving the coefficients of U alone,

2p ” ” U & Wo
Pp - I V alone. But of the 2p equations which involve the coefficients of U & V, p—2 may be cleared
of those belonging to V, and reduced to the form (18); and we hence have finally

2p—2 equations involving the coefficients of U alone,
p+2 by - ULSY,
p ” R V alone.
