laterally, hence the visibility of the coils; what alteration, if any, occurs in its length is not clear. Greater

reliability of the estimations is thus only a relative term applicable to relative lengths within the same
technique. The actual sizes of the living chromosome are still uncertain.

relative sizes have already been given, and though the coincidence between this result
and the known contractability of keratin and myosin must not be over-emphasized,
the fact of chromosome shrinkage is abundantly clear.

With regard to the direct measurements, the general statement that chromosome
length at an early somatic prophase is roughly equivalent to that at late pachytene
