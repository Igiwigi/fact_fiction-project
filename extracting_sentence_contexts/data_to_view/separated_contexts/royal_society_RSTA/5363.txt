Under such
circumstances, slight signs of increase of the velocity are sometimes just discernible. But this was only detected in three cases, when the currents used were as great as
the electrometer would bear without injury. These facts, implying the absence of acquired “momentum,” seemed to indicate
that in ordinary working the velocity of the meniscus at any moment must be some
function of the accelerating force at that moment, in the sense that it is independent
of any previous motion, and can contribute nothing—or practically nothing—to the
velocity with which it moves during the next interval. In order to determine experimentally the form of this function, I arranged a
rheotome in the derived circuit of a rheochord in such a way that any desired difference
of potential could be introduced into the electrometer circuit for an accurately measured
period of from ‘005 sec. to about ‘6 sec.
