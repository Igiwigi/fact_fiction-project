intestine it is proportionately longer in the embryo than in the adult.

The similarity of the embryonic spiral valve of Lepidosteus to that of Elasmobranchit
shows that STaxx1vs' hesitatation in accepting MULLER's discovery of the spiral valve
in Lepidosteus is not justified.

J. Mien (*Bau u. Entwick. d. Myxinoiden *) holds that the 80-called bursa entiana
of Elasmobranchii (ie. the chamber placed between the part of the intestine with the
spiral valve and the end of the pylorus) is the homologue of the more elongated
portion of the small intestine which occupies a similar position in the Sturgeon. This
portion of the small intestine is no doubt homologous with the still more elongated
and coiled portion of the small intestine in Lepidosteus placed between the chamber
into which the pyloric caxca, &c., open and the region of the spiral valve. The fact
that the vitelline duct in the embryo Lepidosteus is placed close to the pyloric end of

stomach, and that the greater portion of the small intestine is derived from part
the alimentary canal behind this, hows that MULLER is mistaken in attempting to
ologisze the bursa entiana of Elazmobranchii, which is placed in front of the
ine duct, with the coiled part of the small intestine of the above forms. The
is either derived from an elongation of the very shorb portion of the intestine
