or, what is the 8ame thing.

—_a+d 2(ad—be) .

and it is easy to verify @ posteriori that this value in fact gives 1*—=M*.

It may be
remarked that if

W=o 1, 0 Y=1,
[ 0, 1|
we have X=0; it will be 8een presently that the

=1 admits of other solutions besides L=+1. The example shows how the
s of the fractional Powers of a matrix are to be investigated.

28. There is an apparent difficulty connected with the equation satisfied by a matrix.
