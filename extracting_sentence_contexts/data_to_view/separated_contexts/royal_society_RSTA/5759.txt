status, potential and independence as a scientific field. It reveals its own problems, methods and techniques,
often with the stimulus of general relativity, quantum
field theory and above all differential geometry, but it
also serves as the inevitable tank of ideas and models for
use of the more data-driven, ‘actual’ physical cosmology.
