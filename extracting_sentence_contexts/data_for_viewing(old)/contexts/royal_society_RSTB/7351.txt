another corresponding visual angle at which foveal vision becomes colourless.

Many years ago it was found by the author (1915) that a light, very nearly colourless to
the eye, could be produced by removing from ordinary white light the whole of the violet and
blue, together with part of the blue-green and some of the extreme red of the spectrum, by
means of suitable dyes, the light thus produced being pale yellowin colour. But the yellowness
of this light could be reduced considerably by partly absorbing the yellow rays. Non-colour-
sensitive photographic emulsions could be exposed to this light with very little fogging,
and in consequence it was used for illumination in the dark room. Many colours could be
seen by it in their natural hues, but others were considerably altered. Red, orange, green,
blue-green, and pale shades of these colours, appeared normal; so did the same colours
mixed with black. Yellow was extremely pale; blue was dark blue-grey; mauve was red-
brown; and crimson was replaced by orange. At the time, these facts seemed extremely
puzzling. Now, however, that the details of the reduced colour vision which the retina
assumes under conditions of small visual angle, or of feeble illumination, are known, the
properties of this light are much more easily understood.

(69) The varieties of dichromatism

There are many varieties of dichromatism, which, however, are divisible into two main
categories: (1) complementary dichromatism, in which the two primary colours are com-
plementary to one another and thus produce white when suitably mixed; and (2) non-
complementary dichromatism, in which the two primary colours are not complementary
to one another, and so do not produce white when mixed in any proportion.
