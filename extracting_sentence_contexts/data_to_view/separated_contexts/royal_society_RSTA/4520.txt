In “ Colour Photometry,” Part III, a comparison was made
of the sensitiveness of the centre of the eye compared with that of a point 10°
towards the periphery. Determinations of this kind are extremely difficult, and it
is only by continued observation that an approach to correct measures can be made. In fact the eye requires training. Perhaps the easiest plan of explaining how the
following determinations were made will be by describing a preliminary experiment. Procure a large sheet of black paper and lay it horizontally on a table near a window,
so that it is equally illuminated.
