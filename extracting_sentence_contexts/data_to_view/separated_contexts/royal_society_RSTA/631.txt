This is one of the reasons (but not the only reason) for such interpretations, because this character
of quantum predictions is an experimental fact. As noted from the outset, the repetition of
identically prepared experiments, in general, leads to different outcomes. Unlike in classical
physics, this difference cannot be improved beyond a certain limit (defined by Planckâ€™s constant,
h) by improving the conditions of measurement, a fact also reflected in the uncertainty relations,
which are equivalent or correlative to the statistical nature of quantum predictions. This character
of quantum predictions must, accordingly, be equally maintained, as must also, and correlatively,
be the uncertainty relations, by realist interpretations of these theories or alternative theories,
such as Bohmian theories. In Bohmian theories, a given quantum object is assumed to possess
both position and the momentum, defined exactly at any moment of time, which allows for
realism and causality.
