doing so by the belief that different aneroids varied very much in the laws they
followed. The fall of reading during the first day’s exposure to a low pressure might
vary, he says, from about one-third * to more than three-fourths of the fall in the first
week,

For evidence of this he refers to a table on his p. 26, giving particulars of the creep
in 29 aneroids during the first day and the first week. The evidence seems to me
somewhat inconclusive. In the first place, there seems no information as to whether
the original lowering of pressure was carried out at an invariable rate. Thus it is
not clear whether an exact comparison is possible between the aneroids which were
exposed to different pressures. Those exposed to the same pressure were presumably
exposed to the same conditions, and in their case there are no variations at all
approaching those mentioned by Mr. Waymrrr. In fact, I notice only two instances
in the whole table in which the creep in the first day was less than the half of that
in the first week ; and in both these cases there was no companion aneroid tried at
the same pressure. In the first instance a 3-inch Watkin aneroid, exposed to a

pressure of 24 inches, is credited with a creep of ‘111 inch in a day and ‘273 inch in
a week ; in the second instance, that of a 44-inch Watkin aneroid, the creeps were
‘052 inch in a day and ‘144 inch in a week. The presumption is that the aneroids
were only read to ‘01, or at most to 005, of an inch, the third decimal coming from
the reading of the mercury barometer; in the second instance mentioned above,
a trifling error in the reading would make a large difference in the result.

* A footnote says “less than a fifth” in some exceptional cases not quoted.
