6 present case.
= We may, therefore, speak of the emergence of a merocyte at the surface, and term
@ the cells which cover the yolk blastomeres, whether they arise directly from the yolk

© Tetraclita porosa, Balanus perforatus, B, improvisus, and B, balanoides, Other
‘@ Species were investigated by Bovax.ius, but they were not distinguished, and the

4 that the development is similar to that of other forms, a probability which is reduced
3 almost to a certainty by the fact that one of the species was Balanus balanoides, a
& form investigated also by Hoxx, whose account can be readily brought into relation
5 with my own.

A In Lepas anatifera the basal plane may be transverse (figs. 8, 9) or oblique
(figs. 10, 12).

After the emergence of the second merocyte (TI.) the first blastoderm cell (I.) may
divide into two cells placed symmetrically on each side of II. (fig. 14) ; or the plane of
division may make any angle with that containing the nucleus of II., and the long
axis of the egg (fig, 13),

A third merocyte (IIL) may then emerge either to the right or left of II. (figs. 15,
