This supplies an explanation of these facts at once adequate and imple;
the oxide of silver in this experiment being reduced by the oxygen of the peroxide
of hydrogen, just as in other cases it might be by hydrogen; the formation of
the silyer from the particles of which it is composed being the corresponding fact
in the decomposition of the oxide of silyer to the formation of water in the peroxide,
80 that we may represent the change thus :—

t=+=+, =
HO O O Ag Agtz=HO+0,+Ag. wlll Zee If

No one can be more sensible than I am of the wide interval which exists between
such a mode of representing a chemical change and an ascertained fact. The very
form in which I have just expressed the decomposition involves an important assump-
tion, an assumption indeed on which, in my opinion, the whole question rests. If it
be true that these bodies are thus decomposed in definite and equivalent proportions,
and that the simultaneous decomposition of the bodies proceeds according to this law,
it is impossible to deny the chemical relation of these changes and the mutual che-
mical action of the substances ; and, on the other hand, if the formation of this oxygen
is to be regarded as a true chemical synthesis, this synthesis must follow the universal
law of the formation of chemical substances, and the masses must combine in definite
and equivalent proportions.
