One fact we may, however, notice at the outset. The capillary system of even an early embryo is by no means a uniform one, and
is itself conforming to a morphological plan. It is this fact which renders the
“ Netztheorie ” in a rigid form untenable. Certain areas of early embryos have a
dense supply of capillaries, while others in certain circumscribed areas remain bare
for considerable periods. One of the most fruitful lines of advance in the study of
capillary distribution would seem to be the intensive study of such non-vascular
areas.
