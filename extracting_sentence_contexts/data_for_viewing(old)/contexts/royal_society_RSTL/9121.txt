iron are welded together and shaped to a determinate form. What is here effected is
to specify the kind of blows which are required and the number of blows of each kind.
Now it may be asked, since every chemical eyent is here referred to one set of causes,
and regarded as occurring by the transferences of the © simple weights” , £, x,...,
How are we to interpret such expressions as (7—a), (zy—ab), when they occur among
the factors of chemical equations? Such expressions apparently inyolve a change in our
point of view; for (x—a) is not the symbol of the © transference ” of x, but of the 8nb-
stitution of one © simple weight,” a, for another, x, and (zxy—ab) is not the symbol of
any substitution of one simple weight for another, but is the symbol of the substitution
of a compound weight ab for a compound weight xy. To this it may be replied that
we are here considering results; that the expression (7—«) means the occurrence of a
phenomenon of which the result is the substitution of @ for z. But it does not inform
us of any particular way in which this result is attained. And, in fact, this result may
with equal justice be considered as the aggregate of the two transferences (&—1)—(a—1)
as a 8ingle substitution. Such an expression, therefore, as (y—&a)(y—b) is always to be
regarded as an abbreviated form of expression for the aggregate

(z—1(y—1)—(z—1(b—1)—(«—1(y—U+(«- (5 =1).
Similarly, developing the expression (zy—ab), we have
a2y—ab=(a—1)+(y—1)+(z—1X(y—1)—(a—1)—(b—1)=(a2—16—1),
80 that the event symbolized (for example) as (xy—ab)(2—1) is to be regarded as an
abbreviated expression for the aggregate of events,
(#=1z—1)+(y—1)(2—1)+(#—1(—1\2—1)—(a—1(2—1)(6—12—1)
—(a—1)b—1)z—1).
