bred-out from collected pupw, but the bulk of them were taken by sweeping through the
plot of oats with a muslin net on July 17 and 20. A few were dissected immediately
after being anesthetised by chloroform, but most of them were preserved in 70 per cent.
alcohol and dissected later.

The numbers reveal the fact that although amongst the flies dissected there was a
large preponderance of females, yet amongst the infected ones there was a slightly larger
number of males than females. The writer cannot advance any adequate explanation
of this. It may be that normal males are more active on the wing than parasitised
ones and so escaped capture. The data available from flies bred out at Harpenden,
and from those of the panicle generation discussed later, show that there are normally
about equal numbers of males and females. Consequently the 966 flies, made up of
607 females and 359 males, cannot be regarded as a truly representative or normal
collection.

Of the 142 infected flies, 4 females contained degenerate worms and had normal
ovaries, which leaves 138 flies, or 14-27 per cent. of the total, in which effective sterilisa-
tion had been brought about by Tylenchinema.
