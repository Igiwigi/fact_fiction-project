By evaluating the commutators in 2 |
the Heisenberg equations of motion, we found that a novel quantum mechanical force operator

appeared in all three identities. In terms of this force operator, all three identities could be put 3
in a form directly analogous to the classical equations of motion dE/dt=F-v, dP/dt=F and oS
dL/dt =R x F. 7s

One wrinkle in those results was the fact that the classical force-times-velocity form could only 12

be achieved for the rate of change of one part of the nuclear kinetic energy, namely the term

Tams (701° (Pi + Al)" |x(0), aa) 8

where |x (t)) is the nuclear wave function that satisfies the effective Schrodinger equation :s

kinetic energy of a fictitious closed quantum system acted upon by scalar and vector potentials Pe

write down if one were given the Schrédinger equation (1.2) but not told it describes only one [3

The closed system described by equation (1.2) reproduces the true N,-body density and N;,- +8
body current density of the nuclear subsystem, but it is fictitious in the sense that off-diagonal
elements of the nuclear density matrix and hence non-local observables of the nuclear subsystem
cannot be calculated directly from the wave function x(R,t).
