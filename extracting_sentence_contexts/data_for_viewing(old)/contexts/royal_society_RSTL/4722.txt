SZ But in the figure which he refers to, of the fourth dorsal vertebra of the Delphinus
S Delphis, the accurate artist, M. LauRLLarD, represents the metapophyses as distinct
5 from the prozygapophysis or anterior articular process, although less $0 than it is in
[4 nature; and it is incontestably the progressive development of this superadded pro-

cess which gives rise to the change of position of the articular surface of the connate
prozygapophysis: and the metapophysis continues to be developed, as the figures in
the © Ossemens Fossiles' demonstrate, long after the articular process or any articular
surface has ceased to existf.

Order BrvuTa (Edentata, Cvuv.).

The exogenous processes of the vertebre present their greatest and most complex
developments in this order, but by no means with that degree of uniformity which
renders their modifications characteristic of some of the preceding Orders. The two
extremes in the degree of development are, in fact, presented by the much-diversified
families of the present extraordinary group of mammals.
