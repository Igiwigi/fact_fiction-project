Within the
field of heterogeneous catalysis, much research has been devoted to understand how the crystal
morphology and size influence the transport and catalytic function. An overall integrative view
on the entanglement between transport, kinetics and the way these are affected by the spatial
heterogeneities is still an open question. The terminology spatio-temporal evolution of a material
has been coined, referring to the fact that the dynamics of the material is affected by the material’s
spatial properties [1,25]. Looking from a more holistic perspective, it is important to realize that
materials and processes have an intrinsic life cycle. This concept has been nicely documented
in catalysis research and referred as the ‘birth, life and death’ of a catalytic solid [26,27].
