E that is to say, it is equal to the weight of a column of liquid of half the height due to the

Z 8peed, on @ base equal to the midship 8ection,—a result which agrees very closely with ex-

S periment. EZ Since a propelling instrument which acts by the reaction of the water, as a paddle,

S A SCreW, an oar, or a jet, drives the particles of water astern, it tends to diminish the
height of the crest of a wave, and to increase the depth of a trough or hollow ;—in
the former case diminishing, and in the latter increasing the energy of the wave, which
partly goes to waste in the case of divergence; and hence it follows that it is favourable
to economy of power that 8uch a propelling instrument should act on the crest, rather
than on the hollow of a wave. This fact is well known in practice. The production of diverging waves is not prevented by totally submerging the dis-
turbing body ; but those waves are of less height at the surface of the water, the more
deeply the body is covered. 'The virtual depth, and consequently the speed, of the waves
of the second and third classes increases, and their angle of divergence diminishes, with

increased submergence of the body; but the speed, and consequently the angle of diver-
gence, of the waves of the first class is unaltered, because they depend on the time occu-
pied by the solid in moving through a certain portion of its length. Q 19.
