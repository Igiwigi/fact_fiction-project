At Dolcoath Mine there is an instance of one ore vein intersecting another
at different depths, and being itself intersected and eyen shifted by the same
vein at a greater depth. I have givena sketch of these intersections in Fig. 27,
(for which I am indebted to Captain PeTHERICK of that mine,) as T am not aware
that it, has been before noticed. Many other facts might, if it were necessary, be accumulated, relative to the
position and intersections of yeins, as well as the nature and arrangement of
their contents, which, with those I haye stated, are calculated to throw entire
discredit on the various hypotheses which have been invented to account for
their origin. But my object is, rather to snggest whether the arrangement of
veins, &c. does not argue design, and a probable connection with other phazno-
mena of our globe. Metalliferous veins, and those of quartz, &c. appear to be channels for the
circulation of the subterraneous water and vapour; and the innumerable clay
veins or © flucan courses” (as they are termed in Cornwall,) which intersect
them, and are often found contained in them, being generally impervious to
water, prevent their draining the surface of the higher grounds as they other-

wise would, and also facilitate the working of mines to a much greater depth
than would be practicable without them.
