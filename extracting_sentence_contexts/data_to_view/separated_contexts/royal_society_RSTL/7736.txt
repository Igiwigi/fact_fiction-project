212 MR. N. STORY-MASKELYNE ON THE

The examination and the analysis of this meteorite had therefore to be performed
on yery minute quantities; in fact on a few grains of debris that had become detached
from the brittle little stone. The conspicuous ingredient in this meteorite is a pale yellow-green, or primrose-
coloured mineral, with a tint similar to that of a yery pale peridot or chrysolite, occur-
ring in crystalline grains cemented together, in a state of very slight aggregation, by a
white opaque silicate, which in a microscopic section has a flocculent appearance. The granules of green minerals present in the microscope the appearance of tolerably
symmetrical crystals, and are 8een of every size, from that of a small pin's head to that
of a microscopic dust.
