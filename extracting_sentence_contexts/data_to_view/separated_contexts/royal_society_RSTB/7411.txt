Sections showed a basi-epithelial concentration of nerve
fibres below the apical tuft, as in the apical plate of a Tornaria. The anterior concentra-
tion of bipolar neurones may therefore be derived from the ganglion cells of the apical
plate, forming in the adult part of a nervous system which is degenerate and simplified. Their apparent absence in certain individuals may be correlated with the fact that some
batches of larvae (of S. horsti) have the apical tuft much less developed than others. Hess
(1938) suggested that his bipolar neurones were photosensitive cells, though Bullock (1945)
pointed out that their form and position are those of ganglion cells rather than sensory
cells. Removal of the proboscis tip produced no obvious modification of the reactions to
light in Saccoglossus (p. 346), but Crozier (1917) and Hess (1936) described this region as
