This work is an attempt in this direction. Thermodynamics : a
is one of the basic theories in physics, and also one of the most slippery ones. In fact, it was : 2
only after our recent work on statistical mechanics of H-AdResS that we have been able to aes
provide a glance of such a thermodynamic view. The strength of thermodynamics resides in its 22
(apparent) simplicity and its enormous ability of provide useful relations between variables [23]. : S
In this paper, we share this view and suggest several of the research lines it opens. We show DN
that thermodynamic arguments are simple and sufficient to recover the equilibrium side of the : =
statistical mechanics theory developed in [20], which starts from the Liouville equation associated [3

with the H-AdResS Hamiltonian and climbs up to the (fluid) equations of motion for the density
of conserved variables.
