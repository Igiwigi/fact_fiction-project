The present rate of pro-
duction of (viable) specific mutations, amongst all flowering plants on the whole surface
of the globe, is almost certainly less than 1 in 10 years and more than one in 60 years :
it probaby lies between 1 in 15 and 1 in 30 years.‚Äù The results are, of course, of the
nature of averages, since the flowering plants are a very heterogeneous group. It is clear that specific mutations must be events of the very greatest rarity ; and no
argument, as it seems to me, can be based on the fact that we have no knowledge or
experience of such phenomena. My work on the point entirely confirms the conclusion
of Dr. Wiix1s. *

If any conclusions stated in this Introduction or in the body of the paper seem to be
too confident, or at all dogmatic, I hope the reader will attribute the appearance to
inadvertence of wording, or a simple desire to avoid the wearisome reiteration of qualifying
phrases.
