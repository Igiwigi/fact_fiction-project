are indicated as coloured vertical lines on the frequency scale. Here f(res) = Vsw.S2q/(V_ + Vin) (purple) is the parallel (to B)
cyclotron wave resonance as described in Bruno & Trenchi [42], where £2, is the proton cyclotron frequency, Va is the Alfvén
speed and Vj is the thermal speed parallel to B; f(d) = Vsw S2pi /c (blue) is the proton inertial length, where S2,; is the proton
plasma frequency; toy = Vsw 2a /Vin (red) is the proton gyroradius; and f(cy) = S2<(1 + Vsw/Va) (green) is the Doppler-
shifted proton cyclotron frequency.

spacecraft (cf. figure 1). The dissipation range should be characterized by a steepening of the
power spectrum and, often, a change in the polarization or magnetic helicity spectrum of the
magnetic fluctuations [43].3 Whether or not the break seen at these proton scales actually reflects
dissipation is difficult to determine despite the fact that, at these scales and smaller, kinetic effects
are expected to couple the fluctuations to the background plasma, removing magnetic energy and
thus heating the background plasma. Cyclotron damping and/or Landau damping may well be
important, but dispersion due to finite Larmor radius effects, as reflected in either Hall MHD or
gyrokinetic treatments [45], also leads to spectral breaks at these same ion scales. (For related ideas
on the relationship between plasma distribution functions and dissipation, the reader is referred
to [46-48].) It is clear, however, that to determine the physics of what is actually happening will
require more and higher-time-resolution data in addition to detailed analyses.

Analysis of Wind data by Leamon et al. [40] showed that interplanetary turbulence
consisting solely of parallel-propagating waves, such as Alfvén waves, was inconsistent with
the observations. Two possibilities emerged: the fraction of the MHD turbulence that was two-
dimensional could be interacting with ambient plasma (although the scales being analysed may
