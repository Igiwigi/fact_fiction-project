The methods adopted in
preparing large quantities will be subsequently described.

6. Proof of the Presence of Argon in Air, by means of Atmolysis. Tt has already (§ 2) been suggested that if “atmospheric nitrogen” contains two
gases of different densities, it should be possible to obtain direct evidence of the fact
by the method of atmolysis. The present section contains an account of carefully
conducted experiments directed to this end. The atmolyser was prepared (after Grawam) by combining a number of “ church-
warden” tobacco pipes.
