It is worth noting that the above form of the numerical equilibrium is not unique and,
obviously, depends on the scaling factor a. To the best of our knowledge, the latter cannot
depend on the velocity discretization but it can be space- and/or time-dependent [55]. Usually,
a=1 for DVMs [29], while the work by Frapolli et al. [41] relies on a= pw;(T) where w;(T) are
temperature-dependent quadrature weights. In the present context, we chose to underline (1) the
quadrature-free property of our approach by discarding quadrature-weights, (2) the fact that we
are applying this methodology to the simulation of fluid flows by keeping the density in the
definition of the numerical equilibrium through a = p. The latter choice eventually leads to the
numerical equilibrium (2.13). Whereas the latter choice does not have a direct impact on imposed
moments, it may lead to different stability domains for the root-finding algorithm. This aspect is
under investigation, and corresponding results will be presented in a forthcoming paper.
