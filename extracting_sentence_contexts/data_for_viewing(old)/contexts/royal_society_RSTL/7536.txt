Frosistances of ships, viz. the manner in which the weight of the material composing the

hull should influence the form.

2 Prior to the design of the Â© Bellerophon,' the forms of ships were determined in com-

Zplete disregard of this consideration ; and even the most recent works upon the subject

Sincite the naval architect to aim always at approaching the form of least resistance.

EThe following investigations will show, however, that the adoption of a form of least

Eresistance, or of small comparative resistance, may, in fact, lead to a lavish outlay upon

Your ships, and to a great sacrifice of efficiency ; while, on the other hand, the adoption

Sof a form of greater resistance would contribute in certain classes of ships to great

\ economy and to superior efficiency.

& In order to indicate clearly, but approximately 0:
asxume that figs. 1 & 2 roughly represent a long and a $horter ship respectively, both
being prismatic in a vertical sense. The length of fig. 1 is seven times its breadth ;
that of fig. 2 five times its breadth, the middle portion of the latter being parallel for
two-fifths of its length. I will further as8ume that the ship (fig. 1) will give a constant
