For a very large number of
western plants on the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains are also found on their
eastern slopes. On the other hand, the line of 100° west longitude sorts off the
Eastern United States’ flora well ; in short, I find it both an easier and a more natural
boundary than the water-parting. The fact is that, in the final result, I come very near to Mr. Wauuace. In order
that the dividing-lines of my tabulation areas may effect a good sorting of the plants
on the primary tabulation, these lines must be made to coincide approximately with
the boundaries of natural biologic regions.
