and resistance to chemical solvents.” Also, “ that if great care is taken to get an alloy
of exactly this composition, we have a grey-white metal with a half-glassy, glimmering,
minutely conchoidal fracture. There is no sign of crystallization ; and polishing and
annealing show nothing. The slower the cooling the more brittle the mass.” He
finds that at 25 atoms of tin the alloy is more easily attacked by reagents
than at 20 atoms, and hence, and for other reasons, he refuses to accept the view
that SnCu, is a compound. He is disposed to regard it as a mixture of two alloys,

which may, or may not, have separated in the liquid state. He finds that this
alloy crumbles under the hammer, or even under a coarse file, into polyhedra with
smooth faces,

In contrast to Benrens, other writers have accumulated a mass of facts pointing,
at least, to the unique character of the alloy with 25 atoms of tin. Laurie finds
that the electromotive force of couples formed of copper and a copper-tin alloy

changes abruptly at this composition. We get here a maximum for electrical
conductivity, for density, and for coefficient of dilatation.

Hence various writers have concluded that the compound SnCu, exists ; but there
