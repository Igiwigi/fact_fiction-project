Another view has been put forward by Lizz16, These experiments with the per-
oxide of hydrogen he places by the side of the fermentation and decay of organic
bodies, of which chemical changes he thus gives the cause{:—* The cause,” says he,
*is the power which a body possesses in the act of decomposition or composition to
elicit the same action in a body in contact with it, or to render it capable of un-
dergoing the same change which itself experiences. Thus the decompoxsition of the
ferment decomposes also the sngar, and the decompoxition of the peroxide of hydro-
gen decomposes the metallic oxide.” The simultaneous decomposition of the two
substances is the fact. That it is the very chemical change itself in the one instance
which determines the chemical change in the other ; this relation L1zBrc has pointed
out. But why and how, consistently with what we otherwise know of the nature of
chemical action, and the mode of its transference and propagation, this can be the
