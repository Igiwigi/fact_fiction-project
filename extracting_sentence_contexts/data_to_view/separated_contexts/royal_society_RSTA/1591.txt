Thus,
we avoid hypotheses of compactness both on the semigroup generated by the linear part and on
the nonlinear term F. In particular, in contrast to [12-15,17], this approach allows us to treat a
class of nonlinear multimaps F which are not necessarily compact-valued. In fact, even for single
valued nonlinearities, assuming that the nonlinear term satisfies a regularity condition in terms
of measure of weak non-compactness is a much weaker assumptions than assuming the same
condition with respect to strong measure of non-compactness (see remark 3.1). For example the
first condition can be easily verified in a reflexive Banach space, where bounded sets are weakly
relatively compact ones. Moreover, unlike [9,11,16], we can handle also linear part A generating
integrated semigroups whose derivative is a non-compact semigroup.
