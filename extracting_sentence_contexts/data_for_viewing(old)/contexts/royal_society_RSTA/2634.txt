Geophysical and petrological results from Iceland are consistent with a stacked sills mode
of crustal accretion, a model that was developed in response to observations from active mid-
ocean ridges and ophiolite complexes. In these models, thin and transient mushes may form at
the margins of thin melt sills, meaning that many rising magmas carry evidence of interaction
with mush and all solid cumulate rocks have progressed through a mushy stage. The melt
sills are encased in a hot, but subsolidus country rock. In order to generate suitable cumulate
country rock it is vital that porosity in mushes is occluded by the crystallization of primitive
phases.

Geochemical evidence from Icelandic melt inclusion suites indicates that mixing and cooling
of melts are concurrent in crustal magma storage zones. Convection is likely to couple these
processes together and the fact that evidence for both mixing and cooling is preserved indicates


that the times cales of these processes are similar. Simple fluid dynamical reasoning can be used
to show that this equivalence of time scales is expected from mixing in basaltic sills that are less
than about 10m in height. These sill thickness are very similar to those envisioned for oceanic
crustal accretion at spreading ridges on the basis of observations at ophiolites.
