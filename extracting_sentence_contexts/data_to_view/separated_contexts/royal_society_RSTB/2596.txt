The essential feature is a prominent columella; a second feature
which may be regarded as correlated, is the scanty development or absence of basal
structures. Lindstrdmia, the oldest of the genera (Ordov. to Carb.), has well-developed
septa reaching to the columella ; the septa are smooth on their surfaces and at their
edges; they have “ pinnate ” arrangement with regard to four principal septa, and a
slight fossula is present. The chief fact which at present calls our attention is
that “ stereoplasm ” fills the lower part of the visceral chamber, while in the upper
part dissepiments or tabulve are scantily developed (cf: Nictonson, ‘ Manual,’ loc. cit.,
p- 298). Fruce says the endothecal deposit is sometimes entirely stereoplasmic,
