It is to appearance a mem-
branous bag, the coats of which are 80 thin as to be semitrans-
parent, and to have no visible muscular structure. From the
effects produced by the different parts of this bag while the
animal is alive, being exactly similar to the contractions and
relaxations of the muscular fibres in- the human body, we
must conelude that this membrane is possessed of a similar
power ; and consequently, has the same right to be called
muscular. The hydatid, from its apparent want of muscles, and other
parts which generally .constitute. an” animal, was for a long
while denied its place in the animal world, and considered as
the production of disease ; we are, however, at present in pos-
session of a sufficient number. of facts, to ascertain, not only
that it is an animal, but that it belongs to. a- genus of which
there are several different species. Hydatids are found to exist in the bodies of many quadru-
peds, and often in the human ; the particular parts most fa-
vourable to their support appear to be the liver, kidneys, and
brain, although they are sometimes detected in other situations. One $pecies is globular in its form, the outer surface of the
bag s8mooth, uniform, and without any external opening ; they
are seldom found single, and are contained in a cyst, or thick
membranous covering, in which they appear to lie quite loose ;
having no visible attachment to any part of it.
