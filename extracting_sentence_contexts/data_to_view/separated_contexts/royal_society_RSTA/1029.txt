Moreover, the tensor map 6[Z] may not be geometrically compatible, i.e. there could
not exist any differentiable vector field gg such that Grad gg = @[Z]. In this case, there does not
exist a deformation that maps the reference configuration of the residually stressed material
into a relaxed one. In fact, assuming that the reference configuration is simply connected, such
a deformation exists if and only if
rot 6[Z] =0. In the following, we call G[Z] the relaxing map. Remark 5.5.
