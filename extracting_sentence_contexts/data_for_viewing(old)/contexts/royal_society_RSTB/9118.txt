versity conservation science. We summarize briefly below
these studies, which range from community ecology patterns
and reserve network evaluation to method comparisons.

Toyama eft al. [54] established 32 plots in the evergreen and
deciduous forest of Cambodia in which they recorded all tree
species and monitored the changes in composition of these for-
ests overa period of 12 years. They reconstructed a phylogenetic
tree of the 376 tree species recorded in these plots and were able
to show that logging caused a decrease in PD within commu-
nities over the period of the study and increased phylogenetic
similarity between evergreen and deciduous plots. These pat-
terns were attributed to the fact that logging was the cause of
the observed environmental homogenization [54].

Using phylogenetic measures (PD and phylogenetic species
variability (PSV) [55]), geographical distributions and the
species conservation status based on the IUCN Red List,
Huang & Roy [45] evaluated how the extinction of threatened
species will affect the evolutionary diversity in coral reefs glob-
ally (i.e. across ecoregions). They found that the projected loss of
evolutionary history was less important in regions with higher
species diversity compared with less species-rich regions. More
importantly perhaps, they showed that regions with high
species richness could lose large numbers of threatened species
