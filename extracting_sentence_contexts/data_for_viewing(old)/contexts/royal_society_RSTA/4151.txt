perturbation regimes of the short-time decay of f(t) (figures 3 and 4) are manifested in the IPR
behaviour (figure 5).

After the Gaussian decay shown in figure 3, we can see a second exponential decay with a rate
given by the classical Lyapunov exponent of the stadium billiard. The Lyapunov exponent is 4 =
410, where A; = 0.43 corresponds to! =r = 1 [46,47]. Here t = 2k is the average velocity computed
from the eigenenergies E; =k? (kj being the wavenumber of the eigenstate |E;)) in the energy
window @ considered. Evidently, the fidelity computed using an initial state pg and the fidelity
obtained from the Haar measure for the quantum maps share the same decay behaviour: a short-
time decay which depends on the characteristics and strength of the perturbation, followed by a
Lyapunov regime depending on a classical feature.

We also compute | f2(t)| using the semi-classical DR. This is a simple task due to the fact that
unperturbed trajectories are geometrically obtained in the billiard and the perturbation only gives
a phase as dictated by equation (2.1). To take into account the initial pg(n1) state, we compute the
semi-classical | fa(t)| by assuming that the initial conditions are uniformly random inside the
billiard; the same was assumed for the direction of the initial momentum. The modulus squared
of the momenta are distributed as the eigenenergies of the unperturbed system. In figure 6, we
show | f(Ã©)| computed using the DR and the quantum results. We can see that the semi-classical
approximation provides an accurate fitting of the quantum results. Moreover, the Lyapunov
decay is clearly observed in the DR approximation.

From the outset, the LE emerged as a viable quantity to characterize instability and irreversibility
