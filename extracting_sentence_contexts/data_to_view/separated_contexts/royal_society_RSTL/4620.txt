They are, however, both canals in which ON,
the waves from two tidal seas enter at opposite ends and meet in the centre, where of the En-
they form a combined wave, and hence they have the property of reversing their 4c ing
streams simultaneously. pared. There cannot therefore be any doubt that the waves which are formed in the
centre of these straits exert a powerful influence over the course of the waters on
both sides of them, and in fact that they both govern their movements and regulate
the limits of their streams. It was the consideration of this influence that determined me to refer all the
movements of the streams of these Channels to the time when the combined wave
was matured. In the Irish Sea I adopted Liverpool as the standard*, and as Dover
was s8ituated s0 near to the apex of the wave in the English Channel, and had tables
of its tides already printed and in general circulation, I adopted the time of high
water at that place as a standard to which all the observations there should be re-
ferred.
