as pubertal or pro-cestrous is uncertain. This distinction is purely academic since
all the animals were non-parous. The vaginal cornification appears a long time
before the cestrous condition is attained and gradually becomes more intense. At
the same time the uterus develops and the follicles exhibit active growth. Prior to
cestrus many of the growing follicles degenerate. The pro-cestrous condition merges
into oestrus. The largest follicles in animals which had copulated, as shown by
the presence of sperms, varied greatly in size. One animal which had copulated
had no follicles larger than 232 » in diameter, while another had follicles up to
328 » in diameter, Other animals which had apparently not copulated, since no
sperms could be found in them, had follicles as large as 296 wu. Sperms were present
in some of the animals on and after April 29 and by May 20 all were pregnant. The
sizes of the largest follicles in animals which had copulated and those which had not
are shown in fig. 2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none of these animals
