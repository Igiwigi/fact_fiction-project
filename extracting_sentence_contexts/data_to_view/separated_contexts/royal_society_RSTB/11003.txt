However, it is now clear that a range of different stressors,
other than heat, such as viral infection, cytokines, oxidative
stress, ionizing and UV irradiation, glucose deprivation or
exposure to toxins and certain metals, also induce the
expression of such proteins. A more descriptively correct
term for these proteins is therefore ‘cell stress’ proteins [5]. The fact that research on the heat shock response was pre-
dominantly undertaken in Drosophila during the 1960s and
1970s led to the expectation that this response was specific to
insects or even to Drosophila itself. However, observations
that the heat shock response was present in chicken fibroblasts
[6], Escherichia coli [7], yeast [8] and plants [9] indicated that the
heat shock/cell stress response is a universal phenomenon. The
cloning of the Drosophila genes encoding HSPs and the sequen-
cing of many of the relevant genes by the late 1970s/early
1980s revealed the evolutionary relationships between the
response and the proteins involved (e.g. [10]).
