Owing to the necessity for
using an acid trap solution, hydrolysis might account for the fact that the peroxide behaved
in the analyses in exactly the same way as does H,O,. The engine peroxide had more affinity for water than had t-butyl hydroperoxide. This
was shown by the fact that a CO, scrubbing procedure left the former in the solution (
did H,O,), but easily removed the latter from solution. Shtern & Pollyak (1943) have identified H,O, in engine-gas condensates by a polaro-
graphic technique but failed to prove the presence of organic peroxides conclusively.
