In these short experiments the alveolar oxygen pressure was abnormally raised, as will be explained
below, and this must have aided considerably the absorption of oxygen,


PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS MADE ON PIKE’S PEAK, COLORADO. 203

since the adequate aeration of the blood during hard muscular work depends in all
probability on the activity of the lung epithelium, even at sea-level. As the theory that oxygen passes into the blood through the lung epithelium by
diffusion alone is deeply rooted in the minds of physiologists, it may be well to consider
at this point the possibilities of the diffusion theory as applied to the facts observed
by us on Pike’s Peak. Bonr* has shown that the rate of diffusion of oxygen from the alveolar air into the
blood may be inferred from the rate at which carbon monoxide diffuses in. A. and
M. Krocut have also calculated the rate of diffusion by the same method, and it
seems probable, as Doucuas and Haxpane have pointed out, that their figures are
more nearly correct for the rate of diffusion in man during rest than Bour’s original
estimate.
