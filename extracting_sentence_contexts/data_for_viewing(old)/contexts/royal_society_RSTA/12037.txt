This is convenient for use of the slide rule. On this chart, vertical lines were
drawn at the particular densities cutting the isothermals at points which afforded the 9
pressures corresponding to the several isothermals. Unfortunately, AMAGaT’s results
do not descend to absolute densities below 0°08. For densities below this, [had to
call in the few estimations of ANpREws’. From these, curves were also plotted, but,
conveniently, of a different character. ANDREWS, in fact, gives pressures in atmo- a |
spheres and fractional decrease of volume (i.¢., the fraction V,/V.) at the temperatures
6°°5, 64°, and 100° (‘ Proc. Roy. Soe.,’ 24, p. 458). Plotting these against each other
we obtain isothermals which may be availed of by calculating the diminution of ~
volume of the gas in the sphere at the temperatures of the isothermals as above. This 5] |
is readily done, as the volume of the sphere (V.) and the volume (V,) of the mass W
at one atmosphere and at the above temperatures, may be calculated. These known, —
and the quotient of V,/V, marked upon the isothermals, the points so formed may
be joined by lines crossing the isothermals diagonally, from which pressures, at any
intermediate temperatures, may be ascertained. The mean pressures and the values
of P, and P, were taken separately from these charts. At the lowest densities, the
estimation of pressure is not very satisfactory. All the data necessary to amend the Mi
result at any time, when more connected results are available, are however contained 4
