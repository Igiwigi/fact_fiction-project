animal, especially more than in the Dog. The present part of our paper will be
devoted to summarising the facts that we have observed and the differences noted
according to the age of the animal, and we shall group the results, as before, according
to the species, beginning again with the highest.

(a.) Monkey.—In the Monkey we have only incomplete observations owing to the
difficulty of obtaining many Monkeys, but all our observations went to show that
phonatory adduction was less represented in the young animal than in the older adult.

().) Dog.—In the Dog these differences are also marked. In the young Dog even
with strong currents we have frequently only obtained from the focus of laryngeal
phonatory representation a high degree of acceleration of respiration with marked
diminution of abduction, but no complete adduction ; in fact in the cortex of such an
animal, while respiration is most efficiently represented, phonation is only imperfectly
evolved.

(c.) Cat.—In the Cat, again, the same thing prevails in its entirety, with the
additional point, viz., that this want of differentiation in the laryngeal movements
was not confined to the larynx, but also prevailed in the centres for the movements of
the limbs.

It is in accordance with points noticed by one of us (V. H.) in the representation
of the limb-muscles in the cortex of the Monkey that a wider extent of cortex —
provides for a higher evolution or development of the motor representation, and
probably the differences we have just been describing as produced by age are due to
