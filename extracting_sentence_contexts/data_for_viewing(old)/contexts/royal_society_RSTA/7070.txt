There are two main forms of the boundary-layer equations, namely, those for a com-
pressible and those for an incompressible fluid, But in many applications of the latter it
has been customary to ignore the energy equation, and to solve the mass and momentum
equations with only velocity as the dependent variable, and it has been found that this
procedure is adequate for the purpose in view. These applications are the subject of F.D.
Chapters m and tv. But sometimes, for instance if heat sources are present, a knowledge of
the temperature is needed, and the existence of a ‘temperature (boundary) layer’ as well
as a ‘velocity (boundary) layer’ must be recognized and the energy equation used. These
applications, which are the subject of F.D, Chapter xrv, require an apparently illogical
system of equations in which the energy equation has been added to the incompressible
forms of the mass and momentum equations, and in which, (i) the velocity of sound is in-
finite in spite of the fact that (small) variations of pressure density and temperature are
permitted and (ii) the physical properties of the fluid (such as viscosity) are constant. The
underlying rationale of this system and its justification is discussed with the aid of the
equations in reduced non-dimensional form in § 7.
