It is often said that fear is a universal innate emotion that we humans have
inherited from our mammalian ancestors by virtue of having inherited
conserved features of their nervous systems. Contrary to this common
sense-based scientific point of view, I have argued that what we have inher-

may go back to the beginning of life. Fear, on the other hand, from my
perspective, is a product of cortical cognitive circuits. This conception is
not just of academic interest. It also has practical implications, offering
cognition clues as to why efforts to treat problems related to fear and anxiety are
not more effective, and what might make them better.
