Mr. BRobie on the influence of the Nerves, &c. 10g

But this, with respect to the greater number of the glands, is
an experiment impossible to perform ; and, with respect to
others, can not be executed without s0 much disturbance and
injury to the other parts, as must render it extremely difficult
to arrive at any positive results. Perhaps in future investi-
gations, some circumstances may arise, which will enable us to
determine more satisfactorily this important physiological ques-
tion. In the mean time, as the labours of physiologists have
hitherto contributed s0 little to this purpose, any facts that
tend to its elucidation may deserve to be recorded, and I am
therefore induced to lay before the Society the following ex-
periments, which afford one example of a secretion_ being
dependent on the influence of the nerves.

The stomach derives its nerves principally from those of
the eighth pair, or the par vagum ;- and the same nerves, as
they assist in the formation of the semilunar ganglions, con-
tribute to the supply of the rest of the alimentary canal, par-
ticularly of the small intestines, In an inquiry which I had
formerly instituted, respecting the functions of the stomach,
I divided these nerves in the neck of a dog, for the purpose
