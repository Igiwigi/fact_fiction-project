The Danainz are evidently the group of pups: which make use of this appearance as
a warning, but, for the reasons given above, I think it is more probable that the
protective colouring is ancestral, and its use as a warning is secondary, rather than
that the development of the appearance took place in the reverse order. The fact
that Mr. Mansen WEALE proved the existence of colour susceptibility in the pupa of
Acrea esebria—one of a group protected by the possession of an unpleasant taste—
greatly supports the suggestion that the conspicuous warning appearance has been
secondarily acquired,

It is very probable that, the gilded appearance having been once acquired, and closely
resembling a very widespread and conspicuous mineral, the continued use of a small
proportion of the colouring might be protective when the insect no longer pupated
on mineral surfaces, because of the fact that the appearance does suggest the common
mineral, whatever the position of the insect may be, and because of the resemblance
to the glittering of dew upon leaves, as Mr. Trimen suggests. Thus the amount of
gilding present upon the green form of V. Jo may, perhaps, have this protective value.

Dr. Fritz Miiier kindly wrote to me on the subject from Brazil as follows :—

“Leider kann ich Ihnen iiber goldige oder mit goldenen Flecken gezierte Puppen
nur sehr wenig sagen; nur zwei derselben habe ich im Freien angetroffen : die von
Mechanitis lysimnia und die von Danais erippus. Beide gehéren zu der ungeniess-
baren Gruppe der Danainen, und es ist der Goldglanz wohl ein Warnungszeichen.
Die Raupe von Mechanitis lysimnia lebt an mehreren stachligen Solanwm-arten in
kleinen Gesellschaften, und an der Unterseite der Blitter der Futterpflanze hiingen
