Finally, electric repulsion of the kind
indicated above seems inconsistent with the fact that the gap is the same, namely,
0-004 mm. for carefully-trued cylinders and plates of materials so dissimilar electrically
as steel and glass. The position may be summarised as follows :-—

Any theory of the Leslie pressure must account for four curious facts :—

(1) The distance h at which the cylinder floats above the plate is independent of the
nature of the lubricant and of the solids, provided the surfaces are clean. (2) The distance is the same in clean air as it is when the air is displaced by a liquid
and remains the same until the pressure of the air is reduced to 2 mm. of mereury. STR WILLIAM HARDY
