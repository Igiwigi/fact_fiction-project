account the finiteness of the quantum of action [Planck’s constant, h]. The probabilities
occurring in the new laws have then to be considered to be primary, which means not
deducible from deterministic [causal] laws. As an example of these primary probabilities
I mention here the fact that the time at which an individual atom will undergo a certain
reaction stays undetermined even under conditions where the rate of occurrence of this
reaction for a large collection of atoms is practically certain. [46, p. 32]

Pauli speaks of determinism rather than causality, but this does not affect my argument because,
as explained earlier, in the case of classical mechanics both notions coincide. Most important is


Pauli’s main claim: ‘The theory predicts only the statistics of the results of an experiment, when
it is repeated under a give condition. Like the ultimate fact without any cause, the individual
outcome of a measurement is, however, in general not comprehended by laws’. Given that
Pauli does not specify otherwise, this appears to include probabilistic or, in this view, statistical
laws of quantum mechanics. Indeed, he corroborates this reading elsewhere in the context of
complementarity: ‘In the general case of the quantum-mechanical state of a material particle,
neither the position nor the momentum is predictable with certainty; in consequence the state
can be described only by statistical statements about the distribution of values of the results of
possible measurements of position or momentum of this state. Formally these statements are
embraced symbolically in a wave function, consisting of a real and an imaginary part’ [46, p. 99]
(Pauli’s emphasis). This point has a major implication, which leads to the statistical (Copenhagen)
interpretation I am about to offer.

In this interpretation, primitive individual quantum processes and events are not only beyond =
