stage, and, in this specimen at least, the orbitar process is less marked. If the position
: of this pair of cartilages be considered, it will be seen that they well illustrate the s0-called
palatal cartilages (+ Gaumenknorpel ”) of Narcine (MULLER, op. cit. plate 5. figs. 3 & 4, e)
and the azygous palatal cartilage (< unpaariger Gaumenknorpel ”) of the Sturgeon (op.
cit. plate 9. figs. 10 & 11, 6). It is the top part, the inturned outspread apex of the arch,
which is segmented off in Narcine on each side ; in Acipenser it is evident that these
segments early coalesced to form the © azygous metapterygoid”*. It is perfectly normal
that the facial arches should #ur% #2 and flatten out at their apex; those the least spe-
cialized, the gill-arches, constantly do this, and the substitution for gill-papillee of small
teeth is a very gentle change and superaddition of function. Certainly the foremost
arches are subject to most modification ; but even the outbowing of the trabeculee is per-
fectly normal, and their hooked apices only enclose the pituitary body because of its
contiguity ; the hooking was a morphological fact before any such relation was brought
about by specializing growth. As to the segmentation of the mandibular arch in Narcine
and Acipenser, let the reader compare their metapterygoid segment, just referred to in
MVLLER's work, with his plate of the Chimera's sﬆkull (op. cit. plate 5. fig. 2, ggg), and
ee how in that type the © pharyngo-branchials” are segmented off to form outspread,
smooth, arched roof-plates to the pharynx; thus the order, harmony, and simplicity
