in 1871, all traces of the blue and red rings disappear, and the green one is only
2, visible so long as there is a special green radiation.

These experiments suggest that the very broad blue and red rings recorded by
Respicut in 1871 are possibly not conclusive evidence that the H, and H, radiations
of hydrogen were very strong in the spectrum of the corona, as rings strikingly
= resembling them can be produced by a continuous spectrum alone when viewed with
© similar instrumental conditions. At the same time no such doubt is thrown upon
4% my own observations of narrow rings which were made with the dispersion of five
"prisms, as false rings of red and blue light are not seen under these conditions. The
red and blue hydrogen rings, as I saw them in 1871, were about 2’ high, and
bright compared with 1474 K; my observations were made earlier in the eclipse
than those of Respi¢ut, to which reference is made above, but the fact that I did not

“= sphere and prominences, Hydrogen was, therefore, certainly present in the corona
Fi of 1871 to a height of about 2’, but the observations suggesting its spectroscopic
visibility at a greater height are not conclusive.

With regard to the photograph of 1875, in which H, was definitely ascribed by
Dr. Scuuster and myself to the corona, the absence of corona rings corresponding to
H and K, which are the strongest lines of the chromosphere and prominences, appears
to support the idea that the H, ring was not due to chromosphere or prominences.
A photograph of the artificial corona, illuminated by an incandescent lamp, under
instrumental conditions closely approximating to those employed in 1875, shows only
a hazy ring near H,, corresponding to the region of maximum sensitiveness of the
