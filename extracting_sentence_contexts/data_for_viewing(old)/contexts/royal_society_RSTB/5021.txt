Again, when the complete section is examined it will be seen that there is sufficient
evidence in it to demonstrate the controlling influence of a wound, not only on the
resin canals produced by it, but on those formed by preceding ones. In the years
just before the wound figured there are scattered resin canals. Had this wound not
oceurred it is only reasonable to infer that there would have been a continuation of
the scattered arrangement in the extensive region where consolidation into one
tangential series has been effected. It would thus appear not only that the wound
stimulus can persist, but that it can be added to and co-ordinated with that of a later
wound.

Though the radial persistence and tangential spread of the response to a wound are
sufficiently striking, the vertical extent is even more so. When the wound year
(third year from the outside) in the sections above and below is examined, the fact
that the effect can extend for several years in both directions will be clear. For instance,

No. 6 has twenty-two annual rings and No, 4 ten, and yet the evidences of traumaticism
are clear in both, more so in the latter than in the former; but this appearance may be
accentuated by the exigencies of the diagram, the canals having been represented by
the same sized dots, and the circumference being less. However, an examination with
the microscope shows that the tangential arrangement of the series in the two is about
the same, and it is for this reason that we chose these sections for illustration. The
upper section is seven years above the wound and the lower one five below it, the wound
