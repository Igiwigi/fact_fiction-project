oremium on representation of entrainment; as a by-product, it makes column
water vapour—for which we have abundant observations—a good indicator of
conditions conducive to convection. While important for revising convective
schemes, the issues of vertical structure are less fundamental to the principle of QE
han are the following considerations, which suggest a reinterpretation of QE.

A number of these features are illustrated in figure 8, which overlays a
schematic of the observed features on the empirically determined critical surface
or column water vapour as a function of temperature from figure 5b. The sharp
oickup in precipitation at a particular set of values of temperature and moisture
corresponds qualitatively to the original QE postulate. Interpreting precipitation
as our observable for strong convection and dissipation of buoyancy and allowing
or the fact that we have expressed our diagram with different temperature- and
moisture-related variables, there is a qualitative correspondence to Arakawa’s
diagram 1a for the original QE postulate.

However, as argued in Peters & Neelin (2006), the empirical properties of the
onset of convection correspond closely to properties of a continuous phase
transition. This implies that the transition associated with QE is inseparable
from a number of important statistical properties.

— The ensemble-average precipitation does not increase linearly with the
distance from criticality. With a functional form like equation (4.1), there
would not be a single convective time scale as in a linear relationship.
