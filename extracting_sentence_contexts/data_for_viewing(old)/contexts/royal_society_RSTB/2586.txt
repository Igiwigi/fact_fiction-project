SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF THE MADREPORARIAN TYPES OF CORALS. 105

Again, a certain sameness runs through the external macroscopic features of most
of the Madreporarian genera, which happen to be well represented in Jurassic strata.
The genus can, as a rule, only be identified with certainty after a careful microscopic
investigation. Many genera erected by FRoMENTEL cannot be criticised or made use
of because of the want of such data. Again, one finds in some authors the habit of
the corallum outweighing any considerations of fine structure. Under the genus
“ Lotimeandra,” as many varieties of Madreporarian types are hidden at the present
day as could ever have been attributed to the name of “ Madrepora” in the earliest
works on corals.

In short I found myself face to face with the fact that the genera and families of
Epwarps and Haims were no longer quite in touch with more recent work, and yet
no recent work gave any general standard of research. The literature seemed split up
into ever so many factions, The only hopeful prospect seemed to be in microscopic
work, and that I determined to do before publishing my monograph of the Stramberg
fauna.

The collection of St. Cassian corals which I had myself made offered a number of
specimens in admirable state of preservation. Besides, these corals being of Triassic
age had a particular phylogenetic interest attached to them.

Dr. Horer, Custos of the Zoological Collection in Munich, kindly handed over to
me several recent corals which he had collected from the Red Sea. These were then
