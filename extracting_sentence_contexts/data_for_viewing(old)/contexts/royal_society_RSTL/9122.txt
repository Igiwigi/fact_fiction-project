without irrelevant assumptions, can possibly be constructed—the system to the base «®,
based on the hypothesis that in chemical transformations the unit of hydrogen is an
© undistributed ” or © simple weight,” and the system to the base @?, based on the as8umP-
tion that the unit of hydrogen is constituted of two simple weights into which that unit
is distributed in those transformations. These systems are mutually exclusive, and
cannot both be true. Now we are not in a position to assert that the one of these
systems is true and the other false. If 80, one 8ystem would be applicable and the other
inapplicable to the facts, and in the construction of our system we should get rid of
hypothesis altogether. Tt is rarely, however, indeed that in any case 8uch a scientific
construction is practicable. But failing this, and admitting the inadequacy of our
information, we may till ask, can we give a reasonable preference to the one or the
other system ? Even this might be out of our power. To what extent, too, is this
preference to be carried? These are questions of probable reasoning which must be
left to the judgment of individuals; but if we are to assume these questions to be decided
before we begin to consider them, we may as well not consider them at all.

I may first observe, that the two systems are not at the outset placed upon a precisely
equal footing ; for it is certain that in a very large proportion of chemical events the
