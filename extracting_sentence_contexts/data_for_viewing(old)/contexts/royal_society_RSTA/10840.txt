very interesting barographie tracing, which shows repeated oscillations of the recording

Mr. O’DonneE LL, of the American Weather Bureau, states that, on May 7, “a sudden
jar occurred in the barograph record at the time of the explosion.”

Here also we may mention that in St. Vincent similar rapid changes in barometric
pressure were noticed by at least one observer, Mr. ErrincHam Dun, of Owia. He
writes as follows :—‘*On May 7 the barometer (mercurial), which had been steady at
29°85, rose within three minutes to 30°12, when it again fell slowly to 29°82, and
remained steady at that throughout the night. This is the only change I observed,
though I paid great attention to the barometer.”

Considerable air-waves appear, in fact, to have been generated by everyone
of the greater eruptions, both of the Soufrire and Montagne Pelée. Rapid rise and
fall of the barometric column have been noted in Martinique to accompany
several of the eruptions there. The outburst at Pelée on the 9th July produced

a distinct vibration of the recording pen of the barograph in the American
Weather Bureau, in Rozeau, Dominica, as was shown to us by Mr. Hopps, who
was in charge of the station. He told us also that in the observatory in St. Kitts
similar effects had been traceable in the barographs on the days of. several other |
eruptions. In every case the air-pressure was temporarily increased by the appearance
