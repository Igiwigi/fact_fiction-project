walls, accounting for the diverse nature of crystal cargo in MORB. Plagioclase crystals along the
channel margin may align, forming foliations and lineations in the surrounding mush.

The integrated end result of these various processes is the extraction of melts that are relatively
homogeneous in terms of major elements (particularly of rapidly diffusing elements, e.g. Fe-Mg,
figure 3), have a cryptic fractionation signature and carry a clear signature of magma mixing.
However, magma mixing is accomplished in a very different way from that classically assumed
to occur in melt-rich magma chambers: it occurs between melt-rich bodies and the interstitial
melts of the crystal mush as melts are emplaced, segregated and transported by channelized
flow. Ultimately, this leads to trace element distributions that are incompatible with fractional
crystallization: the more incompatible elements are over-enriched.

We conclude that the fact that the mid-ocean ridge plumbing system is dominated by crystal
mush has a number of fundamental implications for the behaviour and evolution of the system
as a whole. Because all of the underlying processes are governed by physical processes, and
by the chemical response of the system to these physical processes, we anticipate that the
results described herein are inherent to the evolution of crystal mushes in general, irrespective
of geodynamic setting. As such, the mid-ocean ridge system can serve as a useful template for
trans-crustal mush columns elsewhere.
