been in the highest state of efficiency; I do not think that there is the least doubt on
the indications of any disturbed day. And (as the effect of adjustments made expressly
for that purpose) the traces of the most violent motions are in general perfectly pre-
served—an adyantage which is possessed, I believe in a peculiar degree, by the photo-
grams of the Royal Observatory. Some sheets may be lost from defects in the paper,
defects in the chemical process, &c.; but none, I believe, from rapidity and violence of
motion of the magnets. The indications for every salient point of the curyes haye been
translated into numbers which are printed in the © Results of Magnetical Observations ”
for each year; and those numbers are used as the basis of the following calculations,
For the years 1841-1847, in which obseryations were made by eye, it will be seen in
the printed Observations that no opportunity was lost, on the slightest appearance of
disturbance, of following most carefully the indications of all the magnetometers : and
in fact, as regards both the number of days of such observations and the number of

observations on each day, the observations taken are far more numerous than was neces-
sary. The judgment of the Superintendent has been exercised in making such a selec-
tion of days and such a limitation of records for each day as should make the adopted
register for the period 1841-1847 harmonize well with that for the period 1848-1857.

In the following investigations, whenever one instrument has exhibited 8uch 8igns of
