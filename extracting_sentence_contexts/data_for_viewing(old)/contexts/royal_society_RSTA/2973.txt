[40,41], Jammazi [20], Vacha & Barunik [21], Alvarez-Ramirez et al. [42] and Aguiar-Conraria et al.
[43] provide economic applications using these tools. The field is growing and it is now impossible
to keep track of all papers applying CWT to economic data. Verona [44], Flor & Klarl [45] and
Bekiros et al. [46] are just three nice examples among dozens that could be given. For a person
seeking intuition on CWT, the political science applications of Aguiar-Conraria et al. [47,48] are
good starting points.

(a) Continuous wavelet transform

Time-scale wavelets are characterized in reference to a mother wavelet, w(f), a function of a real
variable t. For a function to qualify to be a mother wavelet it has to satisfy a certain admissibility
condition which, in practice, amounts to requiring that the function integrates to zero and also
has fast decay towards zero. The fact that y tends quickly to zero means that we can view it as a
window function; on the other hand, demanding that y integrates to zero implies that y must be
oscillatory, enabling us to associate a certain frequency to this function.

The mother wavelet w provides a source function for generating a family of daughter wavelets,
Wz; these functions are obtained from the mother by performing two operations, scaling by s and
translation by t:

j= ty (4 R, 40
heal = aw (), s,tER, s#0.

The scaling parameter s controls the width of the wavelet and the translation parameter t controls
the location of the wavelet along the t-axis. For |s| > 1, the windows w;,; become larger (hence,
