definition of w on the Q contour. The factor i is introduced for algebraic convenience.

By the principle of superposition it follows that when the time variation of the source is
not as ei but as H(t), the corresponding ‘total’ displacement potential is given by

In order to separate the x, z occurring here in the combination a, we use an extension by
Lapwood (1949, p. 67) of a result of Lamb (1904, p. 4) and write
