In attempting to determine the place now occupied by the “ fine ” vessels in the
general scheme of vascularisation of the tissues, the first essential is to establish with as
much accuracy as possible their connections with every other member of the vascular
system. Relations between the fine”’ vessels and the blood vascular system : veins.—Connection
between the * fine ’ vessels and the veins might occur in one of three ways: directly,
as venous factors, by anastomosis between branches, through a common capillary net-
work. ‘There is no evidence to show that the “fine ’’ vessels are venous factors. Apart
from the fact that both veins and “fine” vessels are distributed to the same areas,
injection of the veins never fills any part of the “ fine’ system. For the same reason
it would appear that there is no anastomotic connection. It is true that in one or two instances injection thrown into the “ fine’ system has
found its way in small quantity into the jugular and inferior jugular veins ; but in these
particular instances the “ fine ” vessel injection was more than usually complete and
the injection was found only in those parts of the veins situated near the lymphatic-
venous junctions and there is little doubt that the intrusion into the veins took place
by way of the lymphatics (see below).
