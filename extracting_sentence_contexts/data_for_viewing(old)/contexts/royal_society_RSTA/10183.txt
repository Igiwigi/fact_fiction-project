* It may also be observed that, in the four experiments under discussion, the rate at which the
hydrogen disappeared was practically the same, viz. about 28 to 30 per cent. during the first hour in

each case. This clearly proves that excess of oxygen per se has no effect, accelerating or otherwise, on the
rate of combination.

58 DR. W. A. BONE AND MR. R. V. WHEELER ON THE COMBINATION OF

alternating reductions and oxidations of the material composing the surface, it follows
from the facts brought to light in the above experiments (1) that the rate of reduction
of the surface by hydrogen at 200° must be excessively small compared with its rate
of re-oxidation by oxygen, and (2) that the rate of combination with electrolytic gas
must be comparable with the rate of reduction of the surface by hydrogen. That
these conditions were not fulfilled will be seen from the following group of
experiments :—
2nd Group.

Normal electrolytic gas was circulated at 200° over the material (which for some
weeks previously had not been in use) until a constant rate of combination was
attained. The two following determinations of the rate for normal electrolytic gas
were then made :—
