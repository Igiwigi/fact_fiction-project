somites arise almost simultaneously, a close series of stages shows that they rarely if ever
appear quite simultaneously, and P. sedgwicki and the species shown in figure 5a to d
clearly show no distinction between the time or the manner of origin of the first few somites.

The multiple origin of the coelomic spaces of the anterior somites of P. moseleyi, P. capensis,
etc., is no evidence that such a somite represents the mesodermal components of more than
one segment. The initial cavities are variable in numbers and in position, and the somite
once established with its large single cavity is clearly homologous with the somites in similar

positions in the species where the initial cavity is single. This fact is of theoretical importance
(see discussion p. 556).

The cutting off of each somite from the mesodermal band usually occurs relatively earlier
in the more posterior somites in all species, so that separate solid blocks appear first and
their cavities develop immediately after (figures 26, 45 and 46, plates 32 and 34). However,
exceptions occur, and one embryo of P. moseleyi at the stage shown in figure 45 has been
found with only traces of coelomic spaces in the posterior seven or eight pairs of somites,
while the anterior seven pairs show large cavities. The condition here of the posterior somites
resembles the more frequent almost simultaneous development of cavities in the anterior
four or five pairs of somites. As the cavities of the somites increase in size their walls become
one cell thick, as in figure 58, plate 36. Against the endoderm they become thinner, but
remain thick against the ectoderm as shown by Sedgwick.
