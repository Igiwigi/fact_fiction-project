NicrioLson points out that the “theca,” in the case of Zaphrentids, is probably of
epithecal nature.



262 DR. MARIA M. OGILVIE ON THE MICROSCOPIC AND

Comparing now Cyathophyllum with a recent Astreid, the homologies of parts at
once allow the broad outer peripheral dise beyond the inner tabulate area of Cyatho-
phyllum to be recognized as the representative of the “costal” area beyond the so-
called theca of Astreids, We are familiar with the fact that the aboral polypal body-
wall extends over this costal area of an Astrid and, doubling on itself, becomes then
the oval, or peristomal, body-wall, which is continued as the stomodseal wall, The
extracalycinal, or costal portion of the Astraeid skeleton, corresponds with the
“ Randplatte,” or edge-zone (vide antea, fig. 2), of the polypal flesh, and it will be
remembered that the mesenteries, in Astraids, are continued from the visceral chamber
into the edge-zone. Looking back in the history of Astraid and Fungid evolution, it becomes all but
self-apparent that the origin of the polyp’s “ edge-zone” is to be found in that part of
the primitive Cyathophyllid polyp which clothed the “peripheral dise,” @e., the
digsepimental zone of the skeleton around the inner tabulate area. Moreover, we
find that the epitheca bears exactly the same relation to the septa in both Astreid
and Cyathophyllid.
