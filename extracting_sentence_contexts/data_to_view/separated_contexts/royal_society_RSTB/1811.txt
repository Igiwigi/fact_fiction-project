68 PROFESSOR F. 0. BOWER ON THE MORPHOLOGY

they show occasional abstrictions. These facts plainly correspond to those well known
in Leptosporangiate ferns; as in them, so here, it should be recognised that the
circumscribed sorus is only the prevalent, not the exclusive type, while in the
Marattiacece it is the fossils which supply the less definite examples. On the question
of origin of the definite sorus, Srur (loc. cit., p. 792), after remarking that types with
solitary sporangia lived simultaneously with those in which sporangia are united into
true sori, proceeds (p. 793) to state that “ Hapalopteris is move recent than Senften-
bergia,” that is, “the species with solitary sporangia are older than those in which
the sporangia appear gathered in irregular groups.” I do not think that this can be
accepted as a general statement of a morphological progression. It appears to be
based upon observation of two genera only, important and early though they certainly
are.
