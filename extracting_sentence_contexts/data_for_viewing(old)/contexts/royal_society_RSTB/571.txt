(2) The author also affirms that the pelvic arch is identical in structure with that
of the Anomodontia, and is considered to resemble Hehidna.

(3) In the limb bones reference is made to the possible presence of epiphyses in
Pelycosauria. I have found epiphyses to be well developed in the limb bones of
Anomodonts. The humerus is said to resemble that of Echidna, but the nature of
the resemblance is not stated.

The Pelycosauria.

There are few data for judging of the systematic value of the Pelycosauria. But
in view of the fact that the Anomodontia was originally made to include animals
which are allied to the Pelycosauria, supposing that group to be well founded, it seems
more in accordance with usage to class those animals among the Anomodonts than to
