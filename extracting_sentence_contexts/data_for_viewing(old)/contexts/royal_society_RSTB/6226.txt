however, p. 189 above). Very few abortions were observed. During the same
experiments it was also noticed that submorsitans produces more puparia at a relative
humidity of 11% than at 44%. For purposes of comparison it is convenient to
standardize the birth-rate and reduce it to puparia per 100 female-days ; the facts
for the two species are shown in Tables V and VI. In these tables the production
of puparia is given in five-day periods, ¢ signifying the mean number of females
alive during that period, the number of larve or puparia produced, and 4 the
number of births per 100 female-days. Table V deals with tachinoides. It will be
seen that at 88°, humidity, no reproduction occurred in the single experiment.
Four experiments were started at 65° humidity, but no females lived long enough
to reach reproductive age. At 44°, humidity reproduction was active in each of
the three cages, and the mean birth-rate (6) is three times that for 19% humidity

TasLe VI—Showing the production of puparia by Glossina submorsitans kept at 30° C
(86-0° F) under controlled conditions of humidity, and fed daily. Each
cage originally contained 15 females. ¢ signifies the mean number of females
