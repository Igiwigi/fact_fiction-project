This, however, applies only to small specimens of the
leafy terminal branches. It is, however, possible that leaves of different types were
really produced on the same species of plant, and that the differences were due
either to the position or age of the leafy twig or to the physical conditions of
growth. Beyond the fact that the leaves on thicker stems were always larger and
more numerous there is little evidence on this point. The question can only be
settled by the collection and examination of a great number of larger and more
complete specimens than those which we have hitherto had at our disposal. It is
quite possible, too, that the leaves on the stems bearing cones had a slightly
different structure from the young foliage leaves, but here, again, many more
specimens are needed.
