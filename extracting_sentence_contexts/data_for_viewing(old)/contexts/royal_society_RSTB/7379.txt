tissue in the septa, there is a clear discordance between these two kinds of structure.
I believe it is partly this structure that led the old authors to speak of primary septum and
secondary stereoplasm. It would seem justified, in these forms, to apply the term secondary
thickening. However, in the entirely lamellar type of skeleton, no layer that is subsequently
added to the septa would show any trace of discontinuity or discordance. The same applies
to the fibro-lamellar type. In both these types it is impossible to distinguish between the
primary and secondary skeleton, although the skeleton may be markedly thicker in one
part than in another. The essential point is that, during the upward movement of the polyp,
those parts that linger behind, mostly in interseptal loculi, sometimes retain active skeletal
secretion and continue to add layers to the surrounding hard parts. If such parts happen
to be in the form of hanging pockets, the result would be an enclosed pit lined all round by
lamellar tissue. This is not infrequent in Dinophyllum and Amplexus with lamellar tissue, and
in Caninia and Dibunophyllum (figure 17, plate 5) with fibro-lamellar tissue. The fact that
thick septa do not occur in the peripheral region of such corals as Phaulactis and Bothro-
phyllum, is simply due to the cutting off of the polypal parts in this region by the continuously
forming dissepiments.

Looked upon thus, it is only natural that excessive dilatation of trabeculae is compara-
tively rare and limited. For the trabeculae originate at the top of the polypal invagination,
while any soft parts left behind at lower levels are likely to assume the more primitive
function of secreting lamellar tissue.
