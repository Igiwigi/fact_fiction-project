Another focus for
future work will be to study other physical mechanisms that may lead to state-dependent delays

in the ENSO system. For example, a contributing factor to the delay times of the DAO paradigm : =
is the position of the zone of ocean-atmosphere coupling in the central Pacific Ocean, which is : =
closely associated with the western Pacific warm-pool. In fact, a state-dependent DDE for the 1B
position of the western Pacific warm-pool has already been suggested in [91], but has not yet been :2
analysed in much detail. Finally, it will be of practical relevance to study the effect of atmospheric 8
noise on the ENSO behaviour in DDE models with state-dependent delay. : o
