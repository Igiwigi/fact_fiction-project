It remains to provide an estimate of the quantities f(¢, 7) and g(¢, «) in D=3 and for y=4,

which is a consequence of the self-consistency of equations (3.132) and (3.182). For this, we use a

trick for evaluating integrals [39] in dynamics from a renormalization group standpoint. This

involves exploiting the fact that we are interested in wavenumbers ‘k’ that are much smaller

than the viscous dissipation scale and hence evaluate the integrals to the lowest order in k’.
Accordingly, equation (3.12) simplifies to

To evaluate the integral in equation (3.16), it is simplest to write it in frequency space and carry
