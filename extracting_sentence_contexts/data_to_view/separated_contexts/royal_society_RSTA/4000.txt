Although in fundamental physics the central significance of local symmetry is a relatively
recent discovery, artists in many cultures have employed it for millennia, especially in decorative
art. In such art [9], one often finds large-scale patterns built up from symmetric shapes, such as
equilateral triangles, squares and circles. The symmetry of such objects arises from the fact that we
can rotate them through appropriate angles around their centres, without changing their overall
form. But of course each object in the pattern has its own distinct centre, and so to realize the full


symmetry we must allow transformations of space that vary from place to place. Many design
patterns also employ transformations of colour, as well as shape, whose symmetry is local.

(d) Weyl’s gauge symmetry
(i) Gauge symmetry as geometry

The historical origin of the term ‘gauge’ in gauge theory, and of several important ideas in modern
physics, is an incorrect geometric theory of electromagnetism proposed by Hermann Weyl in
1918.
