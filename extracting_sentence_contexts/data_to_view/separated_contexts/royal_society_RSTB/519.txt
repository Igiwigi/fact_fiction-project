Nor was it as ammonia,
as a direct experiment with a rich peaty soil, enclosed under a luted bell jar, and
ammonia free air passed through it, showed very little ammonia evolved. He points
out that the more imperfect the ventilation of the soil, the less was the gain; and he
considers it probable that in the absence of ventilation the evolution of free nitrogen
would be enhanced. In fact the losses were greater in experiments 2 and 3 with
vessels 80 cm. (= 31°5 in.) deep, and only 11 cm, (= 4°3 in.)
