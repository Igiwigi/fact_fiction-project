"This experiment is still more striking when made on a strip of the long muscle of the
spine of a living rabbit ; the surface and transverse section of this muscle may be touched
with the plates of the galvanometer s0 as to have a muscular stratum interposed of either
$ to 10 or 70 to 80 millimetres. The current in the second case is eight or ten times
greater than in the former. This experiment recalls that made on the electric organ of the
Gymnotus or the 'Torpedo, by employing strata of various lengths of this organ. I think.
that, notwithstanding our ignorance as to the form of the electromotive element of
muscles, this proposition leads us to believe that muscular fibre acts as a reunion or
8eries of electromotive elements.

This proposition furnishes a clear explanation of several important facts of muscular
electricity. The first of these facts is, that a differential current takes place constantly on
closing the circuit with the gastrocnemius of a frog united with its half-thigh, the current
being determined by the gastrocnemins. The experiment succeeds equally, if, instead of
leaving the tendon attached to the gastrocnemius, the latter is cut transyersely: in all cases
it is essential that one of the muscles be longer than the other, so that either the gastro-
enemius or the half-thigh may predominate. The same result may be obtained by employ-
ing a prepared frog reduced to two half-thighs of unequal length attached to a piece of
the spine.

This same proposition leads us to explain the fact discovered by M. Du Bots REYMOND,
namely, that a current is obtained by touching with the plates of the galvanometer
the central points and the edge of the same transverse section of a large muscle. In
fact, the central points belong to the longest muscular fibres, and therefore play the same
