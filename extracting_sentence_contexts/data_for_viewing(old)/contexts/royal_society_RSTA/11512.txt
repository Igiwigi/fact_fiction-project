that called for convenience temple C in fig. 2. It was here that the extremely archaic
sculptures, now in the museum at Palermo, were found, representing Hercules carrying
off the Cercopian giants, to which the date 795 seems as consistent as anything
subsequent to 628 would be.
The orientation of this temple C shows that about an hour before the sun rose
upon the axis, « Arietis was setting heliacally towards the West, nearly two cen-
turies before the date of the Hellenic colonization of the city. When, however, the
newcomers took possession, they would have found that the siar had ceased to serve the
purpose it was intended to fulfil, and accordingly it would appear that a new temple, D,
was built closely adjoining it to the North at an angle sufliciently inclined to follow
the star. The calculated date of this new work is eighteen years after the coming of
the Hellenes. From the star « Arietis being thus connected with the orientation,
it may be inferred that these two temples were dedicated to Jupiter. The fact that
the achievements of Hercules had formed the subject of the metopes of the earlier
temple by no means invalidates the supposition that the temple itself may have been
so dedicated. The temple A falls well in the Hellenic period, and the architectural
character, both of this and of temple D, appears to be in keeping with the astronomic
dates. Temple B is extremely small, and is apparently parallel to the neighbouring
temple C, but I did not examine it particularly. Of the group of temples on the
Eastern hill I was unable from want of time to secure the orientations with sufficient
exactness to justify my giving final elements. The angles, however, are approxi-
mately as below :—
