Ficure 31. Near the base of the isolated primordium; m, meristele of parental shoot; /Ã©, leaf-trace
consisting of several meristeles; the vascular tissue is not yet differentiated into phloem and
xylem.

Ficure 32. Higher up, showing the solenostele of the axillary bud d.

Ficure 33. Higher up than figure 32; the base of the first leaf P, of the bud can be seen.

Ficure 34. Just below the apex of the bud; the vascular tissue of the parental leaf p has faded out.
P, stands in an approximately normal phyllotactic relation to p. (Semi-diagrammatic, x 40.)

Although isolated leaf primordia are capable of further growth, this is usually inextensive ;
active growth, in fact, becomes localized in the axillary bud. This bud growth is in marked
contrast to that in normal plants; there the bud has only a small protostelic strand passing
through the cortex of the parent plant, whereas in the materials under consideration the
bud may be solenostelic from the outset, and may soon become dictyostelic, e.g. figures
35 to 37.

In another experiment six leaves, i.e. P, to Py, were isolated as already described. In
each instance an axillary, or approximately axillary, bud developed, the parental leaf
