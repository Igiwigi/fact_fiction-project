the hypoblast is in section, showing clearly the character of its
cells and their arrangement. In fig. 23 its somewhat irregular outgrowths (hy) are
8een, and their relation to groups of the branched mesoblastic corpuscles,

The most important fact shown by these two drawings is the arrangement of certain
of the mesoblastic branched corpuscles (me) in strings or groups, binding, as it were,
others of the cells into groups. The large cells (z) of these figures are not distinguish-
able in form and character from the epiblastic cells in immediate contact with which
they lie, and from which, with little doubt, they have been derived. They apparently
furnish the primitive elements of the foot; but whether they are to be considered
distinctly as mesoblastic elements or as epiblastic I cannot decide.
