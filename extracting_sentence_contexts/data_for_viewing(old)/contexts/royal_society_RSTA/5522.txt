the natural senses. For example, a person in the future using an artificial eye lens, an
electronic one could see ultraviolet and/or infrared. A fireman, or a worker in a foundry,
may have a competitive edge if they could see the temperature of an object. A pilot may
be better off if one can see through fog. The quest to overcome physical disabilities is
pushing towards solutions that will eventually create physical augmentation. In the case
of exoskeletons, designed to help people with paralyses, these are now being used by the
military and assembly line workers to provide extra strength and to relieve fatigue. This
is another example of augmentation.

— Mentally augmented humans: the quest to overcome mental disabilities, like
communication impairment, forgetfulness, results in technology and systems that,
eventually, will augment human capabilities. Technologies like deep brain stimulation
and optogenetics are still closer to science fiction than science in terms of concrete
applications for mental augmentation. They are used in experiments with animals and
deep brain stimulation, and in some trials for reducing symptoms of Parkinson disease.

It will take several more years before these, or new technologies result in seamless mental
augmentation. Brain-computer interfaces are also being used, most of the time in communication
from the brain to a machine like controlling a robotic arm.”

Even without taking into consideration ‘potential’ but science fiction-like technologies, the
trend towards human augmentation is accelerating. Natural language interfaces on the one
