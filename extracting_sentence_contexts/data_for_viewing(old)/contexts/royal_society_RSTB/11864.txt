ecology, environmental science All life depends on water. Since water is scarce in drylands, rivers are the most
dominant factor shaping the ecology of these environments including people
[1]. Drylands occupy around 40% of the world’s land mass and host over

desert rivers, salinization, ecosystem functions, ogy of dryland rivers compared with their temperate counterparts [4-6].
freshwater management Intermittency is often found in these rivers, meaning that they cease to flow

or dry out for variable periods of time at differing locations [7]. Only recently
several publications have called for increased research efforts on such intermit-
tent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES), partially driven by the fact that their
occurrence is expected to increase as many parts of the world have become

their temperate counterparts, dryland rivers, both perennial and intermittent,
are under extreme pressure from artificial flow modifications (e.g. dams for
irrigation, water retention or power generation, water abstraction, and channe-
lization for shipping), exotic species introductions, waste-disposal effluents
from households and industry, changes in catchment land-use (e.g. agriculture
and mining) and climate change [8-10]. These factors contribute variously to
changes in water physico-chemistry including salinization—the focus of this
special issue. In semiarid and arid regions, rivers and streams are often natu-
rally saline owing to underlying geology and high evaporation; however,
irrigation agriculture is one of the main causes of secondary, i.e. anthropogenic,
