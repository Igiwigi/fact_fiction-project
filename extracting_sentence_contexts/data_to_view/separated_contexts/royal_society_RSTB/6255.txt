To take an individual cell and to hope to
define the exact regions of the cytoplasm where certain inorganic elements are located after incinera-
tion is not to be expected ; only approximate results on a few of the inorganic constituents of
protoplasm can be obtained. The ease with which ions may migrate from one portion of a cell to
another during any type of histological fixation, except possibly with the freezing-drying procedure,
is sufficient to justify extreme caution. After incineration, the identification of individual ions in the ash rests, at present, on a few simple
chemical tests and a series of assumptions based upon the colour of the ash deposit as seen principally
by dark ground illumination, Chemically speaking, the colour values indicate little apart from the
fact that thick clumps of ash, containing calcium, are likely to be whitish in appearance and may be
mixed with traces of magnesium, silicon, and aluminium. Relatively large concentrations of iron
may impart a reddish hue of iron oxide to ash in which it is mixed. This iron can be seen readily
in the developing nervous system of the chick, as described by Horninc and Scorr (1932).
