enforced confinement within the membrane may have been the cause of the arrest of
development at this stage. The main reason for supposing this striking abnormality
in Phallusia development to be due to lack of pressure from the notochord cells rather
than the non-extensibility of the ectoderm is that in all known cases where the latter
occurs, 7.e., Corella, Phallusia and Ascidiella, it has been found in all degrees, 2.e.,
varying from almost perfect larve to those with little sign of a tail. In this other
Phallusia type either a fairly typical tadpole was formed or else completely inhibited,
while, moreover, no sign of notochord cells could be seen, either as individual cells or
as a somewhat bulging mass.

Tf this interpretation is correct, and there is a tendency in Phallusia, at least, to
produce anural embryos, since it seems to involve an inactivity of the hatching enzyme,
the fact that the outgrowth of ectodermal ampulle and test in this form is invariably
ineffective as an alternative hatching mechanism may be sufficient to keep it a rarity.

5(d). OccuRRENCE oF ANURAL DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE TUNICATA.

The tailed larval stage has been eliminated completely from the development of
Salpa and Pyrosoma, and modified in the case of Doliolum, but as far as the Ascidiacee
are concerned, no instance of its suppression is known outside the Molgulide. The
distribution among ascidians of tailed and tailless larvee is shown in Table VI, and it
will be seen that the whole ten species with anural development out of the total of
135 is confined to the Molgulidee. The number of species of known development for
each family is probably sufficiently large to be representative, with the exception of
the Pyuride. Naturally, a typically viviparous order as the Aplousobranchia is much
