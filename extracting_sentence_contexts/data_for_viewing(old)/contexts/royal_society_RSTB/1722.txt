# have been able to trace the transition in one and the same stem of Lyginodendron
3 from the small pith and continuous xylem of the basal portion to the large pith and
8 separate bundles of the upper stem, our suggestion must remain an hypothesis. In
the mean time, however, it may serve as a provisional explanation, which is in
harmony of what we know of the development of those recent Ferns which in their
anatomy most nearly resemble our fossil. The fact that Lyginodendron had
_ secondary growth in thickness, while the Ferns with which we have compared it
haye not, does not invalidate the comparison. We have good reason to believe that
the secondary thickening in Lyginodendron and its allies was relatively a recently-
