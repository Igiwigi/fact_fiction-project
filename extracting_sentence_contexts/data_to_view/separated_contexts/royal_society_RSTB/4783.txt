I need hardly say that no importance is to be attached
to the precise number of cataclysms taken and the (very large) proportion of the then-
existing species killed-out by each: the scheme is simply so arranged as to illustrate
the effect of very different time-incidences of destruction. Of the four columns on the right of Table XV, the first gives the number of species
killed-out. The second shows a chance that I have termed for brevity in the heading
the chance of a species surviving for 10 million years : it is, in fact, the tenth-root of the
chance of a species surviving for the whole period of 100 million years, which we have
assumed is the time elapsed since the genesis of the flowering plants. If p is the chance
of surviving 10 million years, p’ is the chance of surviving 20 million years under the same
conditions, 7° the chance of surviving 30 million years, and so on: since p'° in several
of the examples is vanishingly small, it is more convenient to give p. The third column
gives the doubling-period, and the fourth the present rate of production of specific
mutations.
