We show the absolute
values for the reference REF simulation and the relative values with respect to REF for all other :
model simulations. We have computed these maps for all months but choose here to only show :=

August. This choice is motivated first by the fact that August has the largest differences between Sy
the different sensitivity model runs in our study and also because August sea ice concentration is 2
often underestimated in current sea ice models [58]. aed

Comparing first REF, MLD_CST and MLD_MIN_2M, we see that switching off the prognostic 22
ML results in a large increase in ice concentration (A > +10%, figure 8) and decrease in the ML : Ss
temperature (Tinix < —0.4°C, figure 10) over most of the eastern Arctic Ocean (where A < 80%, : s
figure 8). Reducing the value of the minimum ML depth (to hmix =2m) has the opposite effect : Ss
and results in a large decrease in concentration (A < —10%, figure 8) and increase in the ML 15

temperature (Tix > +0.4°C) over the same region. The impact on ice thickness is more diffuse,
with a homogeneous increase in the mean ice thickness (+10 cm-25 cm, figure 9) over most of the
Arctic basin for MLD_CST and a corresponding increase in the ML salinity (more than +2 PSU,
figure 11).
