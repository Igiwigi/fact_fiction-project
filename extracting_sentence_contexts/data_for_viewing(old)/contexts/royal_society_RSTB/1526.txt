same time, so that the most varying results are obtained; at one moment the one
jerk appears to be the greater, at another moment the other. So that it is only by
long, careftl, and repeated observations that it becomes possible to venture on an
opinion as to which knee-jerk is really the more active. Making all allowances for
the difficulties which have to be overcome and fallacies to be guarded against, I am
left with the impression that the knee-jerk on the side of the divided peduncle is
greater than that on the opposite side ; but I make the statement with great reserve,
as, in the face of such difficulties, it is impossible to make a positive statement in this
connection.

Disorders of Sensibility.â€”Vhe extreme difticulty of testing sensation in animals, or
rather of coming to definite conclusions with regard to the presence or absence of
cutaneous sensibility, makes it important that we should only record those facts with
regard to which there appears to be no question. In dogs I find it most difficult to

be certain with regard to sensibility to tactile and thermal impressions, while there is
very little difficulty in ascertaining accurately the condition as regards painful
impressions, I therefore prefer to limit my observations at present to the state of
sensibility to painful impressions. In testing this a metallic clip was used, of such
strength as to be objected to by normal animals in a manner which left no room for
doubt as to whether the animal, which was of course, blindfolded, was or was not
aware of its presence on some portion of its cutaneous surface. Normal dogs tested
