one syllable can also disambiguate neighbouring phonemes,
as exemplified in the American English words ladder (/ze/
longer) and latter (/z/ shorter), which only differ in their
vowel length [32]. Human speech sounds that differ in their
vowel quality (determined by formants), such as the vowels
in the English words feet and fit, may also have distinctive
lengths. Again, physiologically, durational variations are
limited by the individuals’ breathing capacities, but below
that capacious limit, the duration can be varied more or
less flexibly to give structure to the vocal output of humans
