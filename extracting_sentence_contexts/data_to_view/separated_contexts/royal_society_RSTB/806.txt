When, however, the blood-pressure is about the
normal mean for the animal, injection of defibrinated blood raises the venous pressure,
increasing thereby the input and output of the heart without any corresponding rise
of the arterial, and therefore of the coronary pressure, so that the work of the heart
is increased without any accompanying improvement in its nutrition. The result of
this is that the contractions are less complete, and the residual blood in the ventricles
is increased in amount. The unravelling of the relationship between the force of the
heart’s contractions and the nutrition of its walls was, in our work on the subject,
rendered still more difficult owing to the fact that improvement in the nutrition
of the heart wall often leads, not only to increased force of contraction, but also to
increased frequency of beat. According to our experience, the characters of the
myocardiographic curves suffice in most, though not in all, cases to enable one to
distinguish between “augmentor” effects and increase of force of contraction due to
improved nutrition of the heart substance resulting from rise of the aortic blood-
pressure. That the great increase in the output of the heart, resulting from a relatively small
addition to the total volume of the blood, does not cause a rise of pressure in the
systemic arteries, must be due to relaxation of the vessels of some vascular area or
areas, and it is important to note that the output of the heart may be doubled, or
