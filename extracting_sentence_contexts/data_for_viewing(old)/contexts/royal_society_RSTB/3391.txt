Dr. Fryuay, to whom I am greatly indebted for his courtesy in supplying me
regularly with this publication, is careful to inform me that the figures in the tables
referring to stillborn children, “in accordance with the Spanish law, do not only
express the number of children that are actually born dead but also those that die
within the first twenty-four hours after their birth.” This fact does not detract
from the value of these records for the purpose I have in view, but it should be noted.

Speaking generally, there is undoubtedly a very remarkable regularity in the
proportion of the sexes produced by various species of animals of which records have
been obtained, a regularity which is so pronounced that students of heredity are
surely justified in their belief that the laws of heredity are certainly concerned and,
in the main, govern that proportion. The fact that this proportion is different for
different species or for varieties of those species, while in the main stable for each, is
favourable to that view, and I shall bring forward evidence in this paper which cannot,
I think, be interpreted otherwise.

Darwin (1871) concluded “that natural selection will always tend, though
sometimes inefficiently, to equalise the relative number of the two sexes.” The
tendency of natural selection, as the master shows, must undoubtedly work in this
direction, but from my small experience I cannot but judge it very rarely succeeds in
effecting this result.

But, notwithstanding hereditary tendencies and in spite of natural selection, there
are, continually recurring, variations in the proportion of the sexes produced by different
