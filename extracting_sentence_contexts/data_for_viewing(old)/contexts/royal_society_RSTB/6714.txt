volved in the fossa parieto-occipitalis superiorly, but widely divergent from it
inferiorly. In the posterior part of the cuneus a curved paramedial sulcus cuts
the dorsal border of the hemisphere.

It is unfortunate that the lateral surface of this hemisphere is damaged so that the
pattern of the sulci cannot be exactly determined, beyond being certain that there
is no defined sulcus lunatus.

I have not previously seen, either in the brain of the Chinese or the Australian,
an arrangement of the sulci on the medial surface comparable with S.11.R. The
great interest lies in its comparison with the Gorilla’s brain mentioned above.

When the facts concerning the medial occipital region are summarized and
compared with the types seen in the Southern Chinese, the features distinguishing
the aboriginal Australian stand out. The open condition of the fossa parieto-occi-
pitalis characterizing the first two groups is present in 45°, of the Australian hemi-
spheres, and in 10% of the Chinese. There are 27°, showing the vertical type of
folding in the Australian, and 6% in the Chinese ; and finally the formation of a
fissura parieto-occipitalis characterizing group 6 is present in 17%, of the Australian

brains, and in 69°, of the Chinese.

In the Australian the open condition of the fossa parieto-occipitalis is more common
on the left side than on the right ; whether this is associated with the asymmetry
of the lateral part of the hemispheres it is not at present possible to Say.
