Against them I give Pearson’s values:

Bisection 1 10 0-22 M4

Comparing the determinations of P we see that there are great differences, presumably
owing to the fact that I have grouped more of the regions with small expectations
together. None of my values of P would usually be taken as decisive evidence against
the law tested. Pearson, for the second “ Bright-line” series, remarks that the P would
differ from zero only in the tenth place; I get a perfectly normal value, He also gets a
value of y* for the first bright-line series that would imply rejection of the hypothesi
mine is within the expectation and its standard error, The reason is presumably that
these series contain outlying observations at distances where deviations would be
practically impossible according to the normal law. Pearson’s earlier practice makes
allowance for their improbability; his later one, which I have adopted here, lumps them
with the larger expectations and their importance is disguised. It appears that the
earlier method may be the better. But what the comparison really shows is that when
the expectation becomes very small in some ranges the x? test, in any form, is so
sensitive to the arbitrary method of grouping that it is practically useless. The only
