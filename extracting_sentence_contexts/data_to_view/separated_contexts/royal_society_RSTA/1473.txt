This is especially relevant given the key
role of histidine in forming metal coordination complexes that provide significant mechanical
stability to the threads (figure 1c) [44]. Studies on peptides based on the histidine-rich sequences
support the crucial role of pH, histidine and metal binding in self-assembly and mechanics
of the fibres and thus for the transition from LC phase to tough fibre [23,49]. In fact, mussel-
mimetic peptide sequences based on the histidine-rich domains have been used for producing
hierarchically structured films and polymer-peptide hydrogels with metal tunable mechanics
[50,51].

7. Byssus cuticle assembly

Byssal threads are sheathed by a granular protective coating (1-5 ym thick) known as the cuticle. The byssus cuticle possesses an unusual combination of hardness comparable to an epoxy and an
extensibility of nearly 100% before failure, which arises from the hierarchical structure of spherical
granules embedded in a less structured matrix material [52,53] (figure 1c).
