II. In the second part of the book, in which these results are applied
to plants, Van Irerson investigated the positions in which the primordia arise when
the phyllotaxis is constant and when it is changing. He concluded that constant
phyllotaxis is maintained as a consequence of the following “ facts of observation,”
as he calls them :—

(1) The relative radius of the insertions of the new primordia (the factor 6) is the
same as that of the young primordia that are already present.

(2) These primordia are in contact with at least two older members.

(3) They are laid down in the larger gaps between the previous leaves.

(4) Small irregularities in the size or position of new members are eliminated during
the continued growth of the system or in the course of development.”

By his second observation, he does not mean that the primordia arise in contact with
their neighbours, but only that contact is usually achieved by the end of the “ first
growth phase.” For plants in which contact is not then achieved, he falls back on
SCHWENDENER’S idea of a “ field of development ” which must be substituted for the
areas occupied by the young leaves. He considers that the main difference between
constant and changing phyllotaxis is that in the former the relative radius instead of
remaining constant decreases or increases. It shortly attains a new constant value
and a new phyllotaxis system is established, depending on the new value of 6, the relative
