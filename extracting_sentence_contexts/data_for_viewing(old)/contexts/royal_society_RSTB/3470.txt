(Dia. IV). At the stage of entry of the bundles of the two basal bracts and their
axillary branches, the main series of bundles is more or less connected together
into a ring, on the outside of which an increased number of inversely orientated
bundles is present. One or two amphivasal bundles are also generally found inside
the ring. This ring is broken up by the entry of .the lateral bundles, and a very
much folded mass of vascular tissue is then formed (see Dia. VITs).

Owing to the rapid succession of changes which take place at the origin of the
bract bundles and those supplying the axillary buds or branches, it is extremely
difficult to trace the exact sequence of events. In one case investigated the two

* WorsbELt (1901, p. 768-772) regards these, and possibly the whole pith, as representing tissue which
primitively formed part of the xylem; the gradual transition referred to above is a fact which certainly
supports his suggestion. (See also PEARSON, 1909.)

{ The term “inversely concentric ” is here used to describe concentric bundles in which the xylem occurs
external to the phloem.
