The palato-quadrate bones of the disarticulated skeleton are perfectly preserved and
fortunately display both inner and outer surfaces. This bone is much shorter than the
lower jaw, an indication that the palato-quadrate, like Meckelâ€™s cartilage, was
ossified from more than one centre. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the
part of the palato-quadrate preserved corresponds quite accurately in length to the
posterior portion of the lower jaw. The palato-quadrate bone so far as it is shown
consists of a very deep post-orbital ramus formed of a thin film of bone which stood
vertically in the whole skull, and an exceedingly short abruptly truncated palatal portion
lying quite horizontally and very thin dorso-ventrally. The posterior part of the bone to-
ward its anterior end bears at its lower margin a ridge projecting labially which is the
palatal ramus, this subsides on to the outer surface of the ventral plate so as to leave space
for masticatory muscles.
