Many of the observations appear to

Ge of the highest interest, but no mention is made of the important fact of the
gpxistence of dimorphism. Polystomella crispa (Luxn.) is described as usually having
Fe or four nuclei, but is said to become many-nucleated during reproduction ; a form
a reproduction is also described in which the whole of the protoplasm leaves the shell
Bod divides up into numbers of young individuals which assume the characteristic
Fhape of the species. ScHAUDINN has, however, apparently failed to recognise what
4 undoubtedly the fact, that in this species one in every thirty to forty individuals is
Shicrospheric and possesses nuclei of a quite different character from that of the
Bregalospheri ic form.

“Breparatory to reproduction, ScHAUDINN describes a breaking up of the nucleus into
ae which are dispersed through the protoplasm; in this general result, my
Sbservations on the nucleus of the megalospheric form of Polystomella, so far as they
®. agree with his, but I am quite unable to recognise the remarkable phases of the
£r ocess which he describes in those that I have seen.

® lt is stated above that I had no evidence as to the fate of the microspheric form of
8 olystomella crispa (LINN.). I have since made further observations on living Foraminifera (chiefly Polysto-
cella), and have seen in some hundreds of cases the mode of reproduction mentioned
by Scuaupmnn.
