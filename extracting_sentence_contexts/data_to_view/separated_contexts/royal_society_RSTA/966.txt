Tt is seen that the transverse rolls are not part of the scheme; the fact that they
were generated independently and could not be transformed from anything else confirms
this ; there is also the fact that at a speed of 0-5 cm./sec., both the transverse rolls and
the pattern b were obtainable according to whether the pattern started ab initio or
whether it started from a. The transverse rolls appear, therefore, to occupy a unique
position in the series of patterns. The fact that the transverse rolls have not yet been
obtained in a liquid lends further support to the statement. Attention is drawn to the obvious pairing of the rolls. It appears that whatever
the form of the pattern, the air layer is divided into cells, completely closed, with
descent in the centre of each.
