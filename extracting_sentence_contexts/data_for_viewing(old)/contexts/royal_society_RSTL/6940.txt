34, The Hessian of the form is a*, and it thus appears that the plane z=0 is a deter-
minate plane through the double line. But 4=0 is not a determinate plane; in fact,
- if for y we write y+ az, the equation is
—#2+aw(y+22)+(y+MxY=0,
that is,
—#(2=aw—3Ky—e)+ay(w+3r)+4*=0,

which, changing 2 and w, is still of the form a(yw—az)+5=0.

The planes 2=0, w=0 will alter with the plane y=0, but they are not determined
even when the plane y=0 is determined; in fact we may, without altering the equa-
tion, change w, 2 into w+0y, 2+0x respectiyely,

- 35, In the equation a(yw—az)+y*=0, writing y=az, we find for the equations
of a generating line, y=az, 2=M+7. Considering the section by the plane
«r+By+y2+5w=0, we have

& for the coordinates of the point where the generating line meets the section.
D The generating line meets the nodal line at the intersection of the nodal line by the
Z plane z=70; that is, the points 2z=749 on the nodal line correspond to the planes y=az
through the nodal line. In particular the point w=0 on the nodal line corresponds
