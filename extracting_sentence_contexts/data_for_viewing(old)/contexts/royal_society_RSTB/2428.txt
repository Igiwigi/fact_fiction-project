podium (Phymatodes) patelliferwm, Nos., and distinct from P. loma-
rioides, but undoubtedly allied to that species, and must be placed
near that species in the genus Polypodium. But BaKkrr subsequently
upheld Lecanopteris as a separate genus, and suggested that its location
should be near to Dicksonia. Curist, however, still includes ‘it in
Polypodium. This will be a good test case in the use of the characters
introduced in this paper. If the annulus be interrupted at the stalk,
the sorus mixed, and orientation of sporangia be various, the affinity of
the Fern should be with Polypodium rather than with Dicksonia.

Only herbarium material has been available, but from it 1 have
verified the fact already observed by Curisr (loc. cit., fig. 330, p. 115)
that the annulus is interrupted at the stalk, and longitudinal. The
sorus is mixed, and the orientation of the sporangia various. This
being so, the inclusion of these Ferns in the comprehensive genus Poly-
podium would appear to give them their right position, rather than
placing them, as Baker suggests, “as a distinct genus in the neigh-
bourhood of Dicksonia.”
