232 MR. W. H. LANG ON APOGAMY AND THE DEVELOPMENT

experimental cultures, and the nature of the facts necessitated special prominence
being given to the hypothesis of homologous alternation. The attempt has been
made to suggest some of the steps by which such a group as the Ferns might have
originated on that hypothesis. It appears advisable in order to guard against
possible misconception to state that in the author's opinion no preponderating
evidence in favour of either theory and no facts rendering one or the other untenable
are known. Both the theories of antithetic and homologous alternation afford
possible explanations of the facts of the normal and abnormal life-history of such a
group as the Ferns. The reasons which make one or the other appear more probable,
depend on the assumptions made as to the line of descent which has been followed,
and the degree to which the groups of plants now living have had a common origin
and represent actual steps in the process. Under these circumstances it is necessary
to regard the question as an open one until the available sources of evidence, some of
which have been indicated, have been more fully investigated. As one of the
methods which may be expected to yield interesting results, the extension of cultural
experiments under accurately known conditions to the Archegoniats, a method which
has proved of great value in the study of the life-histovies of Thallophyta, may be
specially mentioned.
