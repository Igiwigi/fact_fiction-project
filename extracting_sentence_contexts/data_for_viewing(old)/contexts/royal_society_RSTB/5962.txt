The reversion to DH, of mycelium which had been previously converted from DH, to
DH, is of particular interest. It shows that the effect of increasing age is the same in a
converted DHy as in a typical DH, culture. Hence there seems to be no physiological
difference whatsoever between such cultures and it is reasonable to suppose from this
that a typical DH, culture contains throughout its whole existence a large element of
DHy such as is certainly present in DH, converted to DHy. ‘This is precisely the con-
clusion suggested by all the earlier experiments with DH, alone, and the results of the
two lines of investigation support each other.

Having established the fact of conversion, it is of interest to review the means by
which DH, may exert its influence on DH.

An enquiry into the possible role of the non-volatile staling products of the metabolism
of DH, showed that in the presence of increasing concentrations of these substances
the rate of spread of a DH, culture is reduced, but the nature of the mycelium is un-
changed ; further, the reaction of DHy in all media containing equal concentrations of
staling substances was the same whether these were entirely products of DH, or of DHy,
or were a mixture of the two (see Tables XV and XVI). It is therefore concluded that
non-volatile staling products can be of no great importance in conversion.

Volatile products of growth were found to have much the same effect on DH, as
have the non-volatile substances. ‘The spread of a DHy culture exposed to increasing
