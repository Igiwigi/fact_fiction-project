B. HOPKINSON ON MEASURING THE PRESSURE PRODUCED IN THE

Pressure Produced by the Impact of Lead Bullets. The pressure which should be produced by the impact of a lead bullet can be
predicted theoretically, and the study of this pressure was made rather with a view
to checking the method than in the hope of discovering any new facts. At velocities
exceeding 1000 feet per second lead behaves on impact
against a hard surface practically as a perfect fluid. The course of the impact is shown in fig. 4.
