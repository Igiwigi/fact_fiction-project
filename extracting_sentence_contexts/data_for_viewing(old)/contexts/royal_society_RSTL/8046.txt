latter opinion is undoubtedly the correct one ; and the breakage recorded for wood ships
when launched may be regarded as due in part to what is termed the ship's © settling ”
in her new position afloat—that is, to her reaching such a condition as to make her
powers of resistance balance the bending-moments due to the unequal distribution of
the weight and buoyancy. In part, however, the breakage is undoubtedly due to the
dynamical strains connected with launching ; and although we cannot separate the effects
produced by these two causes, we may yery properly regard the amount of the breakage
as to some extent a measure of the relation between the strength of the structure and

the strains brought upon it. I will pass over the facts respecting the breakage in the
older clases of wood ships, and confine attention to modern wood ships. Speaking of
merchant vessels, Mr. GRANTHAM 8ays*, ** It is the general custom with builders to leave
the gangways of the bulwarks in modern ships unfinished, lest the hull should 80 much
-alter in form by settling in launching that the rails would not again fit their places ;
- and no builder would willingly copper a vessel when new, but rather allow her first to
find her own position in the water, as she would then be less liable to wrinkle the sheets.”
"In wood-built ships of war there is also a considerable amount of breakage, as the fol-
lowing facts will «how. Our finest screw line-of-battle ships, of which the length was
about 260 feet, broke, on the ayerage, about 2 inches, some ships proving weaker than
wEthers, and the breakage in one case (that of the * Gibraltar ') amounting to 4 inches on
= length of 200 feet. Our finest screw frigates, which are 300 feet long, broke from
to 4 inches; the © Galatea,' 280 feet long, broke 3 inches. Shorter ships, of course,
