But from equations (26) and (31) we have

Hence, assuming that the solution wu is such that the order of integration can be changed
in equation (33) and applying equation (34), we obtain

J aCyord) [9 MAY —Ho)3] Yo = Wr) (1h 9)- (35)

This integral equation with y, as independent variable can easily be solved by applying
the Laplace transformation and using the superposition theorem of the operational calculus
(Jeffreys & Jeffreys 1946, pp. 375-376). Thus we write u(q,A) = [ee n(yisd) dy,
0
M,(q,4) = | * avin —M(Ay,)} dy, (36)

and apply the Laplace transformation to equation (35) to obtain

By substituting from equation (31) in the second of equations (36) we find in fact that

=; am]fa
B= ae (38)
so that equation (37) becomes

aga) =£ (2) Wea,a). (39)

Now it is interesting to note that the corresponding Laplace transform of yo(ly,) as
defined by

Holga) =f “e-eryo(dyn) dy (40)
is found, after substitution from equation (27), to integrate out in the simple form
= 1 /q+a
whence equation (39) may be written
2 a7, _
u(q,2) = £W(q,2) Xo(HA)- (42)

Since W(y,,4) = 0 when y, = 0 from equation (33), gW is the Laplace transform of
W’(y,,A), where the dash denotes differentiation with respect to y,. Hence by the super-

position theorem of the operational calculus we can interpret equation (42) and then drop
the suffix unity to obtain a solution of our original equation (30) in the form

u(y) = 555 [WY — md) aay) de (43)

=25

For a given function v(y, A) the right-hand side of this equation (43) is known by virtue of
equations (27) and (33). As in the special case to be considered, however, it will often be
simpler to revert to equation (39) and after finding W from equations (33) and (36), to
interpret direct for u by use of the Bromwich integral.
