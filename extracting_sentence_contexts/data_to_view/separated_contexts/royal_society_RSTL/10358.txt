Whilst on plot 5, with ammonia-salts, the number of species found in the gamples
declined in the first three separation-years from 38 to 36 and 31, on plot 15, with the
nitrate of soda, ib was 39 in each of the three years ; and whilst it declined to 29 in the
fourth separation-year with ammonia-salts, ib rose to 43 on plot 15 after the mixed
mineral manure had been substituted for the nitrate. The table shows that there was much less fluctuation, and a lower mean percentage
of gramineous herbage, on plot 15 than on plot 5; the highest amount was little over
80 per cent., the fact being that a much larger number of miscellaneous species
contributed their share to the yield. A glance at the figures more in detail brings to view the fact that no one grass
contributed snch an overwhelming percentage as on plot 5, and that a much larger
number yielded a fair proportion. Here again, however, Festuca ovina furnished in
the third separation-year rather more than one-third of the whole; but in neither
year did Agrostis vulgaris contribute an excessive proportion as it did on plot 5. The
most prominent among the other grasses were—Poa trivialis and Holcus lanatus, both
of which increased in the second year (1867), Poa trivialis very considerably, although
it diminished in the third year (1872); Alopeenrus pratensis and Lolium perenne, both
of which however declined ; Avena flavescens in 8maller but comparatively uniform per-
centage; and Anthozanthum and Bromus mollis which increased.
