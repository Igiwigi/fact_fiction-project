According to his descrip-
tion it was composed essentially of two bony elements, a large thin shield dorsally and
a remarkable T-shaped bone perforated by a large foramen lying on the ventral
surface in the orbital region; this he called the trabecular. I am fortunate in that a
single specimen, P. 495, shows the entire isolated neural cranium so far as it was
ossified. Owing to the fact that a great deal of the side wall remained as cartilage, the
ventral elements of this brain case sank down until they came into contact with its
dorsal bones, but they are not otherwise displaced. The individual elements all consist
of thin sheets of bone surrounding cavities which still exist as such and were in life
certainly occupied by cartilage. The account that I give of them pays no attention
to the cartilaginous hollow, the whole bone being described as though it were solid,
or as if the description applied to the cast.
