certain Schizopods, and we may point to the close relation of blue and red pigments,
which have been deduced by Frirscx (1891) from observations on Holopediwm,
one of the Daphnids ; by Her (1892), from a study of several Decapod Crustacea, and
by Miss NewsiGin (1897), from chemical investigation on the blue pigment of Astacus
and Homarus.

Returning now to the question, ‘“ What becomes of the blue pigment” ? we must
confess that our knowledge on the subject is but scanty. Nevertheless, we set forth


ON THE COLOUR-PHYSIOLOGY OF HIGHER CRUSTACEA. 341

here a series of facts which we have discovered during the last three years, and
which are interesting enough in themselves to merit record, even though we should
prove to be wrong in thinking that they will throw some light on this question.

The Tissue-reactions of Hippolyte and Mysis.

The nature of diurnal and nocturnal colour-change, from red or yellow to blue ;
the arbitrary way in which “nocturnes” may behave when subjected to light, now
losing their blueness in a flash, now maintaining it for hours; led us to suspect that
the pigment changes are not controlled solely by the nervous system, but that some
other agent co-operates therewith.

The pigment of a chromatophore in an isolated piece of skin of Palemon, or in an
