<chloric acid, and this was found to be proportional to the intensity of the light by
Spunsen and Roscog. c; is also a measure of the rate of formation of the chlorine-
gwater additive molecules, and, as we have seen in the description of the cloud
fexperiments on p. 106, the more intense the light the more rapid is the formation of
She cloud producing nuclei. For the other two constants we have seen that the
Swater-chlorine molecules are produced some time before any hydrochloric acid is
‘ormed, so that the last two stages of the action do not take place so rapidly that
Ethe first intermediate compound has a very short existence. Both c¢, and ¢, are,
therefore, not very large. Further, Bunsen and Roscor showed that there was a
definite absorption of light associated with the combination—more than was absorbed
by an equal quantity of damp chlorine. One, therefore, or both of the constants ¢,,
¢, depends on the light intensity. This also appears from the fact that the effect of
insolation persists for some time after the mixture is darkened. If c, and c, were
both independent of the intensity of the light, we should expect that in a short time
the H,O, Cl, molecules would all be used up, and that the gas would very soon
return to its normal condition. But the effect of previous insolation can persist for
several hours. This is explained if we suppose that the H,O, Cl, molecules are able

original molecules H,O and Cl,, or into new molecules HCl and HClO. That this —
