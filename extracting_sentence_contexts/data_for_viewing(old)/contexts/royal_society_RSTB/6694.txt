S8.3.R., the area striata extends to the posterior lip of the posterior operculum of the
fossa parieto-occipitalis. Although this brain is in a poor state of preservation the
sulci can be readily made out ; and, further, the condition seen is so similar to that
observed in other members of the serie. that there can be little doubt as to the
interpretation here put forward.

The sulcus paramedialis is clearly defined on the dorso-mesial border of the
hemisphere. It is separated from the sulcus lunatus by a narrow superior occipito-
parietal gyrus.

Group 5

The outstanding feature of this group is the fact that practically the whole area of the cuneus
is occupied by the area striata. This finds its expression in the vertical folding of the intrastriate
sulci ; and gives rise to a grouping of the sulci on the medial aspect of the hemisphere which is
as significant as ts the effect of the same vertical folding on the pattern of the sulci on the lateral
aspect of the hemisphere.

Before proceeding to the description of the individual members of the group the
main features of the group will be discussed, using S.4.R. as the basis for comparison.
