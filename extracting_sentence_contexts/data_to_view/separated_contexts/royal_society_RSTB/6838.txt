The evidence of the
few animal remains (Pteraspis dunensis, Cephalaspis sp. and a Eurypterid) found in the
Senni Beds points in the same direction, and that provided by the plants, or at least
the majority of them, shows that the flora as a whole had lived under terrestrial con-
ditions. It is not, of course, excluded that some of the forms from the Downtonian to the
Senni Beds may have been aquatic or marsh plants. But, even in the case of the earlier
floras, the presence of vascular plants with firm-walled and presumably air-borne
spores and the fact that some of the spores were shed from sporangia that had special
arrangements for dehiscence are indications of subaerial life. The evidence for a
definitely terrestrial habitat becomes still stronger in the case of the larger plants of
the Senni Beds. In South Wales the change indicated by the appearance of these
plants occurs at the base of the Senni Beds and within a few hundred feet of rock with
no stratigraphical break.
