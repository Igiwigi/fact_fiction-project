Tt seems to the writer that Remax has described, in 5-day chick, only the inner portion
of the incipient secondary intervertebral body (or in other terms, the primary inter-
vertebral body) arising, as was alluded to above, from the middle zone of the intra-
sclerotomic portion of his “ Blastem”’ (perichordal tube). In later stages, he observed,
on the contrary, only the formation of the outer portion of the secondary intervertebral
body: ‘ Die Anlagen der Zwischenwirbelscheiben gehen, wie der weitere Verlauf lehrt,
aus dem Schwanzteile des primitiven Wirbelkérpers, oder, was dasselbe ist, aus dem
Kopfteile des sekundiiren Wirbelkérpers hervor.”

ReMAk supports his statement about the origin of the outer portion of the definitive
intervertebral body by the observation that the intervertebral dise (Zwischenwirbelkérper)
adheres to the anterior portion of the secondary vertebral body when we try to isolate
it. But this fact iselfis no valid argument in favour of its origin from the anterior aspect
of the secondary vertebral body. Careful study of the development of the postero-lateral
portion of the chordal division of the cranial sclerotomites (interventrals) in 12- and
14-day Struthio, and 5- and 6-day Larus, shows distinctly that this formation gives rise
to the outer layer of the secondary intervertebral body from which is probably formed
the intervertebral disc or ligament. JAGER (1859) showed that the intervertebral apparatus in birds consists of a central
and a lateral portion.
