16. The moxst striking particulars in the last line of these Tables are the following :
First, the almost exact equality of the Mean Coefficients of Irregularity in the three

elements. And this remarkable agreement proves that the Irregularities as meagured
here are real objective facts. For they are measured from photographic sheets in which
the scales are very different: on the Westerly and Northerly records, 0:01 of Horizontal
Force is represented by 287 inches "and 2:55 inches, while on the Nadir record 0-01 of
Horizontal Force is represented by 0-88 inch. Yet the eye of the Reader of the Photo-
graphs has caught the Irregularities when shown on this s8mall scale as certainly as
when shown on the larger scale. With reference to their physical import, T think it
likely that the equality of Coefficients of Irregularity may hereafter proye to be one of
the most important of the facts of observation.

Second, the near agreement in the number of Irregularities for Westerly Force and
for Northerly Force. k

Third, the near agreement in the number of Irregularities for Nadir Force with half
