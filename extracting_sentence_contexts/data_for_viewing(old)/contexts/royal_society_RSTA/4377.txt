thing is that they give us a new type of information. When an illegal value keeps reappearing in
the same point for a long enough number of times (we can choose 5, 10 or any other convenient
number), we can reasonably conclude that that point is either a minimum or a maximum. We can
therefore fix its value, and this means that the total number of unknowns is reduced by one. By
repeating this operation, the number of the unknowns becomes progressively smaller and when
it reaches the number of equations a complete reconstruction is possible. That is the result we
were looking for. The memory matrix allows us to collect information that was not present in the
initial data and which is gradually emerging during the reconstruction process.


Let us now take a closer look at the memory matrix. The information of the vortices appears ls |
in the memory space, but we use that information in the structure space, because it is here that we
reduce the number of the unknowns. We are in fact transferring information from the memory
space to the structure space with a conventional rule of the type ‘If a vortex appears in the memory
space, fix the corresponding point in the structure space to a minimum or a maximun’.

A reconstruction from incomplete information, in short, does not require only a memory.
It requires memory and codes. The reconstruction memory is where new information appears.
The reconstruction codes are the tools that transfer information from the memory space to the
structure space.

5. The code theory of development 2
Embryonic development is nof a reconstruction of structures from projections and it is not Sy
achieved by computations, but it is nevertheless a reconstruction from incomplete information, and 2
there may well be general principles that apply to all such cases. aed
