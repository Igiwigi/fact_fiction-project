Table XXIX. contrasts the ratios borne to ¢, by es, cs, and c,in the seasonal diurnal
inequalities in the sunspot maximum and sunspot minimum groups of years. In the
case of V the ratios seem little dependent on sunspot frequency, whereas in H with
one exception they rise as sunspots diminish, especially in winter. In that season, in
fact, in sunspot minimum the amplitude of the 24-hour term is exceeded by that of
the 12-hour term and even by that of the 8-hour term.

§22. Table XXX. contrasts the phase angles in the diurnal inequalities for the year
and seasons in the six elements H, V, T, N, W, and I. An increase in the phase
angle as we pass from winter to equinox, and from equinox to summer, is shown by
+ H, N, and T in all four Fourier waves.
