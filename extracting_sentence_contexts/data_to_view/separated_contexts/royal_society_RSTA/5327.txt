In this difficulty I cannot share. I must repeat what I
have long contended for,t that it is impossible to suppose that our very limited —
experience—say of 2000 years—could furnish us with standards applicable to the —
comparatively illimitable past. In fact, those that are relied on depend upon unstable
conditions and are liable to vary with every passing century. While admitting the
permanence of the laws of Nature, it is impossible, under the conditions through which ;
this globe has passed, to suppose that at all former periods the effects, which have
resulted from the operation of those laws, though equal in kind, were equal in degree. & | As in other similar questions, we must judge of the hypothesis not by an @ priori
