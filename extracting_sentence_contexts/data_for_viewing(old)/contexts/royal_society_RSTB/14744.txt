the same shade of grey in the image, yet everyone would say 8. M ulti-sensory integration
the illusion changes our visual experience so we see different If you view an after-image of your hand in darkness, and
shades of grey. By contrast, I would argue that we see the move your physical hand closer or further away from your
same shade of grey in A and B, but that the pictorial cues face, the after-image of your hand will appear to shrink or
bias our ability to accurately judge what our own visual grow in size. This phenomenon, known as the ‘Taylor illu-
experience of A and B is. But how do we know if light and sion’ [10,188-190], has led to the suggestion that vision
colour constancies affect our actual visual experience or ‘relies on multimodal signals’ [10] and that ‘visual conscious-

I argue that we should take advantage of the fact that col- integration really affect vision? The leading account of the
ours and shades have absolute values. We can find the Taylor illusion is that the vast majority of its effect is due to
absolute value of the ‘light’ patch by showing the illusion, vergence, and only a negligible amount is due to the hand

and then (without interval) replacing it with a full-screen of movements [10]. But my experimental work has shown that


vergence has no effect on perceived size [12], suggesting that
the vergence component of the ‘Taylor illusion’ is merely cog-
nitive. If a merely cognitive effect can account for the major
(vergence) component of the ‘Taylor illusion’, then it’s
highly likely that a merely cognitive effect can also account
for the minor (multi-sensory) component as well. So I’m
