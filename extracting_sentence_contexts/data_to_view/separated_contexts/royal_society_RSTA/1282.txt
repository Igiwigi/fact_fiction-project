In
hour H18, the coefficients of As/' are significant in both regimes for Q3. In the steep regimes,
the coefficients of As} are at least two times larger by absolute value than in the flat regimes. This reflects the fact that renewable forecast changes affect electricity prices more severely in the
steep than in the flat merit-order regime. In hour H13, the coefficients of positive solar forecast
changes As? are significant and negative in both regimes for contracts Q1 and Q2. In hour H7, the
coefficients of As! are significant and negative in both regimes for Q4, while in hour H18, they are
generally not significant.
