moment of inertia is then L/«.

(5.6) Resultant Force.—If the centre of rotation is such that the impulse does not
reduce to a couple, then, since this is constant relative to the body, 7.e., turns with it, a
force tl must be applied to the body to maintain the motion ; the resultant of the
fluid pressures is then equal and opposite to this, and so is — vol.

This can be shown quite generally as follows. Since w, as obtained refers to axes
moving with the body, the o¢/ot term will be present in the pressure equation. In

fact, :
