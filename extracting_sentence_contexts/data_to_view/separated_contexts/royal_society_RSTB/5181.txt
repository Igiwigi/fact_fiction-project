50, Plate 6), is
very similar in appearance and structure to that of the surrounding Clepsydropsis
roots. ‘There are the same three zones, of which the middle one is prominent as a narrow
dark band; scattered in the inner cortex are the same dark-coloured cells as in
Clepsydropsis. These facts suggest that the organ may after all be a large Clepsydropsis root with
secondary growth—a parent root to many others given off distichously, as hinted
above. But if this be so it is strange that among the numerous roots examined there
is not one which shows a trace of periderm or secondary wood. No root-hairs are
seen, but this may be because the organ is packed among the surrounding roots.
