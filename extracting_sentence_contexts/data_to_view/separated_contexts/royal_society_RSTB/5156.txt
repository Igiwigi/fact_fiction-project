This result is in harmony with the fact that submerged aquatics
tend to have few or no stomata whereas their land forms bear numerous stomata, and
also with the results obtained from Scilla grown in moist and dry air. For a low stomatal
index shows that a lower proportion of stomata are formed as distinct from diminution
per unit area, consequent upon growth of the epidermal cells. The fact that some

submerged aquatics form stomata upon their leaves when well nourished, whereas
under conditions of malnutrition stomata may be absent (e.g., Stratiotes, of. ‘ Montesantos
