The diameter of one of the largest does not exceed g4gth of an
inch, and their distance from each other is about half or once the diameter of one of them. In their present state, as represented by six of them in Plate XXXTV. fig. 16, it is
evident that they are separate developments, and it is equally evident that a slightly
further amount of extension would have caused them to merge in one comparatively
large flat surface of sponge. We see by this instance that a sponge is not always
developed from a single oyum or gemmule, but, on the contrary, that many ova or
gemmules are often concerned in the production of one large individual, and this fact
may probably account for the comparatively very few small sponges that are to be found ;
a few days probably serving by this mode of simultaneous deyelopment to form the basal
membrane of the sponge of considerable magnitude, as compared with the individual
oyum or gemmule, or with a sponge developed from a single oyum only. This mode
of reproduction appears to have a yery wide range. It is common to several distinct
genera of Halichondraceous sponges; and IT haye observed it also in a siliceo-fibrous
sponge, Jphiteon panicea of the Museum of the Jardin des Plantes, Paris.
