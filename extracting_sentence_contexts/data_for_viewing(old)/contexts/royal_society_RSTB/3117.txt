The divisions of the macrospore-mother-cell have not been seen, but, after a
comparison of the stages represented in figs. 20-24, there can be little doubt that it
divides into a row of cells of which the lowest is the functional macrospore. Taking
these figures in the order given, it will be seen that the integument in each stage is
more advanced than in the one immediately preceding it—which implies that the
ovules are successively older. Fig. 21 represents a stage in which the mother-cell
has divided and the second division of the upper daughter-cell (a) is proceeding.
The probak'e interpretation of fig. 22 is that the cell “a!” is equivalent to “a,”
while “ b!” represents ‘“ b” of fig. 21, the nucleus of the latter having divided. In
support of this view, in addition to the more advanced age of the ovule of fig. 22,
there is the fact that the cell “a!” occupies the same position relatively to the top
of the nucellus as does the cell “a” in fig. 21. The cell ““m” in fig. 23, in an ovule
considerably more advanced than that of fig. 22, is certainly the macrospore. It has
already increased in size, and the disorganisation of the contiguous nucellar tissue
has commenced. The four-nucleate embryo-sac (fig. 24) agrees very closely with
