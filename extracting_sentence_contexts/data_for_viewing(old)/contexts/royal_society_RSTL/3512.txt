indeed be @ creation of power, and is like no other force in nature. We have many
processes by which the form of the power may be 80 changed that an apparent con-
version of one into another takes place. So we can change chemical force into the
electric current, or the current into chemical force. 'The beautiful experiments of
SBEBECK and PELTIER show the convertibility of heat and electricity ; and others by
(ErsTeD and myself show the convertibility of electricity and magnetism. But in
no cases, not even those of the Gymnotus and Torpedo (1790.), is there a pure crea-
tion of force; a production of power without a corresponding exhaustion of something
to supply it*.

2072. It should ever be remembered that the chemical theory sets out with a power,
the existence of which is pre-proved, and then follows its variations, rarely assuming
anything which is not supported by some corresponding simple chemical fact. The
contact theory sets out with an assumption, to which it adds others as the cases
require, until at last the contact force, instead of being the firm unchangeable thing
at first supposed by Voura, is as variable as chemical force itself.

2073. Were it otherwise than it is, and were the contact theory true, then, as it
appears to me, the equality of cause and effect must be denied (2069.). Then would

* (Note, March 29, 1840.)—l regret that I was not before aware of most important evidence for this phi-
losophical argument, consisting of the opinion of Dr, Roexr, given in his Treatise on Galvanism in the Library
of Useful Knowledge, the date of which is January 1829. Dr. Rocer is, upon the facts of the science, a sup-
porter of the chemical theory of excitation; but the striking pas8age I desire now to refer to, is the following,
