In all the cases examined, if more than one worm were present in a fly, whose repro-
ductive organs were normal, then all were in a degenerate undeveloped condition. No
example was found in which one worm was healthy and two or three degenerate. Again,
no case was found in which one ovary or testis of a fly was normal and the other rudi-
mentary. It is always a case of either the parasite gaining the ascendancy, along with
a check to the reproductive organs of the host, or vice versa.

In the great majority of cases the worm manages to get the upper hand and grows to
sexual maturity within the host, but occasionally the fly, during its final metamorphosis,
is able, by some means, to build up its gonads in the normal manner. When this happens
the worm fails to grow, remains non-functional and becomes degenerate. There appears,
in fact, to be a race between the development of the worm within the pupal fly and the
gonads of the latter. Generally the former, but sometimes the latter, wins. These
relationships may possibly be explained on the supposition that the worm secretes or
excretes something, perhaps from the intestinal gland, which prevents the normal
growth of the host’s sex-cells. At the same time it is quite likely that the same may be
true of the host ; if once its reproductive organs become sufficiently developed, then it
is able to pour out some.substance which definitely inhibits the growth of the worm.
Such an “ all or none ” reaction is not suggestive of a competition for a common source
of food between the parasite and the gonads of the host.
