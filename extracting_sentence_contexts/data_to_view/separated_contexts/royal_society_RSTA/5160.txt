think it probable that it is so; but it is evident that we cannot expect to prove any
general property of viscous forces in the absence of a strict definition which wil
enable us to determine with certainty what forces are viscous and what are not.” *

89. The general variational equation of motion of the viscous system will in fact by

[or — 8W— Sf) dt = 0,

wherein 6 represents variation with respect to the co-ordinates and velocities of th
system, while 8’ represents variations with respect to the velocities only, the diffe
rentials of the velocities being in the result of the latter variation replaced by diffe:
rentials of the corresponding co-ordinates.t

90. The importance of this analysis in respect to problems in the theory of radiatior
is fundamental. If a radiation maintains its period of vibration unaltered in passi
through a viscous medium, it follows necessarily that the viscous forces of the medium
are of the type above specified.
