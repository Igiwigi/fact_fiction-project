this is probably only a small part, and
not the most primitive of their functions. They are also related to the general
processes of the body, notably to the bodily nutrition. In Daphnia they may be
readily watched engaged in the transportation of fatty particles from the alimentary
canal to its place of storage.t Also any abnormal condition of the perivisceral fluid, 4
blood, leads to the massing of these cells around the special excretory organs of thi

animal, and this fact suggests that their activities are partly directed to maintaining
the normal constitution of the body fluids so far as the dissolved matters are

concerned. 7
