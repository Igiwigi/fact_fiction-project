A modification adopted
‘3 was as follows. Writing f = }sin 2($—8), and F = —hsin¢, where h is the value for which
4 ¢ is required, the values of f,, f2, F, and F, were calculated, and with f, = }sin 2(¢,—9),
2 F, =—hsin4,, etc., the following results are obtained, where differences are indicated by

3 n= yla—P)- (3-2) Although this modification of the usual procedure is formally trivial, practically it effects
a considerable saving of time, particularly in view of the fact that the values of / are usually
1 or 2 figure numbers, and that the difference between ¢, and ¢, can usually be made, from
the first estimate, sufficiently small for the calculation of (3-2) to be made mentally. Numerical integration

For the calculation of the mean magnetization at a given value of h of an assembly of
ellipsoids orientated at random in the field (see table 6, § 4), the value of the integral in

(2:19) is required, namely

From table 2, giving cos ¢ as a function of h at a series of values of @, tables may be drawn up
giving (cos ¢), for @ = 0 (10°) 90°, and a series of equally spaced values of the integrand
obtained by multiplying by sin @. Where the integrand is a continuous function of @ over
the range of integration, that is for | h| <3, for }<h<1, and for | h| >1, the integration can
in principle be effected numerically, using the Newton-Gregory formula, or, if the con-
tinuation of the function outside the @ range from 0 to 90° is known and is of a suitable
character, the more convenient central difference formula.
