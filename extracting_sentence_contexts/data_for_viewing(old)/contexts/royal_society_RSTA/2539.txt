high-temperature phases, giving localized deformations in low-density network structures,
and in providing the mechanism by which the tension effect can give NTE in network
materials.

The RUM model is sometimes misunderstood, most often because it is sometimes assumed
that the model requires a high rigidity of the polyhedra and thus that any distortion might
invalidate the RUM model.4 I have argued here that the starting point of the RUM model is
to identify the easy deformations of a network structure, something that is very important in
applications such as NTE where the important flexibility is likely to be spread across many wave
vectors. Whilst it is always tempting to identify a real-space RUM-type motion to understand
phenomena such as NTE—in practice a mode at zero wave vector—in reality NTE will require
a much wider distribution of RUMs. The visual appeal and impact of a single RUM of zero
wave vector should not blind us to the fact that a single RUM by itself cannot achieve much
more than rationalize a phase transition. Instead, for RUMs to be significant in a thermodynamic
sense, it is important that the polyhedra have a finite stiffness (typically bond bending) that can
enable the effects of RUMs to spread over RUM-like modes with wave vectors close to the RUM
wave vectors. High stiffness limits the effect of the RUMs because the effects are restricted to
a smaller range of wave vectors. For example we consider the theory of the phase transition,
we have the result that the transition temperature is proportional to the polyhedral stiffness.
If the polyhedra are extremely stiff, the transition temperatures would be so large that the
phase transitions do not occur prior to melting. Similarly, although the RUM model gives an
explanation for why the tension effect can operate within a network structure where all motions
are cooperative rather than localized, if the polyhedra are too stiff the number of phonons that
give NTE is too small a fraction of the total number of phonons to give an overall NTE behaviour.
In short, the RUM model starts by identifying the flexibility of a network structure and projecting
