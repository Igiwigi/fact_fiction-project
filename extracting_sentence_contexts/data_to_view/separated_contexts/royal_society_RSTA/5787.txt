We also note that the selective control, i.e. the one especially operating on individuals [8
with larger social nets, allows us to reach for the global population a value below the desired (=
target x7. In particular, the mean contact rate is lower than x7 of an amount directly proportional
to the degree of heterogeneity of the population. This can be explained by the fact that individuals
with larger social networks are mainly responsible for the creation of the contact dynamics. This
situation suggests that it is important to act on this class of people in order to limit the spread of
a disease instead of taking measures with uniform impact over the whole population. From an operative point of view, it is clear that the application of a uniform control, which is
based on restrictive measures uniformly valid for the global population, are simpler to apply with
respect to measures which provide for heavier restrictions for the categories that show a greater
number of social contacts.
