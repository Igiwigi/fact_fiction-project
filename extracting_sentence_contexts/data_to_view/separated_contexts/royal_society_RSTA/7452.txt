VARIATION WITH DEPTH OF THE MAIN GEOMAGNETIC FIELD 125

The vertical sequence is known only at boreholes and mine shafts, perhaps a mile or so
apart. In adjacent sections it is often possible to correlate coal seams and thick beds of shale
and sandstone, but there is considerable lateral variation and impersistence in the thinner
beds. The important facts apparent are that some beds persist over an area at least equal to
that ofa circle of about a mile radius, that the size distribution of beds is more or less random,

andjthat at all points within such an area, the vertical succession, though differing widely in
detail from point to point, will be substantially the same. Thus a sufficiently detailed know-
ledge of the strata is not available to allow the exact effect of the fields to be computed, but
by making some reasonable simplifications approximate values can be obtained.
