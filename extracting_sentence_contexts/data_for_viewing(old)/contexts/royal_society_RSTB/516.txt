liquid remained distinctly acid. In the second extraction, with still greater remaining
acidity, the amounts were 4°03 after 1 hour, and only 3°61 after 24 hours. That
notwithstanding there was much more remaining acidity, there should be less taken
up after 24 hours in the second than in the first extraction, again indicates that a
certain quantity of the nitrogen exists in a more readily attackable condition than the
remainder. It may be added, that much more mineral matter as well as nitrogen was
taken up with the larger proportion of acid solution to a given weight of the subsoil.

With the larger quantity of acid solution to a given weight of the surface soil,
much more nitrogen was taken up than under parallel conditions with the subsoil.
But, in the first extraction there was little more, and in the second even less, than
with twice the quantity of the surface soil to a given quantity of the acid solution.
In fact, there was, taking the two extractions together, even less nitrogen taken up
with the larger than with the smaller proportion of acid solution to a given weight of
soil; but with the larger proportion there was much more mineral matter taken up,
whereby the acid would be to a greater degree neutralised. There is, both after
1 hour and after 24 hours, much less nitrogen taken up in the second than in the first

extraction ; again showing that a certain proportion of the nitrogen of the soil is
more easily attacked than the remainder.

All the foregoing results illustrating the action of dilute organic acid solutions on
