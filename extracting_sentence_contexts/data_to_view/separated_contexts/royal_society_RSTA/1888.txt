However, I believe that the accuracy of the measurements is sufficient
to establish the conclusions which it is intended to draw from them. It will be noticed that the shapes of the curves are all much the same, the most notice-
able difference being that they are spaced widely apart on the voltage axis. In fact,
it is clear from an inspection of fig. 3, that if any two of the curves are given suitable
horizontal displacements, they can be made nearly to coincide with the remaining one. The explanation of such a result seemed obvious.
