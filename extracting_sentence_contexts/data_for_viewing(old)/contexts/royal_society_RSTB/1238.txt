rogenous masses (sp., fig. 110); a layer of cells adjoining the wall of the

; this layer very soon divides periclinally into two.

r results are naturally to be obtained from transverse sections (fig. 111); in
> trabeculee are seen radiating, as it were, from the slightly convex, sub-
a , which intervenes between the sporogenous tissue and the vascular
of the sporophyll. This figure is added for purposes of comparison with
Jium, and, if we refer back to fig. 43 of L. Selago or fig. 64 of L. clavatum, the
s of the similarity between them will be sufficiently plain. The potential
rium of Jsoetes clearly corresponds to the curved sporogenous mass of Lyco-
the chief difference lying in the differentiation of the former into sterile
glee and sporogenous masses. In fact, if we imagine a heterosporous Lycopod
bs sporangium widened out radially, and its enlarged sporogenous mass partly

Bd so as to form trabeculie, the result would be practically what is seen in

often wrongly assumed that the sporangia of Isoetes are actually partitioned,

e of the published drawings, if not corrected by description, support this
Â© The trabeculee are not partitions, but, as their name implies, rods of tissue
radiate upwards from the subarchesporial pad; they are frequently very
ar both in number and form; though, in our figs. 110 and 111, more regular
ss have been chosen, the specimen drawn as fig. 112 will sufficiently show
yregular branchings as may occur, while the structure of them is displayed more
