(2) A loss in numbers through mortality. It is thus possible to find populations which attain to the theoretical maximum number
of individuals, but only where this is achieved at the expense of the size of the individuals
and by increased mortality. A number of factors contribute to produce this phenomenon,
which is peculiar from the fact that the expected final population density is realized when

many more than the optimum number of individuals are originally present on the meat. This indicates that the larvae of the flies in question are unable to make the best use of the
food available. The following are the main factors concerned.
