Any considerable delay in drawing the speculum, when solid, into the anneal-
ing-oven would be fatal; therefore there should be ample capstan power to overcome
the difficulty which uſually is experienced in detaching the speculum from the mould.

686 EARL OF ROSSE ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF SPECULA OF 6-FEET APERTURE,

The last speculum is but 3 tons, and is therefore considerably weaker than its pre.
decessor ; and by carefully comparing the two specula at low altitudes, we have been
made thoroughly sensible of the great importance of strength in preventing flexure,
There are little irregularities in the action of the supporting levers, which are much
more injurious to the definition of the weaker speculum than the other; and although
these irregularities may be susceptible of further diminution, I think there would «till
be sufficient gain to make it worth while to cast a third speculum considerably heayier
than either of the others. In the © Philosophical Transactions * for 1840 I have endeavoured to explain the prin-
ciple upon which the bed of hoop-iron acts; some, however, seem to have attributed
larger effects to it than I haye, and of a different kind. Tt has been s8upposed by some
that a molecular change takes place, somewhat similar to that which has been observed
in the case of yery small portions of speculum-metal rapidly cooled, while by others the
change has been compared to the © chilling of cast iron,” to which I think it bears no
analogy : cast iron when chilled becomes almost as hard as hardened steel ; there is an
exudation of graphite—in fact, a chemical change the exact nature of which seems to
be imperfectly understood : there is no such change in speculum-metal, it becomes
actually softer. To obtain sound castings, all which seems necessary is 80 to manage
the process that solidification must begin at one surface and proceed regularly to the
other, By employing the bed of hoop-iron the object is effected with certainty ; but
the engineer may employ other means, perhaps sufficient for the purpose, which, under
varying local circumstances, may be cheaper and more convenient. Possibly some useful hints may be gathered from a slight glance at the successive
steps by which we obtained a clear view of the principle by which the founder should
be guided in making large castings of speculum-metal.
