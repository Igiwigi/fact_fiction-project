ledons of the new plant, become filled with nutrient materials, forming reserves upon
which, after the resting period, the young plant will subsist, and which will enable it
to resume its growth. Or it may be that the nutrient material may be accumulated
in cells immediately surrounding the young embryo, cells which form the so-called
endosperm and which are not actually part of it. A curious feature this, not repre-
sented exactly by anything in the cycle of animal life, though perhaps the condition
of the egg which is deposited by the parent and quickened later into active life
approaches somewhat to it. This differs greatly, however, in the length of the quies-
cent period, which in the seed may be almost indefinitely prolonged. What changes,
if any, take place in the cells during this period is not known and cannot well be
ascertained. At the end of this time changes do take place, and the arrested develop-
ment is resumed. That the condition of things inside the seed is not exactly
alike always, seems pointed to by the fact that seeds of the same plant do not
germinate at all times with equal readiness, though exposed to the same favourable
conditions. During this period, long or short as it may be, and its length varies
extremely, the different bodies occupying the interior of the cells of the cotyledons or
the endosperm maintain their character apparently unchanged, or, if changed at all,
the nature of the change is such as not to be recognisable by microscopic examination
or by chemical analysis, only being marked by greater or less resistance to the setting
up of the manifest changes which are known as the process of germination.

The process of deposition of the several reserve products in the cells of the seed has
been watched by many observers, and the details of the storage have been examined
