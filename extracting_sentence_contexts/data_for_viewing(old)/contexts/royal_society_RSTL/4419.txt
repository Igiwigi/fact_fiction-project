fluence, the whole mass of solution could bardly have been brought into such a uni-
form crystallizing state. Whether the horizontality of the plates can have any rela-
tion to the almost vertical lines of magnetic force, which from the earth's magnetism
was pervading the solution during the whole time of its rest, is more than I will ven-
ture to say.

2579. The following are considerations which bear upon this great question (2576.)
of an original or an induced 8tate.

2580. In the first place, the bismuth carries off no power or particular state from
the magnetic field, able to make it affect a magnet (2504.) ; $0 that if the condition
acquired by the crystal be an induced condition, it is probably a transient one, and
continues only whilst under induction. The fact therefore, though negative in its
evidence, agrees, as far as it tells, with that supposition.

2581. In the next place, if the effect were wholly due, as far as the crystal is con-
cerned, to an original power inherent in the mass, we might expect to find the earth's
magnetism, or any weak magnet, affecting the crystal. It is true that a weak mag-
netic force ought to induce any given condition in a crystal of bismuth just as well
as a stronger, only proportionally. But if the given condition were inherent in the
crystal, and did not change in its amount by the degree of magnetic force to which
it was subjected, then a weak magnetic force ought to act more decidedly on the
bismuth than it would do if the condition were induced in the bismuth, and only in
proportion to its own force. Whatever the value of the argument, I was induced to
repeat the experiment of the earth's influence (2505.) very carefully, and by shelter-
