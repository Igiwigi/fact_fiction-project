For a gold =
nanoparticle, the SPP resonance can be tuned anywhere in the visible and IR range. In the visible a
range, the loss rate of the Au SPP is just as high as the scattering rate in gold (Yor ~ 10-45-14), .
but in the mid-IR range the diameter a=1/10 exceeds dp and the loss rate decreases to Yerf <
10-8 5-1 beyond 4=3 pm, ie. it is less than the scattering rate in the semiconductor. For the
InGaAs nanoparticle the SPP mode exists only at 4 >3 ym, and, since for InGaAs in this range
a4=1/10 > Ap, the loss of the semiconductor SPP mode always remains higher than that in the Au
SPP mode, despite the fact that the scattering rate in the semiconductor is lower. Note that, in the
end, at long wavelengths with a >> dp the effective loss becomes simply yogg Â© yAp/ma, and hence
the proper figure of merit (FOM) for the material should be w,/y (as first indicated in [15]) and not
w/y, which is often used. According to table 1 the proper FOM is always higher for metals than for any
of the semiconducting materials.
