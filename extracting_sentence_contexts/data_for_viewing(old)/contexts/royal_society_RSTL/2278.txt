stinct functions ; it is the body formed by the convergence of the great tracts of the
cerebrum, where these tracts respectively meet and decussate ; in it the tract of the
corpus olivare is joined to those of motion and sensation.

Below the medulla oblongata the spinal marrow commences, or rather is prolonged
from it, but it is constituted with a distinct arrangement of its columns. On each
8ide it receives three columns from the cerebrum, besides those which come down
from the cerebellum, under the name of corpora restiformia, to form its posterior
part, and these columns enter into relations which do not exist, aboye.

Decussation of the Posterior or Sensitive Part.

We have noticed a fact of more than ordinary importance as reconciling the occur-
rence of symptoms, with our knowledge of anatomy. Where the posterior tract, de-
scending from the cerebrum, has reached the point of the medulla oblongata, just op-
posite to the decussation of the corpora pyramidalia on the fore part, we described a
coalescence, We have already stated, that when we proceed to separate the columns
on the sides of the slit called calamus scriptorius, we see small, neat, and regular fila-
ments, as it were, interlacing and joining the two columns. But when we examine
farther, we perceive that these filaments belong to a plate of fibrous texture which
passes in the central plane from before backwards (Plate XX. fig. B.). This striated
septum stops or is interrupted by the union of the columns of sensation ; and now
attending to the fibres of these two columns, we find them to decussate with an inter-
weaving as distinct as that of the corpora pyramidalia or anterior columns (Plate XX.
fig. 2. c.). After this union and decussation has taken place we may trace the nervous
