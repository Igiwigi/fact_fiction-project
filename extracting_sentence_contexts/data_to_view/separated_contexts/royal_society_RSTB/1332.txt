At the decussation the fibres cross to the opposite side, and no direct
Pyramidal tract is left behind. A few fibres of the pyramid at the lower level of the
ussation instead of crossing to the opposite side may curve round in the form of a
fgnall bundle to enter the crossed pyramidal tract of its own side. Corresponding
#ith this fact, a very few degenerate fibres may be observed in the crossed pyramidal
Bact on the same side as the lesion.
Â© Laneuey,t in summing up the various observations upon descending degenerations,
ates that in no case apparently did unilateral brain injury cause degeneration of the
@pposite pyramid, although, in the cord, both crossed tracts might be degenerate. Since then little evidence has been brought forward to show that the opposite
pyramid may degenerate after unilateral cortical injury. Hamirron, loc. cit., believes
that fibres may enter the opposite pyramid by way of the corpus callosum, and
Scnirert appears to have held a similar view.
