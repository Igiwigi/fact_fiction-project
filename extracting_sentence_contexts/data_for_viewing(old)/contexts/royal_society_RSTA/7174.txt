Further data on the effect of diluents are available from a comparison of mercury ful-
minate with the composite initiator (fulminate, antimony sulphide and potassium chlorate)
664, although in this case the diluent is not strictly inert. It was found that at all temperatures
the induction periods for 664 are greater than those for pure mercury fulminate, this differ-
ence increasing as the temperature decreases. The calculated energies of activation for these
two initiators are, however, practically identical.

E(mercury fulminate) = 25-1kcal. (6-6-4) = 26-6 kcal.

Again, at quite low temperatures, the amount of 664 used must be increased above its
normal value in order to get it to detonate. The violence of the detonation of both mercury
fulminate and 664, at temperatures which correspond to induction times of the order of a
few minutes, was noticeably less than their violence at higher temperatures, a fact which
points to a slow thermal decomposition of the mercury fulminate during the induction
period.

In view of the marked dependence of the length of the induction periods of mercury
fulminate on its amount (see p. 211) it would not be evident from the above experiments
whether the longer induction periods for 664 result from the smaller amount of fulminate,
or from dilution. This point was settled by increasing the amount of 664 so that its fulminate
content was equal to the amount of fulminate normally used in ignition experiments. Even
with amounts of 664 containing the same weight of fulminate as used with this substance
alone, longer times were obtained, showing that dilution increases the induction period.
