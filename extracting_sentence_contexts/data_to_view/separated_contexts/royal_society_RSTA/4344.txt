Since a single optical amplifier has sufficient bandwidth to simultaneously
amplify tens of signals across the entire WDM band (e.g. the C band), considerable savings in
cost and energy could be achieved. More channels were added at higher data rates without a
significant change in cost or energy. In fact both the cost per bit and energy per bit scaled down
at exponential rates [19,20]. In recent years, however, the full band for erbium-doped fibre amplifiers, which are the
predominant amplifier in commercial systems, has become fully exhausted and the spectral
density of the transceivers is approaching the Shannon channel capacity limit. Likewise,


transmission distances have reached continental scales.
