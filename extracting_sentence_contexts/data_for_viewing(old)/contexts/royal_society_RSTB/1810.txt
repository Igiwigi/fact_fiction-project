of one another.

This kind of curves gives occasion to some analytical remarks which are perhaps not entirely
without interest.

The discussion of the preceding diagrams offers a special difficulty. One is accustomed to judge on the
greater or smaller power of a force by the ascension or the decline of the curve, that is, by the height
of the ordinates. But in the present case the ascension or decline of the curve is of quite another
signification. So, for instance, in the diagram B, the lowest level of the curve is found with fathers
of 25, the highest with those of 45; but the natality of these latter is not higher, but sensibly lower,
amounting to 16'1 per cent., whilst that of the other is 48°5 per cent. The cause is that, in the common
diagrams, one of the two axes—in general the vertical one—is devoted to the measure, so that the
representation of the observed facts follows one axis only. In the above diagrams both axes refer to the
phenomenon observed, thus the height of the ordinates does not signify the height of the measure. It
requires some effort on the part of the reader accustomed to the common statistical diagrams to keep in
mind this special nature of diagrams on two axes.

Now let us look on which kind of curves would arise according to the different possible conditions,
To distinguish between the two ages, let us name that which follows the abscissw, the determinated, the
other the determinating.

The following conditions are possible:—(1) the greatest natality is quite independent of the age of
the other consort; or (2) the natality of the determinated sex is bound to a certain year of the deter-
minating one; or (3) to a younger; or (4) to an older age of it.
