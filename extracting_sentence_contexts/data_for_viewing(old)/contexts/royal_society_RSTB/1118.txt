spinal cord both to the cerebrum and the issuing nerves, such an exclusive et
becomes a matter of necessity.

It is well known that when by means of appropriate contacts the cross section is
compared with the longitudinal surface of a living nerve, an electromotive difference
is found to exist, of such a character that if examined galvanometrically the surface
is positive to the cross section. The current associated with this difference was
termed by its discoverer, pu Bo1s-Reymonp, the nerve current (nervenstrom), and
by others, Hermann, Herine, the demarcation current, since it is presumed by them
to have its seat in the zone of tissue which at once bounds and divides the region of
living from that of injured and dead or dying nerve. The use of cither of these terms
is, we consider, objectionable in the present instance, since our object is merely to
state the actual fact without involving any cause thereof; we will therefore designate
the persistent electrical difference just referred to the resting difference.

The difference was in all cases estimated in the following manner. By means of
the long compensator, described in the preceding chapter on apparatus, a known
difference of electrical potential was introduced into one part of the electrode circuit
of a sign opposed to that present at the electrode contacts, and the former was then
adjusted until the galvanometer showed no current to be present in the circuit ; the
original difference between the two electrode contacts is thus given in terms of
decimal fractions of the constant external source of difference of potential. As
already indicated, this source was the Callaud cell, the E.M.F. of which was itself
estimated by a similar balancing method in terms of a carefully prepared Daniell cell.
