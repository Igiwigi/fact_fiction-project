By
addressing risks first, we eliminate the most error-prone areas first. Testing is still important, but
it becomes a demonstration of correctness, not a mechanism for finding defects. In fact, defects
found in testing are indicative of a failure of an earlier verification step, and hence imply a need
to fix the process as well as the system. Our confidence in this strategy, underpinned by years of deploying it and monitoring the
resulting data, allows us to offer a warranty on our software. Small print applies, but basically
we fix defects for free.
