other substance which the ferruretted chyazate is known ty
precipitate, then it is necessary to 'separate such svbstance by
the usual means, before the' application of this test for iron.

With the knowledge of 'these facts, therefore, it is easy
always to obtain correct results, which will best appear by
assuming‚Äù a case particularly unfayourable for the purpose,
and shewing how the difficulties of that case may be ob-
viated.

Let it therefore be supposed that the analyst has a solution
having a considerable excess of nitromuriatic acid and: con-
taining oxide of iron, barytes, alumine, magnesia, and oxide
of copper, and that he wishes to precipitate the iron by the
ferruretted chyazate of potash. If he first throw down the
barytes by a sulphate, then the other earths and oxides by
ammonia, adding an excess of ammonia to redissolve "the
