the salts I haye examined, this presents, perhaps, the most singular peculiarities.

30 SIR J,. F, W. HERSCHEL ON THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF THE

The quality of its papers howeyer varies much with the doses of the ingredients, and,
in fact, I have never succeeded in hitting again that precise proportion of the argentine
and saline solutions which afforded the results I am about to state; and but that
every portion of a pretty large sheet of paper agreed in giving the same, and that I
have some of them now before me, I should hesitate to do 80. The preparation of
this particular specimen of paper, (marked 573-574 in my list of papers put on trial,)
was, 1st, nitrate of silver S. G. 1'132 ; 2nd, saturated solution of Rochelle salt ; 3rdly,
nitrate of silver 1132, which proving but little sensitive, a third wash of the nitrate
was added, by which its sensibility was materially increased, its other qualities re-
maining unaffected. The paper was of the kind called © smooth wove demy.”

fiducial point, of a delicate lead-colour, but faint and dilute, and when the action was
arrested s0on after the first impression made, such was the character of the whole
