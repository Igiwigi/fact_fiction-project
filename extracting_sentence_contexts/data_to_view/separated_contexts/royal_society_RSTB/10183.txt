The individual swifts remained
at the stopover for a few days up to one month, suggesting a
migration strategy including fuelling at stopovers, rather than
a continuous fly-and-forage strategy. Both stopovers in
autumn and spring were needed for fuelling, as individual
swifts remained in the area for a few days up to four weeks

(range: 1.5-32 days). Expected fuelling was supported by the (d) Migration in relation to winds
fact that the swifts arrived at the autumn stopovers on days Our swifts experienced positive wind assistance during
when the winds were favourable for continued migration spring migration, with especially good conditions for birds
across the Sahara (with tailwind-assisted flights towards selecting the western route rather than the central and eastern
south to southwest), but in spite of this the birds interrupted routes. In fact our evaluations of migration departures and
migration (figure 2). During the stopover the wind assistance route selection relative to winds suggest that the swifts
along the preferred migration direction decreased for the following the western route in spring have the chance to
remaining period and had stayed negative throughout the exploit more favourable wind conditions compared with
stopover.
