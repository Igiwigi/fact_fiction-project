Various Remarks.

§ 12. On account of the pressure not being constant, it is necessary to investigate
the influence of its variations.

According to § 7 the cross-section of the jet increases about 1 per cent. for every
10 cm, the pressure decreases. The cross-section ought, then, to be measured at mean
pressure, but is in fact determined at the commencement of the experiment. If the
liquid pressure has diminished h cm. during the experiment, the mean cross-section is

h
2000’

where A is the measured cross-section. The corresponding correction [e] in the
surface-tension T is, then, with sufficient exactness

h
This correction is always negative.
