Indeed, in
some species* of Platycerium and Asplenium the apical cell of the root is so undifferentiated
that it may form a stem when necessity arises. The plasticity of the root is further
emphasized by the fact that the higher forms, under changed cecological conditions,
may lose the rootcap, as in Lemna, where “ root-pockets ”’ take its place, and in Cuscuta,
with its ephemeral root system, In view of such facts, it is not unreasonable to enquire whether even the retention
of centripetal primary xylem and the lack of a definite pith in most roots may not be
due to special conditions under which this organ grows and functions. To penetrate
soil, a solid core is advantageous, and from this viewpoint the centripetal growth of
the primary wood, often meeting in the centre and eliminating the pith, is a decided
advantage. Moreover.
