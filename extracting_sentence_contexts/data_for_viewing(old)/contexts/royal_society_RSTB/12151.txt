biofilm oscillations (a) Full model description

We consider a horizontal cross-section through the middle of a

Conceptually, biofilm oscillations can be understood to arise as biofilm (as depicted in figure 1a) which allows us to simplify the
result of a delayed, spatially extended negative feedback of system into a one-dimensional lattice, as shown in figure 3. The

create glutamine from glutamate and ammonium for biomass by a more detailed model (figure 3) that includes all the afore-
production. Since ammonium is not present in the MSgg mentioned metabolic interactions [5] (left half of figure 2) in
