organs. But although the locomotor centres of a covered-eyed Medusa are thus,
generally speaking, more diffused than are those of a naked-eyed Medusa, if we con-
8ider the organism as @ whole, the locomotor centres in the margin of a covered-eyed
Medusa are 7ess diffused than are those in the margin of a naked-eyed Medusa ; for, 80
far as my observations extend, I find that excision of the marginal bodies alone
produces a greater comparative effect in the covered-eyed genera of Medusw than it
does in the genus Sarsia. But of course it is needless to say a much wider basis of
observation than mine is required to establish this fact as applicable to the whole of
the two groups of Meduse. T may state, however, quite decidedly that in at least one
species of the covered-eyed group (viz. Aurelia aurita) the only portions of the margin
which are capable of originating spontaneous impulses to contraction are the eight
lithocysts, and that in a very large majority of individuals belonging to this species
excision of these minute bodies causes instantaneous and complete paralysis of the entire
gonocalyx, which paralysis is s0metimes also permanent *,

d 1. Mechanical Stimulation.â€”So far as my observations extend, I find that all
Medusz, after removal of their locomotor centres, invariably respond to every kind of
stimulation. To take the case of Sarsia as a type, nothing can possibly be more
