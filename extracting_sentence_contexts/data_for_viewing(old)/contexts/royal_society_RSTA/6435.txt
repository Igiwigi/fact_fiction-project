metrics that include AED to evaluate possible changes and future projections. Nonetheless, under 6 |
climate change, AED can be a powerful driver of drought severity [39,40], with multiple effects

(electronic supplementary material, figure S5). AED enhances evaporation from soils and water 3
bodies and transpiration from plants. This is particularly relevant during periods of precipitation oS

deficits in which increased AED contributes to reducing the water resources available to plants
and humans via enhanced ET [17]. Moreover, AED has direct and indirect impacts on plants
under conditions of soil moisture deficit; higher AED increases plant hydraulic stress and the risk
of xylem embolism and plant mortality [45]. No matter how much water is in the soil, increased
AED can cause plants to take in less carbon and do less photosynthesis [42,43].

AED’s diverse effects are complicated by the fact that the influences of AED on droughts ‘3
vary, depending on drought type (hydrological versus agricultural and ecological), climate SS
characteristics (i.e. water-limited versus radiation-limited regions) and precipitation variability :B
[41]. Thus, during periods of available soil moisture, the effect of AED on plants is usually {=
positive, as high AED correlates with high temperature and radiation, favouring photosynthesis ia
and carbon uptake. On the other hand, when soil moisture is low, higher AED makes plant stress : =
worse. Moreover, although ET is slight in drought periods, any water loss caused by higher AED : =
can be important to guaranteeing plant water availability. Also, evaporation from soils and water 1B
