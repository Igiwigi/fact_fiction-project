In Peripatus, omitting for the time being the consideration of those segments that
form the gonads, it was shown by Sepewick’s careful work that the dorsal ccelomic
cavities, after the formation of the heart, become wedged in the angle between the
heart tube and the gut tube. As development proceeds they gradually dwindle in
size until they finally disappear, their collapsed walls remaining as the pericardial
floor.

In other Arthropoda the accounts differ. In most the fate of the dorsal ccelom is
stated to be very similar to that shown in Peripatus, e.g., Euscorpius (3), Scolopendra (13),
Agalena (15), Donacia (14). But in some it is stated that the ccelom spaces, after the
heart has been formed, enlarge and persist as the pericardial space, ¢.g., Theridium (17).
In fact, one of the most recent workers on Arthropodan embryology adopts the view that
a true pericardium must originate from the coelom, otherwise the space surrounding
the heart is only topographically a pericardium (2).

Estheria must be added to that group of forms the development of which agrees
with that of Peripatus. In Estheria there can be no doubt whatever that the coelom
pouches diminish in size and finally disappear, and that they do not in any way open
owt into the body cavity. It is significant that the forms whose development agrees,
in this respect, with that of Peripatus are forms that can be considered in many ways
