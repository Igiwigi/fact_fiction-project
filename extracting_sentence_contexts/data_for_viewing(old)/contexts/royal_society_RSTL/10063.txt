S nothing in common with the peculiar glands lying in its neighbourhood, either in its
E development, appearance, or secretion. He was followed by RuporLent (20) and
A HavasreD (1), the latter giving drawings of the two organs at various periods of li≈øe ;
and the facts were further confirmed by Barxow (21) and others. S1MoN (2),
however, accepted the older doctrine, holding that the thymus is very large in hibernat-
ing animals, and he partially founded upon this supposed fact his view of the function
of the organ.

The second error arose, as has been stated, about the game time. In 1673,
BarTnoLaNUs (22) as8erted that the thymus contains a cavity ; and a great parb of
many 8nbsequent anatomical researches were taken up with the various accounts of
this cavity, the openings into it, and other 8upposed facts about it. The existence of
a cavity was accepted by Hugo (23), who worked with Harrer, by Lucas (24), by
