Suppose that the curve which has to satisfy given conditions is a line ; the equa-
tion is az+by+cz=0, and the parameters (@, b, c) are to be taken as the coordinates of
a point in a plane. Any onefold condition imposed upon the line establishes a onefold
relation between the coordinates («, 6, c), and the parametric point is sitnate on a curye ;
a second onefold condition imposed on the line establishes a second onefold relation
between the coordinates («, Þ, c), and the parametric point is thus situate on a second
curve; it is therefore determined as a point of intersection of two ascertained curves. Tn particular if the condition imposed on the line is that it shall touch a given curve, the
locus of the parametric point is a curve, the contact-locus ; (this is in fact the ordinary
theory of geometrical reciprocity, the locus in question being the reciprocal of the given

curye;) and the case of the twofold condition of a contact of the second order, or of
two contacts, with the given curve, depends on the singular points of the contact-locus,
or reciprocal of the given curye; in fact according as the line has a contact of the
second order, or has two contacts with the given curve (that is, as it is an inflexion-
tangent, or a double tangent of the given curve), the parametric point is a cusp or a node
on its locus, the reciprocal curve: this is of course a fundamental notion in the theory
of reciprocity, and it is only noticed here in order to show the bearing of the remark
(ante, No. 14) upon the case now in hand where the curve considered is a line.

16. If the curve which has to satisfy given conditions is a conic
(a, b, &, f, g, kX, y, 2)*=0,

we have here six parameters (, 6, c, f, 9, k), which are taken as th
point in 5-dimensional space. It may be remarked that in this 5-dimensional space
we have the onefold cubic locus abe—af*—bg*—ech*+2fgh=0, which is such that to

any position of the parametric point upon it there corresponds not a proper conic but, a
line-pair; this may be called the discriminant-locus.
