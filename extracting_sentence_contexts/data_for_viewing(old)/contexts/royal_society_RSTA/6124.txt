Similarly, the (expected) global EP rate at time f is

Ly (u; tpx(t)

(6() = py LX (v; f)py(£) In wpe) (3.3)
C LE (v4 Pees oO

7To see this, first use the fact that for every unit w in any unit structure, whether that unit structure is tight or not, w C L(w).
Then note that if @ C £(w), at least one reservoir in £(w) would violate the requirement that the unit structure be tight.

5To see this, first note that —w C P(—w), since any set is contained in the associated puppet set. In addition, if there were
coordinates i ¢ P(—w) that lay inside w for some reservoir v, then there would be a coordinate j € —w such that P(v) contains
both jand j. That in turn would mean that j € P() and therefore j € £(w). However, that violates the assumption that the unit
structure is tight. Therefore P(—«) C —w. Combining establishes the claim.

°Note that for convenience in the definition of ‘in-ex information’ below, I adopt the convention that (Q(f)) is the expected EF
rate out of the system into the reservoirs, and so is the negative of the integrand in equation (1.3).


Example 3.1. In an MPP, each coordinate i is a ‘subsystem’; R = N; there is a bijection venga
