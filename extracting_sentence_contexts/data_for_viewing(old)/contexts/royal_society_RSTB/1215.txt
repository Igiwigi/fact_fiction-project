organisms. In some individuals the ccelomic fluid resembles a culture of microbes.
The organisms most commonly met with are certain bacteria, various species of
Protozoa and a nematode belonging to the genus Rhabditis. If the fluid has been
obtained by means of a capillary tube introduced into the ccelom, it will be found to
contain great numbers of yellow refringent spheres, which have been derived from
the yellow (or “liver ”) cells to which reference will be made.

- Symbiotic Micro-organisms (figs. 38-41). That microbes may live in certain
organisms without producing apparent evil results, is now a well-established fact.
Indeed symbiotic bacteria have been described as occurring even in the protoplasm of
a certain species of Amba (Bourne). In the coelomic fluid of the earthworm three
or four varieties of micro-organisms are usually present, but whether these are
symbiotic in the strict sense of the term, or whether they are parasitic may be
doubted. It is certain, however, that they occur in animals that are apparently
healthy. The microbes are mostly bacilli, but there are also micrococci and spirilla

specimens of the ccelomic fluid which were withdrawn with a sterilized pipette after
. animals had been thoroughly washed with a solution of corrosive sublimate.
‘Bho forms which occur in largest numbers, are large thick bacilli (fig. 39) many of
Yalich appear to have bevelled-off ends. On gelatine plates they form a discrete
white translucent colony with central whitish opacity. They liquefy the jelly some-
