We have, therefore, according to present views at leasb, three sets of fibres in the
Frog's vagus, viz. : fibres which are capable of slowing or entirely preventing the dis-
charges from the motor ganglia ; fibres which accelerate those discharges ; and fibres
which in s0me way or other diminish the force of the cardiac contractions. In addition,
we have various statements that sometimes only one vagus is active, thab ab certain
times of the year the vagus loses all power, &c. The literature of the snbject then affords ample evidence of considerable discrepancy
not, only as to the explanation of the action of the vagus, but also as to observed facts
connected with that action. The reason of this confusion will appear in the following
pages, and I will say at present that it is based upon a view of the nature of the
action of the vagus, which appears to me to be too much one-sided. Too great promi-
nence has hitherto been assigned to the action of the nerve upon the motor gangliaâ€”
too little to its action upon bhe muscular tissue.
