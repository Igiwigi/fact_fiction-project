“3 ‘This type, only occurring three times, presents considerable confusion of arrange-
ment, which deprives it of much importance. The localisation of the commencement
& of the march was fairly constant, viz., movement of the small toes, followed by that
‘2 of the hallux. Consequent on the movement of the hallux we should naturally have
2 expected movement of the ankle, and then of the hip and knee. At centres 64 and 78
B this was indeed the case, but at centre 55 movement of the ankle terminated the
march.

= It will be remembered that in a few, comparatively rare, instances the ankle, knee, and
= hipcommenced movement in the limb. It appeared to us likely that some interesting

& facts might be obtained by analysing these exceptional cases. This we did, and the
3 results are best arrived at in the following order :—

& (a.) Ankle Type.—The study of the march, when the movement is begun by the
a ankle, gave the following order, which was fairly constant, viz. :—

5 Ankle, Toes, Hip, Knee.

(b.) Knee Type,—Similarly, summation of the instances when the primary move-
ment began in the knee was productive of the following result, as the most usual

order of the march, yiz. :-— ;
Knee, Hip, Ankle, Toes.
