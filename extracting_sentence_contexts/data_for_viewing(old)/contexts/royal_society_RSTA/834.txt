was just one path we could have taken. This makes reality
relative to your point of view, which is not necessarily
a bad thing given the Copenhagen interpretation of
quantum mechanics.

In this point of view, physical reality as we know
it should be characterized or in some sense created by
the decision to adopt certain axioms or assumptions.
The difference with most mathematical subjects is that
we do not a priori know what the axioms are but are
working backwards to find them. My thesis in [1-3]
was that if we eventually succeed, then we will in
fact uncover a characterization of what it is to be a
physicist. And knowing this, one can anticipate that one

of the central axioms of physics should turn out to be rooted in the scientific method, which one
can formulate as a dual relationship between theory and experiment.
