and raises it to a certainty about the future. For example,
Coleman [9] said that the demographic transition ‘described
the reduction of birth and death rates from traditionally high
levels to the low levels now nearly universal in industrial
societies. Whatever the arguments about its causation, few
now question its irreversibility...’. Likewise, Basten et al. [5]
state that: ‘Fertility forecasting has been dominated by the para-
digm of the demographic transition. Fertility was thought to
fall from a high comparatively stable level to a low compara-
tively stable level. This transition was considered to be
irreversible, so once a low enough level of fertility was achieved
it would never increase.’ Furthermore, Lutz [6] states that:
‘In fact, the social sciences as a whole have yet to come up
with a useful theory to predict the future fertility level of
post-demographic transition societies. Forecasters can only
try to define a likely range of uncertainty. As the fertility tran-
sition is irreversible, we are quite sure that the fertility rate will
not go back to pre-transitional high levels. . .’.

One demographic criticism of the dogma surrounding the
fertility transition is that fertility levels often do not stabilize
at a new equilibrium near replacement level [4,5,7,10,11].
Rather, in many countries, the trend of fertility reduction
has continued to levels well below replacement, failing to
stop at the hypothesized replacement-level equilibrium.
