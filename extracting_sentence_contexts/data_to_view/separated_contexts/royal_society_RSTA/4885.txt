This second point highlights that, even in a kinetic plasma, the nonlinear energy transfer is
essentially fluid in nature, and can be modelled as a nonlinear waveâ€”wave interaction. On the
other hand, the physical mechanisms responsible for damping of the turbulent fluctuations under
weakly collisional plasma conditions, as will be argued below, must be essentially kinetic in
nature, dominated by wave-particle interactions. Talso note that the physics of AlfvÃ©n wave collisions highlights the fact that plasma turbulence
is inherently three dimensional [9,17,61]. The linear term in (2.1) governs the propagation of
the AlfvÃ©n waves along the equilibrium magnetic field and is non-zero only when the parallel
wavenumber ky 40, requiring the inclusion of the field-parallel dimension. And the vector
