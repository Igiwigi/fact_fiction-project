8ettles down to the rhythm 1 to 2, at which it remains permanently, or ultimately
returns to a rate synchronous with the auricular (Plate 67, fig. 3).

In some cases the rhythm of the ventricular beats has remained for a long time
synchronous with every third beat of the auricles, instead of every second, as in
Plate 68, fig. 14, and in other cases, for a shorter time, with every fourth beat. This
latter rate of rhythm occurs frequently in the apex of the heart when the clamp js
placed across the middle of the ventricle and the beats of the apex and base of the
ventricle are compared (see Plate 69, fig. 16) ; here, too, however, the more permanent
rate caused by the compression of the clamp is that in which the apex beats synchro-
nously with every second beat of the base.

These facts show that direct compression of the tissue between the motor ganglia
and the ventricle causes a certain number of the impulses to be ineffective as far as the
causation of a ventricular beat is concerned, although, as shown by the auricular beats,
that compression has not interfered with the rate of discharge from the ganglia.
Either, then, the compression of the clamp in the auriculo-ventricular groove has
caused a diminution in the excitability of the ventricular muscle without altering the
strength of the impulses coming to it, or ib has diminished the strength of the impulses
to the muscle and 80 caused it to respond to every second instead of to every impulse.
Which of these two solutions is the most probable will be better discussed after the
consideration of the effects upon the ventricular rhythm of heating the auricles and
sinus only, and of the application of poisons to the ventricle alone.

When by the method described above the auricles and sinus alone are heated, any
