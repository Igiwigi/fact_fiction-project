experiment.

A central question remains as to what motivates volunteers, especially students and teachers,
to take part in CS projects. A study conducted by Raddick et al. [3], under the Galaxy Zoo project,
points to ‘contribution’ to a original scientific research as a major motivation to engage with
this particular CS project to classify the morphology of galaxies obtained from large datasets.
According to these authors, different citizen scientists will be driven by their own set of individual
motivations, and more research is needed to shed light on the science learning outcomes, if any,
gained by the contributing volunteers.

On the other hand, a study conducted among the astronomy scientific community gives us
some insights into scientists’ views on education and public outreach [4]. The authors of that
study highlighted the fact that astronomers develop their scientific aptitude from a very early
stage (often at primary school level), and therefore they see the benefits of exposing youngsters
to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) related activities. The authors also
point out that outreach is still seen by many peers as a hobby and it often lacks financial support
from grants and policy-makers, alongside a lack of encouragement from senior staff within
academic departments.

Earlier familiarization with STEM subjects was also the topic of a recent report commissioned
by the Women In Science and Engineering (WISE) organization under their campaign
‘People like me’ [5] (www.wisecampaign.org.uk/uploads/wise/files/not_for_people_like_
me.pdf). The author explores reasons for the UK shortage of skilled workers in STEM, which
reinforced the idea that more needs to be done to engage with schools-based audiences. This is
especially so for those from under-represented backgrounds in higher education (HE) institutions.
