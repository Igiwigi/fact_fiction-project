The original result of WaTanase and Imaizumi was given for dry air containing no
carbon dioxide and has been adjusted by — 0-0003 x 107° M, corresponding to the
introduction of the normal proportion of 0-03% of carbon dioxide. The same adjust-
ment has been made to the present result. In addition, a further small adjustment is
