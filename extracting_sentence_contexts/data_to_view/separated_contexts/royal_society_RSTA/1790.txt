Indeed, in fig. 2 of [1], we see that the reflection coefficient
of the counter-rotating modes asymptotes a constant value. This value depends on the azimuthal

number and is about 0.2 for = —1 and smaller than 0.1 for m = —2. :
This observation can be explained if one does not consider the vortex core to be a purely [3
absorbing membrane, as a rotating black hole, but rather reflects parts of the waves. We therefore : =
modify the connection formula and assume that the vortex core has an impedance characterized : 5

where S denotes the fact that we have taken into account the extra reflections between the 1
reflected wave from the vortex core and the saddle point. The spectra obtained for a non-purely : §
absorbing vortex are represented by the dashed curved in figure 5 for Z=0.25. The value of : 8
Z is arbitrary and is chosen only to illustrate the result.
