account for the concentration of the chalazal nuclei, and it is quite possible that their
somewhat smaller size may be associated with the same fact. As in Gnetum, there
is a fundamental difference in the future behaviour of the nuclei of the two ends of
the prothallus with which it is natural to connect the differences seen at this early
stage ; but it must be regarded as possible that these are of physiological signifi-
cance only. Very little starch is present in the cytoplasm of the embryo-sac
or in the cells of the nucellus. Lorsts* suggests the possibility that in the sac of
Gnetum Gnemon “the nuclei found in the “upper half are all descendants of the
“ one daughter-nucleus of the embryo-sac-nucleus, while those in the lower half are
“ descended from the other daughter-nucleus.” As regards Welwitschia there is
no evidence bearing upon this point. In Sequoia sempervirens there is a similar
accumulation of nuclei and cytoplasm in the chalazal region of the embryo-sac, and
its resemblance to a stage in the development of the sac of Gnetum has not escaped
notice,t while, save for the presence of a large vacuole in its upper part, its likeness
