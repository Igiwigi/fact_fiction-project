The height of each tide, and the retardation of phage (or the
lag) are functions of the frequency of the tide, and of the constants expressive of the
physical constitution of the apheroid,

Each such term in the expression for the form of the tidally distorted gpheroid may
be conveniently referred to as a simple tide. Hence if we regard the whole tide-wave as a modification of the equilibrium tide-
wave of a perfectly fluid spheroid, it may be said that the effect of the resistances to
relative displacement is a disintegration of the whole wave into its constibuent simple
tides, each of which is reduced in height, and lags in time by its own special amount. In fact, the mathematical expansion in surface harmonies exactly corresponds to the
physical breaking up of a single wave into a number of gecondary waves,

Tt was remarked in the previous paper,* that when the tide-wave lags the attraction
of the external tide-generating body gives rise to forces on the spheroid which are not
rigorously equilibrating. Now it was a part of the aggumptions, under which the
theory of viscous and elastico-viscous tides was formed, that the whole forces which
act on the spheroid should be equilibrating ; but it was there stated that the couples
ariging from the non-equilibration of the attractions on the lagging tides were pro-
portional to the 8quare of the disturbing influence, and it was on this account thab
they were neglected in forming that theory of tides. The investigation of the effects
