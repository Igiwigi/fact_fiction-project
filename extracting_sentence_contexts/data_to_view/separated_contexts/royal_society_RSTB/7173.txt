These are early differentiated in the larva as the divergent terminal
portions of the ejaculatory duct invaginations. They exist before the junction of the two
parts of the efferent system takes place, In the pupa the vasa deferentia are represented
by those parts of the ectodermal ducts which lie between the vesiculae seminales and the
mesodermal vasa efferentia. This means that the duct which links each testis with its
vesicula seminalis is, in fact, partly ectodermal and partly mesodermal (figure 12 a). Ficure 12. The efferent system in the male pupa of Chironomus dorsalis: a, reconstructed
