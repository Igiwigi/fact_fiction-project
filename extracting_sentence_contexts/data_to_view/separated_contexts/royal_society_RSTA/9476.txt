DETONATION OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES OR BY THE IMPACT OF BULLETS. 449

The percentage of momentum trapped by short pieces is 13 per inch, and the
corresponding maximum pressure for the normal velocity of 1240 feet per second is

0°13 x 38
32°2 x 0°98 x 10-8 ~ 19700 Ibs. The maximum pressure which should be exerted by a perfectly fluid bullet having the
same mass and velocity is

0°35 x (1240)?
= 6 4
aa 6,700 Ibs

The time taken by the bullet to travel its own length is 8°4 x 10-® seconds. Thus
if the bullet were perfectly fluid, the whole momentum should be trapped in a piece
9 inches long, whereas in fact only 86 per cent. is so trapped. The errors inherent
in the method of experiment, which have been discussed in the last section, will all be
less at the lower velocity. On the other hand the rigidity of the bullet will be
relatively more important and probably suffices to account for much of the difference
between the theoretical and observed times of impact.
