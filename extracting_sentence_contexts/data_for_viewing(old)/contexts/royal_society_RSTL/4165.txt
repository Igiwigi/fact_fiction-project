is made in the interior of a bell, whether the air be rarefied or not. This blue re-
flexion is o√æserved on the side of the bell, and is to be seen whatever may be the
nature of the electrodes, or the colour of the light to which these give rise in the
centre of the bell ; only when this central light is very brilliant, it becomes slightly
paler by the effect of contrast,

I substituted for the platinum point a point of SK; but the plate of platinum re-
mained; this being positive and the point negative, I obtained a luminous arc more
than double the length of the are produced by the point of platinum. With respect
to the arc, instead of its being a cone of light, having its base on the plate and its
apex at the point, as was the case when the latter was platinum, it was composed
of a multitude of luminous jets diverging from different points of the plate, and
tending to various parts of the point of coke. This fact shows clearly the influence
that may be exercised by the negative electrode, the function of which is very far from
being a merely passive one. Let me add, that although the strength of the pile was
precisely the same as when the point was of platinum, not only was the laminous
arc much longer with the point of coke, but the heat developed in the plate of pla-
tinum was 80 much greater that it was s0on melted and perforated. The coke being
positive and the plate negative, the length of the arc was less than in the preceding
case, and particularly s0 in air, where it was sensibly less than in a vacuum. The heat
generated was however till yery great, the point of coke becoming quickly incan-
descent throughout. I ought to add, that with the point of coke, the luminous arc
was $0 brilliant that the blue light which I have mentioned almost entirely disap-
peared, which was not the case with any other kind of point.
