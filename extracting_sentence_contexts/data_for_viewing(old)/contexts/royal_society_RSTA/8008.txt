comparisons were made against a line-standard of known coefficient in the bath of the
comparator. The expansion formula for the bar Xy was found to be :—

L, = Lo [1 + (10-494¢ + 0-00595¢2) 10-9]
and the coefficient of expansion at a temperature ¢° C. was given by the expression :—
(10-494 + 0-00595 x 2t) 10-8.


156 J. EB. SEARS AND H. BARRELL ON DETERMINATIONS OF FUNDAMENTAL

The reduction of the determinations in air further involved a knowledge of the
refractive index of air and of its variation with temperature and pressure. Additional
complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by T, and © were
generally different, though only to the extent of 0-006,° C. on the average of the 16
determinations.

The method adopted for the reduction of the determinations in air cannot be properly
described without some reference to the experimental procedure. Each value of Xx
was obtained by deriving the difference between the observed value of Lg and the
observed value of (L; — X\). The value of L, was determined by optical multiplication
from one of the basic étalons, L, or Ly, and was expressed, therefore, in terms of waves
in air under the conditions of temperature and pressure existing in the basic étalon,
whereas the value of (Lg — Xy) was determined by direct measurement in terms of
waves in air under the conditions of temperature and pressure existing in Ly. It was
assumed that the pressure of the air enclosed in the étalon system was uniform.
