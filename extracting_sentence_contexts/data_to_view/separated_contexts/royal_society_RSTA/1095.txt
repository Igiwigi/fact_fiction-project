During this period mostly negatively
charged rain fell. The loss of negative charge and to a certain extent generation of
positive charge by the process already explained led the rear part of the cloud to acquire
an excess of positive charge and the field to become positive. That the cloud had really
an excess of positive charge is confirmed by the fact that during the period the rain-
drops mostly brought down positive charge. Lightning discharges occurred overhead in rapid succession during the period shown
by P and Q on the electrogram. These caused violent and very quick changes in the
record.
