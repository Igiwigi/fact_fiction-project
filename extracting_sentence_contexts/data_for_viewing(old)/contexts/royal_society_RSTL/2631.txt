Tre following observations have been drawn up with the view of communicating
to the Royal Society an anatomical fact of considerable importance in relation to
physiology ; and the author hopes that its promulgation will assist the labours of
those who are now engaged with researches into the functions of the central division
of the cerebro-spinal axis of the nervous system in Man.

In relating this fact it has been deemed unnecessary to dwell at length on the im-
portant inferences which may be drawn from it, or to preface it with many introduc-
tory observyations.

One of the few clearly established principles regarding the functions of the neryous
system, and for the discovery of which we are indebted to Sir CHaRLEs BELL, is that the
anterior roots of the spinal nerves are conductors of yolition to the voluntary musecles,
and the posterior roots of the same set of nerves conductors of sensation from all
parts of the body. This fact once clearly established, it follows as a consequence
that the anterior and posterior portions of the spinal cord must perform a similar
office to the anterior and posterior roots of the nerves connected with them, in con-
sequence of the continuity of the filaments of neurine which compose them. And
though the exact line of demarcation between these two tracts, for volition and sen-
