and 10 months for the 10 most frequent objects and the average for all other
objects.

well known to 10-month old infants; the many other visual
objects that comprise the visual clutter in everyday scenes
would be experienced much more rarely.

4. General discussion

From the infant perspective, individual mealtime scenes are
highly cluttered with many different objects in view. However,
across the scenes in the corpus, there is a small set of objects that
are repeatedly present. This statistical fact about the distri-
bution of visual objects suggests that not all the objects in the
clutter are equal contenders as referents for heard words. By
the Pervasiveness Hypothesis, the prevalence of a few object
categories biases the candidate referents that are tracked and
linked to heard words, a proposal that is supported by the
observed correspondence between the set of highly frequent
visual objects and normatively first-learned object names.
These findings provide new insights about how truly novice
learners may break into object name learning. They also illus-
trate how a developmentally informed conceptualization of
statistical learning may emerge as the plausible mechanism
through which infants learn their first object names.
