its anatomical structure: it is highly vascularized with arteries and veins in midbrain, is
surrounded by the pulsatile flow of the CSF and it is more connected to the lungs. These
factors have been reported to induce stronger changes in the magnetic field Bo [44,45]. The well-
established physiological noise correction methods sharply regress out a very large proportion
of spurious variation in the brainstem signal. Nonetheless, the linear correlation analysis across
subjects still shows that brainstem activity is associated with HRV. The simple mean value


of heart rate reveals such relationship with spontaneous point process response durations. In
addition, LF power, which is generally thought to be modulated by both sympathetic and
parasympathetic activity, is robustly correlated with the response duration in the midbrain.
These phenomena are not affected by different processing pipelines, but cannot be evidenced
with longer TRs. This may be explained by the fact that a more precise estimation of
haemodynamic response duration requires a higher sample rate. To further confirm the effect
from different magnitude field strength, a short TR acquisition with a 7T MRI scanner would be
a great resource.

With longer TRs, the associations between HRF parameters and HRV are more sensitive to the
processing steps. No significant correlation could be found after performing the physiological
noise correction first. Moreover, the spontaneous point process response magnitude and its
normalization (PSC) are the only indexes that are correlated with HRV parameters. Apart from

LF power, SDNN is also significantly correlated with brain areas involved in autonomic activity. : =
SDNN also reflects both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, providing an index of total : yy
HRV [46,47]. Our results reveal that LF and SDNN share regions in MCC that are correlated : 2
