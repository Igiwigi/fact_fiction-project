somewhat sigmoid, with secondary flesions near its junction with the esophagus. As we have previously pointed ont, the dorsal wallof the anterior chambey: ig closely
related to the under surfaces of the expanded transverse processes of the fourth aud
fifth yertebrs, and also to the subyertebral keel whieh the complex and fifth yertebral
centra, with their investing superficial ossitications, combine to form (fig, 23, a.b.). Tn fact the median portion of the dorsal wall, as fur posteriorly as the primary trans-
verse septum, is deeply grooved externally ly the impression of the subyertebral keel,
and this inpushing of the dorsal wall, which is visible internally as a prominent medio-
dorsal ridge, to some exient constricts the anterior chamber into two laterally bulging
halves, while the vertex of the A-shaped transverse septum has the effect of con-
tinuing this constriction into the postertor wall of the chamber (figs. 18 and 23), On
the other hand, the lateral compartments lie comparatively freé in the abdominal
cavity, or at. all events are only related laterally and dorsally to the musculature of
the body wall, the slender transverse processes and ribs, and to the mesonephros, but
in no way are they attached to, or protected by, any special outgrowths or modifiea-
tions of the skeleton as is the case with the anterior chamber.
