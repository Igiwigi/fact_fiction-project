FIBRES OF THE INTERNAL CAPSULE OF THE BONNET MONKEY. 85

We are now in a position to point out the chief facts of interest to be noted in
Table V., and which illustrate the relation between the localisation of motor or
efferent function in the cortex and that in the capsule. Under the drawing, fig. 7,
we have inscribed in their accurate relative positions the arrangement of the capsular
fibres. If lines be laid obliquely as stated on p. 79, the exact correspondence of the
cortical capsular representation will be readily seen.
