tule of sixâ€™ was introduced that prevented groups of more
than six individuals meeting simultaneously.

This paper was one piece of evidence that suggested
that minimal social distancing measures, such as banning
gatherings on their own, would not be sufficient to prevent a
large-scale epidemic in the UK. When we first conducted this
analysis in March 2020, we calculated the population-level
reproduction number as the unweighted mean of the individ-
ual reproduction numbers, which led to smaller attributable
fractions to groups. Ideally, we would have constructed a
who-infected-whom matrix, but the SCS did not contain the
age of contacts. Instead, to capture the fact that highly con-
nected individuals contribute more to the reproduction
number than less well-connected individuals, we used the indi-
vidual reproduction numbers as a weight with which to
calculate a weighted mean of reproduction numbers.

This analysis was conducted before genomic sequencing
could be used to quantify the role of superspreading and
large events. In a phylogenetic analysis of cases in the
Boston area, USA [19], 29% of cases were reported to be
responsible for 85% of secondary infections. In our analysis,
29% of participants reported 77% contacts. After accounting
for contact duration and risk of infection (as we do in the
