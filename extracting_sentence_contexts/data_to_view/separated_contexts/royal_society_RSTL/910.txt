of the repetition of them, 21z. the appearance of a deposit from
the carbonated hydrogenous gas during its etectrization, and the
formation of ammoniac by the same process. In some expe-
riments, which I made on the first portion of gas, both these
facts were sufficiently apparent ; but- neither of them occurred
on electrifying the gas which was afterwards procured. Sus-
pecting that the cessation of them arose from the superior
purity of the latter portion from azotic gas, I passed the electric
shock through a mixture of carbonated hydrogen with about
one-fourth its bulk of azote, and thus again produced the pre-
cipitate, which would have been of a white colour, if it had not
been obscured by minute globules of mercury, that were driven
upwards by the force of the explosion. An infusion of violets
was tinged green when admitted to the electrified gas; but the
change of colour did not occur instantly, as happens from the
absorption of ammoniacal gas ; and required for its production
that the liquid should be brought extensively into contact with
the inner surface of the tube.
