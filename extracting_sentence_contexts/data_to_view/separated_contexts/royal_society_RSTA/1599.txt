Remarkably, for
a particle with constant unitary mass (mj =1,4 =0), the PDM-Duffing oscillator (equation (2.9)
is reduced to the bistable oscillator considered in the pioneering work on VR by Landa &
McClintock [23]. As expected for this special case, VR is observed as shown in figure 4. In fact,
the results of the preliminary analysis for a PDM-Duffing system with constant unitary mass as
presented in figure 4a are consistent with both the theoretical and numerical results presented by
Blekhmann & Landa (see fig. 2b of [106]). Further evidence of VR in this special case is presented
for the dependence of the response amplitude Q on the HF amplitude g for three values of the LF
w(= 0.1, 0.25, 0.1), as shown in figure 4b for f = 0.01. Next, we consider the effect of the PDM parameters on the observed resonances and thus
focus on the possible impact of the mass parameters mo and 4.
