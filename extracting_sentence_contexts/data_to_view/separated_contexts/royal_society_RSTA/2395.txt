In figure 2a-c, note that increasing yg can be understood as a spectral shifting
that reduces the time needed for the agents to achieve consensus.

6. Conclusion

In a class of MAS, a PR protocol is designed such that with each agent using this protocol, the
speed of consensus reaching of agents can be modulated accordingly by means of dominant
(rightmost) roots of the arising PR-controlled MAS. In contrast with prior work, the PR protocol
here is based on the fact that the eigenvalues of the graph-Laplacian underlying the network
are in complex conjugate form. An analytical approach is constructed to tune the PR controller
based on these eigenvalues, which complements the prior work devoted to the case of real
eigenvalues. Future work includes finding an analytic solution to the function Fj,,,, in theorem 4.1
guaranteeing its negativity, establishing a unified framework handling a mix of real and complex
graph-Laplacian eigenvalues, assessing whether or not real versus complex eigenvalues affect the
performance of PR controllers in terms of control effort and noise rejection, and studying various
graphs comprising of directed and/or undirected links.
