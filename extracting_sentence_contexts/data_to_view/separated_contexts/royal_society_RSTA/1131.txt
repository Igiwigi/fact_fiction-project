When travellers arrive in the Chinese territories, they
are beaten as in passing (to counteract the congestion of blood in the brain) (translated by
Sprenger [19], pp. 359-360). Caution is needed with regard to the comment of al-Mas’tidi about effects of niishadir on the
brain. This may reflect the fact that the Chinese term, nao sha, includes a component referring to
the brain, so that nao sha was sometimes termed brain salt (see [20], pp. 446-447), for which there
are several possible explanations.

(b) Early ammonia science and philosophy

While the above examples illustrate the historic importance of ammonium in trade and air Dw
pollution, these were probably not the earliest applications. Pliny the Elder (Natural History 28: 19
19, 149) was already familiar with use of the fumes of deer horn and hair to make people breathe :8
naturally when choking with hysteria. This use is directly analogous to the eighteenth century 8
popularity of ammonium carbonate as ‘smelling salts’; these liberate gaseous NH3, which acts as :
a vasodilator in the airways.
