The following observations were made during the months of February, March, and -
April, at Naples, in 1872*. The eggs of Loligo were obtained in abundance from the
fishermen, as the spring adyanced becoming more common. They were preseryed in a
basin into which a jet of sea-water was allowed to run continually; others were smnk
in a basket in the fishermen's harbour at Santa Lucia. I chose the eggs of Loligo
rather than of Sepia for the purpose of commencing the study of the development of
the Cephalopoda, because the egg-envelopes are colourless, and the egg itself sufficiently
small to be transparent and easy to examine in the living state. The eggs of Sepia, on
the other hand, require very careful treatment in order to remoye the dark-colonred en-
velopes, and are even then unwieldy objects for examination with high powers in the
fresh state. The first part of the observations recorded below relate actually to the
ovarian egg of Sepia, on which I found it more convenient (from the size of the eggs
and from the fact that I possessed well-preserved oyaries of that genus) to carry out
inquiries as to the mode of building-up of the egg previous to fertilization, and as to the
significance of its basket-worked tunic. At the same time IT have made many parallel
observations on the ovarian eggs of Loligo itself; and T believe that it may be asserted
with full confidence, that the oyarian egg of Loligo differs from that of Sepia only in
the size to which it attains.

In examining the progressive deyelopment of the deposited eggs of Loligo, T adopted
the following method of manipulation. One of the finger-like colourless strings of the
eggs being taken, T removed the outer coating of gelatinous matter, 80 as to expose the
deeper gelatinous material which forms a separate capsule to each egg, the capsules
being grouped longitudinally in four series around a central gelatinous string or axis ;
then with the scissors one, two, or three eggs were easily detached in their capsules and
