According to the Liouville theorem, regular compact connected fibres are two-dimensional
Lagrangian tori which coincide with orbits of the R?-action. We say that a fibre Lj, is singular
if it contains a singular point, i.e. a point P such that dH(P) and dF(P) are linearly dependent.
Equivalently, we may say that Lyf is singular if it contains an orbit of a non-maximal dimension,
ie. 1 or 0. A general problem of the theory of singularities of integrable systems is to describe
the topology of singular fibres and their saturated neighbourhoods (similarly for singular orbits).
Note that the fact that F and H commute makes this theory rather different as compared to the
classical singularity theory of smooth maps.

The description of singularities assumes at least three different settings: topological, smooth
and symplectic. For instance, saying that two given singularities (points, orbits or fibres) are
symplectically equivalent, we mean the existence of a fibrewise symplectomorphism between
their neighbourhoods. Throughout the paper, in addition, we assume that all the objects we are

working with are real (or complex) analytic. : =

In this paper, we discuss just one particular type of singularity, namely parabolic orbits and : a
cuspidal tori (speaking informally, a cuspidal torus is a compact singular fibre that contains one 73
parabolic orbit and no other singular points). aes
