1n fact in the aforementioned procedure, we somehow extended g and Gy also to possible non-Lebesgue points. This can be

done more carefully. Namely, one can consider f'* g(r) dt and f;** Gu(#(t) — 9). These are surely continuous with respect

to f €[0,T]. Then thanks to (3.54) and (3.55), we see that

f * g(t)dt > g strongly in C({0, T];L7(2)).
