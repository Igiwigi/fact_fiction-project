Sometimes a greater or less number of the rods of neighbouring series are shifted
abruptly upon the rest in a longitudinal direction, &0 much s0 that their heads may
come to be opposite the middle of the shafts of the remainder (se fig. 1). In 8uch
cases the transverse striz also become correspondingly shifted. This fact would of itself
almost preclude the conception of the existence of continuous membranes extending
across the fibre, an idea which has been largely prevalent of late years. The variations which occur in the form of the muscle-rods are chiefly, if not entirely,
dependent, upon the relation in size which subsists between the shafts and the ends,
these seeming to be in inverse ratio with one another. Thus the shafts are not unfre-
quently increased in length, the heads at the same time becoming smaller and closer
to those of the next series, s0 that a double row of dots is no longer seen in the middle
