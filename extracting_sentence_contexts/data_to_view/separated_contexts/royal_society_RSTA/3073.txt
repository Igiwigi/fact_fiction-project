For the first time ever, there is an agreement by the international community on

priority areas for development with an actionable agenda and a global commitment to reach :2
certain targets and goals between now and 2030. The 17 SDGs constitute an agenda that seeks to : =
balance the three dimensions of sustainable development—social, economic and environmental— : 3
as well as issues of governance and institutions [3]. This is in recognition of the fact that it is : =
difficult, if not impossible, to achieve socio-economic gains if the environment, and threats such 2
as climate change, are neglected; and that promoting synergies and mitigating or eliminating [3
trade-offs among SDGs is essential for achieving this balance and for helping achieve the : a
temperature targets of the Paris Agreement. In this regard, understanding how the various SDGs (8
are interlinked is crucial to the formulation of good policies and more effective action and finance : 3
in support of implementation. 7S

One of the messages of this review is that the success of each of these two global agreements
will depend heavily on the other and on the capacity of countries to develop and implement
programmes of action to address their climate and development objectives in an integrated,
coordinated and comprehensive way. Institutions, policies, governance and finance will need
to play key roles in support of these efforts.
