> 92. The cube in this case is exposed to pressures on two faces, and is free to yield in
S four directions at right angles to the pressure and opposite to each other respectively ;
S'but a cube snch as the unit-cube of our hell, exposed to pressures simultaneously on
four of its faces, is only free to yield in two directions parallel to each other and at
& right angles to the pressures. Direct experiments on this point have not, to the writer's
Z knowledge, ever been made; but certain facts well known to engineers appear to warrant
S the conclusion that rigid bodies, 8uch as cast or wrought iron, steel, or bronze, are
(nkened (7. e. the tendency to become broken up is increased) by the simultaneous
5 application of orthogonal pressures or tensions. 93. Thus, for example, the metal of the interior of a discharged cannon is exposed at
any point at once to compression radially to the bore and to two orthogonal tensions,
longitudinal and circumferential, and it is known that the resistance of the material
thus is less per unit of section than of the same exposed to tension or compression in a
single direction only.
