[12] could be decomposed into rational factors; then equating each of these factors to
Zero, we should have 80 many distinct forms of relation for a proper dodecagon. T

rime. But the coefficients Ã¾, y, 3, or 6, c, d, instead of being 80 many independent
Sibitrary quantities, may be given as rational functions of other quantities (if, for
Instance, the two conics are circles, radii R, r, and distance between the centres a, then
8, y, 3 will be functions of R, r, @): and it is in a case of this kind quite conceivable that
He functions [3], [4], &c., considered as functions of these new elements, should cease
EN be prime functions. In fact, in the case just referred to of the two circles (the
Sriginal case of the Porism as considered by Ftss), the functions [4], [6], &c., which

Joable into two factors: the memoir contains some remarks tending to show @ priori
hat in the case in question this decompoxition takes place. I was led to examine the
Foint by the elegant formulze obtained in an essentially different manner by M. Megx-
210Nn, Bull. de Acad. de St. P6t. t. i. pp. 15, 30, and 507 (1860), in reference to the
Zase of the two circles (it thereby appears that the decomposition takes place for the
uadrangle and the hexagon); and these formulee are reproduced in the memoir.
