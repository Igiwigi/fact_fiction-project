Now the importance of the scattering term
compared with the loss of energy due to ionisation of the absorbing substance
increases with the hardness of the rays, and we thus have an explanation of why,
even when screen and radiator are alike, the absorption falls away from exponential
with higher potentials and thick screens. It appears from the results that there is a considerable range in the hardness of the
rays from an anticathode, for which a screen of the same metal will show an
exponential absorption. The fact that the intensities of similar hard radiations from different anticathodes
follow the order of atomic weights and not that of densities, indicates for the cathode
rays encounters which are dependent on the properties of individual atoms, and not
on their behaviour en masse as a material. With heavy atoms a larger proportion of
cathode rays would be expected to undergo arrests sufficiently abrupt to produce
Réntgen rays than would be the case with lighter atoms. It is not one of the objects of this paper to discuss the “neutral pair” theory of
the Réntgen rays recently put forward by Prof, Brag, but seems to the writer

that it would be difficult, without some additional and special assumption as to the
properties of a “ pair,” to explain on such a theory the marked transparency exhibited
in the case of both primary and secondary rays when screen and radiator are of the
same metal, The agreement in the order of the number of reflected cathode particles
and the intensities of the accompanying Réntgen rays is also to be noticed.
