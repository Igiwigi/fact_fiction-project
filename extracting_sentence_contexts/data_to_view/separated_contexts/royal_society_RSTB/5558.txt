The short, hair-like, chitinous outgrowth on the body of
the torrent-inhabiting insect larvee becomes transformed into strong spines to enable
the animals to stem the current. The torrential fauna is full of such instances, though
it must not be forgotten that it is not only the parts that are modified, the organism is
modified as a whole. The fact that structural modifications are produced through change of functions
seems to have led to a great confusion in the study of animal adaptations ; for example,
Husavtrt (1927, p. 339) observes, “Cet aplatissement, cette petite taille ne sont-ils
pas au contraire deux états préexistants, qui ont facilité 4 ces organismes l’accés des
eaux courantes ?”’ Quite recently Popovict-BazNnosaNu (1928) has come to similar
conclusions from a study of the insect larvee inhabiting the torrents. Adaptation
means the adjustment of an organism to the conditions of its existence ; whether the
animal was favourably shaped when it entered a particular habitat, or was secondarily
modified in response to environmental factors, matters little. Those of the former
category would become adapted more easily than those of the second type.
