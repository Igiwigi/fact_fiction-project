neuroscientist, who has the ability to read someone’s neural
data and intervene in their brain events (call that person
Harry) just in case he is about to decide to take an action that
the neuroscientist disprefers. In these so-called Frankfurt
cases, one’s intuition is supposed to be that if the intervention
occurs, Harry is not responsible for his action, because he is not
really a free agent: he is forced to act as he does by the interven-
tion [21]. However, one is also supposed to have the intuition
that where the neuroscientist does not intervene, because
Harry chooses to do what the neuroscientist wants him to
do, Harry is the agent and is responsible for his action, even
if he could not have done other than he did. One might be
tempted to conclude from this example that it is the fact of
the intervention that deprives a person of free will and absolves
him of responsibility. That would be a mistake.”

Imagine, for example, that the neuroscientist is not evil, and
merely wants to ensure that Harry is able to carry out his
decision. Unfortunately for Harry, the neural circuit that
would allow him to implement his willing is damaged: there
is a disconnection that prevents his will from issuing in
action. Now the helpful neuroscientist intervenes in the follow-
ing manner: if he detects a neural signal at the input end of the
disconnection site, he is to send an electrical pulse to the output
side of the disconnection, effectively reuniting the normal
