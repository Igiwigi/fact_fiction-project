, in fact, ascertained that a considerable amount of the total product of zinceth yl
in an operation in the copper digester, is decomposed during the nes
tion,â€”one of the products of decomposition being metallic zinc in a finely divided
te, which is always found in large quantity interspersed throughout the iodide of zinc
in the digester. The temperature required to expel the ethereal solution of zinc-
methyl from the digester is less than 140* C., whilst zincethyl cannot be wholly expelled
below 1909, or even 200? C.
