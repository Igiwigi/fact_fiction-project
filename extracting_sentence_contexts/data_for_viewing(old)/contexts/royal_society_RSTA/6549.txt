ghately i in a ratio of equality with qu'* a 1 which is the theorem to be proved.
3 We have thought it desirable to obtain the formula $4 = Fy + Oz for its own sake, but, so far as
“Begards the proof in question, that might be obtained more expeditiously from the expression given for
A/2 — ve without introducing the series Fq.
= It is easy to ascertain the ultimate value to which © converges. In the first place, the series of
Gractions 1g + 1fgt + Iqt+...to e—2 terms (where « is the rank of q) may be shown to be
always finite, and consequently, when divided by «, converges to zero.

For we know that (p — q) > (q—1)? > (r—8)*... > (6—3)"~*. Hence the last term of the

{In fact, from § 1 (p. 299) it may easily be shown mer the last term of alla series gi, gt, gt... > M*

Hence, retracing the steps by which @ has been obtained, and observing that p' differs from p by a
finite multiple of 1/2, we have ultimately 9 = v =k — 3p' = k — 3p =k — Be=1—f=— yy. If, then
(using uz to denote the half of the sharpened att Hamiltonian number), we write t— 1/t. = vs, and
understand by G (¢—1/t) the infinite series (¢#—¢~!) + (A —t7 1) + (@—t-*) + ..., itis easily seen
that the principal part of /(vz41), regarded as a function of vz and a, is vs — 4Gu, + yee.
