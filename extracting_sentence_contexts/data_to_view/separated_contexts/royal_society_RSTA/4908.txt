Many examples of (trace functions of) bountiful sheaves, and also of
the more general situation of the next section, together with more statements of the resulting
estimates, are found in ยง3. Readers may wish to first read through this last section in order to see
more examples of the estimates we obtain. There is a certain inevitable tension in this paper between the fact that, on the one hand, we
deal with rather general phenomena, and on the other hand most applications involve extremely
concrete special cases. We hope to write a fuller book-length account of trace functions over finite
fields that will resolve this conflict by providing much more detailed explanations and examples,
but in the meantime, the current text should provide precise references for many applications. Any reader ina state of doubt concerning sums of the type considered here is welcome to contact
the authors.
