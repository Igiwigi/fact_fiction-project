brought near each other on surfaces of mercury, that repul-
5ion takes place.

Nor can the effect be referred to that kind of action which
occurs when electricity passes from good into bad conduc-
tors, as in the phenomena of points electrified in air, as the
following facts seem to prove. Steel wires were substituted
for copper wires, and the appearances were the same in
kind, and only less in degree ; without doubt, in consequence
of a smaller quantity of electricity passing through the steel
wires: and by comparing the conducting powers of equal
cylinders of mercury and steel in glass tubes, by ascertaining
the quantity of iron filings they attracted, it was found that
the conducting powers of mercury were higher than those of
steel ; the first metal taking up fifty-eight grains of iron
filings, and the second only thirty-seven.

Again ; fused tin was substituted for mercury in a porcelain
vessel into which wires of copper and steel were alternately
