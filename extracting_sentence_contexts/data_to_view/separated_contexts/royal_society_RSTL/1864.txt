Specimens of Brismeus,
in my collection, are attached to the side of an oyster-shell, in which they haye
destroyed part of two or three plates to form such a cavity ; but although the
shells of these boring Cirrhipedes are furnished with raised lamellze, the pro-
jections are placed across the valves in such a manner that no motion that could
be given to them would enable them to rasp a hole.
3rdly. That all the boring shells are covered with a periostracum, which is thin
in the Teredines, Pholades, Lasew, &c., and thick in the Lithodomi, and which,
if the animals used the outer surface of the shell as a means of boring, must be
very speedily rubbed off. Such a fact would be readily observyed, as this part
is never renewed after having been once destroyed ; which is easily understood
when we consider, that it can only be formed on the edge of the shell before
the deposition of the shelly matter has adyanced beyond it. 4thly. That although the shells of Teredines, Pholades, some Petricole, &Cc.,
are covered with short spines and strizz by means of which they might be snp-
posed capable of rasping stones, other boring $hells, snch as the Lasece and
Lithophagi, are smooth.
