Benefits of ghost imaging

Another embodiment of ghost imaging that offers special performance is when parametric down-
conversion is phase-matched to give non-degenerate signal and idler wavelengths [14]. In this
way, the object can be illuminated at one wavelength and the spatial information recorded at
another, perhaps where the imaging detector is more sensitive or less noisy. Nearly all ghost
imaging systems demonstrated to date have suffered from the same practical flaw, namely that
the imaging detector is a raster-scanned, single-element detector, and this fact massively reduces
the overall effective quantum efficiency of the system in proportion to the number of pixels in the
image. Ideally, one would wish to use a detector array as the imaging detector; however, until
recently the cumulative noise of such arrays was too high to measure reliably the position of a
