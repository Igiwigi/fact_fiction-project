Tn connexion with the discussions of the expressions for the internal energy of the
material media it may be worth while emphasising the significance of the various
terms in the expression for the forcive on the polarised material elements derived in
the previous paragraph, especially the way in which the various terms arise and their
dependence on the term

in the complete current. Further, we may notice how the complete expression for the
change of intrinsic energy per unit volume, viz.,

(E+2[., Bl 9)

is derived, the latter term being due to the above-mentioned term in the current. FUNDAMENTAL FORMULATIONS OF ELECTRODYNAMICS. 225

This last remark points to the possibility of obtaining an elementary deduction of
the expression

E+ a [ms B]

for the complete electromotive forcive simply by calculating »the rate of change of
intrinsic energy of a moving bi-pole, and the calculation has in fact been carried out
by Larmor,* taking however a parallel plate condenser with equal and oppositely
charged plates, moving in a uniform magnetic field. An’analogous argument in the magnetic case will give a deduction of the magneto-

9. We have stated that the magnetic energy expressions just obtained are
effectively equivalent to those usually derived, whereas as a matter of fact this is true
only of the final result ; the various formule employed in the derivation of this result
are not in their usual form but it has been shown elsewhere? that they are consistent
with the complete dynamical theory, the more usual formule and the various
modifications of them which have from time to time been suggested being all
inadmissible on this score.
