For instance, take ¢, ¢’ to be ¢(x,a), ¢(x,b) so that p=p', X=, =a"; by
putting « = a,b in turn we have

(b, a) = —9 (a,b),
vw (b, a) = & (a,b), W(b,a) = —¥ (a,b),
Ay (x, a) (x, «)—¢ (wx, a) ¥ (x, a) = 1. Again, taking ¢, 9’ to be ¢(«, a), ¢’ (a, b), we have

and similarly

and

which is the formula to be used in the approximation. The right side of (6) is the
error committed when ¢’(b, a) is taken as equal to #(b,@); in it the term depending
on o’—¢ turns out to be unimportant, while when ’ = ) the rest is numerically less
than the square root of

It will be our object to choose p’ so that | (p—p’)’ dx is small, while at the same

time ¢’ can be expressed in terms of known functions, and, in fact, the interval (a, b)
will be divided into small sub-intervals in each of which p’ will be constant. Thus we
need the following lemma :—

If f (x) is a function limited and summable in (a,b) this interval can be so divided
into a finite number of sub-intervals, and a function (x) constant in each sub-

ch
interval can be so chosen that | (fx—px) dx is arbitrarily small.

5. To prove the lemma, let U, L be the boundaries of f(w); take 1—1 arithmetic
