254 Mr. BarLow on the rules and principles for

Experimental examination of the limits within which an error
in spherical aberration and dispersion may have place, without
producing a sensible defect in the object-glass.

17. Although I feel convinced that the method we em-
ployed for measuring a tool, would give us a true result
within ,5;th part of the radius, yet it by no means follows
that a new tool can be made within the same limits to meet
any computed radius. In fact, if all the accuracy of radii
were requisite which the strict theory requires, it would be
almost impossible to construct an object-glass that would
bear a practical examination ; fortunately, however, this is
not the case ; some scope may be allowed, without any very
sensible change in the performance of the telescope ; and to
ascertain within what limits it was necessary to confine the
error, was the object of the following experiments.

Experiment 1.

18. According to the preceding computation ( art. 14), we
ought to have for an 80 inch focus the following curves ; the
