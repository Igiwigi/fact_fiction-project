This does not,
of course, imply that any known form of Heterangium was the ancestor of any Medullosa
—a most improbable supposition—but that the Medulloseze generally may have sprung
from plants related to, and with the same type of stem-structure as Heterangium. Such
a view agrees better with the facts than would an attempt to derive the Medulloseze
from the Cladoxylez. The latter, indeed, conspicuously resemble the former in having
polystelic stems with secondary growth, but the structure of the individual steles is
strikingly different, notably in the fact that the primary wood of Cladoxylon consists
exclusively of scalariform trachese, without conjunctive parenchyma.{ I should, there-
fore, incline to regard the Cladoxylez as representing a parallel line of development
to that of the Medulloses, rather than as primitive members of the same series. In the organisation of the leaves, and in the course and structure of the leaf-trace
bundles, Medullosa anglica diverges widely from the Heterangium type, and stands
on the same level with M. Leuckarti, assuming, as I think the evidence justifies,
that the petioles of the latter really had the structure of Myelowylon Landriotii.
