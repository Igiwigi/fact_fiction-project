deformation, where the short time scale velocity field constrains the long-term (tens of thousands
of years) slip rate on major faults, providing an input into seismic hazard models of earthquake
recurrence [3,7-14]. The idea is that slip on individual major faults has a geodetic ‘identity’, driven
by a continual creep on the deeper extension of the fault where the rocks are too hot to behave
elastically. These models require hundreds of adjustable parameters to fit the short-term data,
including the geometry and depth to ductile creep (i.e. locking point) and coupling coefficients
for each individual fault, and estimates of long-term slip rates on block boundaries.

Lamb & Smith [15] argued that the block models of short-term deformation are unsatisfactory
because they require information on deformation at vastly different timescales ranging from
decades to hundreds of thousands of years, and they provide no insight into the driving forces
of this deformation, assuming the long term as essentially having a close correspondence with
the short term. Furthermore, the premise of the block models is undermined by the fact that
