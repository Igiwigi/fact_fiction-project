In particular: (i) the blanks showed no signs of individual and one Garifuna from Honduras [13,38]. Further-
contaminating Amerindian sequences; (ii) European-specific more, a match was found for the one D1 haplotype (Ht-08)
sequences originating from the researchers who directly par- with an individual from northern Brazil [39]. Finally, the
ticipated in this study were never observed during the three remaining haplotypes (Ht-02, Ht-03 and Ht-10) could
analyses (electronic supplementary material, table S3); (iii) all not be matched to any individuals from our database.

consensus haplotypes and haplogroups were determined
using multiple replicates (ie. samples from independent
extracts and amplifications performed at different times);
(iv) the mutational patterns of the clones were consistent
with those previously described for aDNA (electronic sup-
plementary material, figure S1); and (v) all results from the
HVR-1 sequencing and mtSNP genotyping were consistent.

(c) Y-chromosome analysis

Very few positive results were obtained for the Y-chromosome
SNP analyses, highlighting the fact that degradation of nuclear
genomic DNA in ancient human samples remains a problem. However, the paternal lineage of one individual from the
Grotte Cadet site was identified. This sample (Cadet-1) was
assigned to the Q-M3 paragroup.
