components (Ba and Bt, where Ba lies in the direction between the photospheric footpoints and By
is perpendicular to Ba), then for a photospheric velocity of v, Bt ~ vtB,/2L provided B,(t = 0) =0.
The energy injected into the corona (Poynting flux) is vB,B,/4 and equating this to the nanoflare
energy Q= 2LA),(BA, /81) gives Q~ Ty. Here, Aj, is the cross-sectional area of the magnetic strand
and Bty = By(t = Ty). To account for AR losses, the time taken to build up the required energy is
of order tens of thousands of seconds for typical parameters. If the nanoflare occurred sooner,
with a lower level of stress in the field, then the observed coronal radiation cannot be accounted
for in the case of the AR loops discussed here. In turn, this requires that By) must be in the range
0.25-0.5B, which in turn gives nanoflare energies of a few 10*4 ergs. This has several important
consequences.

(1) Models relying on the reduced MHD approximation [61-63] cannot account for AR
heating as their fundamental assumption of By «Ba will be violated. In fact when
Dahlburg et al. [62] included equation (2.1), temperatures of order 1 MK were obtained.

(2) We noted in §4 that Ty needs to be of order 500-2000s rather than in excess of 104s to
account for the range of AR observations. Cargill [34] and Lopez Fuentes & Klimchuk [64]
have presented comparable but slightly different arguments as to how this can happen.
If a stressed field relaxes by only a small amount, the Poynting flux into the loop is large,
due to its proportionality to By. This leads to an energy input proportional to Ty rather
than T?, but the larger Poynting flux ‘wins’ over the slower build up to give the required
values of Ty. This leads to a very different scenario for AR heating which requires a
highly stressed magnetic field undergoing small relaxations. This in turn reduces the
nanoflare energy by roughly an order of magnitude to a few 107 ergs while increasing
