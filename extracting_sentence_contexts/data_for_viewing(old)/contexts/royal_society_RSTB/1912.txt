“Ebres do not arise from all parts of the nucleus, but they take their origin from one
point, the apex of the elongated nucleus, at which point there is apparently a
wentrosome.
© In both cases we have the formation, apart from nuclear division, of cell walls
found nuclei lying free in a large mass of protoplasm, and in both cases the formation
§s preceded by an arrangement of fibres which run from the nuclei concerned ; in the
fhe case the fibres run to a definite point of the nucleus, in connection, apparently,
‘with a centrosome, in the other case the fibres arise generally from the surface of the
Sucleus.
= Similar radiations were described by StraspuRGER at the formation of walls round
$he free lying segmentation nuclei in the oosphere of Hphedra, but in this case the
fibres stand out equally all round at right angles to the surface of the nucleus. This
@ifference may be connected with the fact that in Ephedra the segmentation nuclei
Fie perfectly free, and separated by a considerable distance from one another, while in
Pinus the nuclei are closely aggregated together at the base.

a Owing to the presence of numerous proteid vacuoles, and of both large and small
Gtaining granules and masses in the cytoplasm, the minute structure of the latter is
not easy to make out.

In many of the preparations of younger oospheres signs of an underlying network
in the dense protoplasm were observed, but these were not sufficiently clear to enable
