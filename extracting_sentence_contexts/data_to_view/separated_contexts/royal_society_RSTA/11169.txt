place oceupied by branch-points at which only two branches interchange, in the
theory of Riemann surfaces; the usefulness of the method of self-inverse substi-
tutions depends on the fact that algebraic forms can be represented on Riemann
surfaces with only simple branch-points. Algebraic functions are not, however, the only ones which can be uniformised. Porncar&* has proved a general existence-theorem that, if 4, %,...
