of nitrogen, was lower in the dry substance of the more gramineons and the riper
produce of plot 14, than in the more mixed and less matured herbage of plot 16.

Another point of interesb brought out by a consideration of the mutual relations
of the botanical and the chemical results is, that whilst with the heavier, the more
simple, and the more gramineous herbage of plot 14, there was a greater actual
quantity of both nitrogen and of mineral constituents taken up over a given area,
the excess is comparatively small. In fact, with about 41 Ibs. more nitrogen applied
per acre per annum to plot 14 than to plot 16, the latter took up within about 7 lbs.
per acre per annum as much as the former, and very nearly as much of several of
the more important mineral constituents, The probable explanation of the obviously
more complete utilization, either of the nitrogen supplied, or of the stores of it within
the soil itself, is that, with the much greater variety of herbage, there was, at the same
time, a more varied range of root-distribution, and a more varied food-collecting
capacity. And, with these, there was, with actually less of the mineral constituents
taken up with equal supplies provided, still very much more in proportion to the
nitrogen supplied, and to the increased luxuriance induced.
