is not necessarily so. If, for instance, a small thickness of material at the interface
between two crystals were to increase in volume, it could not be said without proof
that tensile stresses would not be set up thereby, in addition to compressions. In
some cases, in fact, it is obvious that there must be tensions. Thus, if the outer layer
of a sphere increases in volume, the matter inside must be subjected to a tensile stress. The effect of overstrain on the density of metals is at present under investigation
at the Royal Aircraft Establishment.
