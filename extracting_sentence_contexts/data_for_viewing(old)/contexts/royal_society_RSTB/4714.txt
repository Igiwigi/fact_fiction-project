[Note added November, 1922.—Since this memoir has been set up in type a notice
by Prof. Osporn has appeared, in the September number of “ Asia,” of the discovery
in China by Mr, Waurer GRANGER of an animal probably related to, or identical
with, Baluchitherium. Iam given to understand that the skull is nearly 5 feet long,
a fact which adds some weight to the view that Baluchitherium and Paraceratherium
are separate forms. The conformation of the lower jaw of the first-named animal will
help to decide the point, and the full description of Mr. Grancer’s important
discovery must be awaited with interest. |
