Fic. 23.â€”Records of transmitted excitation, with the block off and on alternately. Arrest of transmitted
excitation under electro-tonic block at BB. In the first case the blocking current was in one direction ;

in the second case it was sent in an opposite direction.

uppermost of the three records was taken without this block (fig. 22) and with a
stimulus intensity of 2. It will be seen that excitation was transmitted as usual, the
velocity of transmission in this case being 29 mm. per sec. The specimen was

exceptionally vigorous and the season the height of summer, which facts account for
the high velocity. The blocking current was next introduced. In order to prevent
the excitation due to sudden make of current, the applied E.M.F. was gradually
increased from zero to 2 volts, by means of a potential slide. During the passage of
this constant current, a second stimulus was applied of the same value as before ; and
it will be seen, from the lowest record, that there was no response, the transmission
of excitation being effectively blocked. In order to show that this block would only
persist during passage of the current, the latter was next reduced gradually to zero,
by manipulation of the potential slide. This was carefully done, to avoid the
excitation due to sudden cessation of current. On again repeating stimulation, the
block, as is seen in the middle one of the three records, was found to be no longer
operative, and response due to transmitted excitation took place as usual.
