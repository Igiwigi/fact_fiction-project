In the QBist framework, the average stabilization output of our model can be interpreted in
the following way:

At the initial instant of time t=0, each pair of players assigns their individual subjective
probabilities to selections of their strategies,

pill

These probabilities depend on the initial state % of the pair of players. By using the representation
of W% as superposition of the ‘certainty states’ gy, (see (3.1)) and Born’s rule, these probabilities
can be represented as

=p;(j;0), i=1,2, 7=0,1.

piGi) = lajol? + lajal? and p2(j) =leo,l* + lor,

for j = 0,1. In fact, for instance, we have p1(0) = (goo, 0)? + |(go1, %) |? and so on. If Yo is non-
factorizable (entangled), then p;(j) cannot be expressed solely in terms of the state of G and vice

°We do not claim that QBism is the proper interpretation of quantum physics. See Khrennikov [50] for reflections from one
of the authors of this paper on the applicability of QBism in quantum physics.
