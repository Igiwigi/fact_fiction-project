Throughout this paper we have assumed—and existing experimental data appear to
justify this assumption—that there is fundamentally only one keratin as the basic
fibre substance of mammalian hairs, but that, in the hair itself, there are three main
variations on the primary theme, the three “ phases,” K,, K,, and K,, which we have
associated respectively with inter-cellular keratin, cell-wall keratin, and intra-cellular
keratin. We haye also pointed out that there is no sharp demarcation between these
three phases, that one gives place to another almost imperceptibly, and that after the

process of “ generalization ” (by stretching in dilute caustic soda, for example) they
behave so similarly that the maximum extension and recovery can be demonstrated
repeatedly even in cold water, while the load/extension curve takes up a limiting position
and form characteristic of a single-phase transformation (see fig. 3). The interpretation
of these phenomena in terms of the present molecular model does not appear at the
moment to offer any peculiar difficulty, since nothing in the study of hair stands out
more than the fact of its variability and the way its properties can be modified without
destroying its identity as hair. The minimum essential of hair-substance, the common.
factor of all hairs as revealed by their common X-ray photograph, we must associate
with the more permanent features of the keratin grid, the co-valent skeleton network of
main-chains and “rungs.” The latter must involve the cystine content at least, but
probably there are other co-valent cross-links besides, while alternating with such
stronger links, something after the manner of the rough scheme sketched out above,
we must find the less permanent junctions, notably those of an electro-valent character,
which are capable of a certain degree of re-distribution without seriously affecting the
cohesion and identity of the structure as a whole.
