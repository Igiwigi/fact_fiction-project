I believe
this to have been fortunate, for had I known his work, and the great increase of
accuracy obtained by his forms, I should probably not have attempted to essay any
further improvement. As it was I had proceeded so far as to feel certain that T was
on correct lines, and had already obtained even more accurate results than his,
besides some of the relationships presented below. The first important result was
that it was rarely necessary to go beyond the e/m term—in fact, not at all for the
alkali metals—that if «, 8 were both included, and, of course, an additional line used
for calculation, 8 always came out a small fraction of «, and that with « alone the
agreement was much better than with 8 alone (Rrrz). Evidence of this is given
below. As will be seen later, there are indications that a form D = m+p+e/(m+a) may
be the true form, at least for certain series.
