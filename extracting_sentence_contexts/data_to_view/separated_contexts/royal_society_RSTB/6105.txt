The previous pages have been devoted mainly to facts, but the reader must have
observed that different experimental procedures have frequently led to similar
conclusions. If, for instance, Glossina tachinoides is exposed at 30° C (86-0° F) toa
range of humidities, we find that 44% humidity is nearer the optimum than any
of the others. At that humidity the adults feed well, Table VII; the females
live longest (fig. 3); the standardized birth-rate is highest, Table V.
