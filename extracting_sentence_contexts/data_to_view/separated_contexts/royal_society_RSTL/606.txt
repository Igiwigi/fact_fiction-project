On repeating this experiment a great number of times, and
when-the water-in the vessels was at different degrees of tem-
perature, (the temperature being the same- in the two vessels,
in each experiment,) the results uniformly indicated, that calorific
rays were thrown off from the black surface, in greater abundance
than from the equal surface which was not blackened. Although the results of these experiments appeared to me to
be 80. perfectly conclusive as to establish the fact in question,
beyond all possibility of doubt, yet, in so interesting an enquiry,
I was desirous, by varying my experiments, to bring, if possible,
a variety of proofs, to support the important conclusions which
result from it. Exper. No. 28.
