These two propagation steps (electron and nuclear)
are computed consistently using a third-order Runge-Kutta algorithm [27,28]. Owing to the
nature of the process, the ultrafast time scales and the computational costs of the simulation, a
single Ehrenfest trajectory was computed for each initial condition (nuclear coordinates, velocities
and pulse shape). In fact, during the time window of the experiments (and corresponding
simulations), we observe large electronic rearrangements while the nuclear motion, even though
important because it can couple to the electronic dynamics, is mostly ballistic and therefore well
approximated by a single trajectory. It is important to note that despite the use of a plane-wave
basis set, the implementation of the Ehrenfest MD approach does not differ from the ‘traditional’
one based on a localized basis set. For more technical details, see [28-30].
