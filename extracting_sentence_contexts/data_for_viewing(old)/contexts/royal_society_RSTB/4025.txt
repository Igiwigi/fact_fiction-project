CO poisoning, or by muscular work, leads to active secretion of oxygen inwards by
the lungs, and consequent raising of the arterial above the alveolar oxygen pressure.
In the case, however, of a diminished oxygen percentage in the air breathed the
raising of arterial oxygen pressure only amounted to about 9 mm.—an amount about
the same as was observed in Mr. FuLLEr before he became acclimatised.

The figures for the arterial oxygen pressure during rest after acclimatisation on
Pike’s Peak are entirely inconsistent with the theory that oxygen passes into the
blood by diffusion alone, and indicate a secretory activity, presumably in the alveolar
epithelium, far greater than that observed on themselves by Doueias and HaLpANE
when the oxygen percentage was diminished at sea-level. From the experiment on
Mr. Futter, and the fact that it takes two or more days for the blueness of the face
to disappear, it is evident that it takes some time for the increased secretory activity
to develop. It may be presumed that the secretory power gradually increases with
use, just as does muscular power, or as the habitual drinking of large quantities of
light beer increases the secretory power of the kidneys.

That want of oxygen is the stimulus to this increased activity is clearly shown by
the experiments in which the oxygen percentage of the inspired air was raised. It is
true that lowering still further the alveolar oxygen pressure caused a diminution, and
not an increase, in the absolute difference between alveolar and arterial oxygen
pressure, This, however, is no evidence that secretory effort was less: for diffusion
was probably acting against secretion entirely in the latter case, and only in the last
stages of the absorption of oxygen in the other determinations. It is probable, also,
