In the average of cases they
were, I think, decidedly convex towards each other ; perhaps two thirds presented
more or less of this effect, the rest bulging more or less outwards. I was never able,
however, to obtain sparks which, separately leaving the ends of the wires 2 and o, con-
joined into one spark before they reached or communicated with the ball c. At pre-
sent, therefore, though I think I saw a tendency in the sparks to unite, I cannot as-
sert it as a fact.

1417, But there is one very interesting effect here analogous to, and it may be in
part the same with, that I was searching for: I mean the increased facility of dis-
charge where the spark passes. For instance, in the cases where one end, as 7, dis-
charged the electricity of both ends to the ball c, fig. 2., the electricity of the other
end o, had to pass through an interyal of air
