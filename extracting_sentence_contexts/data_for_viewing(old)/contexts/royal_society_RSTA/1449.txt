are, in principle, a source of concern for the LB representation.

However, for deformable particles, such singularities are allegedly regulated at the scale
defined by the typical deformation length of the droplet, namely

DZ

6~
E’

where ¥ is the normal stress and E is the Young modulus of the droplet.

In fact, most formal coarse-graining procedures would turn the singular lubrication force
F(g) ~ 1/g into a smoothed version F5(g), recovering the 1/¢ decay at large separations g/5 >> 1
and turning into a constant of order 1/6 in the short-range limit g/5 « 1.

It is important to note that, regardless of the details of the coarse-graining procedure, for
droplet diameters of the order of D ~ 100 1m, a mere 10% relative deformation implies 6 ~ 10 1m,
hence well within the mesoscale regime suitable for LB modelling.


Figure 2. Sketch showing two LB droplets of diameter D placed at mutual distance d, with diffuse interface of finite width equal
to the lattice spacing wig = (3-5) A. The length h is defined as the distance between the midpoints of the diffuse interfaces,
while the g denotes the distance between the extreme points of the two interfaces. Hence g = h — wig, so that g = 0 denotes
contact and g < 0 coalescence. (Online version in colour.)
