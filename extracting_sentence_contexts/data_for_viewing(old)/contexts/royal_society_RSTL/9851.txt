types of elementary tissue ; 3rd, the arrangement of those tissues in the several
vegetative organs ; 4th, the reproductive structures.

The study of external forms has occupied, and still occupies, 80 many observers that
T 8hall not now dwell upon this subject. Outward resemblances, taken alone, are very
unsafe guides, though they are too often the only ones that we can obtain. I would
make but two observations in reference to them : So far as external appearances are
concerned, I am wholly unable to draw a line between Lepidodendron and Sigillaria,

either as regards bark, leaves, or roots. I would further call attention to the fact that,
80 far as externals are concerned, the fine Lycopodium ulicifolium recently imported
from Khasia Hills in northern India in a living state, only requires to be raised upon
an arborescent stem to furnish an exact copy of the ancient Lepidodendra. Its thick,
succulent, dependent branches, devoid of all adventitious roots ; its oblong, flat,
spirally-arranged leaflets, which leave, when they fall, a distinet Lepidodendroid
cicatrix ; and its huge, often dichotomous, strobili, usually six inches in length, remind
us most vividly of the dependent branches of the Palzozoic Lycopods.

The successive developments of the various vegetable elementary tissues is not
unimportant. The modification of spiral tisxue known. as the © barred” vessel—the
* yaisseau rays” of the French Palzo-botanists, and which approximates closely to
the modern © scalariform ” tissue—has long been known to be the prevalent vascular
