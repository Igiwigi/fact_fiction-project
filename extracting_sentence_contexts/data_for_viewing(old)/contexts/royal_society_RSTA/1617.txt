]. Introduction

Internal gravity waves (IGWs) are waves that are driven by buoyancy forces in a stratified
medium. They play an important role in mixing material and transporting energy and momentum
in planetary atmospheres, oceans and the radiative interior of solar-type stars. In the Earthâ€™s
atmosphere, IGWs have been observed and modelled for many years, both in the lower
atmosphere [1,2] as well as at ionospheric heights [3]. Moreover, IGWs play an important role
in the coupling of these two regions. In the oceans IGWs power the overturning meridional
circulation that affects pollutant disposal, marine productivity and global climate [4]. Elsewhere
in the Solar System IGWs have been detected on Mars [5] and Jupiter [6,7]. In fact, the viscous
damping of IGWs on Jupiter could explain the enigmatic temperature structure of the planet's
thermosphere, addressing a long-standing problem in planetary physics [7]. In astrophysics,
IGWs, randomly excited in space and time by overshooting convection, have been invoked to
explain the uniform rotation of the solar core [8] and the rotation profile and the surface Lithium
abundance of solar-type stars [9]. IGWs have also been proposed as an agent for the mechanical
heating of stellar atmospheres and coronae [10]. More recent studies [11-13] show the diagnostic
potential of the IGWs for magnetic field in the solar atmosphere at different heights above the
solar surface.

Owing to difficulties associated with directly observing IGWs in the Sun, however, they have
not garnered the same level of attention they have in these other disciplines. Despite these
difficulties, there is observational evidence of short wavelength (less than 6 Mm) IGWs in the
