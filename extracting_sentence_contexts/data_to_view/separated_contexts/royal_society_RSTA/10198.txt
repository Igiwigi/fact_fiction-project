Now
this is exactly the result to be expected if the ThX is the parent of the emanation,
for the activity of ThX at any time is proportional to its rate of change, 7.e., to the
rate of production of the secondary type of matter by the emanation in consequence
of a change in it. Since the rate of change of the emanation (half transformed in
1 minute) is very rapid compared with the rate of change of ThX, the amount of
emanation present will be practically proportional to the activity of the ThX at any
instant, 7.e., to the amount of unchanged ThX present. The observed fact that the
hydroxide regains its power of emanating in the course of time ig due to the
production of fresh ThX by the thorium, which in turn produces the emanation. In a similar way, excited activity is produced on bodies over which the emanation
is passed, and in amount proportional to the activity of the emanation, 7.e., to the
amount of the emanation present. This shows that the active deposit, which gives
rise to the phenomenon of excited activity, is itself a product of the emanation.
