428 MR. W. CROOKES ON THE VISCOSITY

701. I was unable to take pressure after 1'0 millim., as the McLeop measuring
apparatus does not give trustworthy indications when aqueous vapour is present.
As $00n as the pressure in the measuring tube rises above the tension of aqueous
vapour, water condenses in it, and measurements can no longer be taken. [

These results plotted as a diagram give the curve shown in diagram A, marked
« Moist Air.”

Up to a pressure of about 350 millims. the presencg of aqueous vapour has little or
no influence on the viscosity of air. The two curves are in fact snperimposed. At
this point, however, divergence commences, and the curve rapidly bends over, the
log. dec. falling from 00903 to 00500 between 50 and 7 millims. pressxure. Here
it joins the hydrogen curve, and between 7 millims. and 1 millim. they appear to be
identical.

702. These regults are partly to be explained by the peculiar action of water
vapour in the apparatus. At the normal pressure the amount of aqueous yapour
present in the air, supposing it to be 8aturated, is only about 13 parts in a million,
and the identity of the logarithmic decrement with that of dry air shows that this 8mall
quantity of water has no appreciable action on the viscosity. When the pump is set
to work the air is gradually removed, whilst the aqueous vapour is kept supplied from
the reservoir of liquid. As the exhaustion approaches the tension of aqueous vapour,
