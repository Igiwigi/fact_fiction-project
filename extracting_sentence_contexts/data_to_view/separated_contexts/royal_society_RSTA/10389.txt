Indeed, most of the photographs show that
the region is only comparatively dark. I would draw attention to the fact that when no sound-waves interfere with the
flame, the retonation-wave is very brilliant ; when the flame is crossed several times
BS by reflected waves, the light is more evenly distributed. Nos. 63 and 64, taken under
@the same conditions, illustrate this fact. The phenomenon is explained on the
Bascumption that in the region traversed by the flame the gases are still burning, and
‘§ the sound-waves, when they enter this region, bring about an increase in the rate of
@ combination. They are, therefore, of the same nature as, but differ in degree from,
4 the wave of retonation.
