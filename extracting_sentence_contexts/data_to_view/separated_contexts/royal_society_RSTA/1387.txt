Special Base Surfaces of ’.—When we proceed to find the base surfaces of V in the
usual way, it soon becomes clear that for some of the transformations under consideration
there must be special base surfaces of Y, not arising from doubly infinite systems of
E-curves in §. The existence of such is in fact revealed by applying the test for complete-
ness to those base surfaces which arise in the ordinary way. It is usually easy enough
to find the origin of the missing ones, and without wishing to enter into further detail,
we shall explain three ways in which they may be accounted for :—

(a) Primals of ¥ may have a surface of contact—VThe quadric-cubic transformation of
class I, for example, is just a special case of {2, 4, 3} ; but the usual procedure
gives instead of a quintic base surface, only a base plane and the base quadric Q
corresponding to the neighbourhood of the line /. One would expect then, and
