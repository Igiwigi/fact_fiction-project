The total size of the world population is likely to increase from its current 7 billion to 8-10 billion
by 2050. This uncertainty is because of unknown future fertility and mortality trends in different
parts of the world. But the young age structure of the population and the fact that in much of
Africa and Western Asia, fertility is still very high makes an increase by at least one more billion
almost certain. Virtually, all the increase will happen in the developing world. For the second
half of the century, population stabilization and the onset of a decline are likely.
