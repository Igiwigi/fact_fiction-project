If not linear, they will depend both upon W and the
electromagnetic quantities. It is quite possible that there should be no strain at all,
and yet a very sensible stress due to electromagnetic actions. In fact, in solving the elasticity problem—having given the distribution throughout
the field, of dielectric displacements, of currents, and of magnetisation, required the strain
at any point—the only way in which the electromagnetic data can be used is, by
finding the force per unit volume and surface respectively due to them, and then
treating these forces as external. That is, the knowledge of the stress which produces
the mechanical effects of electromagnetism is of no use in discovering the strain
actually resulting; all the knowledge we can thus utilise is that of the forces (per
unit volume and surface) due to such stresses. This shows that, to find the true
expression for / it is not sufficient to investigate experimentally what strain accom-
panies a given displacement, or current, or magnetisation at a point.* The problem
is much more complicated.
