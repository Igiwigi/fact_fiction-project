Even if its conductivity changed with the temperature our values of R include the
effects of such change, and the manner in which R is built up at each temporal 5
of no consequence. Again, if electrolysis takes place (of which, however, we have had no sign), polari
tion must ensue. The best proof of the absence of polarization is the fact
when the storage and Clark cell circuits were reversed (and this was inve
done more than once during each J experiment) no readjustment of the rheochor
was required when using the platinum coil, although when using the manganine eo
a considerable readjustment was necessary. Had electrolysis occurred, it is almost certain that HNO, would have bee
formed. In our earlier experiments (both in the platinum and silver calorimeters),
