denoted by H, and h,. If/is not an integral multiple of d it will be necessary to work with the
means. Otherwise the choice of means or totals is a matter of convenience.

In considering the accuracy of systematic sampling we shall require some expression for
the variance of the actual samples. The true errors of sampling will be given by the deviations
of h, from the mean of all the terms of the sequence. It appears best, however, to adopt the
convention that

err =
Vike) = 7 uD)

remembering that, with this convention, a factor (d—1)/d must be introduced into the final
estimate of error of a sequence to allow for the fact that we are sampling from a finite popula-
tion. The corresponding variance of the sums H, will be denoted by V[H,]. If / is not a
multiple of d, V[h,] will not be exactly equal to the variance of h,, since the mean of h, will
not be exactly equal to the mean of all the terms of the sequence, but for long sequences the
difference will be trivial.

It will often be more convenient to express these variances on a per term basis. These
will be defined by of H,] = ofhg] = sg Vib].

If the terms are randomly distributed uncorrelated variates with variance ? the deviations
of f, will provide an estimate of 7? based on d—1 degrees of freedom given by
