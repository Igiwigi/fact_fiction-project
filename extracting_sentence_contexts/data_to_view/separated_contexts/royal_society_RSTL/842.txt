If
a theory is sometimes useful, as a standard to which we may
refer our knowledge, it is at other times prejudicial, by creating
an attachment in our minds to preconceived ideas, which have
been admitted without inquiring whether from truth or from
convenience. We easily correct our judgment as to facts; and
the evidence of experiment is equally convincing to all persons. But theories, not admitting of mathematical demonstration, and
being but the interpretation of a series of facts, are the creatures
of opinion, and are governed by the various impressions made
upon every individual. Nature laughs at our speculations; and
though from time to time we receive such warnings as should
awaken us to a due sense of our limited knowledge, we are
| presented with an ample compensation, in the extension of our
- views, and a nearer approach to immutable truth. | _
