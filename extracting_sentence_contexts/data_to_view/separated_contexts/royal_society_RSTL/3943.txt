I have simply sought to show how that without a very delicate galvanoscope,
and with the galvanoscopic frog alone, any person may be enabled to demonstrate
the principal laws of the muscular current. It has always been an object of peculiar interest to me, in the study of the mus-
cular current, to establish fresh experimental proof, or to repeat and extend my
former ones; all which haye led me to conclude that the existence and intensity of
the muscular current depend upon the existence and intensity of the changes of
Structure and composition, which constitute the nutrition of the muscle. Nevertheless, before entering upon the exposition of my researches institnted in
this view, I will describe some fresh facts, which, although they may be anticipated,
notwithstanding, better serye to fix the origin of the muscular current. With a pile of half thighs of frogs I have distinctly obtained the decomposition of
iodide of potassium. To effect this, I soak a piece of paper in a solution of this 8ub-
8tance, and upon it, about the distance of a line apart, I place the extremities of two
platinum wires, the other ends of which dip in the fresh water which fills the extreme
cavities of the pile.
