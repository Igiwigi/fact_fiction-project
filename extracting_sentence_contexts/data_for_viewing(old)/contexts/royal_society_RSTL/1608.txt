the second limb of the sun at the gd, 4th, and 5th wires ;
and lastly, read off the upper limb after the observation is
ended. In this way, one has the meridian passage through
the middle of the field, or within 2' of it: and the meridian
altitude of both the limbs, while the sun's centre is on the
meridian ; for the little alteration in altitude is s0on done, and
can disturb nothing.

Indeed, upon the whole, this instrument itself is capable of
doing a great deal of good work; and convinces me fully, that
one between piers would be highly advantageous to astro-
nomy. As a transit, mine is perfect, s far as that size per-
mits: indeed it is in fact to all intents a transit-instrument.
And for altitudes; since the readings are totally independent
of the circle, though you have it in your power to re-examine
your microscopes by the plumb-line between each observa-
tion, if you please; you find there is no occasion for it: In that
respect, it has the advantage over a quadrant. No force is
used in setting this instrument : the whole, from its form,
is counterpoised in itself: there is no more probability of de-
ranging it in altitude, than in azimuth : and therefore, all
you have to do in actual observation beyond a common
transit-instrument, is, to bisect the star as it passes, or as
S00N as ever it has passed the meridian wire, and read off
the microscopes afterwards. Thus every observation is com-
