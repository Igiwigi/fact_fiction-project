as well as their dynamic interactions with environmental fac- Ss

other parameters on these flow profiles, as well as the relation
between transport and mixing of passive tracers [37]. However,
rigorous assessment of the merits of these models in compari-
son to experimental findings remains sparse [5]. At present,
there is no experimental benchmark under agreed upon ‘nom-
inal’ and ‘altered’ cilia conditions that can be used as a testbed
for theoretical and computational models [89]. To evaluate
mathematical models, we need to compare their behaviour to
experimental results, but, more importantly, we need to test
their predictive ability under altered conditions. A major diffi-
culty arises from the fact that the MCC system is composed of
multiple scales that are coupled together via mechanical and
chemical feedback and feed-forward loops from mucus mech-
anics, to cilia beat kinematics, to molecular motor activity.
Many of the loops in this hierarchical organization are not
well understood, as highlighted earlier. Mathematical model-

tors, such as particles and bacteria. Moreover, MCC function S
is sensitive to noxious effects of harmful agents it is designed
to clear. Recently, however, promising advances have been
made towards disentangling these complex interactions:
human tissue engineering can be applied to reverse-engineer
select defects of MCC using patient-specific induced pluripo-
