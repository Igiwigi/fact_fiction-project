Note further that in the
special case where bz = 0, so that (E) is lost at the (EI/P) boundary, the phase velocity (4.19) of a
wave propagating in the direction n = (+1,0) becomes inversely proportional to the wavenumber
k. The latter observation suggests that the presence of microinertia will cause high-frequency
(large-wavenumber) disturbances to ‘almost’ stop propagating in this direction. In fact, in this
direction the medium behaves as a Cauchy material without Cosserat effects but with non-zero
microinertia, having a phase velocity of the form v2 =12p7lcssh po k?. An analogous conclusion
is reached in the case where (E) is lost at the (EC/H) boundary.

(d) Time-harmonic Green’s function

A time-harmonic concentrated body force Xz = S8(x)5(y) e' is applied in an infinite orthotropic
constrained Cosserat material with microinertia subjected to antiplane deformation. This problem


set-up allows one to determine the Green’s function for the out-of-plane displacement, which
is derived below by employing a Fourier transformation technique sharing analogies with the
standard technique in classical Cauchy elasticity [20].
