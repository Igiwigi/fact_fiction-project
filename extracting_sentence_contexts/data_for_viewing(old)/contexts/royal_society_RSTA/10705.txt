10. Again, the irreversible changes which occur on heating and cooling do not
allow the temperature coefficient to be simply calculated from the difference of the hot
and cold residual intensities which are left after removal of the magnetising force.
Experiments were made on the wire in two ways. Beginning with the wire hot, the
intensity fell from 1294 to 1139 during a series of heatings and coolings, and the
coefficient was + 0°000358. Then, repeating the experiment, but beginning with the
wire cold, the intensity fell from 1204 to 1126, and the coefficient was + 0°000327, a
value not very different from the former, but less than half the coefficient calculated
from the difference of the hot and cold intensities left immediately after the with-
drawal of the magnetising force.

Nevertheless, the relation of these hot and cold curves throws light on the fact
that the temperature coefficient of a magnet of drawn steel is positive or negative,
according as the demagnetising factor is below or above a certain value, a result which
has been fully established (vide Table I.).

11. In another series of experiments the temperature coefficient was determined
at different stages of the curve, the wire being kept during heating and cooling
under a constant force. The wire, the same one as before, was, in the first place,
demagnetised carefully, and then a field of 11-0 units was applied and maintained ;
the intensity at 16° was 120:7, but on passing steam through the tube the intensity
