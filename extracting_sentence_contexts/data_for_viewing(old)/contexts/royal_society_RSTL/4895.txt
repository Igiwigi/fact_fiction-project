much rain or heat this level is always higher than after dry cold. In the former
case the glacier may be said to be gorged, the supply of water from the surface ex-
ceeding the power of the drainage to carry it off. The circulating vessels are there-
fore overcharged. In the latter case the superficial supply is stopped, the drainage
goes on slowly though uninterruptedly, and the level of the water in the vertical
Shaft slowly descends, indicating the diminution of internal pressure. If it were not
for the capillarity of the ducts, it is plain that no effective bydrostatic pressure would

+ This I think is undeniable, from the appearance of the collapsed crevasses above referred to, notwithstand-
ing the difficulty of imagining any variation in the sensible heat of water circulating in ice. It is not the only
fact in the glacier theory which 8eems to require some modification of the commonly received laws of latent,
heat at the very limit of congelation and liquefaction.

be expended in producing internal pressures. With this concluding observation I
commit the Plastic or Viscous Theory of Glaciers to the impartial judgment of those
qualified to decide on its merits in explaining facts, and on the variety of difficult
and complicated considerations which opposed and till oppose themselves to a com-
