is subjective, and often based on the experience of the mod-
eller and the software they have access to obtaining and
extending. Moreover, the issue is often exacerbated by the
fact that it is difficult to accurately compare different model-
ling approaches, because the modeller cannot generally
distinguish between differences that are due to model
assumptions and those that arise from the specific details of
the numerical implementation of the model [82]. A systematic
comparison of the relative strengths and weaknesses of each
model, and the underlying biophysical assumptions, remains
lacking; this would go a long way towards addressing the
above problem. A rare example of such a comparison is the
simulation study by Pathmanathan ef al. [25]; this type of
analysis could be extended to other cell-based approaches.
