Substituting for the quotient-functions their values in terms of a, y, we
should obtain the differential relations between dx, dy, du, dv, viz., putting for
shortness X=a—#x.b—z.c—z.d—v.e—xzf—xr, and Y=a—yb—y.c=y.d—y.e—yſ—y,

these are of the form
_du dy adz ydy

To EVE ET

each of them equal to a linear function of du and dv: 80 that the quotient-functions are
du da
is thus an addition-theorem for them, in accordance with the theory of these integrals. 26. The first 16 equations of the product-theorem, putting therein first u=0, v=0,
and then v'=0, v'=0, and using the results to eliminate the functions on the right
hand side, give expressions for

in fact the 15 hyper-elliptic functions belonging to the integrals and there

A. . B, &c.
(that is, A(u+u", v+»).B(u—r', v—v)) &c.) in terms of the functions of (#, v) and
(1, v) : and we have thus an addition-with-subtraction theorem for the double theta-
functions. And we have thence also consequences analogous to those which present
themselves in the theory of the single functions.
