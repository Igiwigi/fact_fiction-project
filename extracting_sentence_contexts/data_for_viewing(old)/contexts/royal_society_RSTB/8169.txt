by sand. These deposits, which have a widespread development throughout Western
Australia, are generally considered to be fossil soil horizons formed during a pluvial period
in the late Tertiary (probably Pliocene according to Whitehouse (1940). The laterite is up
to 20 ft. thick and crops out as large massive blocks around the edges of hills, giving rise
to ‘breakaways’. It consists of hydrous and anhydrous oxides of iron and aluminium, with
minor amounts of quartz and other insoluble minerals.

Deposits of quartz sand up to about 20 ft. thick are found overlying the laterite wherever
erosion has not been too severe. The sand is thought to be essentially 7m situ and genetically
related to the underlying laterite.

The laterite in the district formed on a dissected surface of fairly well-marked relief, not
on a low-lying peneplain as supposed by previous authors. This is shown by the fact that
the laterite dips towards present-day river valleys at up to 10° and also shows a continuous
variation in elevation from 210 to 863 ft. above sea-level.

A deep zone of alteration exists below the laterite itself. The pre-Cambrian rocks are
completely kaolinized to depths of 100 ft. or more. Among the sediments the Newmarra-
carra Limestone shows most clearly the effects of lateritization. To a depth of 80 ft. or so
beneath the laterite, the limestone is completely altered, calcium carbonate being entirely
removed.

In the field the relationship between limestone outcrop and elevation of laterite is very
evident. Wherever the undulating upper surface of the laterite sinks to within a certain
vertical distance above the base of the Newmarracarra Limestone, the outcrop of unaltered
