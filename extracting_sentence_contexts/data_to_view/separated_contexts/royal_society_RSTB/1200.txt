Here it is seen that the tapet
is still a continuous band outside the sporogenous cells, though the cell-walls of
tapetum are disorganized, and the nuclei float freely in the continuous protop
The outer sporogenous cells still form an external barrier, but certain cells of
sporogenous mass have lost their definite outline, their protoplasm has become i
gular, and their nuclei have lost size and brilliancy, and differ materially from
of the rounded sporogenous cells: the number of cells thus altered in the small p
drawn is 13, as against 30 which are rounded off. These numbers, rough though
are, will suffice to explain the discrepancy above noted. In fact, about one-th
one-quarter of the sporogenous cells are disorganized and do not form spores :

es its way between the rounded sporogenous cells, and then it is no longer
ible to distinguish the nuclei and plasma of the external tapetum from those of
disorganized sporogenous cells. It will subsequently be shown that a similar

it must be recognized as one of the forms which sterilization of this tissue may be
