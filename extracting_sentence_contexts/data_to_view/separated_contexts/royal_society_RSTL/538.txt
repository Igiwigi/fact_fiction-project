By Sir Everard Home, Bart. V.P.R.S.

Read April 25, 1816. Wusn I laid before the Society my Paper upon this sub-
Ject, I was anxious to establish what appeared to me to be
two important facts ; one, that the infusion of the colchicum
can be received into the circulation without producing any
permanent mischief; the other, that it is through the medium
of the circulation, its beneficial effects upon gout are produced
and, therefore, the sudden relief which is experienced can be
readily explained, Having attended to the effects of the eau
medicinale, and of this medicine for several years in cases of
gout, both in my own case, and in those of my friends, I
found, invariably, that they diminished the frequency of the
Pulse, 10 or 20 beats in a minute, and. this effect generally
took place about twelve hours after the medicine was ex-
hibited : I therefore considered this to be the criterion of
the constitution being under the influence of the medicine;
and when I found that the pulse was affected in the same
way by the medicine received into the circulation, and in a
much shorter time, I became satisfied that in both cases this
arose from an effect upon the circulation, and not upon the
Stomach, and therefore did not farther prosecute the enquiry;
8ince exhibiting larger doses could only confirm what is
already known, namely, that the medicine is capable, when
injudiciously used, of producing very violent effects,


Sir Everard Home's Appendiz, &c. 26g

It has been suggested to me since the Paper was read, that
the only mode of proving that the medicine acts through the
medium of the circulation, is to show that when a sufficient
quantity is received into the blood, all the violent effects are
produced, that result from a large dose taken by the mouth ;
and as I had no object but the pursuit of truth, I lost no
time in complying with this suggestion, and introduced into
the circulation of a dog 160 drops of the same infusion before
employed. The animal instantly lost all power of voluntary motion,
the breathing became extremely slow, and the pulse was
hardly to be felt.
