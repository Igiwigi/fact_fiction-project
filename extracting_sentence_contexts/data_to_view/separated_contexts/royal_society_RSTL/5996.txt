17. A little consideration will show that in this equation we may write n—1 for n,
and H, for H. In fact, putting for a moment 3=x,+y,3, +2, we have corresponding

where ultimately (z, y,, 2,) are to be replaced by (a, y, 2). We may operate upon this
equation with D, ID), ... as before, the only difference being that in the first instance
$7, 36, &e. are as regards (, y, 2) of degrees lower by unity than a, 6, &c., that is n—1
must be snbstituted throughout in the place of 2; and when at the end of the process
(z, y,, 2) are replaced by (, y, 2), then $a, 3b, &c. become equal to a, 6, &c., from which
the truth of the asserted proposition is manifest.
