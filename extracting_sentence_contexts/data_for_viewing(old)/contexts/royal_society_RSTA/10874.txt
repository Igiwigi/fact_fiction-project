running in all directions in search of the clothes which they had spread out in the early morning to be
bleached by the sun. Persons of 40 years’ standing said they had never before seen such a tide.”

Jonn K. Kirxuam, Harbour Master at Barbados, sends us the following note of
observations made by Mr, Asupy, the Government diver :—

“ At 3.10 p.m. the water suddenly rose 2°5 feet in two minutes, and as rapidly fell after one minute;
about three minutes later it rose 1-25 feet in three minutes and as rapidly fell, then rose about 0°8 foot in

two minutes, and as rapidly fell, The water rose and fell three times in 15 minutes, the rise each time
being about one-half what it was before. It was spring tide here that day.”

From Barbados also we obtain some interesting facts regarding the changes of
barometric pressure which accompanied the outburst of the great black cloud. The
Rey. N. B. Watson, of St. Martin’s Vicarage, in the parish of St. Phillips, sends us a
very interesting barographie tracing, which shows repeated oscillations of the recording
pen attached to the instrument between 1,30 and 6.30 p.m, of that afternoon, and
Mr. O’DonneE LL, of the American Weather Bureau, states that, on May 7, “a sudden
jar occurred in the barograph record at the time of the explosion.”

Here also we may mention that in St. Vincent similar rapid changes in barometric
pressure were noticed by at least one observer, Mr. ErrincHam Dun, of Owia. He
writes as follows :—‘*On May 7 the barometer (mercurial), which had been steady at
29°85, rose within three minutes to 30°12, when it again fell slowly to 29°82, and
remained steady at that throughout the night. This is the only change I observed,
