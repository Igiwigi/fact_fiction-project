The young are disposed in the brood chambers in the same way as in the micro-
spheric forms from Tonga and Fiji, above described, except that, owing to the
thinness of the margin of the disc, as compared with these specimens, the young in
each annulus are in a single row. I have failed to recognise a nucleus in the young
&m, probably owing to the imperfect preservation. The specimens containing young
fglong to a batch collected in the month of November.

“eWe are here then brought face to face with the fact that in this species megalo-
eric young are produced by megalospheric parents, while it is no less certain that
Fijian specimens, as described by Brady, and in Tongan specimens, as I have

town), megalospheric young are produced by microspheric parents. ‘The relation of

the two forms to one another will be discussed at the end of this paper.*

lt may be pointed out here that, in the Tongan specimens, the nuclear characters

the two forms agree fairly well with those of Polystomella.

"BIn the microspheric form numbers of rounded nuclei are found scattered through
protoplasm, and they may be found in process of simple division. I have not,

iwever, recognised anything like the giving off of deeply staining strands, which is

Sg marked a feature in Polystomella.

£In the megalospheric form, a single nucleus is found during a large part of the

gowth of the individual, and ultimately it appears to break up into a number of

ffagments.

£ Tn Polystomella, as we have seen, the nucleus of the megalospheric form increases

ig size with the growth of the protoplasm. In Orbitolites, however, the nucleus in

e primordial chamber is hardly larger in the examples with many rings of chambers

an in those with few.

© The Celebean specimens are in a phase of growth to which I have found no analogy

in Polystomella.
