On this the general topography of the island is well
brought out, but main roads, tracks, and buildings, are in many instances inaccurately
located or unrecorded. The detail of the hachuring is also very often quite misleading. Considering its age, the chart is, however, wonderfully good; it shows very clearly the
radial drainage of the main hill units, and brings out the fact that the valley systems
of the Centre Hills and Silver Hill are much more mature than that of the Soufri√©re
Hills. The topography shown on fig. 3 and Plate 9 is based on the Admiralty Chart,
but a number of place names have been added, and rough form-lines substituted for
hachuring. A small map of Montserrat, with form-lines, appears on the United States Hydro-
graphic Office Chart, No. 1011; its scale is very much smaller than that of the British
Admiralty Chart.
