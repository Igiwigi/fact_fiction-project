“The most consistent data were for air temperature; this was. ..17—23° C (average,
20° C) at the beginning of stream-away....’

“Careful consideration of body temperature data reveals no consistent relation between
them and stream-away, except that body temperature was always above the permissive
temperature for flight (20° C.) at stream-away. The warmest locusts caught ranged from
27 to 41° C at that time on different days’ (1948, pp. 5, 6).

The suggested explanation of stream-away in terms of a nervous reaction to temperature
(1948, p. 38, and quoted above) came as the conclusion of a discussion opened thus:

‘This fact, that stream-away is comparatively independent of the body temperatures
which we recorded is unexpected and requires explanation’ (1948, p. 30).

However, on the previous page the method of recording body temperatures was described
in detail, and this is referred to in the summary on p. 6:

‘Since stream-away occurs as a result of sustained flight, as distinct from the short
flights commonly seen earlier in the day, and since representative body temperatures from
locusts. in sustained flight could not be obtained, it remains possible that there is a relation
between body temperature in flight and stream-away.’

Since the recorded body temperatures were not those of locusts that had been flying long
enough to have reached thermal equilibrium with the air, it is not after all unexpected that
