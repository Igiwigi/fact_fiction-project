For when a quantity of the eleCtric fluid js forced into
the apparatus, which ſupports the two balls, we ſhould
from its elaſtic principle, expe” it'to_paſs ont/again

flow degrees; and takes a conſiderable time in eya-
cuating the apparatus effeCtually. Some power there-
fore' muſt hinder the fluid, at leaſt, in fome meaſure,
from eſcaping : and that power muſt be exerted at, or
near, 'the ſurface of the body. To fay it is detained by an attra&tion of the body,
will not anſwer the purpoſe : for the power which is
ſuppoſed to draw the fluid into it, muſt certainly be
ſufficient to hinder it from paſſing out.
