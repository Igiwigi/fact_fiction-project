The values of corresponding ratios are always intermediate in
the case of the rubidium salt, between the values for the potassium and czesium salts ;
a-regular extension of the edges of the unit cell of the structural space-lattice thus
oceurs as potassium is replaced by rubidium and the latter in turn by cesium. The
lengths of the cell edges for the ammonium salt are almost the same as, very slightly
greater than, those for rubidium ferrous selenate. This striking fact of the congruency of the ammonium and rubidium salts—which
is in keeping with all the author's previous results for the other groups of double
selenates yet investigated, for the whole of the groups of double sulphates of this
monoclinic series, and for the two rhombic groups of simple alkali sulphates and
selenates—affords yet another confirmation of those former results, and further
substantiates the important conclusions which were drawn therefrom in a memoir*
read to the Royal Society in November, 1916. Cleavage.—All four salts exhibit the development of cleavage parallel to 7’{201},
the cleavage common to the whole series. Some of the ammonium salts of the series
