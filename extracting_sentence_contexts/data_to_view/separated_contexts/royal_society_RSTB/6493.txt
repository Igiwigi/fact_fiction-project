In all these
forms, however, the last abdominal spiracles are more developed than the rest,
showing a tendency to the metapneustic condition. The larvae of Mycetophilidae,
on the other hand, show a tendency to become propneustic—a very rare condition
in nematocerous larvae. Evidence in support of this statement is afforded by the

following facts :—

1. The prothoracic spiracles are first developed in the second stage larva and
persist in subsequent stages. The abdominal spiracles, on the other hand, are only
developed in the fourth stage larva.
