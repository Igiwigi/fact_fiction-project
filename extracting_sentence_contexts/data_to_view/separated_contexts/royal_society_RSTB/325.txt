The salt lies in large contorted sheets, overlaying each other like
frozen waves of muddy ice. On the eastern and southern shores, which shelve away
gradually to more distant hills, are great flats of salt mud covered with Salicornia, &c. The biological interest of this place lies in the fact that upon the steep western
shore are marked very definite terraces, showing the position of the water at different

periods during the progress of the gradual drying up of the lake. On each of these
terraces Cockle shells are found in great quantities, having been left there when the
water was at the level of the terrace. <A series of specimens, therefore, taken from
each terrace from above downwards, gives examples of the shells as they were at each
stage during the progressive desiccation of the lake. On several of the terraces the
shells are paired shells, with the ligaments more or less preserved, placed upon their
