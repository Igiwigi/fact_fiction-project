52 PROF. J. JOLY ON THE GENESIS OF PLEOCHROIC HALOES.

haloes, although plainly representing an early stage of the uranium halo. Here again
it appeared as if some unknown factor existed which could occasion different modes
of origin for a halo, However, the idea that the larger embryos might be traceable
to radium emanation acting as the parent element was found to afford a quite
adequate explanation of the phenomenon, Additional evidence for this view is
found in the fact that these haloes are almost invariably found located on conduits
or veins in the mica; conduits which undoubtedly conveyed radioactive materials at
some past time. And even when we cannot demonstrate the existence of such a
conduit we find in the linear arrangement of these haloes evidence that they have
been generated along a crack or vein. The nature of the nucleus of these interesting
haloes is not determinable. It is probably zircon. Whatever the mineral substance
is, we must ascribe to it the power of absorbing or occluding the emanation and so
becoming a centre of radiation of the a-rays of emanation and of the derived series
of elements.

I cannot claim to have been able to suggest explanations of every difficulty.
Quite the contrary ; with increased number of observations fresh questions present
themselves. These appear, so far, to be confined to the behaviour of the less
