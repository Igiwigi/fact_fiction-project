Remarks.—The lesion not being bilateral, experiments upon hearing, smell, and
taste could not be satisfactorily carried out. The hemiopia was probably due toa
large portion of the occipital lobe having accidentally become involved, at least
in its vascular supply; the facial paralysis to obliteration of vessels proceeding to the
“facial area” from the Sylvian fissure. The affection of general and tactile sensibility
may be due to the fact that the hippocampal region was involved in the removal. This case furnishes an illustration of the fact that hernia cerebri is apt to accompany
the establishment of a septic condition in the exposed brain. Va
