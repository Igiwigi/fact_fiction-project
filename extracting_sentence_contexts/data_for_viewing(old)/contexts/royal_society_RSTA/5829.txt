because the Mixmaster oscillatory regime in the inhomogeneous case is ‘unstable’ and may


decay into oscillations of smaller scales. This then may produce a phenomenon similar to three-
dimensional turbulence in fluid mechanics, but in this case the transport may continue down to
zero scale.

The emerging picture of infinitely many coupled spatial points oscillating chaotically and
indefinitely towards the past singularity, exhibiting chaos on all scales in a spatio-temporal
manner, makes it plausible to suppose that it may soon get unstable and continue as an out-
of-control system exhibiting complex behaviour. This is perhaps related to the acknowledged
difficulty in obtaining universally acceptable results with clear descriptions and explanations.
Indeed, even for the homogeneous Mixmaster case, there are few completely established facts,
cf. [38].

The problem of understanding the behaviour of a complex system that includes an arbitrary
number of (often chaotically) oscillating subsystems coupled to each other in different ways is,
of course, a central one in modern nonlinear dynamics. This problem is usually characterized, on
the one hand, by the inexorable increase of entropy towards states of ever greater disorder, and on

the other, by the ability of subsystems to assemble together and form diverse structures we often : =
see all around us. This enigma poses a profound mystery, that of the appearance of order, not : =
only in space but also in time: the more subtle property called synchronization (commonly called 1B
‘sync’, a name we adopt below). When do coupled oscillators synchronize themselves, how long : =
can sync last, when or how can it break down, and what are the implications of sync for the fate 2k
