did more harm than good. At present the instrument is mounted on a hard
smooth slab of concrete, which reposes on a sandstone pillar resting on the concrete
on which the floors are laid. The coil system is mounted on a sheet of ebonite
supported by insulators on the concrete slab, and the controlling magnet system is
supported by leaden pillars passing through the ebonite without touching it, and also
resting on the concrete slab. The natural stiffness of the slab, or rather its inertia,
is much increased by the fact that it carries the magnetic shield of cast iron weighing
about three hundred pounds. This materially lessens any tendency there might be
to produce disturbance in the suspended system by adjusting the controlling magnets.
The Magnetic Control.—The whole secret of success lies in this. Instead of
Segarding the control as a subsidiary part of the apparatus, it must be regarded
Bs the most important part, and must be capable of the finest adjustment. We have
found it advisable to use the controlling magnets at such a distance that the residual
Held is due to them, and not to the earth. In this case, small changes in the
‘direction of the earth’s field produce less effect than when the residual field is that
Aue to the magnetic action of the earth. We have a simple but important improve-
Bient to report in the matter of control. It turns out that when the sensitiveness is
ffery high, the uniformity of the magnetic field becomes very important. When the
“Beld is not sufficiently uniform, the following fatal effect is observed. We will
