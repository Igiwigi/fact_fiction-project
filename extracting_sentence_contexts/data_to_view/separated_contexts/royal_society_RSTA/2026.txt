Supposing the coincidences to be genuine, the wave-lengths of the solar lines should
show the series relations with the same order of accuracy as those of the ammonia lines
themselves, and the intensities of the lines should be consistent with the series
relationship. This test cannot be completely applied to any one of the six series, on
account of near coincidences with metallic lines, but it may be worth while to take
the chief lines of the dseries as an illustration. The facts with regard to these are
collected in Table IV. It will be observed that while three of the metallic lines (8341°967, 3320°788,
