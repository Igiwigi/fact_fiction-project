solids with extremely low shear modulus G compared with their bulk modulus B. Such solids
approximate liquids or gases (see above) and have been named pentamode materials [50]. The
name derives from the fact that five of the six possible inequivalent modes in three dimensions
are ‘easy’ in the sense that they have very low or even zero frequency (and velocity). In the
static case, ‘easy shear’ means that one can change the shape of the elastic body with little force
(while maintaining its volume), whereas one needs significant force to change the volume (while
maintaining its shape). A corresponding metamaterial structure was suggested theoretically
a long time ago [50], but has been realized experimentally only recently. This pentamode
metamaterial illustrated in figure 10 is composed of double-cone elements which touch each
other around fictitious points that form a diamond lattice, corresponding to an underlying face-
centred-cubic (FCC) translational lattice with lattice constant a. We have shown that the ratio of
bulk to shear modulus scales as B/G « (d/a)~* for d/a <1, where d is the diameter of the thin
end of the cones. This means that one needs small connections d to approximate a liquid by this
‘meta-liquid’.
