a continuous, though fruitless, endeavour to co-ordinate the absent pedicels. If the
pedicels are able to act serially in either direction, there is no more reason why a
partly-shaved Zchinus should remain permanently reared upon its equator, than that
it should remain permanently. inverted upon its pole ; and therefore the fact that in
the latter position the pedicels set about an immediate rotation of the animal, while in
the former and quite as unnatural position they hold the animal in persistent stagis—
this fact tends to show that the righting moyements of the pedicels are something
more than serial. Thus the whole question as between the two hypotheses amounts
to whether the pedicels are able to act serially from oral to ab-oral pole. Observation
has shown us that they are 80, for we have een Zchini spontaneously rear themselyes
from their normal position on the oral pole, to the position of resting upon their
equators. Further, as additional evidence that the righting movements are ab least
assisted by some centralizing influence, is the fact that when the evolution is nearly
completed by the pedicel-rows engaged in executing it, the lower pedicels in the other
rows become strongly protruded and curved downwards, in anticipation of shortly
coming into contact with the floor of the tank.

But, on the other hand, there is evidence to show that the action of the pedicels in
executing this manceuvre, although as we have seen in s0me measure, is not exclusively
dependent upon this centralizing influence. We found that the centre from which
this influence proceeds is the nerve-ring that surrounds the lantern. For when this is
removed, the following results are produced : the pedicels have their spontaneity
impaired, though not destroyed—the animal still continuing to crawl, but only feebly,
and no longer in a determinate manner, frequently changing its direction of advance,
and showing a marked tendency to rotate upon its vertical axis. Moreover, the
