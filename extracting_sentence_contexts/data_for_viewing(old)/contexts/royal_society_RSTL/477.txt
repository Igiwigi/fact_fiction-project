fluoric acid as this principle united to hydrogen.

In the third hypothesis, which probably would have been
formed by the disciples of the phlogistic school of chemistry,
had they been acquainted with the facts, the liquid fluoric acid
is considered as an undecompounded body ; and the metals
and inflammable bodies as compounds of certain unknown
bases with hydrogen: silicated fluoric acid gas, on this idea,
must be regarded as a compound of the fluoric acid with the
basis of silicum, and fluo-boric acid gas as a compound of
fluoric acid and the basis of boron.

Whoever will consider, with attention, the different facts
that have been brought forward by ScayetLE, Gay Lussac
and TyExARD, Join Davy, and myself, will find that they
will admit of explanation on either of these hypotheses ; and,
as in all the cases yet brought forward, of the most simple
chemical action of other bodies on the fluoric substances, more
than one new form of matter is produced, no explanation of
