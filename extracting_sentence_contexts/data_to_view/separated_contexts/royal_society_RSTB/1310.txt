ough the size attained is not larger than that of the megalospheric form, the
ber of chambers in specimens of the two forms of equal size is greater in the
pheric. This is owing to the fact that in this form the central region is occupied
small chambers which gradually diminish in size to the microsphere, while in the
megalospheric form, a single large chamber, the megalosphere, occupies the centre.
_ The smallest specimen I have seen (fig. 7) has twenty chambers, and measures
230 p across the short diameter of the spire of chambers; one of the largest has
forty-seven chambers, and measures 800 yp.
__ Nuclei.—Microspheric individuals have many nuclei. They are distributed through
@any chambers, beginning at one of the internal chambers, and extending some
‘stance beyond the middle of the series, counting from the microsphere to the
‘@rminal chamber.
