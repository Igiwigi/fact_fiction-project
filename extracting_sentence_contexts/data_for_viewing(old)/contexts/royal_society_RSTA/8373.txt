The formuls for the displacements have now served our purpose, and will not be
further dealt with. A simple calculation, or indeed the known facts, will show that
in any practical case, the displacements are very small.

(4) Normal pressure varying as cos 0 over the internal circular boundary of an otherwise
infinite plate.

As a first example, before embarking upon the general solution, we solve the problem
for a normal pressure varying as cos 0 applied to the boundary. This is of more practical
importance than the fact that the traction is of opposite sign upon the two halves of
the boundary would, at first sight, indicate. In conjunction with the known and
very simple distribution of stress due to a uniform pressure on the boundary, it will
give the stress distribution round a hole into which a rivet has been driven, when the
rivet is pulled sideways (7.e., by a force in the plane of the plate). Moreover, these
terms will be the important ones at a distance from the hole, in any case. Finally, this
is the simplest example of the exceptional cases mentioned in § (2), for the resultant
of the tractions is evidently a force directed along the initial line, and the region occupied
by the plate is doubly connected.

Denoting the radius of the hole by a, the stress function must be given by

% = Ao {rO sin 6 — $(1—c) r log r cos 0} + Ca? cos O/r, . . . . (4.1)
