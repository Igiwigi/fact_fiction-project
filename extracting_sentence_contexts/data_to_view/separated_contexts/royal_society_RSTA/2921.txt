If one considers the critical case of delocalization
transition, then the coupling energy in the state assumed here to be that of localization becomes
Olkcr). As we will see in the following, and as one can guess, the coupling energy in the
beating or energy exchange regime is of the order of the total energy. This means that if indeed
\61| Â« 62|, then the coupling energy contains a significant portion of the total energy, which is
not appropriate for the IC of localization (this argumentation also assumes the trivial fact that
(4)e, = O(1), which is obvious for the normalized displacement square average of an impacting
mass). The conclusion from this lengthy argumentation is that the assumption \61| < || is
contradictory for (the perfectly viable) ICs of localization. Consequently, it is either that |6,| =
O(|62|) or that |6;| >>> (in the initial localization regime).
