At Janu-la a dark bituminous limestone yielded some brachiopods which Dr. CowPEr
Reep has identified as Upper Carboniferous. Some sandstones at the south-eastern
corner of the basin of Kho-li-tsun, which is 8.E. of the Ye-lu Shan, and on the western
side of the pass half a dayâ€™s march farther E., contain indeterminable plant remains ;
they are probably Carboniferous as they outcrop on the outer margin of the Permo-
Triassic Red-rock Series. If so, they indicate land conditions toward the end of the
Carboniferous. :

The paucity of fossils in the Carboniferous and Minchia Series in contrast to the rich
faunas of southern and south-eastern Yunnan and of the Shan States recalls the
explanation offered by M. Deprar (1912, p. 144) of the diminution northward of fossils
in Yunnan. He attributes this fact to the destruction of the fossils by the increasing
dynamo-metamorphism of the beds ; the excellent preservation of the fossil fragments
in these scattered limestone outcrops as far N. as Lo-ta is, however, fatal to that
hypothesis. The rarity of fossils in the Carboniferous, and especially in the Minchia
Series, may be due to their deposition in conditions similar to the Cement-stones of the
Lower Carboniferous of Scotland. Fossiliferous beds are scarce in that series, and the
commonest are earthy limestones containing crinoid stems. The Minchia Series, with

its variously coloured shales and sandstones, appears to have been laid down in shallow
lagoons in which lived few animals that have left definite fossils, L. von Loczy (1893,
p- 815) has emphasised the repetition of Flysch-like beds in this region; and the
Flysch is a series of sediments deposited under conditions unsuited to the preservation
of fossils,
