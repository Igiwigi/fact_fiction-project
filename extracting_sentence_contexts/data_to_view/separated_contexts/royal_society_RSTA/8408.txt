Suppose now that we define our function f(t) by the relations

_ F(t) = (1-0 Out)
f=0

when the square root is not real, the quantities (Au, t) being themselves all real. Then by (21), we obtain at once, all conditions above being evidently true,

when real,

F(t) = 5 (2n-+1)P, (0) P,() P,(u),

a convergent development, of necessity. The fact that, when it is real

(lap 4 Baul)! = 2S (n+1)P,() Pw) PA» . - + (22)
is evidently an analogue of our inverse distance formula. It is the fundamental

formula proved by Dovuaatu.*
By attaching a negative sign to any one of the variables, the companion formula

(1a 2aye)-# = FE (—)(2n+1) P, (2) P,(e) P, (0)

is obtained at once.

Writing, as a completely symmetrical form in the variables,

F(A, v, t) = (1—227—p?—# + 2aut)-? if real,

we find

resembling the series at the end of the last section, whose sum is required.
