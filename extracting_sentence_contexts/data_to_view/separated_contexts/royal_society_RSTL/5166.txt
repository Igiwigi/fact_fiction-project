Circumferential Jaminz are developed only on
free surfaces, and do not present there a very level outer snrface. A surface formed
by Haversian systems would be irregularly fluted or nodulated, like that beneath
the calcified cartilage. Neither of those forms of development, then, would effect a
condition of surface similar to that attained by the ossified cartilage, A careful con-
Sideration of the foregoing facts will, we think, lead to the conviction, that the
presence of ossified cartilage as a basis for articular cartilage must not be regarded
Simply as the result of a slowly progressing ossification of a tissue prone to ossify ;
neither must it be regarded as an imperfectly developed tissue in which the forma-
tive process was arrested before the part had been perfected*; but it must be
regarded as a constant element in the osseous system, having its special use, and
necessary to the perfect organization of the skeleton in the higher forms of Verte-
brata. Ossified Lacunal Cells —In addition to the parts already descrihed, the authors
have found a condition of bone which has hitherto escaped observation, or if seen,
has not been recognized as a form of osseous tissxue. The bones of aged people
not unfrequently become extremely light and spongy, readily break, and from the
diminished amount of compact tissue, may in the case of the flat bones, such as
