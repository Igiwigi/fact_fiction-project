be confessed that, in/the present case, some difficulty would
attend such a supposition.

It certainly would not. be easy; to conceive such.a property
to be communicated to the heat by the mere act, of being /con-
ducted through the first glass. Again; a new property. of
heat is thus introduced which, it, must be, conceded, is- not
absolutely and exclusively established.

It appeared to me therefore a point of some interest to ex-
amine,,in the case of non-luminous heatâ€”in the. first., place,
the accuracy of the fact ; and, secondly, if. verified, whether
there might not be circumstances observable in the condi-
tions of the experiment by which it might be accounted for,
without the necessity of supposing any. peculiar property of
heat, or a direct transmission even through the second glass.

(4.) My apparatus in following up this enquiry was similar
to that described by M. De La Rocue, and consisted of two
tin reflectors. In one focus the bulb of a thermometer coated
with Indian ink, and in the other an iron ball two inches
diameter, which was heated to redness, and then cooled till it
ceased to be visibly, red in the dark, at which point it was
