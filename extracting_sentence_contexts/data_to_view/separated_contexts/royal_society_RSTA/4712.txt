266 MR. J. LARMOR ON A DYNAMICAL THEORY OF

perpetual motion postulate, is the same as the free energy of von HetmHoutz’s
exposition: he has explained (“ Abhandlungen,” IL, p. 870) how its form can be
experimentally ascertained for the different phases of matter, except as regards
an undetermined part, as above, of form L + MT, where L and M are constants ;
that then the equilibrium state of a system of reacting bodies at any assigned
temperature is the one that makes it minimum for that temperature, thereby formu-
lating the general solution of the problem of physical and chemical equilibrium :
while the other properties of the system, heat-changes and heat-capacities, as well as
total energy and entropy, are obtained from it directly by processes of differentiation.
