An interesting hydrodynamical problem is that of the dispersion under gravity of a fluid
column immersed in a surrounding fluid medium of lower density and resting on a rigid
horizontal plane. Examples of such a dispersive motion are afforded by the bursting of
a dam wall, the sudden shattering of a vessel containing liquid, or the spread of a thin
pancake mixture in a frying pan.

Another striking example, and the one which inspired the investigation described in this
paper, arises from the fact that a large explosion in shallow water throws a quantity of
water vertically upwards and forms a column consisting of a mixture of fine water droplets
and air. Soon after the explosion, this column starts to collapse under gravitational forces
and, at the same time, spreads out rapidly from the base, producing the phenomenon of
the ‘base surge’ which was observed in the atomic bomb test at Bikini Lagoon. The Bikini
