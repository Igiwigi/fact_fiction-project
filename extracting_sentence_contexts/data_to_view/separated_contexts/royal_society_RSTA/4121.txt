Discussion

The quantum and classical dynamical worlds are very different, and some of their intimate
connections are not always fully appreciated. That semiclassical methods relying exclusively on
classical information can be used to construct more and more accurate quantum propagation
over algebraic time scales in the i > 0 limit has additional implications that do not derive from
the idea that classical dynamics must emerge from quantum dynamics in the same limit. In fact,
classical dynamics emerges only logarithmically slowly from quantum dynamics. This is not an
equivalent two-way street in that it is easier to bootstrap quantum dynamics from classical than
classical dynamics from quantum. The term ‘paradox’ is used here, because although it may seem odd to have the situation
that information from an unpredictable dynamics fully reconstructs a predictable one, there is no
contradiction.
