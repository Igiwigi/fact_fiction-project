According to Harper (1904) the active duct may reach a length of 12 to
15 inches, four or five times as long as the resting organ. This proportional increase
agrees well with that shown in the tabulations given for other birds by GieRsBERG
(1923, pp. 3 and 6), and takes place notwithstanding the fact that the eggs of birds
are not stored in the oviducts as in the case of the tortoise, but are laid almost as soon
as the shell is formed. In the pigeon (HARPER, 1904, p. 352), the fowl (ParrERson,
1910, p. 107; Crew, 1926, p. 230), and probably in most other birds, only one egg at a
time ordinarily passes through the oviduct. Thus the uterus of the bird is principally
concerned with the production of the shelly covering of the egg and has little to do with
storage, one of its important functions in tortoises and in other reptiles.
