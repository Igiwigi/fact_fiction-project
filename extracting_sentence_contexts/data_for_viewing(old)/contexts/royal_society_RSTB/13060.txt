Sociologists have long known that social integration [1,2] and socio-economic
status [3,4] are among the most powerful predictors of mortality risk in
humans. In the last decade, similar strong relationships between lifespan and
social environments have been revealed in primates [5-13], hyraxes [14], ungu-
lates [15,16], whales [17,18], rodents [19], carnivores [20] and lagomorphs [21].
These findings have enhanced our understanding of the evolution of animal
social relationships and uncovered links between sociality and ageing [22].
Evolutionary theories to explain sex differences in lifespan posit that males
and females have different optima in tradeoffs between survival and reproduc-
tion [23]. Nonetheless, in long-lived iteroparous mammals, empirical and
"These authors contributed equally. theoretical work indicates that lifespan is the most important component of
Darwinian fitness in both males and females [24,25]. In spite of this fact, the
relationship between social environments and survival in male mammals
