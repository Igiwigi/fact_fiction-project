and also let A be not greater than the least root of each of these same two cumulants ;
then by lemma A, L and A will also be respectively greater than the greatest, and
less than the least' roots of [q, qs.-:q,_1] and of [q,i4-:4q,}. Now the: coeflicient of
the highest power, of @ in both-[q, q4...q,] and in [q; q4..-9,-1] is positive, but-as to
[quer-++qu] and [quza:+-q,] is of contrary signs in the! two, viz. negative in that one
of those cumulants which contains an odd, and positive in that one of the two which
contains an} even number of 'elements. Hence by virtue of Lemma B, L and any
quantity greater than L substituted for » will make [q; q2.-.q,| to have always the
same 8ign, and in like manner-it may be shown' that A and any quantity less than A
substituted-for z will also canse [q1qz...q,] to retain always the! same-sign.. Hence
Land A are snperior and inferior limits to-[qyqz--.q,] ; and the same reasoning would
magnitude kJ, kyh k;...ki1 ki; ki; and if the roots of [w, wy... w;-1 w;w;+1), 8ay of V;+1, be called 1, L,....li41,
from the fact of the leading coefficients in ;_ and þ;41 heap according to the powers of” tid the
same 8ign, it follows that when #=o, þ;-; and ;41 bave the same sign, but they have contrary signs
when 2=k ; but ;-1 does ndt change its sign between z=0 and z=k, hence ;+, does change its sign be-
tween z== and z=k,, and therefore a root of V;+ lies between « and k,; in like manner precisely it may
be shown that a root of þ;+1 lies between — and k;; and since þ;-z changes its 8ign between k, and k,,
between k, and k,....k, and between 5; and ki, 4,41 must likewise change its 8ign between one and the other
extremity of each of these intervals, and hence the roots 7, 1,.... {41 are intercalated between 92, k;, ky,.....k;,
—®=, or which is the same thing, k,, k,,....k; are respectively intercalated between 7, 7,,...l;41 ; consequently,
if the theorem is true up to 4, it is true for i+1, and therefore true universally ; but is manifestly true when
i=2, for then z= + makes [w,, wg], #. 6. w, wy—1 poxsitive ; but w,=0 makes it negative, which proyes the
theorem contained in Lemma A.
