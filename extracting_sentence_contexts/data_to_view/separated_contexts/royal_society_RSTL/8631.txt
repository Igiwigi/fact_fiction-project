The maximum solar action occurs about 4 or 5 days earlier
in 1845 than in 1844, the supposed duration of the period being 26 days; this may be
due to a change of the solar meridian producing the maximum, or to the action of
superposed irregular disturbances (which, there can be no doubt, have an effect on the
mean result), or to the true period being slightly less than 26 days*. 'The lunar action has als undergone a change, since a maximum occurs both near
new and near full moon ; this result is also affected by the irregular variations. I shall
notice immediately the fact that the moon's action in producing the magnetic variations
appears to depend upon the 8un. There is in 1845, as in 1844, a maximum both when
the moon is near her greatest northerly and her greatest southerly declination. It is not my object here to enter into the differences of the results for each period as
derived from each of the two years' observations, or to seek whether these differences
may not be due to the greater number of irregular movements which occurred in 1845 ;
the consideration of these questions must include the study of a longer series of obser-
vations; yet T may add that it seems to me the least probable supposition that the
meridian of maximum solar action which remained constant throughout 1844 had
changed in 1845.
