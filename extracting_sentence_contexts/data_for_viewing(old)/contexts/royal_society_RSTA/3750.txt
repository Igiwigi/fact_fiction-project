Equation (5.1) represents a set of coupled differential equations which is typically discretized
into a set of contiguous intervals or ‘grains’ with energy spacing AE and written as a matrix
equation:

d :
aP= Mp. (5.5) :2
Diagonalizing the matrix M provides a solution for p, the population vector p(E), i.e. 3
p(t) =Uexp(At)U~!p(0), 66) 2 >

where U is the matrix of eigenvectors of M, and A a diagonal matrix of the corresponding
eigenvalues. The EGME has advanced to the point that it is routinely able to provide near- 74
quantitative predictions of gas-phase kinetics for reactive systems comprising multiple wells and ae
transition states. Part of the reason for its success in the gas phase arises from the fact that the [ae
system/bath boundary is relatively well defined: the system comprises the reactive molecule 8
of interest (which has available to it a range of reactive pathways), and the bath comprises .
third bodies which undergo collisions with the reactive system of interest. For example, the
atmospheric bath is made up of Nz and Oz, both of which can undergo elastic and inelastic
collisions with the reacting species. Third-body collisions of this sort can be treated (often to
a relatively high degree of accuracy) using standard functional forms that have their origins
in isolated binary collision models, quantum mechanical scattering calculations and classical
trajectory simulations.

Two important questions that arise in trying to apply system—bath models like the EGME to
systems other than the gas phase are as follows: (i) How do we define the system/bath boundary?
(ii) How do we treat energy transfer probabilities between the system and the bath? The approach
