action during growth in close contact with sister cells. If an
immunity gene is disrupted by transposon mutagenesis,
such a mutant will be killed by its T6SS+ neighbours. Viabi-
lity of mutants in the presence or absence of active T6SS is
then scored using deep sequencing. Mapping these T6SS-
dependent immunity proteins helps to identify cognate
effectors that are usually located in the same operon [92].
This approach is, however, limited to effectors that have
exactly one cognate immunity protein targeted into the
periplasm of the effector cell.

Another interesting mass spectrometry method was
based on the fact that some Hcp-binding effectors are less
stable in the absence of Hep [88,93]. An advantage of this
method is that proteins that are active in the cytosol or are
not necessarily toxic against bacteria can be detected, but
only in the case of their inherent instability in the absence
of Hep [93].

Bioinformatics has proved to be a useful approach for
finding new effectors for various secretion systems including
T6SS [94]. Some T6SS effectors are part of characteristic gene
clusters or have certain physical properties such as pI or
size, which facilitates their identification [90]. Furthermore,
certain conserved domains are found present in T6SS effec-
