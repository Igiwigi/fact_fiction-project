impulses passing from the periphery to the cerebellum does not admit of much doubt,
It is interesting to note that whereas an animal deprived of, for instance, the left half
of its cerebellum rotates like a right-handed screw coming out of an object (what I
have described as rotation away from the side of the lesion), one in which the left
inferior peduncle of the cerebellum is divided rotates like a right-handed screw
entering an object (what I have described as rotation to the side of the lesion), This
point is of further interest when we remember that intracranial section of the auditory
nerve was responsible for rotation in exactly the same direction as that in which the
animal rotates when one of the inferior peduncles of the cerebellum is divided; that
is to say with a left-sided lesion in both cases the animal rotates like a right-handed
screw entering an object. That the bulk of the afferent impulses, whose interruption are responsible for this
phenomenon, reach the cerebellum by way of the auditory nerve and the inferior
cerebellar peduncle is evident from the above considerations, but that all of the
impulses do not reach the peduncle from the auditory nerve is made clear by the fact
that lateral section of the medulla below the auditory nerve and its nucleus sometimes
results in similar rotation of the animal about its longitudinal axis. And although
such rotation does not always result from this lesion, yet the other indications of
disturbance of equilibration are the same when these tracts are interrupted far back
in the medulla as when the inferior peduncle is itself divided close to the cerebellum. At first sight the disorders of motility would appear to lend strong support to the
view that the cerebellum has a downward action on the muscles of the limbs through
the spinal centres, but that such a conclusion is open to serious question is evident
from a consideration of the results obtained by CLaupE Bernarp* in frogs and puppies,
and by Morr and Suerrinetont in monkeys, for these observers found that impairment
of movement in a limb resulted on section of the sensory roots of the spinal nerves
supplying the limb,

If the interruption of afferent impulses in their passage through the sensory nerve
roots is capable of producing impairment of movement, there is no reason why the
interruption of similar afferent impulses passing up the lateral region by the medulla
and in the inferior cerebellar peduncle should not be also capable of bringing about a
similar result. ;

That this is probably the correct explanation of the way in which defective move-
ment is brought about by division of one inferior peduncle or by lateral section of the
medulla is suggested by the fact that the degree of sensory and motor impairment in
the limbs is very much alike, that is, the limb in which motor power is most defective

after these lesions is that in which most sensory impairment was met with, while
that in which there was least sensory impairment was that in which there was least
defect of movement.
