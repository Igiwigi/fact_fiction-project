For the sake of brevity we shall usually
omit, when possible, the time factor e'. Since, in the case of air, v is a small quantity, when expressed in em. sec. units, it
is clear from (9) and (10) that for all audible sounds |/| will be large compared with
|h|. In fact, at any ordinary distance r from the origin the # terms in (11) will
become insensible owing to the factor exp. {—($0/v)'" 7}. For plane waves propagated in the negative direction of the axis of «, the solution
