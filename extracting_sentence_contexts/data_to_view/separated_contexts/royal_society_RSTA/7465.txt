The effect of absorption may be to raise
or to lower this barrier. If an inhibiting effect on nuclei of the stable solid phase in a system
is greater than the effect on less stable phases the formation of the latter is made more likely. In the present set of experiments we have observed that conditions slightly removed from
those which give rise to metastable phases do, in fact, give rise to visible distortion of the
