— extensive validation and analysis using multi-layer PWM-coded NNs show good
scalability of the proposed approach; however, deeper NNs may need circuit-level
compensation after each layer or high-precision representation techniques to improve
the overall accuracy and efficiency.

5. Conclusion

We propose the first mixed-signal (analogue/digital/relative temporal) perceptron design using
the principles of PWM. Central to our design are a number of parallel inverters that suitably
transcode the input-weight pairs from the spatial domain to the relative temporal domain.
This approach aims to deliver high resilience to amplitude and frequency variations in the
supply voltage, exploiting the fact that PWM-based solutions are typically agnostic to such
variations.

Another advantage of the proposed design is its simplicity. While conventional
implementations of the perceptron require complex logic to perform multiplication and addition,
the proposed approach uses only one gate (either an inverter or a two-input NAND) per
bit for every input. Thus, for the 3 x 3 weighted addition VAC we used only 54 transistors.
This significantly reduces the logic requirement and, therefore, the power consumption of the
entire device.

Extensive experimentation on the perceptron and its use in neural networks of relatively
significant sizes helps to explore the perceptron design’s advantages, usability and limitations.
Also through experimental studies, design improvements are found which further strengthen the
