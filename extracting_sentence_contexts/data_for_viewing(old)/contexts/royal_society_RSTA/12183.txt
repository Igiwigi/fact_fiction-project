assumed to be determined by the components of its rotation, and not at all b
distortion or compression, it seems natural to infer that the viscous resistance to
change of the strain is determined in terms of the same quantities and therefore by
quadratic function of d/dt (f, g,h). This argument, if granted, will carry with
the assertion of Oum’s law of linear conduction in its general form, though probabh
with co-efficients depending on the period, for disturbances of all periods however
small.

In the expressions for JF and W, as given above, the principal axes of the
xolotropic conductivity are taken to coincide with the principal axes of th
wolotropic electric displacement, a simplification which need not generally exist.

The fact that the electric dissipation-function does not involve the velocities of the
material system shows that the forces derived from it are solely electromotive.

93. It seems clear that viscous terms alone could not possibly in any actual
medium be so potent as to reduce the real part of the complex index of refraction
suitable to metallic media to be a negative quantity. Such a state of matters arising
from purely internal action involves instability ; while on the contrary the geners
influence of viscosity is to improve rather than to diminish the dynamical stability of
asystem. This phenomenon, if indeed it is here properly described, must therefore
be due to the support and control of some other vibrating system ; an explanation
which has been proposed is to adopt the views of Youna and SeLimerer, and ascribe
its origin to a near approach between the periods of hydrodynamical vibrations of the
atoms in the molecule and the simultaneous rotational vibrations of the «ther
