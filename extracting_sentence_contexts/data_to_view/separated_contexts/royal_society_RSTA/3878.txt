The elemental characterization of the sample helped to select the most interesting areas for
Raman molecular imaging. Although, in comparison with the in situ data, no new degradation
compounds were detected, molecular images provided new important information regarding
their stratigraphic distribution. In fact, as can be seen in figure 4, the outer corrosion crust on
sample M03 was predominantly composed of goethite (blue image), while magnetite (red image)
was the main compound of the inner layer. This stratigraphic composition is quite common in Fe-based archaeological finds. In fact, iron
oxides tend to be located in the inner corrosion layers (in this case, magnetite was probably
generated in a second step as a result of the decrease of oxygen levels due to the formation of
new outer rust layers).
