Of alloys of platina, palladium, rhodium, and. iridium and
osmium, a ready test is offered when the point is not to/ ascer-
tain what the metal is, but merely whether it be present or
not. - For this purpose we have only to compare the. action
of the same acid on the alloy and .on a piece, of. steel; the
increased action on the alloy immediately indicates the pre-
sence of the metal; and by the difference of action, which
on experience is found to be produced with the different
metals, a judgment may be formed eyen of the particular
one present. v

The order in which the different alloys stand with regard
to this action, is as follows: steel, cromium alloy, silver
alloy, gold alloy, nickel alloy, rhodium alloy, iridium and
osmium alloy, palladium alloy, platina alloy, With similar
acid the action on the pure steel was scarcely perceptible ; the
Silver alloy gave very little gas, nor was the gold much
acted on. All the others gave gas copiously, but the platina
alloy in most abundance. In connection with the analysis of these alloys, there are
some very interesting facts to be observed during the action
of acids on them, and perhaps none of these are more strik-
ing than those last referred to. When the alloys are im-
mersed in diluted acid, the peculiar properties which some of
them exhibit, not only mark and distinguish them from com-
mon 5teel, and from each. other, but also give rise to some
considerations on the state of particles of matter of different
