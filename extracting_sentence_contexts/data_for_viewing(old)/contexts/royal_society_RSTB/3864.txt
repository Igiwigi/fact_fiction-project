of this gymnospermous type occur except in the flower of the Cycadeoidew, so that
it may be said that the gynccium of Cycadeoidea, reduced to a limit of one ovule,
would give a close approximation to the gynccium of Welwitschia which has
attained the minimum construction.

7. A minimum construction does not, however, imply any phylogenetic relationship
to other minimum types. It is important not to confuse parallel biological features,
due to similar response to similar xerophytie conditions, with indications of
phylogenetic relationship. The flower of Cycadeoidea is also, it is true, a generalised
anthrostrobilus, with perianth region, andreecium, and gyncecium, each independently
specialised and non-conformable in phyllotaxis construction. It also presents a much
less tendency to minimum construction, each region is still practically “ indefinite,”
though this is in agreement with the fact that the flowers’ of Cycadeoidea were
large and solitary, while those of Welwitschia are small and enclosed in spikelets or
strobiloid inflorescence constructions. On the other hand, special features of the floral
mechanism are also in agreement. The peculiar staminal tube is much the same in
both types, as a biological adaptation to subserve the investment and protection of
the gyncecium during the period of expansion, probably as much as a shield from the
action of intense light as from simple desiccation (cf. Papilionacee and Paonia
Moutan). Recapitulatory standpoints are always of interest in floral development,
since there must be a reason for the way in which every factor of growth or time is
initiated or comes into action; thus the original habit of the flower of Welwitschia is
evidently best seen in the full-grown buds, since the extension-mechanism of the
staminal tube is clearly secondary, and as in cleisanthous Graminea, correlated with
the fact that the flowers are no longer exposed in situ by the divergence of the cone-
