What does it mean to say that the sequence of canonical pairs (4.2) converges in distribution
to (Po, 4a)? The simplest notion of convergence is that of distribution operators in the Hilbert—
Schmidt norm. This would correspond to convergence in the L? sense of the densities of joint

1n fact their Wigner densities are everywhere non-negative for even n, as may be seen using multiplicative properties of the
corresponding quasi-characteristic functions.


distributions to the corresponding Gaussian density, in contrast with the ‘weak convergence’ in
the probabilistic sense [10] of the two-dimensional classical central limit theorem. But it can be
shown that [11] in the quantum case convergence is in the stronger sense, for an arbitrary bounded
operator S on L2,(R),

As bounded operators are non-commutative ‘bounded measurable functions’, our quantum
central limit theorem, in which convergence is in the sense of expectations of such ‘functions’, is
actually stronger than the classical central limit theorem in which only expectations of bounded
continuous functions must converge. This is just as well because it is not obvious how to find an
explicit non-commutative substitute in this context for the continuous functions similar to the von
Neumann algebra generated for the measurable ones. i

For many years, the quantum central limit theorem of [11] found few applications, though as =
we will see below it was crucial in suggesting theoretical advances such as quantum Brownian 78
motion.
