As we shall see, this new reformulation is directly expressed in terms
of the invertibility of a. In §4d, we have studied the quasi-invertibility of the spectral operator a=a¢ (that is,
the invertibility of each of its truncations al) = a), where T > 0 is arbitrary). In fact, both
theorems 4.7 and 4.8 (from §4d) are stated in terms of the quasi-invertibility of a, either for a fixed
cé (0,1), withe¢ ; (in theorem 4.7), or (in theorem 4.8) for all c € (0,1), with c# 3 (equivalently,
for all ce (0, 3) or, else, for all ce G, 1)). (Recall from the discussion following theorem 4.7 that
1/2 is not quasi-invertible and, hence, not invertible.) However, although very convenient in
the context of §4d, the new notion of ‘quasi-invertibility’, because it involves a truncation of the
infinitesimal shift 0 (and, hence, also of a as well as of its spectrum o(a); see the beginning of §4d),
is perhaps not so easy to grasp or to verify explicitly. Indeed, we lack concrete formulae for a‘),
whereas we have several explicit expressions for a at our disposal, even when c € (0, 1). It is therefore natural to wonder whether the (usual) notion of invertibility of the spectral
operator a = a, cannot be used to reformulate the RH in this context. (See the discussion following
theorem 4.1 for the usual notion of invertibility of a possibly unbounded operator.) The answer
to this question is affirmative, as we shall explain below; see theorem 5.1.
