It is then shown that the mechanical forcive on the magnetic â€˜matter in any one of

function, whilst the force on a current is to be obtained as the positive gradient with
respect to its position co-ordinate.

Unfortunately all the authors concerned merely talk of magnetic energy without
specifying whether it is to be taken as kinetic or potential energy. One might
perhaps infer that as the results are interpreted in terms of a static potential function
it is implied that all the energies are potential, but the fact that the forces on the
currents are derivable as the positive gradients of the function

suggests that this part of the energy at least is kinetic energy. The difficulty of
sign is therefore still present.

Even if we confine ourselves to the statical theory the same interpretation is not
entirely free from difficulties of another kind. The potential energy in the field is
taken to be represented by
