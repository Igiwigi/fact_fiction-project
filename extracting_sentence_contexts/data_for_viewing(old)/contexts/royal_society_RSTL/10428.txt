In the vital necessity of the power of movement lies no doubt the explanation of
the very early appearance of the buds. If the young polyp, upon abandoning its free-
swimming life and settling in the sand, possessed no means of taking in water and
thus of creeping, it would be very apt to be smothered in the shifting 8and. By the
very early appearance of the buds the young polyp is enabled to imbibe water and to
creep as 800n as the sedentary life is assumed, and is thereby preserved from destruction.

This view receives a strong confirmation upon comparing Leptogorgia with Renilla
in'this respect. The former does not possess the power of creeping but attaches itself
at an early age to 80lid objects in situations where ib is nob likely to be buried.
Precisely as we should expect under the foregoing view, the buds of Leptogorgia do
nob appear at, an early period. In my specimens, in fact, they had not made their
appearance at the end of nearly two months (!), whereas in PRenila they appear at
the end of three days.

As the buds become older and more fully developed they gradually cease to perform
the function of imbibing water. It is however assumed by younger buds and is in
turn lost by the latter as they become older. Throughout the entire life of the
organism this function is performed by the sexual polyps in their early stages. The
function is lost, 80 far as T have observed, as the bud becomes mature and is
adapted to perform the functions of nutrition and reproduction. This may readily
be demonstrated by placing a contracted colony in a vessel of water containing finely
divided carmine. The water is forcibly sucked in through the mouths of all of the
young marginal buds, but never through the adult polyps. This function is performed
