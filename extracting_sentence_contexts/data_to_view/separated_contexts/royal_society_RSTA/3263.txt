They observed perturbations in the
rotational levels of the 3EE state which were attributed to the presence of a neighbouring singlet
state. From the analysis of the spectral lines, the authors first confirmed that ors is the ground
state of the carbon dimer. In fact, it lies only 603.8 cm7! below the a3/7, state [48]. Later on, several
other singlet, triplet, quintet and intercombination band systems of the carbon dimer have been
reported in the literature [1,2,48,51]. At present, Cy has a total of 23 identified band systems,
covering the spectral range 0-55000cm7!, and 21 spectroscopically characterized electronic
states; see [1,2,48,51] for a review.
