One is struck by the fact that a viscosity change from,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934
made fairly probable by the fact that it does explain all,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934
explanation is shown by the fact that the apparent sorption calculated,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934

was partly due to the fact that the smoke settled or,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934

theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,that,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934

is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934

account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,that,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934

value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
curves has been omitted.) The fact that we have to leave,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934

to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934

is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934

and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934

and hitherto undescribed character. The fact that the same character has,that,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935
a piece of Zosterophyllum. The fact that the branched axes under,that,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935

finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
region. In view of the fact that this layer has not,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"the compressed condition. Accordingly the fact that both groups, Botryllids and",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935
balls of different sizes. The fact that the coefficient of friction,that,rsta_1935_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1935

to zero ; but in fact we must find that an,that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
Problem It is a well-known fact that long beams can be,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935

1-15 x 10° cm?. The fact that in both cases the,that,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935

is clearly disproved by the fact that they appear in large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935

crystal can be understood. The fact that the edges of the,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
was once more repeated. The fact that drastic cleansing leaves a,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"of all real solids. The fact that they withstand any cleansing,",that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935

but in view of the fact that potassium iodide reacts with,that,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"in the adult, and the fact that this is the position",that,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1936
objection is supported by the fact that distinction itself is not,that,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1936
probably all connected with the fact that Evotomys is a wild,that,rstb_1936_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1936

"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
less satisfactory owing to the fact that the majority of skulls,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936

base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,that,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936

"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",that,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936

support of this is the fact that it is additional to,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937

the analysis lies in the fact that this determination of the,that,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1938

explanation is shown by the fact that the apparent sorption calculated,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"von Matrizen,” Berlin (1901)). The fact that the quotient of |a,\**""~4|",that,rsta_1934_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1934
may now be completed. Another fact that may be useful in,that,rsta_1934_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1934
was partly due to the fact that the smoke settled or,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"too quickly, and to the fact that conditions were not sufficiently",that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934
part of the scheme; the fact that they were generated independently,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934
; there is also the fact that at a speed of,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934
the series of patterns. The fact that the transverse rolls have,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934
space is due to the fact that the smoke settles ;,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934
no reference made to the fact that the square pattern is,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934
bank. In view of the fact that in cloud banks of,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934
difficulty was occasioned by the fact that in this case neither,that,rsta_1934_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1934
basis of this is the fact that since the same lines,that,rsta_1934_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1934

"too, further complicated by the fact that manganese steel, which has",that,rsta_1934_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"Finally, there is the interesting fact that carbon, when added to",that,rsta_1934_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"has been taken of the fact that we may omit M,,s",that,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934
theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,that,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s possible to,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
0-002° Pt. arises from the fact that a comparison at 50°,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,that,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
been developed to express the fact that the absorptions are symmetrical,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,that,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934

this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934
6: this follows from the fact that in general 2 cos,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934
and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934

segregation in spite of the fact that they were sand castings.,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934

"on the whole by the fact that its cells are smaller,",that,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935

and hitherto undescribed character. The fact that the same character has,that,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935
a piece of Zosterophyllum. The fact that the branched axes under,that,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935

tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"the compressed condition. Accordingly the fact that both groups, Botryllids and",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935
balls of different sizes. The fact that the coefficient of friction,that,rsta_1935_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1935

to zero ; but in fact we must find that an,that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
Problem It is a well-known fact that long beams can be,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
less satisfactory owing to the fact that the majority of skulls,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936

also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,that,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936

"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",that,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936

"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936

duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936

remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936

In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936

effect depends only on the fact that the vibrational spectrum of,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936
can be seen from the fact that (w) — w?)? +,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936

the analysis lies in the fact that this determination of the,that,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1938

"and it is an interesting fact that during this period also,",this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932
this condition lies in the fact that the chorionic villi of,this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932

to be made for this fact in any general treatment. From,this,rsta_1932_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1932
state is offered by this fact that a solid cylinder will,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1932

This is supported by the fact that the lightning discharges produced,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1933

justify this assumption from the fact that the tissue is largely,this,rsta_1933_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1933

this serves to emphasize the fact that the genera and species,this,rstb_1934_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1934

to its posterior extension. This fact appears to have been pointed,this,rstb_1934_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1934

"and it is an interesting fact that during this period also,",this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932

This is supported by the fact that the lightning discharges produced,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1933

this serves to emphasize the fact that the genera and species,this,rstb_1934_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1934

"vegetative cells were found. This fact shows that resting spores, provided",this,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937

support of this is the fact that it is additional to,this,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937

"and M. citrina, and in fact is not confined to species",is,rstb_1931_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1931

"small or large, is a fact needing explanation. There are two",is,rstb_1931_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1931

of these experiments is the fact that the injection of the,is,rstb_1931_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1931

tem- perature (p. 245). The fact that it is not necessary,is,rstb_1931_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1931
castration is due to the fact that the animals were kept,is,rstb_1931_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1931

must be qualified by the fact that the relationship is not,is,rstb_1931_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1931
sinistrality is due to the fact that the twist of the,is,rstb_1931_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1931
discrepancy is almost certainly the fact that gluconic acid is present,is,rstb_1931_0028.txt,txt_rstb,1931

is partly due to the fact that the second primordium is,is,rstb_1932_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1932
point of view is the fact that although these canal waves,is,rstb_1932_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1932

no doubt as to the fact that no nervous tissue is,is,rstb_1932_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1932

Of special interest is the fact that any sideward lean of,is,rstb_1934_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1934

is probably responsible for the fact that the Cambrian rocks are,is,rstb_1934_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1934

"at Comley, together with the fact that the Lapworthella Limestone is",is,rstb_1934_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1934

This is correlated with the fact that at this time the,is,rstb_1934_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1934

One is struck by the fact that a viscosity change from,is,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934
explanation is shown by the fact that the apparent sorption calculated,is,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934
; there is also the fact that at a speed of,is,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934

no reference made to the fact that the square pattern is,is,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934
basis of this is the fact that since the same lines,is,rsta_1934_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1934

"is small, viz., unity. This fact has an interesting application later.",is,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934

attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,is,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934

temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,is,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,is,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934
the last paragraph is in fact equivalent to a change of,is,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934
: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934
and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
our opinion this is a fact of great signi- ficance. In,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
quantum equilibrium. It is this fact which makes us consider a,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
suggestion is supported by the fact that in both the previous,is,rstb_1935_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1935
this paper lies in the fact that their Silurian age is,is,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is evidently related to the fact that the cortical lesion was,is,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935
elevations. It is a significant fact also that tubercles are not,is,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig.,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in coupling. It is a fact far too frequently overlooked that,is,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"is made improbable by the fact that, although hernia is very",is,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935

to be due to the fact that it is composed of,is,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935
chromosomes is indicated by the fact that all the wild species,is,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935
of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,is,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,is,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
and it is a remarkable fact that the caudal region was,is,rstb_1935_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1935

Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,is,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935

in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936

also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,is,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,is,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936

"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",is,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936

This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,is,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936

This is caused by the fact that the frontalis inferior in,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
uniform is given by the fact that the results of the,is,rsta_1937_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1937

This is supported by the fact that hosts containing dead second,is,rstb_1938_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1938

is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934

responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,is,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934
the last paragraph is in fact equivalent to a change of,is,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934

: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934
and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
our opinion this is a fact of great signi- ficance. In,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934

JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935

their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig.,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935

be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935

in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,is,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,is,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936

This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,is,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,is,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936

This is due to the fact that only those D cells,is,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937

girdle of Diplacanthus is in fact like that of Macropetalichthys. (6),is,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937
feature of Gemiindina is the fact that the whole extent of,is,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937

Even its position is in fact different in that it is,is,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,is,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937

has called attention to the fact that the sulcus lunatus is,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
feeling is that the mere fact of confluence or separation of,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
"portrayed, as is also the fact that the sulcus frontalis inferior",is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
This is caused by the fact that the frontalis inferior in,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
uniform is given by the fact that the results of the,is,rsta_1937_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1937
values is shown by the fact that the density readings became,is,rsta_1937_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1937

This is supported by the fact that hosts containing dead second,is,rstb_1938_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1938

history is complicated by the fact that dryness and wetness of,is,rstb_1938_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1938

of this strain is in fact admixed with the 1 source,is,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1938
doubtless is due to the fact that the original infection is,is,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1938

a further illustration of the fact that the Stark effect is,is,rsta_1938_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1938
is only due to the fact that these infinite displacements are,is,rsta_1938_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1938
This is due to the fact that when y — 7,is,rsta_1938_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1938
account was taken of the fact that it is not really,is,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1938
This is equivalent to the fact that the ground attenuation due,is,rsta_1938_0009.txt,txt_rsta,1938

"is certainly owing to the fact that the coils, at these",is,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939

"must not be over-emphasized, the fact of chromosome shrinkage is abundantly",is,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939
This is due to the fact that the adult female is,is,rstb_1939_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1939

theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,the,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934

account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,the,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
stands out more than the fact of its variability and the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
unstretched length. By combining this fact with the X-ray data exact,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934

responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,the,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934

probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934

this paper lies in the fact that their Silurian age is,the,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935
of the body of accurate fact regarding the pre-Devonian land-flora. Without,the,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"on the whole by the fact that its cells are smaller,",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is evidently related to the fact that the cortical lesion was,the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"system, the thalamo-cortical radiation.” The fact remains, however, that in experiments",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935

and hitherto undescribed character. The fact that the same character has,the,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935
a piece of Zosterophyllum. The fact that the branched axes under,the,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
number in the ovaries. The fact that no other animal was,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"greatly, principally owing to the fact that initially the entire stock",the,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"is made improbable by the fact that, although hernia is very",the,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935

a direct result of the fact that the bivalents are not,the,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"chromosomes. That being so, the fact that the complexes and the",the,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"indicate little apart from the fact that thick clumps of ash,",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"integral function of z. The fact that f,..,.. op is always",the,rsta_1935_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1935
this function lies in the fact that the generating function for,the,rsta_1935_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"For a single quantic, this fact is substitutionally expressed by the",the,rsta_1935_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1935

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,the,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,the,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935
balls of different sizes. The fact that the coefficient of friction,the,rsta_1935_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"to take into consideration the fact that, with alcohols and acids",the,rsta_1935_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",the,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"into the crystal, and in fact the amount seems in all",the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935
is in accordance with the fact already ON THE CONSTITUTION OF,the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935
1-15 x 10° cm?. The fact that in both cases the,the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"present, and the microscope in fact shows only irregular masses with",the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"the immediate surroundings, a significant fact which is discussed later. It",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
is clearly disproved by the fact that they appear in large,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
showed the typical figure. The fact that many of these particles,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"of the film, a curious fact which leaves plenty of room",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
to be carefully studied. The fact that the upper part of,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
960° C for silver. The fact that during the earlier stages,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
crystal can be understood. The fact that the edges of the,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
was once more repeated. The fact that drastic cleansing leaves a,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"of all real solids. The fact that they withstand any cleansing,",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
were further complicated by the fact that there was a variety,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
but in view of the fact that potassium iodide reacts with,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935

engine was suggested by the fact that the steel stem of,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935
not the Griess tests. (The fact that the spray affected the,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935
not easy to explain the fact that some fuels behave so,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935
do not readily knock. The fact that the amount of nitrogen,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935
will be mentioned. (1) The fact that the molybdate solution 502,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935
$ mainly due to the fact that the gas passing through,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"ultra-violet is shown by the fact that when a Jena G.G,",the,rsta_1935_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1935
The photographs illustrate the well-known fact that almost all the visible,the,rsta_1935_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"one might expect from the fact that, as the colour temperature",the,rsta_1935_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"set up, and (6) the fact that for a small fraction",the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1935

be altogether suppressed. The interesting fact is shown of the detonation,the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"is solely due to the fact that, in order to obtain",the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"of this lies in the fact that, while a pronounced “",the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"in the adult, and the fact that this is the position",the,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1936
objection is supported by the fact that distinction itself is not,the,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1936
probably all connected with the fact that Evotomys is a wild,the,rstb_1936_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1936
assume that they are in fact prepubertal. The testes of the,the,rstb_1936_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
less satisfactory owing to the fact that the majority of skulls,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
6. Additional points are the fact that while the first three,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,the,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",the,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
74 100 166 Another curious fact is the small difference between,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936

base this view on the fact that Srensio’s suggested restoration of,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937
"may be afforded by the fact that in Pterychthiodes, which StENsto",the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937

shown (P. 501) by the fact that it can be displaced,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937
feature of Gemiindina is the fact that the whole extent of,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937
"is partly due to the fact that, while the incisor region",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
of considerable importance is the fact that in all my specimens,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
"of specimen A, despite the fact that in specimen A the",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937

"crown of the tooth, in fact it is recogniz- able before",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937

the same phenomenon. Certainly the fact that a niche is present,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
“‘endostichos”’ are differentiated by the fact that the members of the,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937

; being satisfied with the fact that the pars ventralis is,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
perhaps an expression of the fact that in these cases the,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937

has called attention to the fact that the sulcus lunatus is,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
parallel sulcus and establishes the fact that in many cases the,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
"in any way elongated, in fact rather contracted, so that the",the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
parietal lobule indicated by the fact that there are no sulci,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
feeling is that the mere fact of confluence or separation of,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
sufficient remains to establish the fact that the inferior parallel sulcus,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937

various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
curves has been omitted.) The fact that we have to leave,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
stands out more than the fact of its variability and the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
unstretched length. By combining this fact with the X-ray data exact,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
been developed to express the fact that the absorptions are symmetrical,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,the,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934

"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934

this paper lies in the fact that their Silurian age is,the,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935
of the body of accurate fact regarding the pre-Devonian land-flora. Without,the,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"on the whole by the fact that its cells are smaller,",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is evidently related to the fact that the cortical lesion was,the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"system, the thalamo-cortical radiation.” The fact remains, however, that in experiments",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935

and hitherto undescribed character. The fact that the same character has,the,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935
a piece of Zosterophyllum. The fact that the branched axes under,the,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"greatly, principally owing to the fact that initially the entire stock",the,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"chromosomes. That being so, the fact that the complexes and the",the,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935

tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935

this function lies in the fact that the generating function for,the,rsta_1935_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",the,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"into the crystal, and in fact the amount seems in all",the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935
is in accordance with the fact already ON THE CONSTITUTION OF,the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935

is clearly disproved by the fact that they appear in large,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"of the film, a curious fact which leaves plenty of room",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
to be carefully studied. The fact that the upper part of,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"of this lies in the fact that, while a pronounced “",the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"in the adult, and the fact that this is the position",the,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1936
objection is supported by the fact that distinction itself is not,the,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1936
probably all connected with the fact that Evotomys is a wild,the,rstb_1936_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1936
assume that they are in fact prepubertal. The testes of the,the,rstb_1936_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
less satisfactory owing to the fact that the majority of skulls,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
6. Additional points are the fact that while the first three,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,the,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",the,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936

"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936

This asymmetry might be in fact a displacement of the ventral,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936

remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936

In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936

shown (P. 501) by the fact that it can be displaced,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937
feature of Gemiindina is the fact that the whole extent of,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937
"is partly due to the fact that, while the incisor region",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937

the same phenomenon. Certainly the fact that a niche is present,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
“‘endostichos”’ are differentiated by the fact that the members of the,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937

feeling is that the mere fact of confluence or separation of,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937

According to GEITLER (1932) this fact might perhaps find its explanation,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937
(see p. 28)—but to the fact that the two halves of,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937

I imagine that to this fact and to the adhesion to,to,rstb_1937_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1937

This is due to the fact that only those D cells,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937

difficult to see that this fact carries any weight at all,to,rstb_1937_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1937
I imagine that to this fact and to the adhesion to,to,rstb_1937_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1937
the Mycetophilidae owing to the fact that all the Mycetophilidae which,to,rstb_1937_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1937

"is partly due to the fact that, while the incisor region",to,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937

is partly due to the fact that in man we have,to,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
sufficient remains to establish the fact that the inferior parallel sulcus,to,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937

is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934

responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,is,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934
the last paragraph is in fact equivalent to a change of,is,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934

this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934
and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934

our opinion this is a fact of great signi- ficance. In,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934

JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935

their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig.,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935

be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935

confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,is,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936

feature of Gemiindina is the fact that the whole extent of,is,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937

Even its position is in fact different in that it is,is,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,is,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937

has called attention to the fact that the sulcus lunatus is,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
feeling is that the mere fact of confluence or separation of,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
"portrayed, as is also the fact that the sulcus frontalis inferior",is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
This is caused by the fact that the frontalis inferior in,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
uniform is given by the fact that the results of the,is,rsta_1937_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1937

of this strain is in fact admixed with the 1 source,is,rstb_1938_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1938

a further illustration of the fact that the Stark effect is,is,rsta_1938_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1938
is only due to the fact that these infinite displacements are,is,rsta_1938_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1938
This is due to the fact that when y — 7,is,rsta_1938_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1938

"is certainly owing to the fact that the coils, at these",is,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939

"must not be over-emphasized, the fact of chromosome shrinkage is abundantly",is,rstb_1939_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1939
This is due to the fact that the adult female is,is,rstb_1939_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1939

This is correlated with the fact that at this time the,is,rstb_1934_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1934

One is struck by the fact that a viscosity change from,is,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934
explanation is shown by the fact that the apparent sorption calculated,is,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934

no reference made to the fact that the square pattern is,is,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934
basis of this is the fact that since the same lines,is,rsta_1934_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1934

"is small, viz., unity. This fact has an interesting application later.",is,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,is,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934

attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,is,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934

temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,is,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,is,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934
the last paragraph is in fact equivalent to a change of,is,rsta_1934_0002.txt,txt_rsta,1934
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934
: this follows from the fact that wu — i is,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934
this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,is,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934
and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
our opinion this is a fact of great signi- ficance. In,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
quantum equilibrium. It is this fact which makes us consider a,is,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
suggestion is supported by the fact that in both the previous,is,rstb_1935_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1935
this paper lies in the fact that their Silurian age is,is,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935

JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,is,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig.,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,is,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in coupling. It is a fact far too frequently overlooked that,is,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,is,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,is,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,is,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935

Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,is,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935

Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,is,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935

in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936

also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,is,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936

confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,is,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,is,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,is,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937

may be sought in the fact that the former is the,be,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1932

main difference lies in the fact that the proctodzeum begins to,the,rstb_1931_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1931

theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,the,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s possible to,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934

account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,the,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,the,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934

would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
stands out more than the fact of its variability and the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
unstretched length. By combining this fact with the X-ray data exact,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
been developed to express the fact that the absorptions are symmetrical,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,the,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934

this paper lies in the fact that their Silurian age is,the,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935
of the body of accurate fact regarding the pre-Devonian land-flora. Without,the,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"on the whole by the fact that its cells are smaller,",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is evidently related to the fact that the cortical lesion was,the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"system, the thalamo-cortical radiation.” The fact remains, however, that in experiments",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935

and hitherto undescribed character. The fact that the same character has,the,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935
a piece of Zosterophyllum. The fact that the branched axes under,the,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
number in the ovaries. The fact that no other animal was,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"greatly, principally owing to the fact that initially the entire stock",the,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"is made improbable by the fact that, although hernia is very",the,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"Bonp (1920) has emphasized the fact that when there is asymmetry,",the,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935

a direct result of the fact that the bivalents are not,the,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"chromosomes. That being so, the fact that the complexes and the",the,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935
Tables III-V show the remarkable fact that 93 out of 99,the,rstb_1935_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"features, the first being the fact that whereas the male has",the,rstb_1935_0016.txt,txt_rstb,1935

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"indicate little apart from the fact that thick clumps of ash,",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"the compressed condition. Accordingly the fact that both groups, Botryllids and",the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
then in spite of the fact that the intercleavage intervals remain,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"however, and this explains the fact that the cleavage and gastrulation",the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"integral function of z. The fact that f,..,.. op is always",the,rsta_1935_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1935
this function lies in the fact that the generating function for,the,rsta_1935_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"For a single quantic, this fact is substitutionally expressed by the",the,rsta_1935_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1935

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,the,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,the,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935
balls of different sizes. The fact that the coefficient of friction,the,rsta_1935_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"to take into consideration the fact that, with alcohols and acids",the,rsta_1935_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",the,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"into the crystal, and in fact the amount seems in all",the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935
is in accordance with the fact already ON THE CONSTITUTION OF,the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935
1-15 x 10° cm?. The fact that in both cases the,the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"present, and the microscope in fact shows only irregular masses with",the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"the immediate surroundings, a significant fact which is discussed later. It",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
is clearly disproved by the fact that they appear in large,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
showed the typical figure. The fact that many of these particles,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
the bare glass. A curious fact is illustrated by the comparison,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"of the film, a curious fact which leaves plenty of room",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
to be carefully studied. The fact that the upper part of,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
960° C for silver. The fact that during the earlier stages,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
crystal can be understood. The fact that the edges of the,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
was once more repeated. The fact that drastic cleansing leaves a,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"of all real solids. The fact that they withstand any cleansing,",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
were further complicated by the fact that there was a variety,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
but in view of the fact that potassium iodide reacts with,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935

engine was suggested by the fact that the steel stem of,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935
not the Griess tests. (The fact that the spray affected the,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935
not easy to explain the fact that some fuels behave so,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935
do not readily knock. The fact that the amount of nitrogen,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935
will be mentioned. (1) The fact that the molybdate solution 502,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935
$ mainly due to the fact that the gas passing through,the,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"ultra-violet is shown by the fact that when a Jena G.G,",the,rsta_1935_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1935
The photographs illustrate the well-known fact that almost all the visible,the,rsta_1935_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"one might expect from the fact that, as the colour temperature",the,rsta_1935_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1935

growth of two phases. The fact that the adsorbed atoms remain,the,rsta_1935_0017.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"set up, and (6) the fact that for a small fraction",the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"detonation, as proved by the fact that on traversing a glass",the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1935

be altogether suppressed. The interesting fact is shown of the detonation,the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"is solely due to the fact that, in order to obtain",the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"of this lies in the fact that, while a pronounced “",the,rsta_1935_0015.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"in the adult, and the fact that this is the position",the,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1936
objection is supported by the fact that distinction itself is not,the,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1936
probably all connected with the fact that Evotomys is a wild,the,rstb_1936_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1936
assume that they are in fact prepubertal. The testes of the,the,rstb_1936_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
less satisfactory owing to the fact that the majority of skulls,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
6. Additional points are the fact that while the first three,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,the,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",the,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
74 100 166 Another curious fact is the small difference between,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
This asymmetry might be in fact a displacement of the ventral,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936
remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936
nervous paths. And the further fact that menstruation in women in,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936
In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936

base this view on the fact that Srensio’s suggested restoration of,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937
"may be afforded by the fact that in Pterychthiodes, which StENsto",the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937

shown (P. 501) by the fact that it can be displaced,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937
feature of Gemiindina is the fact that the whole extent of,the,rstb_1937_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1937
"is partly due to the fact that, while the incisor region",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
of considerable importance is the fact that in all my specimens,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
"of specimen A, despite the fact that in specimen A the",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937

"crown of the tooth, in fact it is recogniz- able before",the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937

the same phenomenon. Certainly the fact that a niche is present,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
“‘endostichos”’ are differentiated by the fact that the members of the,the,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937

; being satisfied with the fact that the pars ventralis is,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
perhaps an expression of the fact that in these cases the,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
verticalis sufficiently accounts for the fact that the area striata does,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
lunatus is evidenced by the fact that the cortex immediately behind,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
has called attention to the fact that the sulcus lunatus is,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
parallel sulcus and establishes the fact that in many cases the,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
"in any way elongated, in fact rather contracted, so that the",the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
parietal lobule indicated by the fact that there are no sulci,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
feeling is that the mere fact of confluence or separation of,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
sufficient remains to establish the fact that the inferior parallel sulcus,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937

curves has been omitted.) The fact that we have to leave,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"its orientation follows from the fact already pointed out, that the",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
stands out more than the fact of its variability and the,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
unstretched length. By combining this fact with the X-ray data exact,the,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
been developed to express the fact that the absorptions are symmetrical,the,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,the,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,the,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,the,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934

"is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in",the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,the,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934

this paper lies in the fact that their Silurian age is,the,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935
of the body of accurate fact regarding the pre-Devonian land-flora. Without,the,rstb_1935_0004.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"on the whole by the fact that its cells are smaller,",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is evidently related to the fact that the cortical lesion was,the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"system, the thalamo-cortical radiation.” The fact remains, however, that in experiments",the,rstb_1935_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1935

and hitherto undescribed character. The fact that the same character has,the,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935
a piece of Zosterophyllum. The fact that the branched axes under,the,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935
JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,the,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
2. In view of the fact that the follicles of none,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
number in the ovaries. The fact that no other animal was,the,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"greatly, principally owing to the fact that initially the entire stock",the,rstb_1935_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1935

a direct result of the fact that the bivalents are not,the,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"chromosomes. That being so, the fact that the complexes and the",the,rstb_1935_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1935

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935

tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,the,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,the,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,the,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935

this function lies in the fact that the generating function for,the,rsta_1935_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1935

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,the,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,the,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",the,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,the,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"into the crystal, and in fact the amount seems in all",the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935
is in accordance with the fact already ON THE CONSTITUTION OF,the,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935

is clearly disproved by the fact that they appear in large,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"of the film, a curious fact which leaves plenty of room",the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
to be carefully studied. The fact that the upper part of,the,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935

before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
6. Additional points are the fact that while the first three,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,the,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,the,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,the,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",the,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
74 100 166 Another curious fact is the small difference between,the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",the,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"orientation to the egg-periphery, a fact which is in accord with",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",the,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,the,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936

This asymmetry might be in fact a displacement of the ventral,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,the,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936

remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936

In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,the,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,the,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936

of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937

feeling is that the mere fact of confluence or separation of,the,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937

state is offered by this fact that a solid cylinder will,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1932

"and it is an interesting fact that during this period also,",this,rstb_1932_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1932

state is offered by this fact that a solid cylinder will,this,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1932

This is supported by the fact that the lightning discharges produced,this,rsta_1933_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1933

this serves to emphasize the fact that the genera and species,this,rstb_1934_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1934

their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig.,in,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935

According to GEITLER (1932) this fact might perhaps find its explanation,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937
(see p. 28)—but to the fact that the two halves of,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937

I imagine that to this fact and to the adhesion to,to,rstb_1937_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1937

According to GEITLER (1932) this fact might perhaps find its explanation,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937
(see p. 28)—but to the fact that the two halves of,to,rstb_1937_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1937

One is struck by the fact that a viscosity change from,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934
made fairly probable by the fact that it does explain all,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934

was partly due to the fact that the smoke settled or,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934

theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,that,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
already been made to the fact that the determinations in air,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934

account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,that,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934
various curves lies in the fact that the more heavily loaded,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
curves has been omitted.) The fact that we have to leave,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934

"of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
to this explanation by the fact that wool dyed with eosin,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
can be traced to the fact that an absorption equation of,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
been developed to express the fact that the absorptions are symmetrical,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is clearly owing to the fact that the hole is bis),that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934
temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,that,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934
result is deduced from the fact that the characteristic values of,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934

this is seen from the fact that for such a circuit,that,rsta_1934_0024.txt,txt_rsta,1934

and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934

finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935

copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935

view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935
balls of different sizes. The fact that the coefficient of friction,that,rsta_1935_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1935

to zero ; but in fact we must find that an,that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
Problem It is a well-known fact that long beams can be,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
treatment with boiling water. This fact seems to indicate clearly that,that,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935
1-15 x 10° cm?. The fact that in both cases the,that,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935

is clearly disproved by the fact that they appear in large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"of all real solids. The fact that they withstand any cleansing,",that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"in the adult, and the fact that this is the position",that,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1936

"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
less satisfactory owing to the fact that the majority of skulls,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936

base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,that,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
the pre-sphenoid distinct bones. The fact that the two elements are,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",that,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
and fowls lies in the fact that the former have a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
at its apex. From the fact that both in longitudinal and,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
This is confirmed by the fact that growth of the pulp,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"remiges of the fowl), the fact that a definite calamus exists",that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
duckling and gosling feathers. The fact that in definitive feathers pigment,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial transverse,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"explained, as well as the fact that a third engrafted ovary",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly",that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936
remarkable in view of the fact recorded above that ovulation can,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936
to be produced. The well-known fact that suckling is 302 442,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936
nervous paths. And the further fact that menstruation in women in,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936
In this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two,that,rstb_1936_0012.txt,txt_rstb,1936
the pollen grains and the fact that when selfed they breed,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936
was made possible by the fact that many plants from the,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936
requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally no,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936
survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana,that,rstb_1936_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1936
coils is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from,that,rsta_1936_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1936
effect depends only on the fact that the vibrational spectrum of,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936
can be seen from the fact that (w) — w?)? +,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936

to emphasize here that the fact that an = Y1 that,that,rsta_1936_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1936

prob- ably due to the fact that the bulb has a,that,rsta_1936_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1936
to be due to the fact that whilst the adsorbed sulphur,that,rsta_1936_0011.txt,txt_rsta,1936

Even its position is in fact different in that it is,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937

has called attention to the fact that the sulcus lunatus is,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937

my researches I used the fact that the population of Holland,that,rstb_1932_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1932

The proof lies in the fact that comparisons so limited yield,that,rsta_1932_0001.txt,txt_rsta,1932

might be urged that the fact of two distinct modes of,that,rstb_1934_0019.txt,txt_rstb,1934

One is struck by the fact that a viscosity change from,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934
made fairly probable by the fact that it does explain all,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934
explanation is shown by the fact that the apparent sorption calculated,that,rsta_1934_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1934

was partly due to the fact that the smoke settled or,that,rsta_1934_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1934

theory here developed by the fact that the first power of,that,rsta_1934_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1934
correction was due to the fact that the vacuum determinations were,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
Additional complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934

is on account of the fact that all temperature measurements in,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934

account being taken of the fact that the baro- meter is,that,rsta_1934_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1934
we should expect from the fact that the ground state of,that,rsta_1934_0004.txt,txt_rsta,1934

value arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934

"a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-",that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
measured lies therefore in the fact that for a short time—the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934

but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
rather an expression of the fact that in the simplest formulation,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934
arrangement accounts readily for the fact that the a-dimension of the,that,rsta_1934_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1934

may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the hypothesis of ‘‘,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
new equations consists in the fact that they represent the absorption,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934
conclusion was confirmed by the fact that a reversal of sign,that,rsta_1934_0005.txt,txt_rsta,1934

is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only,that,rsta_1934_0006.txt,txt_rsta,1934
evidence definitely points to the fact that the striee have been,that,rsta_1934_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1934

responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable,that,rsta_1934_0003.txt,txt_rsta,1934

and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
"diameters are clearly shown. The fact that in the binary alloys,",that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934

justified in view of the fact that the annealing experiments gave,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
probably due chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934
separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended,that,rsta_1934_0014.txt,txt_rsta,1934

and hitherto undescribed character. The fact that the same character has,that,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935
a piece of Zosterophyllum. The fact that the branched axes under,that,rstb_1935_0009.txt,txt_rstb,1935

finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural,that,rstb_1935_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately 35 animals,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935

"of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant animals, with",that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
copulation is extremely rare. The fact that only 3 animals in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
This is shown by the fact that the active mammary glands,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
view is provided by the fact that sperms were present in,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
the young are weaned. ‘The fact that three of the lactating,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
alternative is supported by the fact that ten embryos and one,that,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935

of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"poorly developed, but to the fact that the zooids all develop",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
number would account for the fact that the zooids of a,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooids is shown by the fact that a piece of test,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"again, and apart from the fact that each zooid has an",that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the,that,rstb_1935_0014.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"present work, lies in the fact that it is the source",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is possibly due to the fact that the tubular glands of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
theory are limited by the fact that he was not aware,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the mammille lie partly,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"indicate little apart from the fact that thick clumps of ash,",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"cells, quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is",that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
after sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
even more important is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of the,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
region. In view of the fact that this layer has not,that,rstb_1935_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"the compressed condition. Accordingly the fact that both groups, Botryllids and",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
then in spite of the fact that the intercleavage intervals remain,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"This consideration, together with the fact that in the urodele development",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
is probably due to the fact that chordal cell division is,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
Of more importance is the fact that the rate of development,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
At the same time the fact that epibolic gastrulation is less,that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935
"however, and this explains the fact that the cleavage and gastrulation",that,rstb_1935_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1935

especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935
looked for. Now the experimental fact that the optical extinction directions,that,rsta_1935_0008.txt,txt_rsta,1935
balls of different sizes. The fact that the coefficient of friction,that,rsta_1935_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1935
load between the surfaces. The fact that oleic acid gives less,that,rsta_1935_0010.txt,txt_rsta,1935
to zero ; but in fact we must find that an,that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that many gravity results have",that,rsta_1935_0012.txt,txt_rsta,1935
may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced in,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
is also confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935
Problem It is a well-known fact that long beams can be,that,rsta_1935_0007.txt,txt_rsta,1935

1-15 x 10° cm?. The fact that in both cases the,that,rsta_1935_0018.txt,txt_rsta,1935

Still more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935

crystal can be understood. The fact that the edges of the,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
was once more repeated. The fact that drastic cleansing leaves a,that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935
"of all real solids. The fact that they withstand any cleansing,",that,rsta_1935_0016.txt,txt_rsta,1935

but in view of the fact that potassium iodide reacts with,that,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935

not easy to explain the fact that some fuels behave so,that,rsta_1935_0013.txt,txt_rsta,1935

"in the adult, and the fact that this is the position",that,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1936
objection is supported by the fact that distinction itself is not,that,rstb_1936_0002.txt,txt_rstb,1936
probably all connected with the fact that Evotomys is a wild,that,rstb_1936_0003.txt,txt_rstb,1936

"probably, also the eighth. The fact that the type of Nythosaurus",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
less satisfactory owing to the fact that the majority of skulls,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"the last post-canines, and the fact that the young have a",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth are,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth does,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936

base of the third. The fact that this tooth is only,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
Bork called attention to the fact that the tooth germs of,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"described cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very",that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
with a reptilian tooth. The fact that in the early cynodonts,that,rstb_1936_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1936
confusion is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales,that,rstb_1936_0008.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is largely due to the fact that nearly every skull from,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"large, thick bones. From the fact that the surface of the",that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly forms,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936
succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars,that,rstb_1936_0001.txt,txt_rstb,1936

"ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the peripheral extensions of",that,rstb_1936_0007.txt,txt_rstb,1936
From this emerges the curious fact that in 1933 all of,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is undoubtedly due to the fact — .- that in two,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
almost certainly due to the fact that the intensity of the,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
therefore only due to the fact that it was based on,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
full moon ; (2) the fact that the differences are at,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
result is due to the fact already explained that in 1934,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up,that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"alternatives with certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably",that,rstb_1936_0010.txt,txt_rstb,1936
complicated owing largely to the fact that the presence of yolk,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
is sufficiently evident from the fact that it may be present,that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"however, it differs in the fact that insect gastrulation is no",that,rstb_1936_0011.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"may be due to the fact that with rubbing experiments, it",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids,",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur when,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
"hours, which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to",that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
of cells. 5—Consecutive Infection The fact that aphids are capable of,that,rstb_1936_0013.txt,txt_rstb,1936
may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a,that,rstb_1936_0006.txt,txt_rstb,1936

Even its position is in fact different in that it is,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
support of this is the fact that it is additional to,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937
nature at this stage. The fact that there are two prominent,that,rstb_1937_0015.txt,txt_rstb,1937

has called attention to the fact that the sulcus lunatus is,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
of this group is the fact that practically the whole area,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937
is partly due to the fact that in man we have,that,rstb_1937_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1937

bases this suggestion on the fact that between December and April,and,rstb_1935_0005.txt,txt_rstb,1935
