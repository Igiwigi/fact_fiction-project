of Mars” as a subject meriting further investigation.

Such are all the observations relative to the extensive atmosphere of Mars
which my observatory can furnish. One of these, viz. that of the 17th of last
March, demands further consideration, lest, having served to invalidate one
hypothesis, it might be brought forward to support another ; namely, that
* the red colour of the planet Mars is dependent upon the physical properties
of his atmosphere.”* Moreover, it seems inconsistent with a previous ob-
servation.

'The star 37 Tauri had © nearly the colour of Mars” whilst in contact with
the planet ; whereas, the star 42 Leonis was © beautifully blue” previously and
subsequently to occultation by the planet. The facts are different ;—are they
reconcileable? 'The following then are extracts from the Observatory Journal.
On the night following the obseryation of 37 Tauri, namely, the 18th of
March, © the five-feet Equatorial was placed upon Mars, in order to compare
its colour with that of 37 Tauri; the star and planet were still in the field to-
