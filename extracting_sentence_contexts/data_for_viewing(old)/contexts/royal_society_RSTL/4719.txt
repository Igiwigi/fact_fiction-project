anterior of these processes, calls it * une seconde apophyse articulaireh;” and M. pz
BLainvilre, struck rather with the shape of the process, calls it © apophyse styloide||;”
whilst M. STraus-DuRcknei, regarding it as a sort of accessory transverse process,
prefers to call it © apophyse plagienne@| :” I have termed it the * anapophysis**,” The
8econd tubercle is usually a somewhat larger process, situated between the diapo-
physis and the upper or anterior zygapophysis; it is equally constant in certain ver-
tebr& in Man, and attains in some mammals, the Armadillos for instance, as great a
length as the spinous process itself. The part in Man to which I allude is that
which the accurate Bouncery has depicted in his beautiful plates, and indicated
as the © face ruguense de Vapophyse articulaire supcrieure-4.,” STRaUs-DURCKHEIM
mistakes it for the superior articular process itself, in the feline quadrupeds, calls
it *apophyse antoblique,” and denies the existence of anterior oblique processes in the |,
third to the ninth dorsal vertebra inclusive ; which do, in fact, possess the articulating

surfaces 80 called, but want the accessory process which becomes 80 markedly deve-

loped in the posterior dorsal and lumbar vertebrz. For this accessory process if

have proposed the name of * metapophysis{,” and have noticed some of its modifica-

or both met- and an-apophysis, is uncertain.
