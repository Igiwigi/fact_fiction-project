Under most conditions, however, it is easy to distinguish the intergranular boundaries
in the cast surface, either by the presence of some gas there or by slight differences
of level between one grain and the next.

Occasionally the faces of some of the grains in the surface cast against glass are
covered with a number of very minute pits, whose true character appears only under
a magnification of about 1000 diameters. They are then seen to be pits of definite
geometrical form both as to outline on the surface and as to inner facets. Figs. 7, 8,
and 9 are photographs of these pits in glass-cast cadmium. It will be seen that they
are systems of geometrical figures which remain similar and similarly situated over
the entire surface of a single grain, but change in character from one grain to the
next. These pits appear to be excessively small bubbles or blow-holes which have
taken a geometrical shape, forming, in fact, negative crystals. During the crystal-
lisation the crystalline elements have built themselves around the gas bubbles in
regular orientation, finally leaving the pits as we see them. In support of this view
the appearance seen on fig. 8 may be cited ; the pits are seen to be surrounded by a
halo or circular patch of bright surface—due apparently to the absorption by these
larger geometrical bubbles of the numerous tiny bubbles that dot the surface
elsewhere,

The photographs show these “ air-pits” in cadmium cast against glass under a
magnification in most cases of 1000 diameters, and in one case (fig. 9) of 4200
