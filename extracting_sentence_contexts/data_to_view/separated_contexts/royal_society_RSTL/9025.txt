(9) Let us now very briefly consider the inferences to which these results would em
to point. The ſact that the localizing power of the polypite is completely destroyed as
regards all parts of the bell lying beyond an incision in the latter conclusively proves, as
already stated, that all parts of the bell are pervaded by radial lines of differentiated
tissue, which have at least for one of their functions the conveying of impressions to the
polypitef., The fact in question also proves that the particular effect which is produced
on the polypite by stimulating any one of these lines cannot be $0 produced by stimu-

lating any of the other lines. Or, to state the same thing in the words previously used,
we have conclusive proof that, so far as their function is concerned, these radial linegpf
differentiated tissne are undistinguishable from what we elsewhere know as afferent
nerves. But although these tracts of differentiated tissxwue thus far resemble afferent,
nerves in their function, we s0on see that in one important particular they differ widely
from such nerves; for we have seen that, after they have been divided, stimulation of
their peripheral parts still continues to be transmitted to their central parts, as shown
by the non-localizing movements of the polypite.
