Codon-based methods of estimating dy/ds are therefore power-
ful tools for testing hypotheses concerning the molecular
changes accompanying major evolutionary events [35]. Here, we study the evolution of mitochondrial OXPHOS
genes of South American and African electric fishes by
implementing codon-based models to evaluate changes in
selective pressures that may have accompanied the evolution
of electrogenesis. We take advantage of the fact that
bioelectrogenesis evolved independently in gymnotiforms
and mormyroids to search for convergent patterns of
evolutionary constraint and selection in OXPHOS genes
across these lineages. Shared patterns are likely to indicate
shared evolutionary responses to the metabolic burden of
bioelectrogenesis. Because the OXPHOS system plays a cru-
cial role in cellular energy production, OXPHOS genes are
highly conserved [36,37].
