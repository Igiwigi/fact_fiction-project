The pericycle has also
undergone an enormous thickening, with tangential cell-divisions, around the bases of
the roots. Between their bases secondary tissue, partly consisting of wood, has been
formed in the pericycle in a very anomalous manner; much of this tissue is seen in
transverse section, so the direction of the tracheides must have been tangential with
reference to the stem. There seems, in fact, to have been a special “réseau
radicifere,” as it is called by Van T1eqHem,*t in connection with the bases of these
roots. In fig. 29 we have shown a curious structure which we think may probably repre-
sent a very young root enclosed within the cortex of the stem. The section is a
nearly complete transverse one of a good-sized stem with a considerable amount of
secondary wood.
