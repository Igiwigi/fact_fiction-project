the g's do not change, these complexes will be fixed in space. The complex whose
equation has just been given is the locus of lines along which there is no linear
momentum. If no forces act, if we multiply the equations of motion respectively by
@1, ®g, . . . wg, and add, we geb by integration

Aw*+Bouy?+Coug?+Fof+Go?+Huf=2T

which is the equation of conservation of energy.
If again we multiply the equations of motion by Aw;, Bus, - . . , and add, we arrive
at another integral of the equations,

A%o;*+ B*og+O%,+ Foul+ 0%, +H%uf=K?,
which expresses the fact that the 8um of the 8quares of the 9's is constant.

One more integral may easily be found. For let

A=ma?, 1 B=mb?, ....
then
f*=1=—a? gf=1—0? Þ=l=&
and
G—-C=M(1—?—?))=H—B, &e.

Hence the first three equations may be written in the forms
