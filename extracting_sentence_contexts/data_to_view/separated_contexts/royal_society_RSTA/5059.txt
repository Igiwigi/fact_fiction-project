Bunsen flame, ;4srd of a milligramme of manganese can be detected (SimMLER) ; but
the quantity of alkalies is much smaller—as, for instance, zpgath of a milligramme of
potassium, goolsooth of lithium, and ygq¢ecc00th of sodium (Kircnnor). The
flame spectrum of manganese is almost entirely a banded spectrum, the peculiarities
of which had not been investigated at that time.
