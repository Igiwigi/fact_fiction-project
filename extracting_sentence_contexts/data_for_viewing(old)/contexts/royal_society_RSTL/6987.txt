The formation of this compound, for which I propose the name of diphenylalcohol
or diphenylic acid, takes place according to the equation

C, H; N,, 2NHO, + 2H, 0 = CG, Hy, 0, + 2NHO, + 4N.
Nitrate of tetrazodiphenyl. Diphenyl-alcohol.

Diphenyl-alcohol (diphenylic acid) crystallizes in small white, or slightly tinged plates
or needles, which possess slight solubility in water, but are soluble to any extent in
alcohol and ether. It fuses on heating, and can be sublimed in small quantities by
heating it cautiously in a test-tube. It is thus obtained in the form of oft, white,
very lustrous plates. 'The chemical deportment of diphenyl-alcohol shows it to be
most closely allied to the class of compounds the best-known representative of which
is phenylic alcohol. It may in fact be considered as the first biatomic representative
of this peculiar group of chemical compounds. The new alcohol is readily soluble in
potash, and can be reprecipitated by the addition of an acid. Concentrated ammonia
also dissolyes it. On heating an ammoniacal solution with basic acetate of lead, a white
voluminous precipitate ensues. Heated with ordinary strong nitric acid it is changed
into a nitro-acid, which crystallizes out in yellow roundish crystals; the ammonium-salt
of this acid crystallizes in beautiful long needles.

Action of Alcohol upon Sulphate of Tetrazodiphenyl.

On heating an admixture of alcohol and sulphate of tetrazodipheny], violent decom-
position takes place. The products formed are nitrogen, sulphuric acid, and a solid sub-
