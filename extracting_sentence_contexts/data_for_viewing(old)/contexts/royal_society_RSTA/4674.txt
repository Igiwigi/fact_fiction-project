It is, perhaps, interesting to note that the last term, which is not a function of time, takes the same
shape along the cable as the static sag (w(x) « (¢x — x*) from [24]). It can therefore be seen as
reducing the sag effect due to the increased average dynamic tension in the cable as it oscillates.
The in-plane NNM response, at the level of accuracy of the normal form transformation, therefore
consists of the linear mode shape oscillating at three frequencies along with a dynamically
corrected static sag and a further term in the shape of the square of the linear mode shape. Due to
this final term, the shape of the NNM in the in-plane direction is dependent on the amplitudes of
the resonant responses in the first-in- and out-of-plane modes and varies over each oscillation.
To examine these NNMs, first consider the S1 solution, in which U2 =0. Figure 4 shows the
trajectory of the mid-span deflections v(¢/2,t) and w(¢/2,t) for a range of values of U; up to
the bifurcation amplitude in the y versus —z (to account for the fact that z is defined positive
downwards) plane using (4.13) and (4.15). For each trajectory, the resonant frequency is different,
as shown in figure 3. The dashed line represents the maxima of the trajectories and corresponds
to the initial deflection points from which, provided the initial shape is imposed, the system can
be released into the pure S1 NNM. This initial shape is a half sine wave out-of-plane regardless
of the amplitude of U; but is a more complex weakly amplitude-dependent shape in-plane. Note
that the in-plane deflection plotted here includes static sag—the value of which corresponds to
the minimum of the dashed line where the initial out-of-plane deflection is zero. Any deflection
along the NNM from this point results in the cable oscillating above the static sag position. For the
