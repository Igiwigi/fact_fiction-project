But objects in the
direct path of the insect are often physically incompatible with its continued movement and,
physically or merely sensorily incompatible, they do in fact provoke active compensatory
responses having the effect of restoring to the anterior field of view the general character to
which the moving insect has become accustomed. If this be true of hoppers, then we should
expect to find adult migrants behaving with relation to a ‘wall’ on land much as do hoppers,
although on a larger scale. Such behaviour is in fact well known: the tendency of swarms to
move along valleys. This was observed generally in mountainous Iran apart from the
particular instances given above, and has been mentioned by other authors (Predtechensky
19354; Zolotarevsky 1930; Vosseler 1905). Other factors are probably involved, wind and
temperature especially, but this tendency is at least consistent with the principle of ‘move-
ment in the direction of maximum constancy of the visual field’ (Kennedy 1945).
