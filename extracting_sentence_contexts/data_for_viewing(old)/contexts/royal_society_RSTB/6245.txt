The root of the stapedial artery at first runs into the head vein in this region, but
later severs this connection to run forwards as a capillary beneath, and. in intimate
contact with the head vein.

These examples are intended to illustrate the theory that nerves and both types
of blood vessel show this postulated contact reaction to an equal degree. This type
of hypothesis has the further advantage that whereas blood vessels and nerves are
presumably not physiologically equivalent in the part they play in and their reaction
towards grades of oxygen tension and so forth within organs, yet their selection of
path taken during growth appears to be governed by identical principles. Thus
were we to adopt an hypothesis that the path taken by a nerve fibre was determined
by gradients of oxygen tension, the fact that the behaviour of blood vessels, which
presumably condition such gradients, appears to be similar to that of nerves would
form an insuperable obstacle to such a theory.

The adoption of an outlook upon the development of blood vessels such as that
outlined above would discourage the investment of any particular capillary with
special morphological significance, such as was done by FLEMING, who saw in a
capillary which he found growing forwards from the dorsal end of the third aortic
arch the representative of the external carotid of the Dipnoi. What might be
termed the “ left wing attitude ”’ of an extreme upholder of THoma’s position towards
the morphological relationship of any particular capillary would be that this was
entirely dependent upon the way in which the capillary in question fitted into the
morphological plan of its surroundings. This position provides an easy explanation
