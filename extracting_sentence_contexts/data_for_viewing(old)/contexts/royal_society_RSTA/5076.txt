The picture that emerges from the detailed microstructural studies is one in which a microcrack ;
is initiated in a brittle particle such as a carbide or oxide/silicate by the local stress generated at [a
the head of an array of slip dislocations. The condition that needs to be met for this microcrack 1
to propagate in a brittle manner across the surrounding ferrite grains, however, is that a critical 1g
value of tensile stress must be attained in the plastic zone ahead of a blunt notch or (an initially [oe
sharp, but, at the point of fracture, blunted) fatigue pre-crack tip. The hydrostatic component in :s
this constrained plastic zone is such that, for an initially sharp crack, the tensile stress can be up :
to 2.5 (Tresca) or approximately 3 (Von Mises) times greater than the uniaxial yield stress [6]. The
fact that the microcrack travels across the brittle particle at high velocity is of importance, because
this means that there is insufficient time for dislocation sources in the ferrite matrix close to the :
pre-crack tip to operate. Reliable values for the critical stress of are obtained from blunt-notched a
test-pieces (as in figure 5), in which no warm pre-stressing effects are involved. : 3

Treating the inclusion-initiated microcracks as penny-shaped cracks, the median fracture stress LB
for the ‘as-received’ material in figure 5 (1555 MPa), may be combined with an average inclusion
diameter of 2.35 1m to give a local yp work-of-fracture of approximately 8Jm~. Other results, Da
derived from the fracture stresses in wrought steels containing carbides, suggest a range of order tw
8-14Jm~? [14,18]. It should be emphasized that the very high amounts of work associated with :
failure in standard fracture toughness tests relate to the precursor work required to develop a :3
sufficiently large plastic zone ahead of the fatigue pre-crack to generate the required level of :3
tensile stress to propagate a microcrack. The value, 8-14Jm~?, is a few times that of the generally :
