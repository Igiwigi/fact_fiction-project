This represents the type of non-rusting and acid-resisting
steel now in most general use, and familiarly known as 18:8. Its elongation at
ordinary temperature is specially high, namely, 56%, and at the lower temperature the
figure remains of quite respectable magnitude, 25Â°. Associated as this is with a
tenacity of no less than 119-8 tons, a combination of high tenacity with excellent
ductility, it presents, in fact, the best result obtained in this research. Specimen No. 3671, with 0-71% chromium and 3-34%%, nickel, was introduced as
representing a type of high-tenacity steel in general use in the automobile and aircraft
industry. Previous experience Haprrep (loc. cit.) had indicated that steels with
contents of nickel and chromium of this same order retained in liquid air much of their
original ductility, and to an extent rather better than similar nickel steels without
chromium.
