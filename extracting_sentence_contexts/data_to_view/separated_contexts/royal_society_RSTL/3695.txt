Meanwhile they may in turn receive some elucidation from the researches
detailed in this paper. Parallel lines of inquiry into the anatomical yarieties of the
Malpighian bodies and uriniferous tubes, and into the chemistry of their secretion, in
the different tribes of animals and in various stages of their development, could
scarcely fail either to confirm or to confute what has now been advanced. I shall conclude with three remarks founded on the foregoing facts and speculations.

1. The bile and the urine have been ever classed together as the most, important
excretions. The former is secreted from venous þlood ; the latter it has been thought
ſrom arterial blood, except in some inferior animals, in which the blood from the
lower part of the body circulates through the kidneys.
