though I am not quite certain that I fully comprehend its au-
thor*) were well founded, the texture of the alburnum must
Surely be much more intricate and interwoyen than it is, and its
tubes would lie less accurately parallel with each other than
they do: and were the fibrous substance of the bark progres-
sively changing into alburnum, the bark must of necessity be
firmly attached to the alburnum during the spring and summer
by the continuity, and indeed identity of the vessels and fibres
of both these substances. This, however, is not in any degree
the case, and the bark is in those seasons very easily separated
from the alburnum ; to which it appears to be attached by a
substance that is apparently rather gelatinous than fibrous or
vascular : and the obvious fact, that the adhesion of the corti-
cal vessels and fibres to each other is much more strong than
the adhesion of the bark to the alburnum, affords another
circumstance almost as inconsistent with the theory of MAL-
PIGHI, as with that of MiRBEL.

Many of the experiments of DUHAMEL are, however, appa-
rently favourable to the theory of MarrGnt, respecting the
conversion of bark into alburnum ; and MIRBEL has cited two,
which he appears to think conclusive. In the first of these,
DvnantL shews that pieces of silver wire, inserted in the
bark of trees, were subsequently found in their alburnum ;
but DUnaMEL himself has shewn, with his usual acuteness and
