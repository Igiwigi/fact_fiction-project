Sea TEMPERATURE AS AFFECTING INHERITANCE, ETC. In a previous section we have stated that in 1912 the inheritance in hybrids made
with Z. miliaris as the maternal parent was different from what it had been in
former years. That this changed inheritance was due to some factor operating on
the germ cells before fertilization is indicated by various facts which are fully stated
in Section 16 (see p. 342). The conclusion was forced upon us that some environ-
mental condition had so changed the female germ cells of E. miliaris that they no
longer transmitted the characteristics of the species to hybrid offspring. In this section we suggest that there may be a connection between the changes in
temperature of the inshore waters, during the winters preceding the experiments,
and the types of inheritance found in the hybrids.
