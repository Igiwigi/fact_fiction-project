Though naturally of a very casual nature, restricted as they were to
the course of the vessel in each particular case, these investigations have neverthe-
less yielded important results, and hearty thanks are due to the Danish seamen who
contributed thereto. On some few occasions we were able to work more
systematically and with the assistance of our own staff, as for instance in 1918,
with the schooner “ Margrethe” belonging to the Vendsyssel Packing Co., and
in 1920 and 1921, with the schooner “Dana,” owned by the East Asiatic Company. In both these cases, despite the fact that the vessels had not the special

equipment of the “Thor,” important results were obtained, and the owners, who
generously placed them at our disposal for the work, have highly deserved the thanks
of science. I will now give an account of our investigations at sea, touching very lightly
upon the earlier ones, which are dealt with in detail in the reports already
published. Following on cruises made in 1903-05 with the ‘“ Thor,” I was able to show
(1906)* that full-grown eel larvee were found in quantities in the Atlantic west of
Europe throughout the entire range from the Faroes to Brittany, west of the
1000 metre line.
