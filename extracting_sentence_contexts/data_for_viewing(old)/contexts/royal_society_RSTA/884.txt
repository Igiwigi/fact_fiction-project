wavelet, the Morlet wavelet, is shown in figure 1a and simply comprises a complex sinusoid
within a Gaussian envelope. We can use this wavelet to represent signal information in the
wavelet domain via the CWT. As an example, figure 1b contains a test signal with both a frequency
modulation and a longer-term increasing frequency drift. Inspection of the signal in the time
domain provides limited information, with perhaps a realization that the dominant frequency
is generally increasing over time. The corresponding Fourier transform modulus plot (figure 1c)
also provides limited detailed information apart from a general picture of the range of frequencies
contained within the signal. However, if we view the corresponding wavelet transform modulus
(figure 1d), we may observe a very obvious white band snaking across the transform plane. This
band indicates where most of the energy of the original signal is contained in time and frequency
and we can see that the characteristics of the signal are now displayed in highly resolved detail:
the general frequency drift is evident, increasing over time and the frequency modulation is
obvious from oscillatory nature of the band. In fact, the ridge of the band (shown as a black line
superimposed on the band maxima) may be used to extract the instantaneous frequency of the
signal component relatively easily by projecting this ridge vertically (figure le). This new signal
