Now, as we have seen above, with such values as those with which we have to deal,
6xt/c* is a small fraction, notwithstanding that it increases with the time. . 4

Hence, for the upper layers, we have approximately

Thus it appears that the integral effect is always a stretching, and that it is the

same in amount at whatever speed the globe cools. The fact that, if the globe cools

suddenly, the integral effect must be stretching has been pointed out by Mr. Davison.
If we differentiate (10), we have
