values. As a result, the (random) upper and lower values of the random probability box U4; 0
Fy are given by U,+1(vj), with vj =i/(n + 1) and i=0,...,n +1. This partitioning allows for the
projection of (4.5) onto an n + 1-dimensional Dirichlet distribution. Making use of (3.9), we can
specify F? directly as a random p-box

with (Win41} ~ Dir[1,...,1] and {x(1),n)} being the ordered dataset {xj.,,}, augmented by x(q) = x,
and x(n41) = XR.

The fact that the robust posterior distribution F? can be expressed in this simple manner has
significant implications. Equation (5.12) provides an intuitive understanding of the method that
has been developed. The interval | is partitioned into n +1 closed intervals with boundaries
at the observed points {x;}'!_,. Each of these intervals is assigned a random weight W;, drawn
from a Dirichlet distribution. Note that this Dirichlet distribution with n+ 1 unit parameters
is in fact the uniform distribution on the unit simplex A”, as can be seen from equations (3.1)
and (3.2).

Realizations of the posterior distribution Ff (figure 2b) have a natural interpretation in the
DS theory of belief functions [11]: a probability mass Wj is assigned to the elementary events
[x@-1),x(], from which a belief function on IC R can be constructed. This assignment is inherently
‘imprecise’ in the following sense. The elementary events have overlapping boundaries (the
points x(;)), so that there is no precise probability associated with the open intervals (x(j-1), x()
