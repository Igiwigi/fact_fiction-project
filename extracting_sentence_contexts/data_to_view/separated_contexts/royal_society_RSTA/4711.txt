This inhibition can most
probably be attributed to the formation of HO, and its presence can also explain the minimal
conversion of CO into CO. The lack of CO formation could also be explained by considering
the preferential role of OH attack on RH over CO. The fact that the temperature at which the
turnover for the NTC occurs is lower for increasing fuel size is consistent with equilibrium
calculations when considering different R radicals. This is known as the ‘ceiling temperature’
where [R] = [RO] [14].

(b) Phenomenological analysis of plasma-assisted combustion kinetics of propane/butane

The thermal and plasma-assisted (at 1 atm) fuel consumption profiles are compared to the work of
Koert et al. [27] for propane oxidation using a high-pressure flow reactor at 10 atm (figure 6). Fuel
consumption below 800 K under the effects of the thermal reaction does not occur until elevated
pressures owing to difficulties in forming the alkyl radical, and when initiated an NTC regime
emerges between 740 and 770K.
