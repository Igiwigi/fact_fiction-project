In order to
satisfy the boundary conditions on the perfectly conducting plate, this value of /, must be
equated (for x>0) to that of — Ei at y = 0; the result is the integral equation (67). Equation
(67) is of the type susceptible to the method of Wiener & Hopf (Titchmarsh 1937). The
Wiener-Hopf procedure would be facilitated by the fact that the kernel (4 |x—&€|) is
defined as a Fourier integral in (66), but this really emphasizes the irrelevance of bringing
) into the analysis and indicates that the dual integral equations offer a more direct line
of attack. Another slightly different formulation of the problem may be devised. So far we have
considered the complete field in terms of a ‘correction’ to the field existing in the absence
of the perfectly conducting sheet.
