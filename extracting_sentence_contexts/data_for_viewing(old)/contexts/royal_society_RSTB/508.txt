seems reasonable to assume that there would be much more nitrogenous crop-residue
for nitrification than in the case of the Trifolium repens plot.

But even supposing, for the sake of illustration, that each year’s growth would
leave crop-residue yielding an amount of nitrogen as nitric acid for the next crop, or
succeeding crops, approximately equal to the amount which had been removed in the

crop, the increasing amounts of nitrogen yielded in the crops from year to year could
not be so accounted for; and there’ would remain the amount of nitrogen in the crop-
residue itself, still to be provided in addition, In fact, assuming the proportion of
nitrogen in the crop-residue to that in the removed crop to be as supposed in the
above illustration, nearly 700 lbs. of nitrogen would have been required for the
Medicago crop and crop-residue of 1884; or if we assume the nitrogen in the residue
to be only half that in the crop, about 500 lbs. would have been required. Doubtless,
however, some of the nitrogenous crop-residue would accumulate from year to year.

The results can leave no doubt that the Zrifoliwm repens, the Melilotus leucantha,
and the Medicago sativa, have each taken up much nitrogen from nitric acid within
the soil. But, at any rate so far as the Medicago is concerned, there is nothing in
the figures to justify the conclusion that the whole of its nitrogen can have been so
derived. It is obvious that if nitric acid were the source of the whole there must
have been a great deal formed by the nitrification of the nitrogen of the subsoil. The
