On the other hand, in Angiopteris Teismaniana, A. erecta, and Marattia ascensionis,
they not only exist in the parenchymatous portions, but they are equally abundant,
though of smaller size, in the dense layer of sclerenchyma * which encases the inner
parenchyma. In sevyeral of my figures of the fossil forms I have represented these canals
as being more or less filled with a cylindrical rod of black carbon, as in the example of
fig. 17, . T have seen nothing like this in any of the vascular tubes, whilst in the
canals it is the common condition. It appears to me that this difference is due to
something more than mere infiltration of carbonaceous matter in the case of the inter-
cellular canals; in all probability the black substance is the carbonized residuum of the
gum with which these canals were once filled.

M. Rexaulr has already called attention (oc. cit.) to the fact that whilst in our fossil
examples the hypodermal sclerenchyma forms an interrupted layer, in the recent
Marattiacee it forms a continuous one. The inner margin of my sections of Angio-
pteris erecta display an irregular dentate outline, which approaches in some slight degree
to that of fig. 1. M. Rexavir has further pointed out that ordinarily in Angiopteris
there are isolated bundles of sclerenchyma within and detached from the continuous
hypodermic layer. As already shown, I find these islets to be wanting in Marattia lavs
and M. frazinea (that is, in the two species which exhibit no gum-canals in the sclero-
dermic layer), whilst they are present in Angiopteris Teismanian, A. erecta, and Marattia
ascensionis; they are also more conspicuous in the thick bases of the petioles than in
their slender upper extremities.
