.Now a measurement
of this kind is justifiable only if it be known beforehand that the natural excitation
wave hasa simple spread along the muscle fibres and exactly in the line of the
contacts. Both premisses were assumed by Gorcu; but, as we can clearly show,
neither is warranted by the facts. It is impossible to calculate and express the rate
of propagation even approximately, from the times at which the natural excitation
wave appears at given points on the ventricular surface, even if we have accurate
estimates of these readings. The course of the excitation wave, relative to a pair of
surface points, is not the same for different regions of the heart.
