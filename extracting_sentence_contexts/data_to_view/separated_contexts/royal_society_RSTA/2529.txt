From the small diagrams in figs. 3 and 4, showing the paths
of the waves through the earth, it can be seen that the rays which strike the core leave
the focus at inclinations which are very nearly vertical. The times taken by these
waves differ from those of the corresponding rays of a normal earthquake, therefore,
by an amount which is practically constant at all the distances for which these phases
can be observed. The difference is, in fact, within one or two seconds of the time of
travel along the vertical path from the deep focus to the normal depth. By extra-
polating Knorrâ€™s table Professor TurNER} inferred that the times taken in travelling
vertically from a depth of 0:06 R to the normal depth are 46 sec. in the case of P
waves and 86 sec.
