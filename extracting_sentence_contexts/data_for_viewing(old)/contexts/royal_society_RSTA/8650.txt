A SELECTIVE HOT-WIRE MICROPHONE. 405

the form of heat is lost mainly by convection. There is in fact above the grid a free
convection current whose velocity depends on the temperature and diameter of the
platinum wire. A sound of suitable pitch produces in the neck of the resonator an
alternating current of air which is superimposed upon the free convection current,
with the result that the convection of heat from the platinum wire is alternately retarded
and accelerated. It can easily be seen that if the maximum velocity of the alternating
air-current does not exceed the velocity of the convection current, the periodic tempera-
ture change produced in the platinum wire will have the same frequency as that of the
sound stimulating the resonator.

This is in accordance with the observed fact that when the microphone is held
vertically the note heard in the telephones has the same pitch as that of the original
sound.

Next, suppose that the microphone is held so that its axis is horizontal and the grid
lies in a vertical plane.. The free convection current is now at right angles to the axis
of the neck, and the effect of an oscillatory motion of the air in the neck (parallel to its
axis) will be to produce a periodic change in the temperature (and therefore resistance)
of the grid whose periodicity will be twice that of the sound which produces it. This
is in fair agreement with observations, for when the microphone is gradually tilted
over from a vertical to a horizontal position, the fundamental note heard in the telephone
slowly dies away and the octave becomes more and more prominent. The octave is
heard best, however, when the neck is pointed slightly downwards so that the axis
