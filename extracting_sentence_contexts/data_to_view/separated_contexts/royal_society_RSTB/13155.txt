Explanations for this remarkable convergence have generally
invoked only adaptive processes (e.g. sexually antagonistic selection); how-
ever, there is still little evidence for these hypotheses. Here we propose a
model in which recombination on sex chromosomes is lost due to the neutral

that sequence divergence, in any form, reduces the probability of recombina-
tion between any two sequences. Using simulations, we show that, under
certain conditions, a region of suppressed recombination arises and expands
outwards from the sex-determining locus, under purely neutral processes. One contribution of 12 to a theme issue Further, we show that the rate and pattern of recombination loss are sensitive
