Many works have shown
success in predicting the Lorenz system; however, the tasks considered are different from that
explored in this work, and they usually fall into the following categories:

— The model is trained with data from a single trajectory and then tested with the same
initial state [30,31].

— The resulting model offers accurate short-term predictions while generating similar
dynamical statistics for long times [46,79].

— The model predicts the Lorenz system with regular adjustments or intermittent external
forcing or under a data assimilation framework [51,80]. By contrast, we train the model with batches of trajectories and test with unseen initial conditions;
we also test long-term predictions without any external inputs. In fact, almost all previous models
belong to single-scaled models in our discussion. The trade-off between computational accuracy and efficiency are visualized in figure 5a. Here,
we report the £2 error, averaged over all time steps and test trajectories.
