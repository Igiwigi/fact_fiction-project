But these
depend very largely upon the characters of the rays and arms, which are of a
comparatively subordinate value ; while the lateral separation of the radials in the
las named genus, and in the /hodocrinites, is a fact of considerable importance in
Crinoid Morphology. It must be remembered also that Glyptocrinus has decided affinities with some of
the earlier Actinocrinide, certain species appearing to be without under-basals. In
fact, according to the American authors, © It is a question whether that genus, ab
least partly, should no be arranged with the other group alt ogether.”

Thus, then, I would divide the Rhodocrinide (W. and S.) into groups as follows :—
