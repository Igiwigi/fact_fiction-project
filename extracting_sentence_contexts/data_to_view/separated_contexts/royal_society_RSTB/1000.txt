An additional point of interest which showed itself in the experiments on (
that a certain amount of cedema almost invariably appeared on the proxi
the ligature. The amount was never as great as that on the distal side, b
very evident, and pitted deeply on pressure. Reference to this fact will |
later. It is sufficient here to state that careful dissection showed that the parts
the ligature did not drain into a vein which opened into the main trunk on the
side of the ligature, and hence that the cedematous parts above the ligature
the seat of venous obstruction. *
