But it is
not sufficient that there is one homomorphism with the isomorphism property and another
with the weak intersection property; because the latter entails no restriction whatever on
the amalgam: the trivial homomorphism on to the unit group clearly always has the weak
intersection property.

10. Embedding in an Abelian group

It may be noted that in this chapter no really essential use has been made of the group
property of the algebraic systems under investigation. In fact much of the theory can be
carried over, with only trivial changes, to other and rather more general algebraic systems. We briefly sketch the special case of Abelian groups. An amalgam A may be embeddable not merely in a group, but even in an Abelian group.
