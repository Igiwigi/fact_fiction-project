of thermodynamic work used to run this composite map in actual cells. To calculate the minimal
possible work, we can decompose the composite map into any sequence of thermodynamically
reversible maps that achieves the same thing. So we can start with a (thermodynamically
reversible) map (1) taking {a sequence of nucleotides in a DNA string plus a bath of nucleotides}
— {that same DNA string, plus a specific sequence of nucleotides in an mRNA that is a copy
of the DNA string, plus the remaining nucleotides in the bath}. We can suppose that after this
map (1), there is a (many-to-one) thermodynamically reversible map (2) taking the codons in the
mRNA to a (fictional) sequence of amino acids, formed from the amino acid bath. After this there
is a map (3) copying that sequence of amino acids to produce our protein. Our analysis above
considers the minimal work needed to achieve map (3).

At this point we actually have four copies of the information giving the protein; the DNA
segment, the mRNA, the ‘fictional sequence of amino acids’ and the actual protein. Next, the
‘fictional sequence of amino acids’ is broken back down into its constituent amino acids (leaving
us with the DNA, mRNA and protein, along with the baths) in a thermodynamically reversible
map (2’) that recovers the thermodynamic cost of map (2). After that the mRNA is broken
down into its constituent nucleotides in a map (1’) that (in an idealized process) recovers the
thermodynamic cost of map (1). So all we are left with is the cost of map (3)—which is what we
calculate above.
