Ifit is perpendicular to the base passage and
at a distance / from its mid-point, then Â¢<0dZ if J+ 2d. Similar results can be found for other
configurations and for the H component. However, these criteria cannot be applied when
a line source is parallel to the base passage, and their practical use is limited by the fact that
the small local variations in the field may make it difficult to determine dZ. Attempts to
find the average value of the gradient by statistical fitting have been made, but the errors
are large and the validity of the method is doubtful as it assumes random disturbance, where-
as the disturbing iron is usually buried in the floor or pack wall and its effect is chiefly in
one direction. The base passage at Cadeby is narrow and has solid walls, so that any buried
