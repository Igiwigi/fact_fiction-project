The seasonal prediction
of rainfall associated with the boreal summer monsoon across India is a difficult task [54-58] due
partly to the large impact of a few extreme days [59,60]. We may hypothesize that CanWE#3 and
#5 are more difficult to predict than CanWE#4 and #6 given their spatial extent and duration. The

fact that CanWE#5 is responsible for most annual maximum hourly rainfall also poses a serious : =
challenge in the prediction of extreme rainfall, and may also potentially blur the interannual : =
signal of the seasonal amounts [59]. Further efforts are needed to better understand the impact of 1B
interannual modes of variation (ENSO or Indian sea surface temperatures) and intraseasonal ones : =
(as the Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation in the 20-40-day range) on CanWEs. Another : 8
avenue of research would be to estimate a posteriori the impact of the CanWEs on the success or : 4
failure of seasonal hindcasts.
