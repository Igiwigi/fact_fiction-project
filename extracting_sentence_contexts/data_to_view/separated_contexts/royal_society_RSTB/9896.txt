This means that, by necessity, manipulative
studies are rare compared with correlative studies. Even
when manipulative studies have been possible [3,69], debate
and controversy have persisted [70,71]. Another major chal-
lenge is the fact that a negative statistical result does not
necessarily translate to a negative biological conclusion. This
second challenge arises because simple lack of evidence is not
evidence of lack of an effect, particularly if the statistical power
of the approach is low. Fortunately, larger datasets increase
statistical power, and a spectrum of ecological conditions
gives the possibility of more closely emulating randomized
trial conditions found in experimental manipulations.
