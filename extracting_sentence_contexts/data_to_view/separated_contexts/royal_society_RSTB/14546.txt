is the average probability of choosing behaviour C among
mutant individuals once the invasion process has stabilized. Note that since the mutant allele is rare, mutant individuals
can have only one mutant chromosome; the other chromo-
some has no mutant alleles at locus A and remains at the
internal equilibrium frequency }p,,. A sufficient condition
for the equilibrium with phenotype <x to be externally stable
is that A<1 or from equation (4.1):

W(Xp, X) < w(K, X),

for all possible mutants A, that generate mutant phenotype
x, This condition is in fact the condition for a strict ESS
from equation (2.1a) and can be used to prove the following
result for large, randomly mating, diploid populations with
two-locus genetic systems [95,99,106]. Result 4.1. Any phenotype % generated by an externally
stable equilibrium is an ESS.
