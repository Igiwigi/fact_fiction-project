respectively. Recently
Roth (1946) has applied corrections to these figures which apparently reduce the dis-
crepancy to almost negligible proportions. A large discrepancy still exists, however, since
a further adjustment must be applied to the figures of Todd & Miller, who, in spite of the
fact that the amount of water liberated in their experiments was sufficient to dissolve only
a small fraction of the boric acid produced, erroneously based their corrections on total
solution. The corrected value according to the experimental: data of Todd & Miller is
328-5 kcal. This differs from the amended value of Roth & Borger (340-2 keal.)
