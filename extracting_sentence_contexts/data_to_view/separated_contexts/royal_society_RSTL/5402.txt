The boiling-points of the indifferent hydrocarbons being such important evidence, it
has been considered proper to give positive proof that the fractions analysed were those
whose constitution exactly tallied with the bodies with which they were sought to be
identified ; in each case therefore the vapowr-densities of seyeral fractions near the known
boiling-point of the radicals were determined ; and it is submitted, that it is no slight
proof of the correctness of the view advanced relative to the nature of the bodies isolated,
that in almost every instance the fraction which gave the correct yapour-density was
that which corresponded in boiling-point with the radical. In order to save space, the
numerous determinations made are condensed into Tables. In one or two of these
merely trial experiments, it will be observed that the regularity of the series is slightly
interrupted ; where this happens, it will be found to arise from the fact of the bodies
not having been obtained from the fraction corresponding to their own boiling-point ;
thus in the Table containing the amyle experiments, the fourth and sixth determinations
are not in perfect harmony with the rest ; in the third, the fraction used distilled between
160 and 1659, but it was obtained from the portion of the crude hydrocarbons boiling
between 150? and 160*; this makes the density come out s0mewhat lower than it would
have been had the fraction been extracted from the hydrocarbons boiling between 160*
and 165%, In general, however, it will be found that the increase of density with the
rise of boiling-point is quite as steady as could haye been anticipated. It has been stated that the composition of the fractions varied s0 little as the boiling-
points became higher, that I did not imagine myself justified in considering the nature
of any fraction established by the mere results of analysis ; but although yapour-density
has been chiefly relied on as the means of research, it is believed, neyertheless, from the
extreme care with which the combustions were made, that they represent very nearly
the true per-centages of carbon and hydrogen. Chemists are aware that the accurate analysis of volatile fluids, having a high per-
centage of carbon, is a somewhat, fatiguing process, from the constant attention indis-
pensable, and the slowness with which it is necessary to advance the fire along the tube.
