dissection also exposed the teeth of the left dentary, fig. 1, and showed that the fifth
and seventh teeth have five cusps as has, probably, also the eighth. The fact that

Thrinaxodon liorhinus seemed to remove the justification for separating the two
genera.

There are, however, sufficient fixed points shown in the type of Nythosaurus
larvatus to enable a reconstruction to be made. These points are :—the position of
