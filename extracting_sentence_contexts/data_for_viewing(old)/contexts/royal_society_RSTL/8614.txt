maximum in August and a slight minimum in November. The variation is greater
here than in the horary columns, being for hour 15=6%:56, The largest W is at
March 15"=6"56 ; the least at May 15"=0-00.

The law of $S is simpler; it has one maximum in December and one minimum in
July; its range, too, is something greater, being in hour 20=6"-98. The greatest
magnitude =8":285 at December 4", its least =0"82, July 19% There is a general
agreement in the change of the two components, with one striking exception, the
maximum and minimum which W has in March and April. Such a general agree-
ment might be expected, for any air coming from the south must have a westward
motion due to the greater velocity of the earth's rotation in a southern parallel. This
anomaly, if real, may be caused by the geographical conditions to which I have already
alluded. To them also may be referred the fact that at May 15% W=0, though
$=2"-41, from which a sensible magnitude of the other might be expected. Tt must,
however, be observed that some of the changes exhibited in this Table can scarcely be
regarded as periodical. I have already pointed out that from the very great dis-
cordance of individual observyations it is evident that a much greater number of them
than is afforded by a period of seven years is required to eliminate the barometric and
hygrometric influences. Yet these disturbances might be expected to be distributed
with some uniformity through the day; while the changes from hour to hour are
sometimes considerable. Thus in February 9* to 10" AW=0:89; 16" to 17% AW
=—0:90; March 10" to 1" AW=—T115; 14" to 15% AW=0:94; April 10" to 11"
AS=—0:71; December 10" to 11" AS=0:86. These are the largest; and it deserves
notice that they occur in winter months ; in summer there is much less abruptness
of change.
