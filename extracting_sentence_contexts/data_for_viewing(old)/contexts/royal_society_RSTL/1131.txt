The third division contains the period since we acquired
some knowledge of natural history, became acquainted with
causes and effects, and able to trace the connection between
them.

With the operations performed in the first division (corres-
ponding with VAaRRo's prolepticum ) modern theorists assume
that they are well acquainted, able to account for every appear-
ance, and to detail the whole process of original formation.
I however shall decline noticing these early processes of na-
ture, and limit myself to the second division of natural his-
tory, hoping from the prominent features of my country that
remain $till undefaced, and from its curious facts, to trace and
demonstrate the great effects that have been produced upon
our surface; and though I do not presume to advance far-
ther, I perhaps may assist in clearing the way for future
naturalists, and by establishing effects, encourage them to
proceed to causes, and help them to discover the powers and
agents by which these grand operations have been executed.
