o:(Q), o.(Q) in terms of the groups distinguished by the signs of £, n, £ instead of

wu, v, w; and owing to the fact that in all the cases to be considered U?, V?, W? are
of the second order of small quantities compared with u?, v*, w* this may be done.
For we may put

o:(Q)=${(EFV)Q}=${(E#V)Q}+${(&#0)Q}* . . . . (19)
o:.(Q)=2{(&FV)Q3=z{(&FV)Q3—zi(&#0)Q} . . . . (13

and when U is small compared with ,/;2, the last term on the right in each of these
equations will be small to the second order as compared with the firs; term. For the
number of molecules over which the swmmation in these terms extends is to the whole
number of molecules in a unit of volume in something less than the ratio of U to \/4F.
Hence, as will subsequently appear, in neglecting these las terms we shall be neglect-
ing nothing within the limits of our approximation. We have therefore
