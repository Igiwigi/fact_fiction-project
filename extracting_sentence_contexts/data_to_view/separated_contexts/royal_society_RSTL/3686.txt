I do not doubt but that I ſhall «convince you,
as I am myſelf convinced, that the whole circuit
(fo far as I have examined) within the boundaries
marked in the map, is wholly and totally the pro-
duQton of fubterrancous fires; and that moſt probably
the ſea formerly reached the mountains that lie be-
hind Capua and Caſerta, and are a continuation of
the Appennines. If I may be allowed to compare
ſmall things with great, I imagine the ſubterrancous
fires to have worked in this country under the botrom
of the ſez, as moles in a field, throwing up here and
there a hillock, and that the matter thrown out of
ſome of theſe hillocks formed into ſettled volcanos,
filling up the ſpace between one and the other, has
compoſed this part of the continent, and many of the
iſlands adjoining. From the obſervations I have made npon mount
Etna, Veſuvius, and its neighbourhood, I dare ſay,
that, after a_ careful examination, moſt mountains
that are, or have been volcanos, would be found
to owe their exiſtence to ſubterraneous fire ; the
direc reverſe of what I find the commonly received
opinion.

» Nature, though varied, is certainly in general uni-
form in her operations ; and 1 cannot conceive that
two ſuch conſiderable volcanos as'Etna and Veſuvius
ſhould have been formed otherwiſe, than every other
conſiderable volcano of the known world. 1' do
not wonder that fo little progreſs has been made
in the improvement of natural hiſtory, and parti-
cularly in that branch of it which regards the
theory of the earth ; nature as ſlowly, it is difficult
to catch her in the fact, Thoſe who have made this
