THE communication which I have now the honour to present to the Royal Society

is a portion of a series of investigations on the Development of the Embryo on which
< TI have been for some years engaged, and which was commenced in a paper on the
S Development of the Myriapoda, that was honoured with a place in the Philosophical
2 'Transactions for 1841. TI now propose to give the results of my observations on the
= Amphibia, reserving to a future early occasion the continuation of those on the Inver-
S tebrata commenced in the paper alluded to.
S The Amphibia, of all the vertebrated animals, afford to us the readiest means of
= investigating the difficult subject of Impregnation by actual experiment, and it is
2 only, perhaps, by combining experiment with careful observations on the physical
Z conditions that affect the development of the germ, and comparing these with the
£ facts of the natural history and instincts of the species, that we may hope, ulti-
Ss mately, to obtain some further insight into this one of Nature's most hidden secrets.
'S I sball endeavour, therefore, in this communication, to show the condition of the
= ovyum in the Amphibia through its earliest changes, and also before and immediately
& after impregnation, and to detail experiments made with a view to learn by what
means its fecundation is effected ;—and in a future communication I propose to trace
ZE the development of the embryo from the time of fecundation to that of its liberation
g from the ovyum, in the two chief divisions of the class,—the tailless and the tailed
£ Amphibia., The subjects thus naturally form two series—Impregnation and De-

© velopment.
