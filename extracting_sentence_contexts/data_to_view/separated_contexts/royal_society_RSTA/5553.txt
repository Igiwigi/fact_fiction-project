with positive constants C and D that are independent of n and which depend only on 2
and a.
(iv) Taking advantage of the fact that the constants C and D in (3.7) are independent of n, we
can show that

remains bounded for small values of 7. This allows us to replace the constant D in (3.7)
by zero on the expense of a larger constant C. Eventually, insisting on the fact that the
constant C in (3.7) depends only on a and @ and that D=0, one can let n > 0, which
allows us to complete the proof.

(a) Adequate regularization of the velocity field
The regularization process is based on the following (classical):

Lemma 3.4. Let u ¢ C°“() be a divergence free and tangential to the boundary vector field defined
in a bounded simply connected domain Q with C? boundary. Then, there exists an approximation family


u € C%(Q) of divergence free vector fields, which are tangential to the boundary and which converges to
u in the C°() norm as n — 0.
