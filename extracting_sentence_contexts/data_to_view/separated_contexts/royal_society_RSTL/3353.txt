Some-
times, by accidental violence, a recent fasciculus may be reduced to a pulpy mass, in
which fragments retaining their striz are strewn in confusion, while the sheath may
remain uninjured, and preserve all these parts from falling asunder (figs. 37. 38.). But there is another method by which the existence and some of the properties of
the s@rcolemma may be demonstrated. This depends on the fact that its contents
swell considerably when subjected to the action of several fluids, especially acids and
alkalies. Phosphoric, tartaric and citric acids, and potash, are what I have em-
ployed most commonly. The $heath dilates at first, but s00n grows tense ; the effect
of which on the fibrillz is, that they emerge at its open extremity, where the fasciculus
has been broken off, and there swell in diameter; or if their union is but slight,
expand in all directions into a roundish mass or button.
