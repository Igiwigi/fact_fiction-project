Hence, the approach possesses strong explanatory and predictive qualities,
which make it a prime candidate for the explanation of several spatial patterns observed in
nature. However, when merging this theory of pattern formation with biological practice, a hurdle
presents itself, which prevents the direct application of the ideas of Gierer and Meinhardt. The
difficulty lies in the fact that the theory needs (at least) two independent, diffusing, species, that in
addition must form an activator-inhibitor pair, i.e. interact in the specific manner described above. In very many applications, this poses an insurmountable problem. While a prime candidate for
the activator can often be identified without much difficulty, the same is not the case for the
inhibitor.
