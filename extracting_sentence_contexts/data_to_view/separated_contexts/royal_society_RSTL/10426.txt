The cone and roller principle was employed by Professor MosELEY
in a calculating machine,+ and by SANG and others as a Platometer or Planimeter. Messrs. A8HTON and STory have revived the application of the disk and roller to a
continuous Indicator, which should, however, really be called a steam-power Integrator. In the last-named instrument advantage is taken of the fact that as the steam
pressure acts alternately on one 8ide or the other of the piston, the roller may be
made to take a corresponding position on either side of the centre of the disk, thus
both the forward and backward stroke of the engine combine to effect the continuous
rotation of the roller in one direction, and thereby integrate the total work done. All the foregoing examples are applications of the disk and roller mechanism for
purposes of integration. Differentiation may practically be effected by means of the
disk and roller in the following manner :â€”In fig.
