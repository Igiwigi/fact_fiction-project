equations between the symmetric functions of the second degree in each set of roots. But we have V*=0=a symmetric function of the roots, and thus the entire number of
linear relations is 56, and this is in fact the number of the symmetric functions of the
-8econd degree in each set. I use for shortness the 8ign S to denote the 8am of the
