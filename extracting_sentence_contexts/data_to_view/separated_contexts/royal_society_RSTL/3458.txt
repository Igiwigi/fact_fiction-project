If 80, the intermediate part is stretched and
torn as contraction proceeds ; and if an isolated contraction occurs in the centre, the
parts between it and the two extremities are similarly affected*, the conditions of
the rupture being, 1. a partial contraction of the ruptured muscle, and, 2. a force
snperior to the tenacity of the uncontracted part, holding the ends of the fragment
asunder,

The same conditions apply in the healthy living snbject, where it is impossible, in
consequence of the admirable adaptation of mechanical arrangements to the extensi-
bility of museles, that any rupture can take place solely from the action of antago-
nists. For example, no force of the flexors of the knee can by itself rupture the
extensors, because the structure of the joint prevents flexion being carried beyond a
point which the extensors, if relaxed, readily allow. And yet antagonist museles may
and do play a conspicuous part in most muscular ruptures ; but it is only by afford-
ing a resistance to the approximation of the ends of the ruptured musele, greater
than the tenacity of its uncontracted parts,—such a resistance, in fact, as might be
offered by any power mechanically adapted to produce the same effect. I say wncon-
tracted parts, and the propriety of supposing them in the living subject appears from
the examination of the tetanic muscle; for putting aside the impossibility of any
rupture happening in a muscle of which no part was pbysically weaker than another,

by a contraction consisting of an absolutely simultaneous and uniform approximation
of all its elementary parts to one another, and supposing for a moment that though
the contraction was everywhere present, yet some feebleness of structure, or trifling
diminution of the contractile force at one part, determined a rupture to take place
there, the resulting appearances would necessarily be altogether different from those
that have been detailed.
