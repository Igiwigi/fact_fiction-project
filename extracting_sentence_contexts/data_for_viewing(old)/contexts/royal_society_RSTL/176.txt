masses multiplied into the squares of their velocities, (a
multiple to which I shall for conciseness give the name of
impetus ) ; while those, who are considered as NEWTONIANS,
conceive that the forces are in the simp/e ratio of the velocities,
and consequently as the momentum or quantitas motus, a name
given by Newrox to the multiple of the velocity of a body
simply taken into its quantity of matter.

It cannot be expected that at this time any new experiment
should be thought of, by which the controversy can be de-
cided, since the most simple experiments that have already
been appealed to by either party have received different in-
terpretations from their opponents, although the facts were
admitted.


14 Dr, WorLastoy's Lecture

My object in the present Lecture is to consider which of
these opinions respecting the force exerted by moving bodies
is most conformable to the usual meaning of that word, and to
shew that the explanation given by Nzwrow of the third law
of motion is in no respect favourable to those who in their
view of this question have been called Nzwroxtaxs.
