According to-
Gay Lvssac and TyenarD,* three measures of muriatic acid
should condense one of oxy gen (or only one-third their bulk),
and should form two measures of oxymuriatic acid. Hitherto,
I have not been able to satisfy myself respecting the true pro-
portions of oxygen and muriatic acid gases, that are capable

of being united by electricity; for though I have made several

experiments with this view, they have not agreed in yielding

sImilar results. The condensation of a part of the undecom-

posed acid by the water, which is formed during the process,

will, probably, indeed, always be an impediment to our learn-

ing these proportions exactly, The fact is chiefly of value,

as it affords an example of the production of oxymuriatic acid

under the simplest possible circumstances; and as it shews

unequivocally that, under such circutstances, the visible ap=

pearance of moisture is a part of the phenomena. * Memoires d'Arcueil, ii, 217. Manchester, Jan, 6, 1812,
