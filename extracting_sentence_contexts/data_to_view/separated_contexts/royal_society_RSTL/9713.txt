If, on the other hand, we suppose that the s0il yielded up as much potass from its
own stores to the crop of plob 8 as to that without manure, there would remain at the
end of the ix years of the application 567 1bs., or nearly two-thirds of the whole
supplied till to be accounted for. On the same supposition, at the end of the next 14
years there would still remain more than 300 Ibs. of the 8upplied potass as yet
unaccounted for. That some did, and does still, remain in an available condition may
be concluded from the fact that there was a considerable excess of produce, of mineral
matter, and of potass, removed from plot 8 compared with plot 3 in the two succeeding
years, 1876 and 1877, and there was again an excess of produce in 1878. Whether, however, the soil did actually yield up from its own resources more or less
to this manured than to the unmanured produce, we have not the means of determin-
ing. Tt has been seen that the superphosphate of lime applied alone on plot 4-1
enabled the herbage to take up very little more potass from the soil.
