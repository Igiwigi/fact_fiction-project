Further, when separate masses of subsporangial tissue
Gare close together, giving on external examination the effect of a single group of
Bporangia, archegonia are found on the intervening areas of prothallus tissue. In
uch cases they are usually unopened, but with the canal and venter of a brown
Holour. A number of facts appear to indicate that the projections bearing sporangia
Qyre of a similar nature. That this is so in some cases does not at all exclude the
Sprobability that sporangia are also developed from tissue, the origin of which has
â€˜shad no connection with the site of an archegonium. E Some of the archegonia present no differences from those found in an unopened
state elsewhere.
