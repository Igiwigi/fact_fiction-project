The several series of illustrations
presented here show how varied are the changes undergone by the severed meristeles in
the isolated segments. In the distal region of segments in which only a single strap-shaped
meristele is present, the meristele becomes differentiated like a protostele: it has a circular
outline in transverse section and occupies a central position in a segment which is also of
circular outline. In fact, a radially symmetrical structure is produced. In the older literature the endodermis has usually been held to originate inâ€™a specific
region of the developing shoot, i.e. either in the inner layer of the periblem or the outer
layer of the plerome. It is true that, in the normal development, endodermis occurs with
great regularity in a specific position, i.e. just outside the pericycle.
