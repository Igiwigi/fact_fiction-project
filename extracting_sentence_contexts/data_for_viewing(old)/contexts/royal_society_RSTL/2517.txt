bers. Examine the sea Crab, and no material difference in the structure of its loco-
motive organs is to be observed from that of the land Crab whence a different kind
of motion can he inferred ; hence there can be no actual necessity for the existence
of natatory apparatus in the young land Crab, which must be just as able to support
itself in the water without any such as an ordinary sea Crab. If, moreover, we ex-
amine the structure of the branchial apparatus of the land Crabs, we find still further
evidence in support of this argument. MM. Avupovin and M. H. Epwarvs, in the
Annales des Sciences Naturelles for September 1828, have given an account of this
organization : the exterior of the branchial cavity is furnished with a reservoir for
containing a supply of water ; and in'the land Crab there is moreover a second vessel
destined for the like purpose, whence it is evident that in this respect the land Crabs
do not materially differ from the sea Crabs. I will not dwell upon this subject farther
than to refer to the conclusive facts subsequently stated in proof that the young of
the land-Crabs is neither a Zoe nor furnished with natatory apparatus.

Fifthly, I will only observe with reference to Mr. Twomyson's general assertions,
that no great weight ought to be attached to them until the necessary details shall
have been given to the public, more especially if, as I have shown to be the case, we
find cause in those already published to distrust the views of the author.

Having thus gone through the various statements made by Mr. TaomesoN in 8up-
port of his theory, and ascertained from them the apparent want of confirmation of
such theory, I proceed to notice the opinions of crustaceologists whose writings have
established for them some degree of weight as authorities upon the question.
