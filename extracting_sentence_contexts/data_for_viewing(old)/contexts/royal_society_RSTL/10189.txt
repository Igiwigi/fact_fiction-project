It might therefore be advisable to separate these genera as a distinet group, which
might be called the PRoTO-ALCYONARIA.

The next step in the phylogeny was the formation from swch an isolated ancestor
of a colony. The formation of the colonies may have taken place in two ways :
first, by the formation of buds from the firs formed polyp ; and secondly, by the
intermediation of a stolon upon which the young buds were formed.

A colony formed in this second way would with slight modifications give us a form
such as our modern Clavularic or Cornularia,

In the genus Tubipora there is a stolon which I shall point out in a subsequent
paper is very similar to the stolon of Clavularia. Tubipora might in fact have been
derived from a Clavularia-like ancestor, in which the following modifications took
place : The polyps became considerably elongated, and the 8picules of the body-wall
fused together to form a hard tubular support for them. These long polyps then
became connected by canals which eventually joined together to form the horizontal‚Äù
platforms traversed by a network of the canals, and from them new polyps budded as
they do from the original stolon,

If this reasoning is subsequently proved to be accurate it will be necessary to
separate those forms with a stolon from the rest of the Alcyonaria into a separate
group, which might be called the STOLONIFERA,

In the great majority of the Alcyonaria we have sufficient evidence, I think, to
