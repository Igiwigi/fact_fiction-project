To bring the nerve
Q to this state of excitability, it may be either left to itself for a long time, or be sti-
mulated by frequent intermitted currents in rapid suecession. Before detailing the
results which follow, it is necessary to mention what happens when a nerve has been
expoxsed for a long time to the passage of the direct current, or to repeated actions
of this current in those cases in which the nerve is left to itself. In fact, in order
to be able to measure what is dne to the action of the inverse current, we imust first
know what is the effect upon the nerve of its being left to itself, after the direct cnr-
rent has ceased to act upon it. Mamax1xt had already found that a frog which has lost the faculty of contracting
apon passing the current, re-acquires it on being left to itseif for five seconds. I have
