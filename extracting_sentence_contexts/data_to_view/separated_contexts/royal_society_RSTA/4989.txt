Additional experimental work confirmed that the cracks do travel faster than the : &
transverse wave speed [11,12]. The experiments led to theoretical descriptions for supersonic : FS
cracks in tension [13,14]. Both explicit numerical solutions for atomic equations of motion and : 8

the corresponding analytical solutions show the supersonic cracks do in fact exist [15]. This last
reference contains an extended discussion of how crack speed depends upon loading for the
models studied in this manuscript. Supersonic cracks were also observed for cracks with hyperelastic constitutive laws that cause
stiffening near the tip [16].
