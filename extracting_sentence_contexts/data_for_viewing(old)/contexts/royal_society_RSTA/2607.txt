function of temperature [30], while in figure 2b we show an analogous figure for a melt which fed
Soufriere Hills volcano, Montserrat [26].

In the Montserrat case, the crystals are dense relative to the melt, and the crystals may fall
through the melt, accumulating on the floor of the chamber to form a cumulate layer. As this
happens, the density of the residual melt decreases and as a result, the density of the melt trapped
in the pore space between the crystals will also gradually decrease (figure 2b). This leads to a
decrease in the melt density for crystal fractions less than about 70%, and will lead to a decrease
in the bulk density of the cumulate layer with time as the trapped melt becomes progressively
less dense.

In the Iceland case, the melt is much denser, and the plagioclase crystals which precipitate are
in fact less dense than the melt. As a result, the melt density actually increases with crystallization
once the crystal fraction exceeds about 10% and plagioclase comes on to the liquidus. The
occurrence of an Icelandic melt density minimum at the onset of plagioclase crystallization was
identified recently by Hartley & Maclennan [33]. The production of less dense crystals leads to
the possibility of a roof cumulate as well as at the floor of the intrusion. If the density of the melt
gradually decreases, then the melt trapped in the roof cumulate will be stably stratified while the
melt in the floor cumulate will become unstably stratified. In the next section, we develop a model
for the cooling and crystallization to explore some of the controls on the formation of cumulate
layers.

3. Amodel for cumulate formation

As a simplified model of the formation of a cumulate layer, we draw from the work of Huppert &
