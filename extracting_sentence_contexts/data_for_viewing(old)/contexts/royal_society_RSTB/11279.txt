dominant hemisphere would be due to a disturbance to
devoted retrieval mechanisms or stored representations [8].
By contrast, a lesion in the contralateral, non-dominant hemi-
sphere could provoke in some cases a generic processing
shortcoming that would affect any relatively demanding
cognitive task, leading also to problems with simple
(i.e. one-digit) calculation. This explanation lacks empirical
support, however. In turn, a demonstration of the fact that
the processes in each of the two hemispheres are indeed
specific is also missing.

Neuroimaging studies, again in the instance of arithmeti-
cal facts, seem to invariably evidence bilateral activation,
most often not entirely symmetrical and, crucially, in some
cases superior on the right hemisphere [9]. By a logic analo-

(a) Clinical studies

Clinical studies are the most time-honoured methodology in
investigating the brainâ€”behaviour relation. Over other
methods, clinical studies have the advantage to show effects
that may not be expected by the observer/experimenter:
counterintuitive findings may lead the researcher's attention
towards new pathways of investigation. Many phenomena
