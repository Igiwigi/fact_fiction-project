2863. Hence the atmosphere is, in common phrase, a highly magnetic medium.
The air that stands upon every square foot of surface on the earth, is equivalent, in
magnetic force, to 8160 lbs. of crystallized protosulphate of iron (2794. 2861.). This
medium is, by every change in its density, whether of the kind indicated by the baro-
meter, or caused by the presence or absence of the sun, changed in its magnetic rela-
tions. Further, every variation of temperature produces apparently its own change of
force, in addition to that caused by the mere expansion or contraction in volume, and
none of these alterations can happen without affecting the magnetic force emanating
from the earth, and causing variations, both in its intensity and direction, at the earth's
surface, Whether these changes are in the right direction and sufficient in quantity
to supply a cause for the variations of the terrestrial magnetic power, is the point
now to be considered, for the illustration of which I will endeavour to construct a
type case, and then apply it, as well as I can, to the natural facts.

2864. Let us assunme the existence of two globes of air distinct from the surround-
ing atmosphere, by a difference of temperature or by a difference of density : the

assumption is not too extravagant for an illustration, since Prov showed that there
were masses of air, larger or smaller, floating about in the atmosphere, and singularly
distinct from the surrounding parts, by temperature and other circumstances. Not to
