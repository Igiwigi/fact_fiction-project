constant temperature of T= 40K for a grain with a diameter of 2.02nm. The hydrogen atom is
placed at 20 different, randomly chosen initial positions and for each position 10000 simulation
runs are evaluated.

In figure 3a, the effusion times are shown as a function of the minimum distance from
an absorbing site in the grain boundary for the three different methods. The results obtained
using the different approaches agree very nicely within our numerical accuracy. As the AMCs
provide an exact solution for the escape from superbasin states the close agreement between the
results from direct KMC and KMC with AMC simulations is expected. The good agreement with
the results from the combined FAS/KMC simulations illustrates the validity of fitting the key
quantities in the AMC, #; and zj, with the analytic functions in equations (2.10) and (2.11). In this
particular case, the AMC approach is actually computationally more expensive than the direct
KMC simulations. This is due to the fact that there is no large barrier for the escape from the
superbasin states, i.e. the system is not trapped in these states, and the effusion can also readily
happen in the KMC simulations. The time-consuming part of the AMC algorithm is the inversion
