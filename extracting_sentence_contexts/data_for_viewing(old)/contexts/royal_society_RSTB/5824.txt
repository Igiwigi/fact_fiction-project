BETWEEN GENERA ZYGOPTERIS, ETAPTERIS AND BOTRYCHIOXYLON. 43

known earlier, neither of the genera Botrychiorylon (Scott, 1912) and Etapteris
(BERTRAND, 1907) would have been founded. Indeed, the creation of the latter genus
was due entirely to an error of observation, for even in the type-specimen the petiolar
bundles are typically Htapteris-like, as Corra showed a century ago, and not ><-
shaped with hooked antenne, as we have been accustomed to believe, after Pav
BERTRAND, since 1909. The mode of branching of the petiolar strand is also identical
in every respect with that of Htapteris.

These facts raise questions of nomenclature and relationships which are briefly
discussed. Both Etapteris and Botrychiorylon are no doubt firmly linked with
Zygopteris ; and in ordinary circumstances would be merged in Corpa’s much older
genus. But recent experience within the Zygopteridese imposes caution against a
merging of the genera at the present stage. For while, on the one hand, petioles of
an identical type have actually been found attached to stems of two different genera
(“ Clepsydropsis”” australis and Asterochlenopsis kirgisica), on the other, stems having
an almost identical stelar structure are known to have borne petioles of two distinct
types (Ankyropteris Grayi or A. scandens and “ Clepsydropsis” australis).

At the same time, although, as a precautionary measure, the genera Botrychiorylon
and Etapteris may for the present be maintained, the author believes that it would
be surprising if the petiole of B. paradoxum should eventually prove to be of a type
