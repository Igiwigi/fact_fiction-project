The fact that aneesthetics stop the action
of convulsants shows that convulsions arise from the first stage and anesthesia or
paralysis from the second stage of disordered cerebral metabolism. This is borne out
by the fact that after a convulsant has been administered a far less quantity of the

aneesthetic agent is required to produce anvesthesia. There is no need to multiply
further examples of the fact that hyper-excitability is, as a rule, the first result of a
downward alteration of the metabolism of the nerve centres. The higher function of
the brain is not excitability (Actionscapacitiit), but resistance to impulsive action
(Actionswiderstand), and it is the latter which is the first to fail when nutrition
becomes disordered. To put it in other words, ‘ Bahnung” then becomes easy, while
“ Hemmung” fails.
