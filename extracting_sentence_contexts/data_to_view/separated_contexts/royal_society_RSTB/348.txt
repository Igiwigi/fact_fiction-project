WILLIAMSON ON THE ORGANISATION

of this plant; e, the outermost cortex, composed, in transverse sections, of radiating
bands of sclerenchyma, g, alternating with parenchymatous areas, f At k, k we find
two bundles of tracheids, like those at d, forming the centre of the cortical structures
of a petiole of Rachiopteris aspera, 7, 7, which petiole is organically united to the
cortex e of the Lyginodendron. The two bundles k, & are assuming the oblique
relative positions seen in the similar bundles of the free petiole of 2. aspera, repre-
sented in fig, 2. Other sections in my cabinet, similar to fig. 1, demonstrate the
same facts, viz., that the pairs of bundles, fig. 1, d, which form so characteristic a
feature of transverse sections of the middle cortex of Lyginodendron Oldhamium, pass
outwards, through the outer cortex, to become the trachegal* bundles of the petioles
of the plant, and which petioles I had previously designated Rachiopteris aspera. I may
state that my friend Grar Soums-Lausacn, who has obtained numerous specimens
of the Lyginodendron associated with others of Rachiopteris aspera from a locality
on the continent, agrees with me in the conclusion at which I have arrived respecting
their unity. The more perfect specimens of the Lyginodendron obtained during the
last seventeen years have thrown yet further light upon those figured in 1873.
