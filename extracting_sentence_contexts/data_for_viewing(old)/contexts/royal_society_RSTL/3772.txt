THE MALPIGHIAN BODIES OF THE KIDNEY. 73

Reflecting on this remarkable structure of the Malpighian bodies, and on their
singular connection with the tubes, I was led to speculate on their use. It occurred
to me that as the tubes and their plexus of capillaries were probably, for reasons pre-
sently to be stated, the parts concerned in the secretion of that portion of the urine
to which its characteristic properties are due (the urea, lithic acid, &c.), the Mal-
pighian bodies might be an apparatus destined to separate from the blood the watery
portion. This view, on further consideration, appears 80 consonant with facts, and
with analogy, that I shall in a few words state to the Society the reasons that have
induced me to adopt it. I am not unaware how obscure are the regions of hypo-
thesis in physiology, and shall be most ready to renounce my opinion, if it be shown
to be inconsistent with truth.

In extent of surface, internal structure, and the nature of its vascular network, the
membrane of the uriniferous tubes corresponds with that forming the secreting surface
of other glands. Hence it seems certain that this membrane is the part specially con-
cerned in eliminating from the blood the peculiar principles found in the urine. To
establish this analogy, and the conclusion deduced from it, a few words will suffice.
1. The extent of surface obtained by the involutions of the membrane, will by most
be regarded as, itself, sufficient proof. But, 2. Its internal structure is conclusive.
