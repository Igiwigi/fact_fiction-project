strict progression. It is not possible, however, from 80 limited a number of obser-
vations, to determine this point with certainty, or to attempt any intermediate infer-
ences.

We have, from these observarions, been able to deduce results which plainly
point to the law which governs the effect of the pressure of the atmosphere on the

mean leyel of the ocean, and may be encouraged to pursue the investigation through
a more extended series of observations, in order that we may at length arrive at the
most accurate conclusion that the observed facts may justify.

For all practical purposes, it may in the mean time be well to assume, what the
preceding obseryations seem to indicate, that the ocean is a water barometer on a
vast scale of magnificence, and that the level of its surface is disturbed by every
variation of atmospheric pressnre, inversely as the mercury in the barometer, and
exactly in the ratio of the relative specific gravities of the water and the mercury.
And as all obserrations of the tides, before they can be safely employed to investigate
the laws by which they are governed, should in the first place be corrected for the
large and hitherto mysterious irregularities which the variations in the pressure of
the atmosphere produce, the following formula may be used to determine the correc-
tion z to be applied to all observations of the height of the tide, or the mean level of
the ocean deduced from them, to reduce them to the mean pressure of the atmosphere.
