2-2. CHRONOMETERS
The accuracy required for timing the pendulum in a submarine gravity survey is not
quite so high as that needed for the most accurate land surveys. Nevertheless, it is desirable
to know the rate of the chronometer to at least 1 in 2 x 106 (approximately yy sec./day). By

comparison with the rhythmic time signals transmitted by the Post Office Wireless Station
at Rugby (G.B.R.), the mean rate can easily be determined with this accuracy, but it
requires an exceptionally good chronometer to ensure that the rate shall remain constant
throughout the interval between time signals. In the past mechanical chronometers have
been used, but the fact that these must operate electrical contacts, and the unfavourable
conditions on board a submarine, make it difficult to ensure the necessary constancy of rate.
Matters may be improved by using two or more chronometers, but it is quite possible that
the conditions experienced during a dive, such as the change in temperature and pressure
and the cessation of violent motion, may introduce systematic changes in the rates.

A great advance in the accuracy of timing was made by the American submarine gravity
survey of 1936-1937 on board the U.S.S. Barracuda, by using the ‘crystal chronometer’
designed and constructed by the Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York (Ewing 1938).
This proved extremely accurate even under the most exacting conditions. It consisted of
a 100 kc./sec. valve-maintained oscillator controlled by a quartz crystal, the output from
which was demultiplied to 1000 c./sec. and supplied the power required to run a small
phonic motor mounted in the pendulum apparatus. The whole instrument, with the
