The independent actions of
each body are shown in the projections below the movement for June (Plate 38).

3rd. The variation of the time of single oscillations is explained in a similar manner
by the combinations of the different variations.

4th. Since the agreement between the observed and calculated results is 80 consi-
derable, we are entitled to conclude that during a period of twelve months the solar and
lunar actions remained nearly constant for the same positions of these bodies relatively
to the earth and to each other,

Had it been s0ught merely to establish the fact that the variations of the daily mean
horizontal force of the earth's magnetigm may be represented very nearly in years of
small magnetic irregularity by the computed variations due to three causes having
periods of 26, 27:3, and 29:5 days, the investigation might have stopped here. It
seemed to me, however, desirable to examine to what extent the same process would
succeed in a year for which the movements appeared more irregular, 'The variations
for 1845 were therefore calculated from the means in the last columns of Tables I., I1.,
and 11T., in the same way as has been explained for 1844, commencing January 1, 1845,
with the 3rd day of the solar, the 9th of the lunar synodical, and the 10th of the lunar
tropical period. The sums of yariations for each day having been obtained, they were set off from the
curve of four-weekly means as before (sce Plate 38).
