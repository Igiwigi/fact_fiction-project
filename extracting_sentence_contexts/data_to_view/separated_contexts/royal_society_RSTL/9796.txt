THE FROG, AND ON THE ACTION OF THE VAGUS NERVE. 1031

energy, are less excitable, and less compact than the combinations which oceur in the
higher part of the series. Finally, I cannot help being struck with the fact that
alkaline substances snch as sodium hydrate or sodium carbonate increase the execita-
bility, increase the tonicity and increase the force of the contractions in weakly- -beating
hearts ; while, on the other hand, such 8nbstances as lactic acid diminish the excitability,
diminish the tonicity and diminish the force of the contractions of the cardiac musde. Whether the resemblance in these two cases is purely fictitious, or whether the trophic
action of the vagus nerve is connected with some such action of acids and alkalies I
cannob 8ay, and only put forward the resemblance in the hope that a possible clue
nay thus be ſound to the chemical action of the vagus upon the musecular s8ubstance of
Stthe heart.

5 Throughout this paper I have spoken of impulses proceeding from the sinus to the
Ecialo without attempting to define the nature of the stimulus which causes the
-Zventricle to contract, or the path along which the impulse travels. Subsequent
Sinvestigations which I have made upon the hearts of Tortoises have thrown new light
upon the cause of the sequence of the ventricular upon the auricular beat, and point
:2t0 a posible explanation of the want of 8equence observed under different cireumstances
Swhich i is 80mewhat different to that suggested above.

'S, The heart of the Tortoise is removed from the body and suspended TIP two

lovers i in the manner above deecribed ; no clamp is used, but the aortic trunk is held
firmly i in a 8uitable holder.
