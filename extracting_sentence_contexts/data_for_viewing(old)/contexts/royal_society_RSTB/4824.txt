The posterior carotid (fig. 6, p.cr.a.) shows some slight and gradual increase in size
after its origin from the dorsal bend of the first efferent branchial, but the increase is in
no way to be compared with that of the afferent pseudobranch artery. Its main trunk,
and to a less degree the three branches into which it divides, are contorted by a series
of short zigzag loops; a certain amount of sinuosity may also be observed in the basal
parts of the branches given off from the external carotid (fig. 6, ext.cr.a.). The modi-
fication of the artery as a whole is, however, much less than that of the anterior
carotid.

In the Fox Shark (Alopecias vulpes), one of the Lamnide, the carotid system approaches
the extreme degree of elaboration observed in Lamna, but is without the formation,
as in that genus, of true plexuses by the branching and anastomosis of its several com-
ponents. In fact, the arrangement of the vessels is similar to that just described in
Carcharias, but far more complicated,
