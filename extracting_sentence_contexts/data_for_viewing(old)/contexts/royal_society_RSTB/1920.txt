the mesial fillet, which has here passed outward from the ventral and mesial situation
it occupies lower down. ‘here was no degeneration on the same side as the lesion.

In this locality the degeneration, secondary to destruction of the auditory ganglion,
is extensive and intermingled with numerous normal fibres of the tegment. That
these degenerated fibres enter the internal geniculate body was assumed from the
fact that no evidence of their presence was detected in sections made higher up.
This assumption, however, received confirmation and amplification from the examina-
tion of a case in which the posterior quadrigeminal body and lateral fillet were
unilaterally destroyed. In this case, which is described in the next section (d), the
degeneration of the fibres arising in the accessory ganglion of the opposite side
was well marked, and was traced in diminishing quantity from the corpus trapezoides
to the internal geniculate body. This proves conclusively the existence of a direct
strand of fibres between the accessory auditory ganglion and the opposite
internal geniculate body. Hence we are unable to confirm the statement of
Epincer (14) that this segment of the auditory path is interrupted, first, in the
superior olivary body and, secondly, in the nucleus of the lateral fillet. From the
fact that the auditory tract diminishes in extent as it is traced upwards, it may be
argued that many of its fibres terminate in the superior olivary bodies, the nucleus
