values which increased progressively from 156-17 at wave-length 6708 to 203-85
at wave-length 3917. But a “ simple ” dispersion formula [M] = 140-67/(\*—0-0477),
based upon the readings for the two dominant mercury lines, showed an agreement that
was very satisfactory, especially in view of the fact that the observed rotations had been
multiplied by nearly 12 to convert them into molecular rotations. Moreover, the
