In
all four species there is a fairly large blood-tube in the subfilamentar tissue in the
apex of the plica, and all the interlamellar septa, and not the alternate ones only,
extend high up the demibranch, The ordinary filaments present no exceptional
features. In Psummobia pallida there is a much more copious proliferation of sub-
filamentar tissue, tending to choke up the interior of the plica, than in the other
species, There is a fair amount of muscle fibre around the interlamellar spaces and
in the interlamellar septa in Psammobia vespertina. The principal filament of Psammobia ferroensis bears a false resemblance to a
couple of ordinary filaments (see fig. 38), due to the sharply-cut sides of the frontal

filament. The illusion is dispelled, however, on examining sections near the ventral

finally disappears.
