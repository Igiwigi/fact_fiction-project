Probably all the grafts form a certain amount of mesoderm; but it is not always
possible with this tissue to make out with certainty the boundary between the graft
mass and the host tissues. As regards the neural tissue, the table shows that anterior
pieces of the primitive streak frequently form this material, the middle piece sometimes
do and sometimes do not, while the posterior pieces hardly ever do so. The records
would be entirely self-consistent, were it not for the specimens 280 and 442. Of these
280 is exceedingly difficult to interpret and it is by no means certain that no nervous

tissue is present. In 442 the grafted piece was extensively injured during the operation
and the failure to form neural tissue may be due to this fact.

Thus, from the grafts recorded in the table, it might be possible to argue that the
anterior end of the primitive streak always formed neural tissue if conditions were
favourable, while the posterior end never did. The varying results obtained with
middle thirds would then depend solely on whether they extended far enough anteriorly
to include any of the presumptive medullary material. There is, however, another
factor to be considered. These grafts were prepared primarily for the purpose of testing
the inducing capacities of the grafted tissue, and in several cases, when the graft structures
could not be seen after a dayâ€™s cultivation, the culture was discarded and not sectioned.
In such cases it is very probable that the graft had formed mesoderm only, since neural
tissue is usually easily seen in inspection of the culture. While it is almost certain
that an examination of these cultures would not have altered the statistical fact that
