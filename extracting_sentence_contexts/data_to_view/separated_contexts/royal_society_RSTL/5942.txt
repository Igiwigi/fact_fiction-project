nexion with the point, and I think one result of snch observations would be the esta-
blishment of the comparative shallowness of the Glacier de L6chaud. There is another characteristic of glacier motion which was predicted by Professor
Forsxs, before any observations had been made upon the point, and afterwards con-
firmed both by his own measurements and those of M. MarTINs,—I allude to the fact
that the glacier is not only retarded by its sides, but by its bottom, the superficial ice
thus moving more quickly than that in contact with the bed of the glacier. Objections have been made to both the measurements alluded to, and I was therefore
desirous to submit the question to a new test. 'The experiments which I have to record
were made upon the face of an ice precipice, which offered a rare opportunity for an
observation of the kind. The face formed the eastern boundary of the Glacier du Geant
near the Tacul, was about 140 feet in height, and nearly vertical.
