The
dimensions of the random series of chimpanzee teeth resemble those of man more closely
than do the Proconsul teeth. The orang teeth resemble those of man more closely than do
those of Plesianthropus or Paranthropus, while those of the gorilla agree to an equal extent. A brief reference was made in the introduction to this paper to the fact that the original
claims made about the character of the limb bones of the Australopithecinae by Broom
(Broom & Schepers 1946) and Le Gros Clark (19474, 6) have not been corroborated by
more recent studies. Thus Straus (1948) has concluded from a biometrical and statistical
analysis that the distal end of a humerus attributed by Broom to Paranthropus, and which
both he (Broom & Schepers 1946) and Le Gros Clark (1947a, 5) have claimed to be

essentially human in form, is *...no more hominid than it is anthropoidâ€™. Furthermore,
Kern & Straus (1949), by a similar metrical analysis, have shown that the distal end of
a femur of Plesianthropus, which Broom (1946) and Le Gros Clark (19474, 6) have again
claimed to be human in form, is not exclusively hominid, for, although not resembling the
great apes, it resembles man and the Cercopithecid monkeys in about equal degree.
