The limiting errors in the
eases of Rb and Cs are so wide that it did not seem worth while to discuss them in
the same detail, especially in view of considerations which will appear later, The
evidence so far is strengthened as to the correctness of (F) and (G) in fact; but, on
the other hand, the impression is intensified that there is something not quite correct
with the form for the S series. Rirz uses m+°5 instead of m, although there does
not seem any experimental evidenee in its favour. As a fact it can be shown that the
use of m+°5 in place of m in our formula makes it still more difficult to fulfil
conditions (F) and (G).

‘487 would include all except K. The values point to the possibility of there being
a constant difference, if the correct S formula be found.
