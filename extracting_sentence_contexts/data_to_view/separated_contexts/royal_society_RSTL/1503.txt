But for the-present, I intend to relinquish this subject to
such as may consider it worthy of attention; whilst, as 1
have already stated, I entertam very sanguine expectations,
that eventually it will prove economically useful ; and should
any be inclined to pursue the inquiry, I would recommend
particular attention to those processes which relate to the
roasted vegetable substances, and to peat. Almost any refuse vegetable matter, such as twigs, dead
leaves, &c. will serve for the former ; whilst the latter, as I
have shewn, does not require to be roasted, and in many,
especially the northern counties, peat is found in such abun-
dance, that but a 8mall proportional quantity is consumed in
the only useful way to which it has hitherto been applied,
namely, fuel. Before I conclude this Paper I s$hall also observe,
that the experiments which have been described, must be
regarded only as a mere sketch of that which may be
performed, whilst the facts which have been ascertained re-
specting the resins, balsams, gum resins, and gums, serve
to prove, that much may be expected from regular che-
mical examinations of these bodies. But such investigations,
in order that science- may truly be promoted, should be
strictly regular: that is, they should not be taken up in a
desultory manner, but these substances should be compa-
ratively and systematically examined with all the accuracy
which can be employed in the present state of chemical
knowledge ; for as this knowledge concerning the composition

of organized bodies is confessedly very imperfect, I am
persuaded, that like other of the sciences, chemistry will
be less liable to error, when guided by comparative experi-
ments, and comparative analyses.
