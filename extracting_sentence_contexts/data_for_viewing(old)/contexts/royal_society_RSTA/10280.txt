allowed of a simpler enunciation of physical laws. But in physical research so much
depends upon a trained imaginative intuition, that it seems most unlikely that
existing physicists would, in general, gain any advantage from deserting familiar
habits of thought.

Part I. (i) consists of general considerations upon the nature of the problem and
the method of procedure. Part I. (ii) contains a short explanation of the symbols
used, Part II. is devoted to the consideration of three concepts, which embody the
ordinary prevailing ideas upon the subject and slight variants from them. The
present investigation has, as a matter of fact, grown out of the Theory of Interpoints,
which is presented in Part III. (ii), and of the Theory of Dimensions of Part IV. (i).
These contain two separate answers to the question: How can a point be defined in
terms of lines? The well-known definition* of the projective point, as a bundle of
lines, assumes the descriptive point. The problem is to define it without any such
assumption. By the aid of these answers two concepts, IV. and V., differing very
widely from the current concepts, have been elaborated. Concept V., in particular,
appears to have great physical possibilities. Indeed, its chief difficulty is the
bewildering variety of material which it yields for use in shaping explanations of
physical laws. It requires, however, the discovery of some appropriate laws of motion
before it can be applied to the ordinary service of physical science.

The Geometry throughout is taken to be three-dimensional and Euclidean. In
