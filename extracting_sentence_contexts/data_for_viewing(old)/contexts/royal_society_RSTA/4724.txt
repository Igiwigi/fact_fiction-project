Taking the limit as h > 0, using the arbitrariness of 5 > 0 and the fact that the right-hand side of
the above does not depend on € gives us the result. a


(b) Existence of bounded weak solutions

With all the uniform estimates acquired, we can extract (weakly) convergent subsequences. In
fact, we find (we have not relabelled subsequences)
