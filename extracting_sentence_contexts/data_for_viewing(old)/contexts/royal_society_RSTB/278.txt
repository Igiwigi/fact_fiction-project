a When I resumed my investigation of the leaf of Dionea in 1885, the fact which
served as the starting point was the change in the electrical relation of the upper to
the under surface which is produced by leading through it a weak descending voltaic
current. The investigation of this change soon led to the discovery that the condition
of the leaf which I had called normal, in which the upper surface is negative to the
lower, is not that of its prime, but one of transition towards a state of diminished
activity. Then it was learned that, although the excitatory electrical effects which I
had described as belonging to this state are of greater intensity than those which are
witnessed when the leaf is in its prime, their right to be called normal is equally
questionable ; in short, that in vigorous leaves which have been successfully prepared,
