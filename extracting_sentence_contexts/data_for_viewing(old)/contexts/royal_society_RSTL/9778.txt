I know of no satisfactory instance in any gland in which the substances found in the
secretion are found stored up in the cells. In the liver-cells none of the characteristic
constituents of bile are found. Tt may be objected that in these no substance is
stored up, and that the cell protoplasm in activity forms straightway and excretes the
constituents of bile. From many observations carried on during the pasb twelve
months on the liver of the Frog, Toad, Newt, and Snake, I have been able to satisfy
myself that in these cases also granules are stored to be used during secretion.

In mucous glands the evidence is against the 8ubstance stored by the cells being
actually the mucin found in the fluid secreted. It is probably a pre-produet closely
related to mucin.

In the serous glands the facts known are not sufficient to be of much use for or
against.

PHYSIOLOGY OF PEPSIN-FORMING GLANDS. 697

When the sccretion produced by a gland contains nndissolved particles, these particles may be stored up
by the gland, thus fat globules are apparently stored up by the cells of the Harderian and Mammary glands.
