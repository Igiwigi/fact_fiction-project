A cuRvE of the third order, or cubic curve, is the locus represented by an equation such
as U=(%YJz, y, 2 =0; and it appears by my + Third Memoir on Quantics,‚Äù that it is
roper to consider, in connexion with the curve of the third order U=0, and its
Hessian HU=0 (which is also a curve of the third order), two curves of the third class,
2. the curves represented by the equations PU=0 and QU=0. These equations, I
ER represent curves of the third class; in fact, PU and QU are contravariants of U,
Sid therefore, when the variables , y, z of U are considered as point coordinates, the
Kriables E, 7, Z of PU and QU must be considered as line coordinates, and the curves will
by curves of the third class. I propose (in analogy with the form of the word Hessian) t5 call the two curves in question the Pippian and Quippian respectively.
