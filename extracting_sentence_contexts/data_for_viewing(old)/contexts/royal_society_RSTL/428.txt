3 gible. The law is, that & wherever two portions of the same
5 « light arrive at the eye by different routes, either exactly or
S « yery nearly in the same direction, the light becomes most

Z tioned by NEwToN. But it is still more satisfactory to observe
its conformity to other facts, which constitute new and distinct
classes of phenomena, and which could scarcely have agreed 50
well with any anterior law, if that law had been erroneous or
imaginary : these are, the colours of fibres, and the colours of
mixed plates.


388 Dr. Youxs's Account of some Cases

As I was observing the appearance of the fine parallel lines
of light which are seen upon the margin of an object held
near the eye, 50 as to intercept the greater part of the light of a
distant luminous object, and which are produced by the fringes
