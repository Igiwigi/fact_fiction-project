* We would emphasize here that the application of the older thermodynamical equations to metallic
equilibria is much more complicated than is assumed by many writers. Apart from the fact that the
electrons will form a degenerate system, the existence of contact potentials between different phases may
require the introduction of terms for electrical work done in the various cycles which are assumed. +*Ann. Physik.,â€™ vol. 10, p. 52 (1931) ; vol. 14, p. 353 (1932).
