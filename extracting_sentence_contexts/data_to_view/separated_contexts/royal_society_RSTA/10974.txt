It will
be shown below that there are apparently cases in which the method can still be
applied even when the metals of the solutions are different. The agreement for the half-normal solutions is less complete than for the more
dilute solutions. This may be partly due to the fact that the observed E.M.F. of the
cell was more uncertain in this case than in the others ; but a much more probable
explanation lies in the fact that the difference between the coefficients of ionization
for KI and KCl respectively becomes appreciable when the solutions are not dilute. Before examining the effect of such a difference further, I will give the results ot
experiments upon some of the other solutions mentioned by NERNST. EXAMINATION OF OTHER KNOWN DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE LIpPMANN-HELMHOLTZ
THEORY AND THE NERNST-PLANCK THEORY OF THE POTENTIAL DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN SOLUTIONS.
