We remark that the instantaneous frequency, IF*, recovered from the shape function is not
exactly the same as the instantaneous frequency in the EMD method, since, in IF*, only the intra-
wave modulation is taken into account; in the EMD method, the instantaneous frequency includes
both the intra-wave and inter-wave modulation. The difference can be clearly seen in figure 6.
However, these two instantaneous frequencies actually give an equivalent degree of nonlinearity,
as shown in appendix A. The reason for this is that in the definition of the degree of nonlinearity,
(5.9), the inter-wave modulation is actually factored out. This fact also shows that the nonlinearity
is encoded in the shape function, while the amplitude and instantaneous frequency have no
contribution to the nonlinearity if the definition of the degree of nonlinearity given by Huang
et al. is adopted.

In figure 62,b, we give the instantaneous frequencies recovered from the shape function for the
solution without and with noise in one wave cycle. As we can see, they both have very strong
intra-wave modulation. And even with a large noise perturbation to the solution of the Duffing
equation, we can still get the instantaneous frequency that captures the main feature of the
underlying Duffing equation. For the noise-free signal, the EMD method could also capture the
intra-wave frequency modulation, as shown in figure 6c. The instantaneous frequency obtained
from the shape function is not the same as that obtained by the EMD method. The difference
between the instantaneous frequencies obtained by the two methods is due to the fact that the
