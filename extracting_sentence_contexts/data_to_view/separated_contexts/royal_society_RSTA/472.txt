My theorem-prover couldn’t do it’. At that time, Robinson’s resolution method for
automatically proving first-order logic formulae [4] was very influential. Berger quotes Milner as
saying ‘I greatly admired Robinson’s resolution principle, a wonderful breakthrough, but, in fact,
the amount of stuff you can prove with fully automatic theorem proving is still very small. So, I
was always more interested in amplifying human intelligence than I am in artificial intelligence’. In 1970, Milner had an opportunity to explore this interest at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory, where he took a job as a research associate working for John McCarthy.

Before moving to Stanford, Milner had visited Oxford to hear Dana Scott speak on his theory of
domains.
