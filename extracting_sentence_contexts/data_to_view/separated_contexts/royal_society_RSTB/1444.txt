§ Vessels.—The fact of the vaso-dilating action of aldoxime being so feeble seemed
first to militate against the presence of any nitrite-like body. This can now be
@plained by the vaso-constrictory influence of aldehyde, and by the excessive weight
of aldehyde present in the aldoxime molecule. ‘wThe fact that a mixture of blood and aldoxime, after standing, acquires a
Seater dilating influence is to be accounted for, I take it, by the disappearance
By part of the aldehyde, either by oxidation or evaporation. Nitrous acid will not be
tet. It will be present in the form of sodium nitrite, which salt we know is
easily oxidizable.
