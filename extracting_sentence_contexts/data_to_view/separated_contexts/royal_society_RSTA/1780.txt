Empirical flux-based models have their shortcomings. Firstly, there are uncertainties in
estimating gsto, largely due to challenges in the parameterization of gsto models for different
species, cultivars and ecotypes. This is further complicated by the fact that O3 can both positively
and negatively affect gsto depending upon species and O3 exposure profile [69] and that O3 can
modify the stomatal responses of plants to naturally occurring environmental stresses such as
drought (e.g. [70-72]). There are only a limited number of flux-based ERRs for yield and biomass
effects (table 1). ERRs exist for four crop species (wheat, potato, tomato and rice), five forest
tree species/types (beech/birch, poplar, Norway spruce and Mediterranean deciduous oak and
Mediterranean evergreen species) and one grassland species (perennial ryegrass) with only three
ERRs for species/species types outside of Europe, all of which are Asian species.
