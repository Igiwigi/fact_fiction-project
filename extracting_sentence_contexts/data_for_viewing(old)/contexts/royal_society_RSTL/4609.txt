the circumstance of the retina arising, as it undoubtedly does, from the cerebral cells,
being in fact part of them and performing a similar function, we have, I think, a great
proof of the similarity in the structure of these two parts. There is another point
also, I think, of some importance in proving, as it does, that the opinion of some
modern anatomists is incorrect in stating that none of the fibres of the optic nerve
can be traced to the optic thalamus. I have said that the origin of the retina is from
the anterior cerebral cell, and that at a future period the optic nerve could be traced
uniting with its fellow of the opposite side beneath the optic lobes. It is in the
anterior cerebral cell that the thalami are subsequently formed, which makes it ex-
ceedingly probable that some of its fibres are connected with it, although the greater
majority may be traced to the optic lobes.

These facts I think are of some importance, and prove how deductions formed
from microscopic embryology may be applied to confirm dissections or microscopic
investigations made on the same parts in the mature animal.

On the Development of the Membranous Labyrinth and Auditory Nerve.

The observations I made prior to my description of the mode of evolution of the
retina will almost apply here as a preface to my observations on the development of
the membranous labyrinth and auditory nerve, for the essential part of this mem-
brane consists, like the retina, of a fibrous lamina formed of the terminal axes,
cylinders of the nerve tubules or of terminal loops of nerves, which are in intimate
relation with a layer of dark and closely-set nucleated cells, not unlike those found
lying between the meshes of the fibrous lamina of the retina; like it also, it may be
