The discoyery of valyular vessels in the brain, acting as
absorbents in that organ, immediately led me to suspect
that there must be a similar provision for carrying off the
fluids taken into the stomach, whenever the quantity or qua-
lity interfered with the process of digestion. To do this by the
route of the thoracic duct, was not only too circuitous to cor-
respond with the general simplicity of the operations of nature,
butwas mixing these heterogeneous liquids in too crude a tate,
with the general circulation of the blood. That there was
some unusual mode of conveying fluids from the stomach tothe


g6 Sir EVERARD HOME on the

urinary bladder, I have upon a former occasion established,
since they arrived there when both the pylorus and thoracic
duct were tied up, and the spleen was removed out of the
body ; but till the fact of valvular vessels supplying the
office of absorbents was ascertained, any opinion respecting
the route of fluids from the stomach, must continue to be
entirely hypothetical. Upon the present occasion, through Mr. Bavrr's means,
I am not only enabled to demonstrate 'vessels s0 constructed
in the coats of the stomach, but to give abundant collateral
evidence of their acting as absorbents, even more than can
be produced respecting those of the brain.
