The first contractions were taken at 11.30 A.M. During the first two hours and a
half, with the secondary coil standing at 10 centims., there was a gradual loss of
irritability advancing pari passu in both muscle and nerve. At 2.15 P.M., that is to
say in 2 hours 45 minutes, the secondary coil was pushed up to 5 centims. This
stronger stimulus caused a much larger response when direct than when indirect.
With the coil at 0 centim. there appears Jess discrepancy, and it is seen that five
hours after commencement of the experiment the nerve was still fully irritable, and
this stronger stimulus, when conducted along the nerve caused almost as large a
muscular response as when passed directly through the muscle.

Employment of 1 and 1:25 per cent. solution has demonstrated the fact that a loss

of irritability in efferent nerve-fibres is distinctly a prior effect of the action of
aldoxime to the loss of irritability in the muscle-fibres themselves.

The question arises, is this really due to a loss of irritability in the nerve trunk,
or is it simply due to a loss of power of conduction either in the nerve trunk or
end plates ?
