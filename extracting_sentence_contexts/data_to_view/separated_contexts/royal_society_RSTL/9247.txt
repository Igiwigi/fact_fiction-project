It
is obvious that such a substance as this would be called a solid in ordinary parlance,
and in the tidal problem this must be regarded as a rather small viscosity. Ti 8eems to me, then, that we have only got to postulate that the upper and cool
gurface of the earth pregents such a difference from the interior that it yields with
extreme glowness, if at all, to the weight of continents and mountains, to admit the
Possibility that the globe on which we live may be like that here treated of. If,
therefore, astronomical facts should confirm the argument that the world has really
gone through changes of the kind here investigated, I can se no adequate reason for
agguming that the whole process was pre-geological. Under these circumstances it
must be admitted that the obliquity to the ecliptic is now probably slowly decreasing;

that a long time ago it was perhaps a degree greater than at present, and that it was
then nearly stationary for another long time, and that in still earlier times it was
considerably less,*

The violent changes which some geologists 8eem to require in geologically recent
bimes would till, I think, not follow from the theory of the earth's viscoeity. According to the present hypothesis (and for the moment looking forward in time),
the moon-earth system is, from a dynamical point of view, continually losing energy
from the internal tidal friction.
