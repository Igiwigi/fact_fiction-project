Another and equally popular plasticity theory suggests that
sleep is important for strengthening synapses in specific cir-
cuits, thereby aiding memory formation and long-term
storage of information in the brain [31,32]. The relative
strengths and weaknesses of these opposing theories is hotly
debated [30,31,33,34]. In the end, it may turn out that both
types of plasticity occur during sleep, but determining exactly
how remains a challenge.

A quick search of the literature might suggest that evidence
in support of some theories is rather compelling but, in reality,
unequivocal evidence does not exist for any of them (e.g.
[15,34]). The fact that no single theory accounts for all aspects
of sleep, especially when viewed across the animal kingdom,
suggests that sleep serves many functions. Although sleep
may have evolved once very early in evolution to perform an
initial function shared by all subsequent animals, it is also pos-
sible that sleep evolved multiple times in response to different
selective forces. In either case, once sleep evolved it likely took
on additional functions, as certain processes may occur more
efficiently in a sleeping animal. The nature of these functions
may vary across species, reflecting their evolutionary history
and ecological and physiological demands. While this poten-
tial mosaic of functions probably contributes to the debate
over the functions of sleep, other factors undoubtedly play a
