In addition, elastic inter-
action of the surface irregularities must be taking place continually during sliding and
this may be an important factor determining the frictional force. As in the case of
unlubricated friction, therefore, a complete interpretation of the phenomena must
take into account, not only the surface properties, but also the bulk properties of the
sliding solids. The fact that friction is not a purely surface effect is also brought out by the
experiments on multilayers described in this paper. This work shows that although a
single molecular layer may be capable of reducing the friction and wear, the protective
layer is rapidly worn off during sliding with consequent increase in the friction and
wear between the surfaces. A layer many molecules thick wears off much more
