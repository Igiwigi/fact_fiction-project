Let m,, 1m, mg, 74, denote the masses of the molecules of A, B, C, D, respectively. Then, if these are gases, by what we have proved before (p. 486), the value of
L equals

ome (e+ Balog mt) + men (at Rl log 2)

Myqn

+ mrt A + R, log Th, Sy + mse (c, +R, 1 og 2) —w, . . (45)

MSE
where w is the mean potential energy of the four gases, and the remaining notation is
> the same as that on p, 486. The quantities & », ¢, ¢, are not independent of each other ; in fact, there are three
relations between them. ‘Thus suppose, for example, that {A} consists of the two
components a, 8; {B} of y,8; {C} of a and y; {D} of B and 8, then the chemical

reaction is expressed by the equation

(«B) + (78) = (ay) + (68);

so that we have evidently

so that

Thus, if € be increased by dé, the change in L equals

and by Hamiitoy’s principle the quantity in square brackets must vanish when there

is equilibrium. For perfect gases (‘.¢., gases which obey Boye’s Law)
