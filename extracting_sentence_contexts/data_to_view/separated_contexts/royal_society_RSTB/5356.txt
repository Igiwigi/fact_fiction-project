In forms possessing 4 pairs of arcualia in each segment, the second pair, namely the
interdorsals and interventrals respectively, are produced by the apical parts of respective
ventral and dorsal pyramids, as cell clusters situated between successive basidorsals
and basiventrals. These findings are extended to other groups as “ they (interbasalia)
are present in Fish and in every other vertebrate, although by no means as independent
typical interbasalia, but frequently modified into seemingly quite heterogeneous
parts.”

The theory of Gapow and Axpsorr cannot be applied to the development of the
vertebral column of Mus, because, in the first place, the intrasclerotomic fissure, the
existence of which these workers vehemently deny, is indubitably present (Plate 12,
fig. 7, i.sel.f.). That this fissure is not merely an attempt to explain the growth dorsal-

wards of the cells of a ventral pyramid and the growth ventralwards of the cells of a
dorsal pyramid is shown by the fact that the derivatives of these so-called pyramids
do not occur on opposite sides of it. On the contrary, the basidorsal (or the chief
component of the neural arch) and the basiventral (or rib-bearing element) occur in
each segment on the posterior aspect of the intrasclerotomic fissure, which separates
them from the elements giving rise to the interbasalia. If the views of Gapow and
Asporr were correct, the fissure would separate the basidorsal from the basiventral.
