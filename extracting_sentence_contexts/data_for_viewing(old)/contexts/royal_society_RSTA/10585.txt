to one another as p/cp to v, where ¢ is a length, say the radius of the tube.

The equations do not show in what way the motion depends upon this relation,
but it was inferred that the eddying motion must depend on some definite relation
between v and p/cp, expressible in the form v = ky/ep, where k is some constant.

The experimental observations were of two kinds, the earlier depending on the
device of introducing a colour band into a glass pipe and observing the velocity at
which break-down of the stream-line motion occurred, and the later method depending
upon the fact that stream-line motion is associated with resistance proportional to
the velocity, while for eddy motion the resistance is proportional to a higher power
of the velocity.

Both methods showed that the critical velocity at which stream-line motion
changed to eddy motion varied directly as the viscosity, and inversely as the radius
of the pipe.

Object of the Experiments.

In the experimental verification of the temperature effect upon the critical velocity
a satisfactory agreement was obtained with the formula, but as the range of
temperature was extremely limited, it was pointed out that “it would be desirable
