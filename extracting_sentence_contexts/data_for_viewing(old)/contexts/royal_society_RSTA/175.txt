(Houchmandzadeh et al. 1992; Conti & Salje 2001; Salje 2008); secondly, the fact
that any heterogeneity is translationally invariant in an infinite body. A point
defect or an interface can, in principle, move between positions of equal energy
and (almost) equal entropy. Such a move will accommodate external agents
such as strain, electric fields or magnetic fields. The elastic susceptibility (as
the characteristic response function) is hence lowered, i.e. the sample is seen
macroscopically as soft while no such softness exists in its proper crystal structure.
Any calculation of macroscopic features needs, technically speaking, a certain
degree of compactification and, often, the application of effective medium theories
and the like (Milton 2002).

Surface relaxations have been analysed and were found to be virtually
independent of the concrete atomic potentials. All that matters is the fact that
he second- and higher-order interactions are cut in any half space (figure 1).
Any energy minimization of the remaining interactions leads to a series of
differential equations with solutions of the type ¢, =A”e9, where &, is the nth
ayer relaxation amplitude (strain), In A is the length scale of the relaxation and é9
is the relaxation amplitude of the outermost layer. All structural relaxations have,
hus, exponential envelopes and phase factors that are either +1 (ferroelastic),
—1 (antiferroelastic), or exp(i¢) (incommensurate). The only variables are the
amplitude of the relaxation, such as the amplitude of the first layer, and the
ength scale of the relaxation. Calculations using realistic potentials show that the
amplitudes are around 2 per cent of the inter-atomic distances and the length scale
is around 10 inter-atomic layers unless the system is close to instability, where
his length scale diverges. This divergence leads to a collapse of the structure and
