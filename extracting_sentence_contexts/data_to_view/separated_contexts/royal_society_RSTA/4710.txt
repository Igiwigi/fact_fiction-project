But the unavailable or bound energy of thermo-
dynamics is the vesidwum which we cannot render mechanical by any sifting process
in bulk, or by anything short of the application of constraint to the individual
molecules. This vesiduwm may not be absolutely irreducible, but as the knowledge
of physical transformations increases, some parts of it may be raised into the domain
of available energy: on the other hand the recognition of temperature coefficients in
reversible processes will show that some energies previously considered as wholly
available are really in part unavailable. Each such discovery in fact involves an
amendment or improvement in the corresponding thermodynamic relations ; a process
which has happened, for example, with respect to Lord Ketvrn’s law of electromotive
force of a voltaic cell.

40. Once the idea of temperature is acquired, the whole science of ‘Thermodynamics
is implicitly involved in the principle of dissipation, that the unavailable part of the
energy of an isolated material system always tends to increase, never of its own accord
to diminish. The inference follows directly from this principle, by the reasoning first
employed by Sapr Carnot, that if the system pass from a state A to a state B such
that it can retrace its path back to A, the unavailable part of the energy is not
changed : thus there is a whole “ plane” or complexus of states, with perfect conti-
nuity of transformation among them, so that any one state is freely convertible—
whether the process has been actually discovered or not—with any other for which
