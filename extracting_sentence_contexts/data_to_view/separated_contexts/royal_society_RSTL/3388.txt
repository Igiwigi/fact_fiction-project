presented an appearance fully warranting the section fig. 177 ; though it was not pos-
sible to represent this appearance in that small figure. The seetion fig. 177. is, in

vesicle in an ovarian ovum of 8} hours. And in no object of the kind sufficiently
adyanced, and the interior of which the eye could reach, have I failed to find traces
of a structure essentially the same (se Plate XXV. figs. 200. 201.).
