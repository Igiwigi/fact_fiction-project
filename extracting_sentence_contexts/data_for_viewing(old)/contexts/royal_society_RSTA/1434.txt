Appendix A. Improvements since first VECMAtk release

In table 2, we present the fundamental improvements and changes in the development of each
VECMAtk component since the first major release.

Appendix B. Demonstration of a single example VVUQ analysis: COVID-19
application

To demonstrate the added value offered by VECMAtk more concretely, we showcase one specific
VVUQ procedure example, using the Flu And Coronavirus Simulator. We perform sensitivity
analysis across six different input parameters of FACS! to identify their sensitivity relative to
our quantity of interest (Qol). In table 3, we provide the default value for each parameter along
