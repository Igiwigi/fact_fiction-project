WHICH SATISFY GIVEN CONDITIONS. T7

single condition of a Higher manifoldness, and the corresponding relations as forming a
single relation ; and thus, though it is often convenient to consider two or more condi-
tions or relations, this case is in fact included in that of a -fold condition or relation.
In dealing with such a condition or relation it is assumed that the number of parameters
is at least =#; for otherwise there would not in general be any subject satisfying the
condition : when the number of parameters is =, the number of subjects satisfying the
condition is in general determinate.

2. A subject which satisfies a given condition may for shortness be termed a solution
of the condition ; and in like manner any set, of values of the parameters satisfying the
corresponding relation may be termed a solution of the relation. Thus for a fold
condition or relation, and the same number þ of parameters, the number of solutions is
in general determinate.

3. A condition may in some cases be satisfied in more than a single way, and if a
