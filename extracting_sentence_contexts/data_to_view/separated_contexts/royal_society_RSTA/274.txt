The 0! directrix curves
meeting Ay, are conics except for a unique straight line y', the generating line ayc, of 2

in fact. ‘ bi Wy ; ae a
Had ¥Y’ been A 3] with an extra 9th point its tableaux would have been
Vi Yo
1h 5 ss = T\ and all the directrix curves would be conics with no distinctive points

on the line Ay, which they all meet. Incidentally the above geometrical process throws light on the somewhat obscure
algebraical fact that in reducing a matrix pencil to canonical form it is the minimal
index of lowest value which first presents itself. When D has a single minimal index , and therefore a single curve .1°, of order 7),
the canonical form of the corresponding space Y/ is explicable as follows: This curve

meets two strata A and C in single points a, and ¢; say. The osculating systems of these

points interlock and at once give rise to chains @, dy ..., ¢{¢3 ... of index n,, where the set

c, is the set ¢,¢c, ... in reversed order.
