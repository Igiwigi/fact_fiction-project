Since b/a may vary in value from metal to metal, and
in the same metal at different. temperatures, this theory may by a proper choice of the
laws of variation be brought into unison with the observed facts. Tt is, however, open to doubt whether any theory which does not take into account
the atomic differences of the various metals can give a satisfactory explanation of the
whole facts. The nearness to each other of the curves for metals belonging to the
same chemical group, Plate 31, suggests that atomic properties play their part in
determining the behaviour of a metal to the flow of heat and electricity through it. Electronic theories have regarded the free electrons as the sole carriers of energy
from molecule to molecule, and have therefore been unable to deal with the thermal
conductivities of electrical insulators, in which there can be no free electrons.
