This plant was also invested by
a well-defined zone of sclerous prosenchyma, which, in the transverse sections, was seen
to be more or less subdivided radially into cubical masses (oe. cit., fig. 30, k, and Plate
29, fig. 35, hk). The central part of the transverse section (Plate 14, fig. 14, @) resembles the Petticur
plant in consisting of numerous clusters of tracheze aggregated into a large axial mass,
into the composition of which many parenchymatous cells enter. That these cells may
have become carbonised is probable from the fact that, when examined under a higher
power, the appearances shown in fig. 15 are observed. Two of the clusters of trachez,
enlarged 75 diameters, are here represented. In the centre of each cluster we have a
number of larger trachex, @, a, surrounded by still more numerous smaller ones, inter-
mingled with some cells, d, d.
