Let n> 2, 1 <p <oo and assume that 2 C R" is a standard domain of class C3. Then
the Stokes operator defined by

Apt:=PAu, D(Ap):= W??(2) 0 Wa? (2) NLE (2), (2.6)

generates a bounded analytic Cy-semigroup Tp on LE (@) and

(a) o(Ap) = (—00, 0] if 2 is R", RY or an exterior domain,
(b) o(Ap) C (—00, —«] for some k =K(@2) > 0 provided 2 is bounded,

The above Theorem 2.6 goes back to several authors, who proved various assertions of the
above theorem by different methods. In fact, maximal L?-regularity estimates for the Stokes
equation (1.1) due to Solonnikov, see [33,36], imply, in particular, the existence and analyticity
of the Stokes semigroup Tp on L5.(@). A very different proof for the case of bounded domains
with smooth boundaries was given by Giga [37]. His approach is based on Seeley’s theory on
pseudo-differential operators rather than on localization methods.
