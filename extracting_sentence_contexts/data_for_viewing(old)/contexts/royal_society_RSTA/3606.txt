The conclusions of these studies are inevitably uncertain given the similarity between the
spectra of cometary nuclei and those of the aforementioned C-, P-, T- and D-type asteroids
[25,28], which comprise most of the observed asteroids in the outer main belt, Hilda and Jovian
Trojan populations [32-36], any of which could also be the source of the observed low-albedo,
spectroscopically ‘comet-like’ NEOs. Identification of formerly active comets via dynamical
means is also complicated by the fact that Tj is actually not always conserved (§3), meaning
that the population of ACOs could contain a significant fraction of objects that are originally
from the main asteroid belt and are not of cometary origin [37-39]. However, more detailed
dynamical studies of these objects that rely on dynamical properties other than T) and instead
use detailed numerical simulations can potentially give a better sense of objects’ origins [40],
and near-dormant comets can also be identified simply by performing deep searches for residual
activity. Such searches have in fact occasionally turned up evidence of low-level activity (e.g. in
the cases of P/2003 WY25 = 289P/Blanpain and (3552) Don Quixote, among others [41,42]), but
this is not the case for most ACOs.


(b) Active asteroids
(i) Overview

In contrast with ACOs, which are observationally asteroidal and dynamically cometary (i.e.
have T, <3), active asteroids are observationally cometary and dynamically asteroidal (i.e. have
T) > 3) [43]. The first type of active asteroids to come to light were the main-belt comets (MBCs),
which orbit completely within the main asteroid belt yet exhibit comet-like mass loss due (at
least in part) to the sublimation of volatile ices [44,45]. In recent years, however, it has become
