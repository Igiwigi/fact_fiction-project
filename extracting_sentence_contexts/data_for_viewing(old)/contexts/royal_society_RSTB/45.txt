¢ Although, as urged by Moserey and Lankester (‘ Journ. Anat. Physiol.,’ vol. 3, 1869, p. 73), the
canine is not essentially a distinct tooth from the premolars, yet it was evidently very early specialised,
as is shown by such forms as the Mesozoic Stylodon pusillus, Ownn.

appears to have been wholly in the number of the true molars, and not of the pre’
molars, as is particularly well illustrated by the early representatives of the many-
toothed Odontocete Cetacea,* and also by the great majority of the Mesozoic Mam-
malia, many of which,t while still having only four premolars, have from five to eight
true molars. In fact, the earliest forms seem to have normally had a considerable
number of molars, but these were soon reduced down to four in the Metatheria, and
later to three or less in the Eutheria, leaving a few isolated forms, { with larger
numbers as remnants, retaining what the common ancestors of all had once possessed.
Two only of the many described genera of these ancient forms have been said to have
more than four premolars, namely, Amphitherium and Amphilestes, each described as
having six premolars and six molars §; but, as even this determination is disputed, |
and in any case rests entirely on the Bet of the teeth, and not on a knowledge. of
their manner of changing, it can hardly be said to prove incorrect the practically
universal rule that the typical number of premolars is, and has always been, at least
since middle Mesozoic times, four, and four only.§

Whether the teeth in the first stage of all were rooted or rootless is very doubtful,
