but it is probably acted upon by the currents of induction, which the interrupted
currents trayersing the conductor placed in the axis of the helix produce in it. 1

current through the interior one, I heard a remarkably intense sound. In the
reyerse case, the sound existed, but was much weaker. This fact is evidently con-
nected with the known property of helices trayersed by electric currents exercising
scarcely any magnetic influence exteriorly, whilst in the interior this action is yery
energetic.

Metals and solid bodies are not the only substances which produce the phenomena
I have just described ; all conducting bodies, whatever may be their state or their
nature, appear to be capable of producing them. Thus, I have observed them with
pieces of charcoal of all kinds and shape. Mercury als produces them in a very
marked manner. I have inclosed mercury in a tube of glass an inch in diameter, and
ten inches long : the tube was completely full and closed with care, s0 that the mercury
could have no motion. As 800n as it was trayersed by an interrupted current, trans-
mitted by means of two platinum wires, and the electro-magnet or the helix was
