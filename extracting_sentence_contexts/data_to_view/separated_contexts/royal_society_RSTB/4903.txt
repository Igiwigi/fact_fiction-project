The slope of the dorsal segment of a rib is not an index to
the axis of movement of a costal arch, nor to the degree of slope of the arch;
the axis on which ribs move is largely determined by the spinal and other muscu-

Vertebral level

natives does not necessarily signify a more inspiratory poise of their chests. Another fact which shows that the ribs of natives have a greater slope as regards
their anterior, or ventral ends, is the relationship of the upper end of the sternum to
the vertebral column. Dr. Redfield has used a costo-clavicular plane to indicate the
upper limit of the thorax; the mean position of the plane in whites is opposite the
middle of the vertebral attachment of the fourth pair of ribs; in natives the plane
cuts towards the lower part of the same attachment. Turning to the changes apparent in skiagrams taken of members of the Expedition

was 20 mm.
