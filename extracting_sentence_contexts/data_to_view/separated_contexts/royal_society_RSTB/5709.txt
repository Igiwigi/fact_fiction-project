The great variability in the subsequent involution of the uterus makes it difficult
to seriate accurately later post-partum material. Lactating mammary glands
are an obvious criterion of the post-partum phase, but while active they give little
evidence of the stage. Our chief difficulty has been in diagnosing (a) lactating animals
for which mammary glands were not available, and (b) one or two later post-partum
animals which showed no evidence of lactation. â€˜The situation is complicated by the
fact that during the involution of the uterus the segments in between the placental
sites may show a condition similar to that found during pro-cestrous enlargement. Examination of the uterine glands and reference to the Fallopian tube has been found
of assistance in these cases; the Graafian follicles give no clear indication of the post-
partum condition. A general classification of this material has been achieved firstly by
examination of the mammary glands, and secondly by considering the weight and
histological appearance of the uterus; when the glands were not available, classifica-
tion has occasionally been difficult.
