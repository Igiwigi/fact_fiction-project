Jt would turn out more easy to secure good astaticism with four-magnet systems than
Brith two, but this hope was not justified by the event. The adjusting and mounting
af the astatic system is the most difficult part of the manipulation ; the final adjust-
‘4nent must be made by hand twisting, as described in the ‘ Phil. Mag.’ (Joe. cét.).

(6.) The fibre must have a minimum torsional coefficient. In plain English, the

bre must be as thin and long as possible ; and it is, of course, much more important
go have the fibre thin than long. The proper thickness was calculated from the results
@btained by one of us in a paper on “ Quartz Threads” (‘ Phil. Mag.’ [5], vol. 30,
8. 99, 1890), and the thread was then picked out by measurement with a microscope ;

i factor of safety of about 2 being generally allowed. As a matter of fact, the thread
Bequired is very fine, but not unmanageably so: pieces about 25 centims. long were
generally used. We find that the thread can be fastened more securely by a little
“nelted shellac than by hard paraffin; we have had several accidents from the thread
“Slipping out of the paraffin. Of course shellac that has not been overheated or

issolved in alcohol, must be used. Care was always taken to use the thread in an

Zuntwisted state.
