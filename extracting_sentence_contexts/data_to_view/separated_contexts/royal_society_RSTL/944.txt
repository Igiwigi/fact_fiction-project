If a nest of wasps be approached
without alarming its inhabitants, and all communication be sud-

or themselves. But if one escape from within, it comes with
a very different temper, and appears commissioned to avenge
public wrongs, and prepared to sacrifice its life in the execution
of its 'orders. | I discovered the circumstance, that wasps thus
excluded from their nest would neither defend it, nor them-
selves, at-a-very-carly period of my life; and I profited 80

the actions of bees, under similar circumstances, would be the
same.*

which exuded between the: scales of the belly of the insect ;
but I am strongly disposed to believe that it is collected from
plants, and merely desposited between the scales of the belly

* A curious circumstance, relative to wasps, attracted the notice of some of my
friends last year, and has not, I believe, been satisfactorily accounted for, A greatey
number of female wasps were observed in different parts of the kingdom, in the spring
and early part of the summer of that year, than at almost any former period ; yet
scarcely any nests, or labouring wasps, were scen/in the following autumn ;_ the cause

in the autumn of the year 1805, on which Ãž had been making experiments, I noticed,
during many s2ccessive days, a vast number of female wasps, which appeared to have
been attracted there by the shelter and warmth of a south wall ; but I did not observe
any males.
