concerning the value of the internal velocity breaks down. Consider again ty
planes moving with a slab of matter, one inside and one outside the mass, and ]
the space motion of the outside ether at the‘position of outside plane be affected |
the motion of the slab to the extent yv, then all we can say is that

v— yo=n" (v— xv),
or, a
z=1— ow yet
wherefore it is possible for « and y to be unity together.
We may take it, however, that the quantitative accuracy of the Fizeau expt
ment renders anything of this sort very unlikely, and that we are bound to supp
the ether immediately outside moving matter to be stationary, i¢., to be 0
pletely unaffected by its motion, unless we are directly forced by facts to admit 1
contrary.

DR. OLIVER LODGE ON ABERRATION PROBLEMS. 735

The two parts of FresNet’s law, the motion of internal ether, and the fixity of
external ether, can and ought to be verified separately. The Fizeau experiment has
verified the one. I propose to attempt the other. To this end I am passing a beam
of light, split into two equal halves, very near a rapidly rotating disk (in fact between

mechanical motion and the other half travels against it. The two half beams, after
