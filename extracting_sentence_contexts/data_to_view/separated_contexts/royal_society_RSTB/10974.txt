Its
best modern variant, put forward by the mathematical logician
John Mayberry, takes arithmetic and number theory to be gen-
eral truths about sets (including one-membered sets and the
empty set), interpreting numerical equations in terms of 1-1 cor-
relations as is done in standard set theory [2]. For example, ‘3 +
2 = 5’ istaken to mean that there is a 1—1 correlation between the
union of any triple with any pair not overlapping the triple and
any quintet. In fact, the whole of cardinal number theory, includ-
ing theorems about zero, can be interpreted along these lines in
set theory. An attractive feature of the classical view is that the
problem of cognitive access seems to melt away: we can have
access to some numbers by perception (those three eggs) or by
description (Jupiter’s moons). But there is one major disadvantage.
