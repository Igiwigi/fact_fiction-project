spectral conjecture ([205]) above will hold.

An important part of the problem is to recover the Taylor series invariant that classifies semi-
global neighbourhoods of focus-focus fibres [3]. A positive solution was given in [206,207], but
the procedure was not constructive: one had to first let # — 0 for a regular value c near the focus—
focus value cg, and then take the limit c > cg, which does not help in computing the Taylor series
in an explicit way from the spectrum.

Problem 7.6 (S. Via Ngoc). Compute the Taylor series invariant of semitoric systems directly
from the spectrum ‘at’ the focus-focus critical value.

One should probably use the corresponding singular Bohr-Sommerfeld rule; see problem 7.3.
In fact, the following intermediate question is very natural:

Problem 7.7 (S. Vii Ngoc). Is the singular Bohr-Sommerfeld formal power series inf a spectral
invariant?

There are various later refinements and extensions of conjecture 7.5 [18,208,209], following
other inverse spectral questions in semiclassical analysis (see, for instance, [210-212]) which
concern integrable systems (or even collections of commuting operators) more general than
semitoric, and even in higher dimensions. All of them essentially make the same general claim:
‘from the semiclassical joint spectrum of a quantum integrable system one can detect the principal
symbols of the system’. A more concrete problem is

Problem 7.8 (A. Pelayo). What information about the principal symbols f,,.. .,f. of a quantum
