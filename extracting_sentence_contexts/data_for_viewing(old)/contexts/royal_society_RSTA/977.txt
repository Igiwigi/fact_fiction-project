momenta. An analogous result was obtained by Mironov in [51] for m=5 under the additional
assumption of real analyticity.

As for the ‘degree > 5’ line of table 1, let us first mention the results of Kiyohara [46], who,
for each d > 3, constructed a family of metrics on S* whose geodesic flows admit a polynomial
integral of degree d, but do not admit any non-trivial integrals of degree 1 or 2. Unfortunately,
for the examples constructed in [46], it is not clear whether they might have non-trivial integral
of ‘intermediate’ degrees d' (i.e. 2 < d’ < d) or not. The integral F of degree d constructed in [46]
is irreducible, but one may still imagine that there exists an additional polynomial integral of a
smaller degree which is independent of both H and F. The point is that the metrics constructed
in [46] are Zoll metrics, i.e. all of their geodesics are closed. This means that the geodesic flows are
superintegrable (see the discussion in §3c), which implies that additional integrals exist; it is not
clear though whether they are polynomial in momenta and, in fact, we conjecture that it is not the
case.

Problem 3.1. Complete table 1: (i) construct new examples of natural Hamiltonian systems
on closed two-dimensional surfaces admitting polynomial integrals; describe and, if possible,
classify them; (ii) prove, if possible, the non-existence of such integrals (perhaps under some
additional assumptions).

Of course, this general problem is very complicated, and a solution of certain special cases
(some of them are listed below) is interesting. Even a construction of one new integrable example
ona closed surface deserves to be published!

Let us list some conjectures/special cases/additional assumptions which were studied in
