** Polistotrema (a Myxinoid) in the adult possesses a distinct system of lymphatics or veno-lymphatics,
supplying a region amply furnished with veins’ (ALLEN, “ Studies on the development of the veno-
lymphatics, in the tail region of Polistotrema,” ‘ Quart. Jour, Micro, Sci.’, vol. 59, 1914, p. 348).

“Tt is largely by the anterior terminal branches of the external carotid artery that blood enters the
subcutaneous sinus. . . The external carotids otherwise supply the gut ..., and also the skin of the

to the blood-vascular system is indicated by the fact that they do contain blood, and
by their distinct connection with arteries.

The condition of the vascular system in these lowly Vertebrates thus seems to present,
as Cone suggests, an early stage in the evolution of lymphatics, in which “the
“lymphatic ’ spaces are neither true lymphatic nor true blood-vascular spaces, but
partake of the nature of both. We have in the Myxinoids the final stage in the
separation of the blood-vascular from the lymphatic system. In other words, the two
systems are in the act of segregating out.’ (Coun, 5, p. 229.)

Some such condition may well represent, in a general way, a stage through which
the lymphatic system of Teleosteans has passed, a stage in which the pre-Teleostean
lymph vessels still partook of the characters of veins and were still in direct connection
