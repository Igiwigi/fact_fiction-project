In many respects, such as its wide
distribution, and its want of stratification, it resembles a subaérial glacial detritus,
but its entire want of wear, the presence of and condition of the bones, and especially
the presence of delicate land shells, are incompatible with such an origin. The
absence of foreign transported materials or boulders, and of marine shells, is equally
incompatible with a submarine glacial origin. Taking all these facts into consideration, the only agent which appears to me
capable to have produced such results, is that of an upheaval of a submerged land
following upon a wide-spread submergence. This upheaval by displacing the super-
incumbent body of water, would give rise, as shown in a paper by the late Mr. W.
Horxixs, of Cambridge,* to divergent effluent currents, which would sweep down
from the higher to the lower levels the débris of the submerged surface. Such would
have happened, if after a temporary submergence the land had again been upheaved,
and the former levels approximately restored.
