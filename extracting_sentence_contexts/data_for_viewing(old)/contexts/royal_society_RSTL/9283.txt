T deseribed this species in the Flora Antarctica from very imperfect specimens
gathered by myself in the Falklands in mid-winter, along with the yery similar R.
hydrophitus, Gaud., and from a careful examination of the remains of the only flower
found, which resembled in petals, sepals, and stamens those of its neighbour, T
suppoxed it to be closely allied to it. Good specimens gathered by Cunningham in
the Straits of Magalhaens, and by Taton in Kerguelen, prove that it belongs to another
section of the genus, differing from R. hydrophitus in the usually trimerous perianth
and the long style of the flattened ripe carpels. 2. trullifolius is, in fact, referable
to St. Hilaire's genus Casatia (now reduced to Ranunculus), and its nearest ally is
NR. bonariensis, Poiret (R. Kunthii Trian, and Planch.), which differs by its ovate
crenate leayes, long-peduneled flowers, and a√æsence of style in the ripe carpels.

R. hydrophilus, again, is probably a form of 2. adscendens, St, Hil. (2. humilis,
