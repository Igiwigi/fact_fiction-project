L. Acass1z that there is a complete parallelism between the embryonic developm
the tail in these Fishes and the palzontological development of this organ. We t
that it is moreover convenient to retain the term homocercal for those types of ca;
fin in which the dorsal lobe has atrophied 80 far as not to project beyond the ve!
lobe.

We have stated these now well-known facts to enable the reader to follow us
dealing with the comparison between the skeleton supporting the fin-rays of the yen
lobe of the caudal fin, and that snpporting the fin-rays of the remaining unpaired

It has been shown that in Lepidosteus the unpaired fins fall into two catego
according to the nature of the skeletal parts supporting them. The fin-rays of t]
true ventral lobe of the caudal fin are supported by the spinous processes of certain «
the hamal arches. The remaining unpaired fins, including the anal fin, are supported
by the 80-called interspinous bones, which are developed independently of the vertebral
column and its arches. 4

The question which firsb presents itself is, how far does this distinction hold good for
other Fishes? This question, though interesting, does not appear to have been greatly
