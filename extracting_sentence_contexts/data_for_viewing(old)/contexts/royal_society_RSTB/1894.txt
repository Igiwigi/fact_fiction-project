necessary to regard it as a somewhat special kind of enamel.

Jancken (6) considers it a low form of enamel, and hence distinguishes it by a new
name, “ Placoinschmelz.”

Scurry (8) summarises the arguments for and against its being enamel, quoting
Kraarscn (5) as holding that it is not true enamel, because it is not a product of the
epithelium; but he further says that JanckEL writes as though KiaatscH had
changed his opinion. Scurry himself always refers to it as “Schmelz,” and
Miss Nunn (4) not only expresses no doubts as to its nature, but even uses what is to
be seen in it as arguments as to the nature of Mammalian enamels in general.

It has long been a familiar fact that the teeth of Plagiostomes differ from their
dermal spines in degree rather than in kind, and that, whilst the latter are roofed
over only by epithelium during their formation, the former are developed, to a much
greater size, under the shelter of a thecal fold of mucous membrane (fig. 14).

But the extent to which this protection is carried varies much in different members
of the group; thus, in Mustelus, Raia blanda, and Raia microcephala, only two or
three of the youngest tooth germs are covered in, whilst in Acanthias five or six,
and in Lamna seven or eight in successive stages of formation are within the shelter
of the fold.

And whilst in Mustelus the rows of teeth form a pretty continuous pavement over
the surface of the jaws, and so the fold can take but little hold between them, in
