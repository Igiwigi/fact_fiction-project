completely regular.

This rhythm, we show, must be looked upon as the same as that which, as
Wootpripee and Ticersrept observed, makes its appearance when the ventricles
are severed from the auricles. We point out, however, that the independent
ventricular rhythm of vagus action is characterised by the slowness with which
it establishes itself. (Pp. 231-233.)

This characteristic is due to the lowering of the excitability of the ventricles
produced by vagus action, and we adduce a considerable number of facts showing
that the vagus does lower the excitability of the ventricles, and that, by means
of muscarin and by discontinuous stimulation of the vagus, it is possible to isolate the
influence of the vagus on the rhythm and force of the auricles from its influence upon
the excitability of the ventricles. The power of the vagus to stop the ventricles
temporarily can only be explained by this diminution of their excitability.

We show that, with a certain degree of vagus excitation, irregularity of the
ventricles necessarily results, in consequence of the sinus and the ideo-ventricular
rhythms interfering with one another; that this is the common cause of irregularity,
and that irregularity may also be caused by the auricles not responding to all the
impulses which reach them from the sinus.
