to be in all probability the most primitive of existing Echinoderm larval types, in
virtue of the following characters taken as a complex :—

(1) In possessing a large preoral lobe; (2) in showing vestiges of a primitive
“ protoccelomatous ” mode of origin of the posterior ccelom ; (3) in feeding for itself
from the gastrula stage right up to metamorphosis; (4) in having an arrangement of
the enteroccelic cavities from which that of the other types of Echinoderms can be
derived, and in showing, to begin with, practically perfect bilateral symmetry with
regard to the middle or hydroccelic region of the right and left cceloms ; (5) in having
the hydroccele originating in the left middle ccelomie region as an open crescent ;
(6) in having the larval stomach and part of the larval cesophagus and intestine
retained ; (7) in having a gut curvature from which the disposition of the alimentary
canal in Echinoderms generally can be derived ; (8) in the fact that all the perihzemal
pouches originate from the /.p.c. ; (9) in having a dorsal pulsating “epicardial” sac ;
(10) in acquiring radial symmetry during a fixed stage from which release is obtained
by loss of the larval stalk.

Common Ancestor of Balanoglossus and Echinoderms.—We are probably justified
in inferring (1) that this ancestor was eleutherozoic; free swimming or crawling ;
with an anterior ccelom* and (paired) middle and posterior cceloms, the anterior and

organ, and it will be remembered (p. 275) that the late double-hydroceele larve showed the formation of a
pharyngeal ccelom and of an axial organ on the right as well as on the left side.

It is obvious, from its structure, that the axial organ is more than a simple vessel or network of vessels,
