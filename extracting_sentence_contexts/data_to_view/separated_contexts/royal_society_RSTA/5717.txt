The liquid solidifying at the trailing interface forms a region
free of liquid droplets. The simulated microstructure behind the migrating liquid film showing
a particle free zone agrees well with experimental observations. It is also found that the solid
concentration in the particle free zone is lower than the initial composition; essentially it is the
equilibrium solid concentration, due to the fact that the resolidification at the trailing interface
occurs with local equilibrium. Simulated concentration profiles across the migrating liquid film
agree well with experimental quenched liquid films. CA simulation calculations are performed regarding the evolution of microstructure and
composition field for an Al-4wt.%Cu alloy with an initially equiaxed grain structure in a
temperature gradient.
