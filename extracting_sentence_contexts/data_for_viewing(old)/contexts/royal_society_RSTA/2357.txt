to answer, partly due to its subjective nature, and especially since the structural analysis of
the models reveals strengths and weaknesses in both designs. In the wider context of how
successful the bridges were as commercial ventures, however, the bridge at Middlesbrough might
be considered the clear winner, since it generated a profit and it was generally the more reliable of
the two bridges, whereas Newport made a continuous loss. On the other hand, appropriate credit
should still be given to Ferdinand Arnodin, the joint chief engineer behind the Newport bridge,
for his contribution to the field of structural engineering itself. Both structures are complex, but
the degree of nonlinearity inherent in the stayed-suspension layout of the Newport bridge, in
particular, required Arnodin to formulate his own linear approximations for the structure in order



to make its design and analysis possible. The fact that he achieved this at the start of the twentieth 0 |
century, creating a design of such complexity which still stands today, represents a significant

innovation. 3

In recent years, both transporter bridges have become significant tourist attractions, and oS
it is possible to climb up and walk along the boom of eachâ€”even to bungee jump off the : gS
Middlesbrough bridge on occasion. Climbing up the tower and walking across each bridge allows : 3

visitors to appreciate both the structural engineering and splendid views. These transporter
bridges remain valuable technological and cultural assets.
