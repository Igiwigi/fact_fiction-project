and the fact that a single LED is active at any time removes inter-carrier or inter-band interference DN
(IBI) at the receiver. However, it has been shown that the power efficiency of the scheme is lower :3
than that of the equivalent CAP scheme, due to the requirements for distinct channel gains for :&
the different LED sources [76]. Ways to mitigate this issue include the application of the PFI
technique in a similar manner to MIMO to differentiate the channel gains or the use of multiple
photodiodes (PDs) at different locations to increase the probability of correct symbol recovery. It

has been shown that significant improvements in power efficiency can be achieved with these two
schemes. Additionally, a study on the multipath effects on S-CAP in indoor VLCs was also carried

out [76], indicating that the use of multiple PDs can significantly improve the system performance

in the presence of strong multipath interference.
