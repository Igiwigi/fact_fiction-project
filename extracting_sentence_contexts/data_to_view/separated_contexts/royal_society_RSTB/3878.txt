The comparison of the two diagrams just cited will give a good

idea of the changes which take place in the arrangement of the strands in this part

of their course. Text-fig. 4 was drawn from a section at the beginning of the series,

Ls and text-fig. 5 from one near the end, the distance between the two being about

S 20mm, â€˜The absence of any leaf-traces passing out through the wood prevents us

By from determining with absolute certainty the upward or downward direction of the

& series. The fact, however, that all the movements of the medullary strands, so far as

a they go, are outwards leaves little doubt that the series (1-24) runs from below
upwards, and in what follows it will be assumed that this is the case.
