As expected, the predictions from Tm-HoTMuSiC are more
accurate than those from the standard HoTMuSiC, given that additional potentials are considered,
which take more properly into account the thermal stability properties of the proteins. However,
the difference in performance is smaller than expected, especially in the light of the results shown
in the next section where a relation between the Tm of the wild-type protein and the ATm
distribution of point mutations is observed. This can be attributed to the fact that the T-dependent
potentials are extracted from small datasets of about a hundred proteins and thus are noisy, even
if some tricks were employed to limit this small-size effect [27].

5. Analysis at the structuromic scale

On the basis of the results obtained at the protein level, we analysed the thermal properties
of proteins at the structurome scale in view of understanding how the physical principles that
drive the thermal optimization are reflected in the evolutionary pressure on the sequences, which
occur in response to the thermal conditions of the environment. In the last decade, a series of
investigations tackled this issue (e.g. [29-34] and references therein), but the answers remained
elusive and too frequently model dependent.
