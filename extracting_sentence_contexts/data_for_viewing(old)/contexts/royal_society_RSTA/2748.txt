travel back and verify the accepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance’. To that another
guest replies ‘Don’t you think you would attract attention? Our ancestors had no great tolerance
for anachronisms’. The Time Traveller has no reply to any of that because, I believe, Wells had
no reply.

The issue of paradoxes is not mentioned again in The Time Machine until near the end. And once
again, it seems clear that Wells was puzzled by paradoxes. When a dishevelled Time Traveller
returns from AD 802, 701 and beyond, one of his incredulous friends exclaims ‘What was this
time traveling? A man couldn’t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?’

The best known paradox is almost certainly the grandfather paradox: what if the Time Traveller :
journeys back to when granddad is a baby and kills him—from where then comes the Time [=
Traveller? This is an old paradox, one that generations of science fiction writers have had a lot 5
of fun with, but in fact there is a resolution to it that has found general agreement among most :
physicists and philosophers, a resolution that does not conclude that time travel to the past is Da
impossible [36,40]. There are, however, plenty of other even more bizarre paradoxes that have not :
been so tamed, and I'll concentrate here on just one type, a type that lends itself in a natural way 74
to Heaviside’s FTL particles, as well as to his early life as a telegraph operator. I am referring to 73

6. Messages to the past

The classic science fiction example of a temporal information loop is the story of a physicist who
has been trying, without success, to build a time machine. Then, when he has become sufficiently
frustrated as to be just about ready to toss the whole business in the trash, a silent visitor (who
