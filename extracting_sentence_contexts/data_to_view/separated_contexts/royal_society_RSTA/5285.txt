Media reports and weblogs debating extra-terrestrial life, including those
hat relate to this very Royal Society Discussion Meeting, also provide some
evidence on public opinion and reactions that can be expected. If data are absent or ambiguous, we tend to argue by retreating to analogies
or theories about universalities. Historical examples, however, need to be well
understood before these can serve as a guide, which is demonstrated by the fact

1at history is full of misinterpretations and misconceptions of itself (cf. [48,49]). Rather than aliens invading Earth, most likely detection scenarios will involve
microbial organisms and/or extra-terrestrial life at a safe distance that prevents
yhysical contact. As far as exploring other life forms is concerned, any strategy
applied must exclude biological contaminationâ€”not only to protect ourselves,
yut also to preserve any alien life discovered as part of an overall commitment
o enhancing the richness and the diversity of life in the Universe [16].
