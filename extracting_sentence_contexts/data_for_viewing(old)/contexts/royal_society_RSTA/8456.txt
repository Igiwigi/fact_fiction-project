S was abstracted, as described in § 3.

The method of reduction described in §§ 9, 10 should nevertheless eliminate 8 from the
final sums I-IV, provided that on the summary sheets the 24 rows of sums all refer to
equal numbers of days ; but departures from equality in this respect will affect the deter-
minations of L, more seriously in this case (owing to the relatively large amplitude
of S) than when § has initially been removed. On most of the summary sheets this will
only increase the accidental error of the resulting values of L,, because no systematic
variations in the numbers of days included in the different rows of sums are likely ; but
on the summary sheets on which the lunar days are separated according to the moon’s
distance, into the groups A, a, p, P (§4), such systematic variations are more likely
(owing to the near agreement between the lengths of the synodic and anomalistic months),
and did, in fact, appear. The results from these summary sheets are therefore not given
in this paper.

During part of the years 1882-3, Géttingen time was used at Pavlovsk instead of local
time. The corresponding data were omitted from this investigation.

§ 12.5. Horizontal and Vertical Force at Pavlovsk—tThe printed records gave the
horizontal and vertical components of force to 1 y, but the last digit of the lunar hourly
differences was ignored, so that the unit on the lunar sheets was 107. The solar diurnal
variation was abstracted as in other cases, and the complication mentioned in the first
paragraph of § 12.4 was met as in the case of the declination.
