We realize
in this way that organic information is as real as the copying process that generates it. This in
turn means that organic information is essential to describe genes and proteins. To this purpose,
in fact, it is no less essential than the physical quantities, and this means that organic information
has the same scientific status as a physical quantity. They both belong to the class of objective entities
that allow us to describe the world. This conclusion, however, raises immediately a new problem, because there are two distinct
groups of physical quantities: a small group of fundamental quantities (space, time, mass, charge
and temperature) and a much larger group of derived quantities.
