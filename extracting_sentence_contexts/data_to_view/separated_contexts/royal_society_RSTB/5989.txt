This cannot represent anything other than a vestige of the original basal
connexion. A connexion almost certainly similar was described by Finatorr (1906)
in the pigeon, but was held by him, on grounds which we believe to be untenable, to
represent the ascending process. The interest of this connexion between the polar cartilage and the pterygoquadrate
lies in the fact that it enables us to identify the basitrabecular process, and to see that
the infrapolar process is not simply a basitrabecular process directed backwards. The
basitrabecular process as such is not further developed in the cartilaginous skull in the
duck ; it is, however, very obvious in the swallow, fig. 22 (b.t.p.), and has been described
by W. K.
