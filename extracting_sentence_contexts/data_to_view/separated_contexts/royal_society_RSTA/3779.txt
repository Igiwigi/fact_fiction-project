The back E.M.F. of the are, as a whole, was but little affected
by the introduction of the search carbon. This distortion of the are by the search
carbon probably also accounts for the observation that the measured impedance of
the are as a whole is not equal to the sum of the impedances of the two parts
comprised between the search carbon and the main electrodes. Owing to the correct method of apportioning between the two electrodes, the
resistance and self-induction of the loop formed by the carbons, holders, and frame ot
the lamp, being unknown ; and owing to the fact that the measured quantities are
only roughly approximate, due to the disturbing effect of the search carbon, no
attempt was made to apply the small correction to the observations for the self-
induction and resistance of the carbon holders and lamp frame, and the observed
impedances were treated as resistances, and the back E.M.F.â€™s calculated as usual. Further, the three ares which had the same length and current will be considered as
having been identical, though such was not strictly the case. On these assumptions, consider the resistance between the positive electrode and
the search carbon when the search carbon is 1 millim.
