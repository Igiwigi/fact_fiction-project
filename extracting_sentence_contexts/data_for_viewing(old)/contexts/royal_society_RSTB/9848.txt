applied in the context of biparental care, using a sequential game in which
parents first compete with one another over resources, and then choose how
to allocate the resources they each obtain to care of their joint young (public
good) versus their own survival and future reproductive success (private
good). We show that when the two parents both invest in care to some
extent, they should refrain from any conflict over the division of resources.
Subject Areas: The same effect can also support asymmetric outcomes in which one
parent competes for resources and invests in care, whereas the other does
not invest but refrains from competition. The fact that the caring parent
gains higher fitness pay-offs at these equilibria suggests that abandoning a
