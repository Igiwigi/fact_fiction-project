When the mud first arrived, the number of larvee that could be hatched from it was
considerable, and a large proportion of these grew to maturity. After a few months,
however, the yield of larvee was much smaller and a far smaller proportion survived to
maturity. There was certainly a diminution in the number that hatched, but the fact
that so few survived must be attributed, partly at least, to the fact that the crop of
micro-organisms hatching out with the nauplii became progressively smaller, and hence
the food supply became insufficient. It was attempted to make up this deficiency with
protozoal cultures reared in the laboratory, but without success. The micro-organisms
at first consisted of various flagellates and ciliates as well as bacteria, but subsequently
the bacteria only were evident and these in far fewer numbers.
