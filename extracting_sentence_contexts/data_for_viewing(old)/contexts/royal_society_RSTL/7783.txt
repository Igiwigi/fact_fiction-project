To ascertain the loss of weight by the fluoride of silver in the preceding experiments,
12'8 grains were put into a platinum boat enclosed in a roll of platinum-foil, and heated
to tranquil fusion at a gentle red heat in a platinum tube-retort (similar to the tube A
in fig. 5), then cooled and weighed; the loss was 0:10 grain. The boat and foil were now
put into a long horizontal platinum tube and gently heated in a slow current of hydrogen
(which had been generated by magnesium and pure dilute sulphuric acid, and dried by
two wash-bottles of strong sulphuric acid), the current of gas and the heat being main-
tained until acid fumes entirely ceased; the loss of weight was 1:80 grain. This is
less than the theoretic quantity by 0:10 grain, which is partly (if not wholly) accounted
for by the fact that fluoride of silver, even when carefully prepared from pure materials,
is liable to contain a variable amount of metallic Silver, which is left as an insoluble
black powder on dissolving the salt in water. This free silver is caused in the process
of drying the alt, by the aqueous yapour from the imperfectly dried portions and from
the surrounding air decomposing the dry and hotter portions; it is increased in quan-
tity every time the alt is fused in contact with atmospheric air.

[To determine the amount of silver in the fluoride, 15:89 grains of perfectly anhydrous
fluoride was dissolved in water, the solution filtered, the separated black precipitate
washed, and the silver in the filtrate determined by addition of chloride of potassium ; it
gave 18:00 grains of chloride =13:55 grains of silver. The black matter weighed 0-1
grain after ignition ; deducting this amonnt, the 15-79 grains of fluoride contained 13:55
grains of silver: theory requires 13:437 grains. On several occasionsT have had reason
