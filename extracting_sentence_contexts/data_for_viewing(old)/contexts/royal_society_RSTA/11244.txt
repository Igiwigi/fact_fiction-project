The equation I—i=hk, .
Réntgenised gases in which most of the ionisation takes place throughout the volume

was originally obtained for the conductivity of

a , where @ is the constant in the equation ~ =aN?
representating the rate of recombination of the ions, 7 is the distance between the
electrodes, « the charge carried by each ion, and U the sum of the velocities of the
positive and negative ions under an electromotive intensity of one volt per centim.

When all the ionisation takes place at the surfaces of the electrodes, the above
signification of k, no longer holds, but the fact that the equation can still represent
the observed relation between the current and E.M.F. shows that the general nature
of the conductivity is the same in both cases.

In our paper referred to above, we showed that the conductivity of the halogen
salts is approximately proportional to the square root of the concentration of the salt
vapour in the flame. The conductivity of the oxysalts followed the same law when
the concentration was very small, but with greater concentrations was nearly pro-
portional to the concentration of the salt vapour. Now when the concentration of the
salt vapour in the flame is very small, the amount of salt in an extremely thin layer
at the surface of an electrode in the flame will be proportional to C', where C is the
concentration of the salt vapour, that is, supposing that the mean distances between
the molecules of salt is larger than the thickness of the layer in which ionisation takes
