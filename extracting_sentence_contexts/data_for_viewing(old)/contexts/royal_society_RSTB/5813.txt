but it is evident from previous figures that such is actually available. The rise of water-
table near the canals obstructs the leakage from them, and, conversely, the lower the
underlying natural water-table the steeper the gradient from the canals, and the more
they will lose. The double wedge of leakage water-table shown in this figure is 1 m. high
and 2 km, wide, equal to a rectangle 4 m. high and the same width, during the period of
maximum leakage, as against our considered estimate of nearly } m. (10 cm. water is
taken as 40 cm. water-table) over the same width in the permeable soils for an average
over the whole year, so it is not unreasonable.

We are now in a position to divide the well readings on our farm into their com-
ponents. We do not pretend that this division is more than an estimation by graphic
methods, as in the two previous figures, but it seems to be a fairly close approximation
when tested against the facts observed, and, besides being informative, it is some-
what surprising. It is presented in fig. 41, based on the eight-year mean curve of
fig. 24, p. 356, which is repeated through two seasons for clearness. The rapid drop in

amplitude of the flood wave, upon which we have already commented, is still more
emphatic when thus taken out of the well-curve from Pit IIT, but meanwhile we have
largely justified this reduction of amplitude to less than a half in less than 1 km. by
