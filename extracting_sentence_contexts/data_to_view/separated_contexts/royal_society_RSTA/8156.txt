It is an honour and privilege to have been given the
opportunity of establishing these facts and proving by the resources of modern science
that Farapay is justly entitled to be regarded as the first to conduct deliberate researches
on an extensive series of ‘* Steel and Alloys.”

Tn view of the state of metallurgical knowledge at the time these specimens were
made, 1819-1824, the research taken as a whole may be considered as one of a remarkable
character and, whatever their immediate practical value, it ought never again to be
said that Farapay’s investigations in this field “ ended in nothing.”

In the light of his own fifty years of experience in the field of ferrous metallurgy,
largely concerned with alloy steels during the whole of this period, the author maintains
that the steel alloys produced by Farapay more than a century ago constituted another
proof of his genius and foresight. They remain of great interest and importance, even
to-day, and they represent a research which was certainly no failure, but rather a column

built well and firmly as far as it went and then abandoned by its builder and others for
reasons not now known, when it might eventually have been continued, as it was later
by others, to a successful issue. Failure, as judged by the lack of continued practical
application and development, lay not in Farapay’s conception and research but in
the fact that his work was not continued by others when he laid it aside. Tt must be
remembered that outside certain comparatively small requirements, steel was then but
little used, wrought iron was the material of the day. As showing this, it is doubtful
whether an appreciable quantity of steel made more than a hundred years ago could be
found to-day except in Museum and Collection specimens.
