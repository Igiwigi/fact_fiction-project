articulary surface, frequently turned upwards in an oblique direction. Two muscles arise from this projection,

e itself does not correspond in form with the condyle of the quadrate bone, being
much elongate in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the body, and, in fact, nearly
ur times as long as the opposite articular surface.

When the jaws are closed, the upper condyles rest on the hindmost part of the lower
articulary surface ; but when in action, the lower jaw can be moved backwards to a con-
8iderable extent, the condyles advancing to the front part of the joint. As the upper
.condyles are concave, moving on a longitudinal convexity of the lower surface, they
cannot escape sidewards, but press the hind part of the mandibles outwards; this again
would not be possible, if the mandibles were anchylosed at the symphysis; 80 that their
ligamentous junction finds now its explanation in the peculiar structure of the maxillary
Hints. When the jaws are at rest, the distance between the posterior extremities of
AKie mandibles is 28 millims. ; when the lower Jaw is drawn backwards, the distance is
