The work of this section can be used to calculate the distribution of * busy periods’ in a queue
with Poissonian input and exponential service-time. This problem has also been considered
by Kendall (1951), who sketches a derivation, by an entirely different method, of a formula
for fyo(t) (— W/1,(8) which agrees with (4-13). Our analysis shows the result to be valid for
all positive A, « and not only for A<4, as Kendall appears to suggest. It also confirms his
conjecture that, when A>, an infinitely long busy period is an event of positive prob-
ability; in fact this probability is

Suppose now that
A,=A>0 (n>0), fy =#>O (n>1) (4°15)

(so that Ay >0). We now have
