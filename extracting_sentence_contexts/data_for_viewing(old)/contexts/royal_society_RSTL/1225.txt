When the basis of potash is heated with gold, or Silver, or
copper, in a close. vessel of pure glass, it rapidly acts upon
them: and when the compounds are thrown into water, this
fluid is decomposed, potash formed, and the metals appear to
be separated unaltered.

The basis of potash combines with fusible metal, and forms
an alloy with it, which has a higher point of fusjon than the
fusible metal. $4

The action of the basis' of potash upon the inflammable oily
compound bodies, confirms the other facts of the strength of
its attraction for oxygene. 7

On naphtha colourless and'recently distilled, as I have al-
ready said, it has very little power of action ; but in naphtha
that has been exposed to the air it s60n oxidates, and alkali is
formed, which unites with the naphtha into a brown soap that
collects round the globule.

On the concrete oils (tallow, spermaceti, wax, for instance),
when heated, it acts slowly, coaly matter is deposited, a little
gas* is evolved, and a s0ap is formed ; but in these cages it is
