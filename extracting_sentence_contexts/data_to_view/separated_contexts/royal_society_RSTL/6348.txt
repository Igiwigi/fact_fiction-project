of the con-
sumed mineral matter. Were it not indeed that Sheep are now generally fattened when
still young and growing, the proportion of the mineral matter consumed which would
be retained during the s0-called fattening period, would probably be extremely small, In fact, it can hardly be greater, on the ayerage, than above snpposed, taking the whole
period of existence of the animal. But it is obvious, that the proportion will depend
much more on the character of the food, as to the quantitative relation of its mineral
matter to its available organic substance, than upon any other cireumstance. At any
rate, the proportion of the mineral matter consumed by either store or fattened animals,
which is sent off the farm in their bodies, is comparatively small ; and from the per-
centage indicated in the {ive-weight of the animals in the different conditions, as given in
Table VILI., the annual exhaustion of the farm from the sale of known weights of animals
is a matter of easy calculation.
