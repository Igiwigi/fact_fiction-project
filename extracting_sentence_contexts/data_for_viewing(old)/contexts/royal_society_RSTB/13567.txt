Â°Smeets [93] shows that Hurrian was spoken all across the Fertile
Crescent in the third and second millennia BC; Urartian was the
language of the powerful state Urartu, which functioned around
Lake Van between 1000 BC and 585 BC [94].

7In fact, some historical evidence of contact exists in the relevant
domain: e.g. Mongolian and Tungusic populations may have been
in contact with each other due to original geographic proximity (in
the Lake Baikal area) and to their being part of the Mongol empire
[104-106], and both Mongolian and Turkic populations had contacts
with non-Balto-Finnic Uralic speakers until recently. If these contacts

may explain some genetic and partly phonemic convergence [107],
then the question that remains is indeed which deeper source
explains the stronger syntactic similarity obtained for Finno-Ugric
and Alltaic.
