It was, therefore,
clear that death was due to respiratory failure. The phrenic nerves were tested with
the secondary current, by make-and-break shocks, and contractions of the diaphragm
were readily elicited up to 450 millims. distance of the secondary from the primary
coil. The coil was, in fact, pulled out 100 millims. beyond its usual working distance. When the electrodes were directly applied to the diaphragm the muscle responded to
make-and-break shocks up to a distance of 145 millims. of the secondary coil. The heart was beating fairly well when it was stopped by a vagal nerve stimulus
at 140 millims.
