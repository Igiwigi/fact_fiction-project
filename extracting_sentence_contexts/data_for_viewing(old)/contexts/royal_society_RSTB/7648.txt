Genus THAMBOCERAS H. Douvillé, 1916

Type species by monotypy Thamboceras mirum H. Douvillé, Bajocian, Sinai.

This genus is still as great a puzzle as when H. Douvillé described it from Gebel
Maghara 35 years ago. Attempts to fit it into Oppeliidae, Clydoniceratidae or Grapho-
ceratidae, or any other Oppeliacean or Harpoceratacean family, all seem equally
unnatural. Although Douvillé assigned it to the Amaltheidae and rightly pointed to the
resemblance of its suture-line to that of Oxynoticeras, he remarked with considerable per-
spicacity that the characters of the suture could result merely from the oxycone shape, and
that the real affinities may lie with Ermoceras, the concave venter of Thamboceras and the
carinae on either side corresponding to the ventral groove flanked by raised rib-endings in
Ermoceras. In fact, the smooth, compressed E. inerme Douvillé (1916, pl. ii, fig. 10) is so
similar to Thamboceras that Douvillé’s suggestion is the best working hypothesis yet put
forward. Oxycones of Stephanoceratacean origin are familiar enough in the Upper
Jurassic, where at times they were even dominant (e.g. Cardioceras, Amoeboceras, Quensted-
toceras), and they are known in the Lower Callovian (Chamoussetia), but except for this
neglected suggestion of H. Douvillé’s there appears to be no mention of them in the
Middle Jurassic. Another analogue for Thamboceras on this hypothesis would be the smooth,
discoidal Kosmoceras of the Jason Zone (subgenus Gulielmites), in which also there is
a tabulate venter verging on concave owing to the raised rib-endings on either side, such
as Douvillé pointed out in young Ermoceras.
