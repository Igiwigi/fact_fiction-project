of the East Indies, the coluber naja of Linnzus, in which the
ribs of the neck are shewn to be formed in a particular man-
ner; $0 that when they are raised, the skin becomes stretched
out, and puts on the appearance of a hood.

The ribs s0 employed have several peculiarities, which, I
took for granted, were confined to those of the neck, for I was
not in possession of the bodies of the snakes, and therefore
could not examine the others ; but have since found that many
of these peculiarities are not only common to all the ribs of
this snake, but to those of the whole tribe.

This fact, as it escaped my observation at that time, would
have $till done $0, had it not been for the following circum-
stances.

A coluber of unusual size, lately brought to London to be
exhibited, was shewn to Sir Joszen Banks; the animal was
lively, and moved along the carpet briskly: while it was doing
80, Sir Josepn thought he saw the ribs come forward in suc-
cession like the feet of a caterpillar. This remark he imme-
diately communicated to me, and gave me an opportunity of
seeing the snake and making my own observations,
