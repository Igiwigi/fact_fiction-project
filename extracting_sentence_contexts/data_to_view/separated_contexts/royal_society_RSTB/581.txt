Having now reached a level below the bottom of the calcarine fissure (fig. 37) there
is a great confusion of fibres, and those from the posterior part of the internal capsule
and the optic radiations of Gratioter have begun to merge with the central white
matter of the convolution which formed the inferior lip of the calcarine fissure, on the
median aspect of the occipital lobe, fig. 38, C.R. In fact here the part of the occipital lobe on the outside of the calcarine fissure and
of the lateral ventricle is merged with the part of the occipital lobe which is below
that fissure. : The fibres of the cingulum still have the appearance of being cut across, and sub-
sequently the most internal fibres of the hinder part of the internal capsule, which,
in previous sections proceeded to the extreme posterior part of the occipital convolu-
tions, now turn sharply round the lateral ventricle into the neighbourhood of the
cingulum.
