For Newton this was to a problem, since he believed in absolute space.


theory can tell if a force is real (i.e. electromagnetic, weak, strong, ...), and this feeds the theory
back into the axiomatic primitive in a circular way.” On the other hand, the notion of ‘body’, or
physical ‘object’ (on which forces act), is a seemingly innocent concept, which, however, bears its
own theoretical logical discord. Indeed, the most general notion of object—the object as a ‘bundle
of properties’—is incompatible with quantum theory, since it lacks its mereological connotation
(i.e. composability of objects to make new objects). In fact, in quantum theory it is common that
the properties of the whole are incompatible with any possible property of the parts [4,5].° To
make things worse, the same notion of ‘particle’ as a localizable entity does not survive quantum
field theory [6], and what is left of the particle concept is a purely mathematical notion: the particle
is an irreducible representation of the Poincaré a group [7]. Keeping Newtonian mechanics aside, and entering Einstein's special relativity, we encounter
physical primitives as ‘clock’ and ‘rigid rod’, apparently unharmful notions entering the theory
axiomatization ‘operationally’, but which instead are pregnant of theory, e.g. in regard of
precision of clocks pace and rods length, which are both established by a separate theory:
quantum theory!”

As an additional argument in support to a full mathematization programme of the physical
theory we have the non-accidental fact that what endures time in a theory is mainly its
mathematical component. Exemplar in such respect is group theory, which provides a perfect
case of purely mathematical formulation that is ‘physical’ in the interpretation.
