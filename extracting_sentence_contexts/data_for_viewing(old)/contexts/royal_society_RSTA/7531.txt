This must be equal to F/dé+ O(dé?). ore and using (11) and (15) we have

F} = [058 dS,+4 st (Gea —p,? 7) ') as, + a (BPS uie On — DG uf) aS;.

The second term vanishes by (7) and (9). According to (8) the last term is unchanged if
Xo is deformed in any way as long as it still encloses the singularity. Hence this term is
a constant characteristic of the singularity in an infinite medium and entirely independent
of the size and shape of the body containing it. When we let X> tend to infinity the term
vanishes if wu behaves like 7! or logy at large distances in a three-dimensional or two-
dimensional problem. For isotropy the theory of biharmonic functions shows that these
conditions are fulfilled if the stresses do in fact fall off at all with 7, as they must do if there is
not to be asingularity at infinity. It is fairly obvious that the same will be true for anisotropy.
We return to this point in §9 and meanwhile assume that the three quantities

vanish for any surface } surrounding the singularity. Manipulating the surviving integral
in F} as we did (17), we have, for example,

Ff} = imc (ul pi. —piuz,) dS,.
