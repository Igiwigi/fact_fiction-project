related to) its role in communication is not universally endorsed. The competing view argues
that symbols derive much, or even all, of their core meaning via their role in internal computations.
[76] Summarizes this distinction:

[It is useful to distinguish] (at least) two uses of symbols, their use in calculation, as in
adding a column of figures, and their use in communication, as in telling someone the
result. Symbols that are used in calculation are typically not being used at the time for
communication. ..You might invent a special notation in order to work out a certain sort of
problem. It would be quite proper to say that by a given symbol you mean so-and-so, even
though you have no intentions to use these symbols in any sort of communication [76].

The above position, that meaning is in large part a product of internal (to the mind) computation
is not fringe. In fact, it is arguably the dominant view among modern linguists and cognitive
scientists. That is not to say modern linguists and cognitive scientists deny that spoken and
written language is communicative; it obviously is. Rather, the point is that cognition (including
thinking, planning, etc) is often best modelled in terms of manipulations of meaningful symbols,
and these symbols have meaning whether or not they are attached to communication. According
to this position, the debate about whether an LLM can encode meaning does not depend on
whether it has communicative intent when it predicts the next word in a sentence, but rather
depends on the form of the internal computations that connect its inputs to its outputs.

Notably, the debate about whether meaning derives from communication versus computation
does not reduce to the debate between formal versus distributional semantics. It is true that
