and Greenwich obseryations to produce the interpolated catalogue.

TasLE IV. contains four catalogues, in which, as no systematic
difference can be traced, the instrament must be considered as
perfect within the limits of the 8mall discordances in Catalogue
I. and II.

TasLE V. contains the errors of each of the preceding cata-
logues. From this table it appears, that the regular difference
between the results with six and with two microscopes, is now
nearly insensible. This must have arisen formerly from flexure; and
the new. braces, though intended only to strengthen the attach-
ment of the telescope to the circle, have, in fact, added strength
and firmness to the whole frame of the instrument. (Vide Expe-
riments on this subject in the yolume of Observations for 1820.)

TaBLE VI. shows the difference between the results of the
Dublin and Greenwich circle, hoth at the present time, and in the
year 1812. From this it is evident that a small change has taken
place in one of the instruments. Formerly the two instruments
differed only one second in an arc of 90*; at present, the diffe-
rence amounts very exactly to double that quantity.

TapLe VII. contains the two catalogues of Dr. BrinxLEy and
Mr. BzsszL. Here the differences are much greater and more
