These relations have been shown to dif-
fer according as the body is luminous, or not ; in the one
case, the direct heat affects bodies in proportion to the dark-
ness of their colour, without regard to the texture of their
surface : in the other, the magnitude of the effect depends
solely on the absorptive texture without reference to colour. I
use the term © absorptive texture,” to signify that peculiar
state of division in the particles of the surface, which has
been shown, by Professor LEsLIE and others to be most sus-
ceptible of the influence of simple radiant heat, and always
to give a proportionally greater radiating power. The question then is entirely one of facts ; and involyes no
hypothesis as to the nature either of light or of heat. The
object is simply to ascertain by experiment, whether, of the
total heating effect radiated from a luminous hot body, the
portion intercepted by a transparent screen is of the same
nature as, or different from the part transmitted in its rela-
tions to the surfaces on which it acts.

(6.) In conformity with this view of the object proposed,


190 Mr. PowtLL's experimental enquiry into the nature of

the general principle. of the following experiments is this:
taking different luminous hot bodies, to expose to their influ-
ence two thermometers presenting, one, a 8mooth black sur-
face, the other an absorptive white one: thus obtaining the
ratio of the total direct effect on the two, we may; compare it
with the ratio similarly observed, when a transparent screen
is interposed.

(7.) This principle of experimenting was applied with one
or two variations : and though in the abstract sufficiently
simple, it will in practice require an attention to several con-
siderations.
