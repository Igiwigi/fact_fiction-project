For this immediate purpose it will only be necessary to
apply the test to two lines, the general question being postponed for the present. In the first attempt at arranging the D,, series the strong lines (8) 20559°08 and
(10) 88366°36 were taken for m= 1, 2, and the formula calculated with the limit
D(*%)=8(). As will be seen immediately, this gave satisfactory agreement with
sounded observed lines up to m= 15; and as a matter of fact this series was used ‘to
test for the parallel sets displaced (+2d,)S() on either side of it. Now the formula
constants for a set only vary slightly if the wave-number of the line chosen for m = 1
is changed considerably. This therefore did not prove definitely that 20559 is the
correct Dj, (1), and as a fact it does not satisfy the multiple test.
