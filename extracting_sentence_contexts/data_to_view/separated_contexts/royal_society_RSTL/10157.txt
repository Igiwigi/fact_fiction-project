B. WILSON ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENILLA.

variations in the distribution of the dentoplagm. As shown in figs. 55-57 certain
spheres may be slower in their development than others, so that their descendants
are larger, a fact long since observed by ALLMAN in Hydroid eggs. This is probably
caused by the presence of a larger amount of deutoplasm than common, though poxsibly
to the tardy division of the nuclei, In the forms of © partial ” segmentation shown in
figs. 59-67, the large unsegmented mass must contain a number of fully formed
nuclei, since it breaks up almost at once into several s8pheres. Hence the delay is
caused, apparently, by some obstacle in the vitellus, which we may suppose to be an
especially great amount of dentoplasm in one half of the egg, as is normally the
case in the entodermic pole of an epibolic gastrula.
