I begin by examining the gestures that hearing children pro-
duce in the process of learning spoken language. At a time in
development when children are limited in the words they
know and use, gesture offers a way for them to extend their
communicative range. Children typically begin to gesture
between eight and 12 months [9,10], first producing deictic
gestures (pointing at objects, people and places in the
immediate environment, or holding up objects to draw atten-
tion to them), and later at around 26 months [11] producing
iconic gestures that capture aspects of the objects, action or
attributes they represent (e.g. flapping arms to refer to a
bird or to flying [12]). The fact that gesture allows children
to communicate meanings that they do not yet express in
speech opens up the possibility that gesturing itself facilitates
language learning. If so, changes in gesture should not only
predate, but they should also predict, changes in language.
And they do, both for words and for sentences (table 1).
