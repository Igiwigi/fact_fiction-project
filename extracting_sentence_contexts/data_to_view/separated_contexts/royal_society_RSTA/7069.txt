The most likely point of difference
between samples, which behave so differently to thermal activation, is in the geometrical
location of individual centres of chemical activity. It may be suggested that, in the powder,
various crystallites are decomposing at more or less steady rates, once their decomposition
has begun. In the case of samples of lead azide which fail to detonate, the fact that chemical
decomposition has occurred can be clearly detected under the microscope by the blackening
of the crystals, produced by the heating process. Detonation will not occur, apparently,

unless the energy liberated by chemical action within any given volume is sufficient to
build up a detonation wave. If this view is justified, then dilution of an initiator with inert
material, which decreases the amount of energy available in any specified volume, should
appreciably modify the above limits of temperature for 100 and 0°% ignitions.

(3) The dilution of initiators with inert materials

(a) Constant bulk of composition

Owing to its use in certain compositions, powdered glass was used as diluent, to diminish
co-operative action between the crystals of an initiator.
