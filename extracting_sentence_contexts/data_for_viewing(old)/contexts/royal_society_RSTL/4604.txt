In the molar teeth of Lepus aquaticus (Bacuw.) and Lepus sylvaticus (Bacuv.), I
find no characteristic differences in the dental tissxue by which they could be distin-
guished from each other, or from the teeth of either of the preceding species of
Hares.

Before leaving the snbject of Hares' teeth, I should Â«tate that occasionally fine
supplemental enamel fibres may be seen crossing the course of the ordinary ones at
a right angle. They do net exceed the 15,000th of an inch in diameter, and are not
constantly present ; indeed I have only seen them near the basal half of the tooth,
where the enamel is not perfectly hardened.

The facts which are recorded in the foregoing pages have been gathered from

careful and repeated observations made upon upwards of 350 sections, cut from
the teeth of various members of the order Rodentia. When a donbt as to the
nature of a tissue has arisen, I have made numerous sections from different parts,
and in different directions of the same tooth. In some instances I have made as
many as twenty-five from the teeth of one species; and have seldom contented
myself with less than three sections.
