existence and is not due to chance, as I am very doubtful how far the theory of
chance in its present form can be applied to the course of epidemics. These
amplitudes are expressed as proportions per thousand of the mean value, above and
below which the variation takes place. That is, if the curve be expressed by
y =a+bsinw, the amplitude is given by 1000b/a. The diagram begins with a
period of 25 weeks. The first point to catch the eye of the observer is the existence
of a very notable amplitude in the centre of the diagram. This occurs corresponding
to a period of 1°865 years, or 97 weeks. The amplitude, in the measure indicated
above, is 413. This amplitude far exceeds—in fact, is double the value of—the
amplitude given by any other period except those in the nearest vicinity, namely,
those for 96 and 98 weeks, Had the 97-week period not varied during the
75 years in question, such high amplitudes would not have been observed, but the
magnitude of the variation is no greater than might be expected in a biological
phenomenon of this kind. The next point to be noted is the extent to which the
numbers of deaths from measles are affected by the solar year. Amplitudes of
approximately 200 are found both for the yearly and half-yearly periods. This does
not necessarily mean a double period. It might equally easily mean that a single
harmonic was not capable of expressing the effect of the climatic influence, though
the average values through the course of the solar year of many meteorological
phenomena such as temperature can be closely represented by one harmonic term.
