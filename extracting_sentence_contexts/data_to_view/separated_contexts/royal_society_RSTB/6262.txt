25, Plate 18, and gu, figs. 28 and 29, Plate
19, cannot conclusively be regarded as the pro-secretion phases of calcium secretion
in the uterus. In fact, sections from material fixed in alcohol-formalin and Zenker-
formol may be placed in nitric, hydrochloric, and acetic acids, without the slightest
alteration in the subsequent staining of the granules with iron hematoxylin. The
appearance of the granules and, indeed, their reactions to acids are more consistent
with the assumption that they are the shell matrix secretion. The quiescent state
of the basal cells during secretion, leads to the conviction that the uterine epithelium,
as a whole, does not take any part in calcification.
