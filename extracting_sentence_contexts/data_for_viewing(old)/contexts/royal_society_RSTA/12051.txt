portional amount required was not great. If the density of the supposed gas were
double that of nitrogen, one-half per cent. only by volume would be needed ; or, if the
density were but half as much again as that of nitrogen, then one per cent. would
still suffice. But in accepting this explanation, even provisionally, we had to face the
improbability that a gas surrounding us on all sides, and present in enormous
quantities, could have remained so long unsuspected.

The method of most universal application by which to test whether a gas is pure or
a mixture of components of different densities is that of diffusion, By this means
GRAHAM succeeded in effecting a partial separation of the nitrogen and oxygen of the
air, in spite of the comparatively small difference of densities. If the atmosphere
contain an unknown gas of anything like the density supposed, it should be possible
to prove the fact by operations conducted upon air which had undergone atmolysis.
Tf; for example, the parts least disposed to penetrate porous walls were retained, the
“9 nitrogen ” derived from it by the usual processes should be heavier than that
derived in like manner from unprepared air. This experiment, although in view from
the first, was not executed until a later stage of the inquiry (§ 6), when results were
