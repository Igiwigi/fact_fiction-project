THE FIBRES OF THE POSTERIOR ROOTS OF SOME SPINAL NERVES. 687

<periments on certain roots, especially root VI, it became evident that in this way
fairly constant figure was arrived at for the same root, subject to comparatively
ainor variations ; it also became evident that the root distribution was such that in
der to isolate one root-territory, in some cases so many as seven consecutive pos-
erior roots above or below had to be severed. Some time and labour was wasted by
ny not recognizing this fact early enough, and its explanation will be dealt with after
elating the experiments in which it occurred.

Regarding the form of stimulus used, the skin was pinched with a fine pointed
pair of dissecting forceps, and sometimes a mere touch sufficed to elicit a reflex; at
ther times, especially near the edge of the root territory, a hard pinch had to be
mployed. At first I attempted to keep a record of the areas obtained by trans-
rring them to “ proportional paper” as in mapping from the microscope by means of
e movable stage and squared eye-piece : difference of size and proportion, between
dividual and individual frustrated this attempt, the maps becoming too confusing
from necessary absence of perspective and inability to follow accurately the two
superficial dimensions of a very irregular solid figure. I then proposed to content
myself with accurate measurements from comparatively fixed points and written
