This made probability irreducible,


defined by quantum causality as probabilistic causality, and correlatively the arrow of events. QM,
nevertheless, found a way to use very abstract mathematics, such as that of Hilbert spaces over C,
to enable probabilistic predictions strictly in accord with what is experimentally observed, thus
still enabling QM and then QFT to remain mathematical-experimental sciences, with mathematics
playing an even greater role in them. It is, however, rarely, if ever, noticed that the Galilean reduction is twofold, in fact threefold,
because the mathematical-experimental nature of modern physics is already predicated on the
double reduction. The first is defined by only dealing strictly with physical (rather than also
mental) reality; and the second is defined by a mathematical idealization of natural processes,
which requires disregarding those aspects of nature that cannot be mathematically idealized. There is, however, a third reduction.
