The cells are smaller than those of the nucleus septi lateralis
(n.s.l., figs. 28 and 29). â€˜This latter nucleus lies in the dorso-lateral region of the septum,
ventral to the hippocampus and dorsal to the septal portion of the nucleus accumbens. The cells are larger than those of the medial septal nucleus but not as large as those of
thenucleusaccumbens. The fact that the lateral nucleus is the origin for a portion of the
medial forebrain bundle suggests a plausible reason for its cells being larger than those
of the medial nucleus. MARION HINES ON THE BRAIN OF ORNITHORHYNCHUS ANATINUS. 209

The nucleus preopticus (n.p.o., figs. 37 and 38) is made up of several rows of cells
surrounding the ventral part of the third ventricle about two millimeters cephalward of
the optic chiasma. There is no definite arrangement of the small round and slightly
elliptical-shaped cells.
