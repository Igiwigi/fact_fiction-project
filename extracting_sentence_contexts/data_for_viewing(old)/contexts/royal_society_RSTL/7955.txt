between the two plants that sorely tempt a botanist to do 80. But before attempting
to determine the question, we must ascertain what are the several points of resemblance
and of difference.

Different botanists have defined the Equisetacew in yarious ways; but most of these
definitions of the family include two things: 1st, a sheath to each joint of the stem ;
and 2nd, hygrometric elaters attached to each spore. That the former of these has no
existence in Calamites is universally admitted*. The plant figured in M. BroxnGx1ant's
great work under the name of Calamites radiatusf, exhibits what that distinguished
botanist regarded as a true sheath. But I recently examined the specimen which is, or
was, in the Strasburg Museum, and I satisfied myself that the supposed sheath is a mere
yerticil of leayes; a conclusion in which its eminent custodian, Professor ScuneeR, fully
agreed with me. Consequently the fact must be admitted, that one of the universally
existent features of recent Equisetaceous plants does not appear in the fossil Calamites.

In his description of his Volkmannia Binneyii Mr. CarrRUTHERS announces the dis-
covery of spores with attached elaters, and on the strength of this supposed fact he
further rests his conclusion that the Calamites are Equisetacee. But to this I enter-
tain two objections. I have not seen Mr. CARRUTHERS's specimen, but I have made 8ec-
tions of and examined a considerable number of strobili of the same species; and though
I find spores in abundance, I have failed to detect a solitary example furnished with ela-
ters. T think the evidence for a conclusion, 80 scientifically important as that to which
the recognition of elaters would lead us, must be very clear and decisive before we ac-
cept it; and if we find one solitary example which may possibly be interpreted as bearing
such organs and a large number of others, of the same species, in which no snch organs
