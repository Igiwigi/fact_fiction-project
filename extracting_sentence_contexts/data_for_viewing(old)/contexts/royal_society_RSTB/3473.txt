very obvious in the immature ground tissue of most of the female peduncles
examined, and are generally found to represent the reduced continuation of inversely
orientated bundles.

In many cases when a pair of bundles are found with their xylems directed
towards one another (p. 194, Dia. VI) the mass of lignified elements between them
contains some tracheides ; I am inclined to think that these elements must be here
regarded as the homologue of the centripetal xylem seen in connection with the
cotyledon bundles, and that they may be compared with the centripetal xylem found
in Cycadean peduncles.{ WorspE.,ยง however, regards the groups of lignified
elements throughout the peduncles, and possibly also the whole of the lignified pith,
as representing tissue which was originally xylem. The gradual transition found
between the elements of the pith and those of the centripetal xylem is a fact which
supports this suggestion; but I am inclined to think that the development of
lignified elements in the ground tissue of both peduncles, as well as those found
