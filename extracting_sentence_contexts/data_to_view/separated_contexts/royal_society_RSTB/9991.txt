For if those local connec-
tions bring about CP by creating correlated activity between
neurons that are truly in the read-out pool and additional neur-
ons outside the pool, then a static set of connectivity would seem
to predict that the local correlations (and hence CP) should not
change with firing rate. The source of the elevation in firing
rate that is the ‘choice signal’ may be bottom-up noise [17] or
top-down feedback, related perhaps to attentional or reward
signals [48-51]. We were able to disentangle neuronal firing rate, neurometric
threshold and CP over a wider range of stimulus preferences than
previously suggested [28], because we exploited the fact that

Figure 5. For the analysis of the time course of choice signals, we used
Neurons and cylinder configurations with a significant CP (permutation test,
p < 0.05; cylinder optimally aligned to preferred motion direction: n = 23;
sub-optimal dot motion: n = 15). (a) Instantaneous CP was calculated for
each time point using data from a window with 41.7 ms duration. The timing
and emergence of the CP signal did not differ when stimuli were less well
matched to RFs and induced lower firing rates. (b) Same data as in (a), but
CP was accumulated over the trial.
