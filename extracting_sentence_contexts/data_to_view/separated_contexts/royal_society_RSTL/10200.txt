798 LORD RAYLEIGH ON THE CLARK CELL AS

** Mercury alloyed with any number of metals takes the place in the scale of E.
of the most electro-positive metal it may contain, if the amount of the electro-positi
metal present is not less than about 75549009 in weight of the mercury,”
$ 55. In order to obtain any stability of E.M.F. in these cells, it 8eems to
necessary that the mercury should either be alloyed with a sensible, though
relatively very small, portion of zinc, or else protected with mercurous sulp|
With pure mercury without paste nob only is the E.M.F. variable from hour to
but it can scarcely be said to be definite even at a particular time--that is, it
be altered by the passage of a very small quantity of electricity, 8nch as 8
have no effect whatever upon a properly constibuted cell. Sometimes when the
galvanometer contact was made, a throw of the needle was observed, not followed
by any corresponding permanent deflection, the cell in fact behaving like a charged
condenser. '

In the absence of paste a very 8mall addition of zine to mercury gives it a
definite and tolerably permanent character. If, however, there be any mereurons
sulphate, even though originally in another leg of an H-cell, the mercury is gradually
repurified. To this cause is to be attributed the gradual fall to zero of the E.M.F.
of the cells (F) and (G) above considered.
