Consequently, the “ Ursegmente” assumed a third meaning, hitherto
undefined.

x Lastly, whilst Mrvor considers myotome as equivalent to protovertebra, MarsHaLL

ged myotome as synonymous with muscle segment in the adult, consequently, as

@fferent from muscle plate.

§ Although most authors are probably aware of the degree of imperfect correspond-

ice of the technical terms as used by them, with those of other authors, this does

got necessarily apply to their readers unless they have, perhaps, spent a considerable

#nount of labour in trying to arrive at the exact equivalent of the various terms. To

Witigate the prevailing uncertainty, I make the following suggestions :—

spThe term Myotome is to be restricted to the whole remainder of the protovertebra

ter the skeletogenous cells have been given off for the production of the Sklerotomes.

5 The sum total of the Sklerotomes makes up the Skeletogenous Layer. The ending tome to indicate the primary, or earlier, less differentiated,

3 the ending mere to signify the final condition or product.

4 Hence, each Myotome produces (1) one Myomere, cr segment, of the general mass

@ trunk muscles; (2) Cutis (out of the “aeussere Lage,” or Rindenschicht,

Borer, p. 208).

= Of Sklerotomes, there are two to each protovertebra, namely, a ventral and a

@rsal Sklerotome ; two Sklerotomes combine to form one Skleromere, i.e., a vertebra

D the widest sense, in fact, a skeletal trunk segment.

3 The sum total of the Sklerotomes forms the so-called membranous vertebral column,

extending upwards and downwards as the “ Membrana reuniens” of Rercuert, and
twards in the shape of the intermuscular septa. The ventral sklerotomes correspond exactly with the sklerotomes of vAaN WHE

and Rast. The dorsal sklerotomes have hitherto been neglected.
