But if we interpret this in terms of p, we obtain

Pp (1p? Fame = p**(1—p)-* dp,

a result inconsistent with that obtained previously. In fact, the distribution previously

assumed for p was equivalent to assuming the special distribution for 0,

af = cos 10,

the arbitrariness of which is fully apparent when we use any variable other than p. In a less obtrusive form the same species of arbitrary assumption underlies the method

known as that of inverse probability. Thus, if the same observed result A might be
the consequence of one or other of two hypothetical conditions X and Y, it is assumed
that the probabilities of X and Y are in the same ratioas the probabilities of A occurring
on the two assumptions, X is true, Y is true.
