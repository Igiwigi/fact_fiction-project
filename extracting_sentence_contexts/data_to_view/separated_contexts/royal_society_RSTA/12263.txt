Professor Ewine (‘Phil. Mag.,’* V., vol. 30 [1890], p. 205), has given a theory
which adapts itself to dynamical methods such as the present. In his theory the
phenomena of hysteresis depend upon the fact that groups of molecules can have
various stable configurations, different groups at any instant having very different
degrees of stability. The stability of a group is liable by variation of H and W to
break down, so that the group takes up another configuration of greater or less
stability, and the oscillations which necessarily ensue on the change result to our
senses in the production of heat. On this view hysteresis is a phenomenon that
prevents us, if we would take full account of the facts, from ignoring certain coordi-
nates we have hitherto ignored.
