INTRODUCTION.

The literature of reptilian colour change extends over twenty three centuries, and
yet our knowledge of the physiological processes which govern it, and of the environ-
mental factors which bring it about, is to-day far less complete than for the other two
groups of vertebrates which possess pigmentary effectors. The cause of this, it would
seem, resides in the fact that the colour changing reptiles inhabit pre-eminently the
tropical and subtropical regions of the globe, and are not readily available for physio-
logical investigation in the main centres of scientific progress. The history of this
subject is peculiar. From Aristotle to the end of the nineteenth century the literature
deals almost exclusively with the chameleon, an animal which for centuries has excited
the curiosity of travellers in North Africa, and which, in consequence, has acquired
a popular reputation that is quite remarkable. Thus the hundred pages which Fucus
(1914) devoted to reptilian colour response contain far more references to chameleons
than to all other reptiles taken together. In the present century, with the single
exception of the work of HocBen and Mirvisu (1928) from this laboratory, no further
investigations on the chameleon have been published. Our knowledge of colour
change in reptiles has progressed chiefly through the work of Professor G. H. PARKER
and his many associates. In the New World chameleons do not exist, and conse-
