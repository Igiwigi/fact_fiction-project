Also shown in figure 1a are the seven spatial frequency components in the illumination
intensity pattern plotted again relative to the objective pupil. It can be seen here that when the
illuminating beams are positioned at the edge of the pupil (the coherent cut-off) then the spatial
frequency is only at a factor of /3 larger than the coherent cut-off. Combined with the fact that
the incoherent cut-off spatial frequency seen when imaging the light back through the objective is
twice the coherent one, this is what results in a limit of 1 + 3/2 = 1.87 improvement in resolution
in epi-illumination. Unmixing the seven spatial frequency components generated by this type of illumination
pattern requires only seven raw images illuminated with seven appropriately phase-shifted
patterns (see electronic supplementary material, S1 for a detailed mathematical description), two

fewer than the nine raw images required by conventional 2D-SIM, making it attractive for high-
speed imaging.
