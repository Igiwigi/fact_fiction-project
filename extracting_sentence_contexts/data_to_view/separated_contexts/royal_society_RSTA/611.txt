The work we report on
here is part of the InK project. In the low-temperature region, reliable thermometry is still a demanding task even though : =
a great variety of thermometers are available for temperature measurements. This is caused by : yy
the fact that most of the thermometers exhibit nonlinear characteristics, are prone to external 2
influences and instabilities and may lose thermal contact with the object being measured with aes
decreasing temperature. 22

In the history of international temperature scales, which started in 1887 when the first : 8
international temperature scale was adopted by the Comit√© International des Poids et Mesures DN
(CIPM), only four different truly low-temperature scales were adopted, namely the 1958 +He : g
and 1962 *He vapour-pressure scales [5,6], the 1976 Provisional 0.5K to 30K Temperature : &

Scale (EPT-76) [7] and the PLTS-2000 [2]. The ITS-90 is basically identical to the EPT-76 in the
temperature range between 0.65 K and 5 K as it is based on the same experimental dataset for the
helium vapour pressure but is represented in a different mathematical form. The PLTS-2000 [2], which was adopted by the CIPM in 2000, is defined by a polynomial
relating the melting pressure of 7He to temperature.
