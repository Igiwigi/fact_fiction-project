space. We may compare the two states of the gas, as it would exist free with these
two different volumes, and then suppose that by an ideal process the fluid environ-
ment of the molecules is directly brought about in each case: that process will, as
regards change of intimate molecular configuration, be essentially the same for both
states of the gas, therefore the change of free energy due to the dilution of the solu-
tion is simply that which corresponds to the free gaseous expansion of the dissolved
gas.* This conclusion carries with it, by the thermodynamic principle of free or
available energy, a theoretical proof of vanâ€™t Horr's generalization that the osmotic
pressure of a very dilute solution is equal to the gaseous pressure of the dissolved
molecules when they are supposed to occupy the same volume in the gaseous state.
The extension of this proof to dissolved liquids and solids, which form the practically
important case, is at first sight barred (unless it is formulated as in the footnote) by
the fact that we cannot then actually have the molecules existing free at the same
volume as they occupy in the dilute solution. But when the ANDREws isothermal
for the dissolved substance is made into a continuous curve by inserting a super-
saturated wavy part, there will always be a real point on it corresponding to the
volume occupied by the substance thus existing in a homogeneous condition, and also
a corresponding pressure which at the small density under consideration would prac-
tically be that of the gaseous state: thus there would be no difficulty in the exten-
sion to dissolved solids and liquids, were it not that this point on the isothermal
might be on the thoroughly unstable reach, along which rise of density corresponds
to fall of pressure, so that any slight accidental inequality of density would be spon-
taneously increased. The successful use made of the ANDREWS diagram for numerical
calculation of the properties of substances by Van per WAALS shows however that
its physical reality is not destroyed by this instability : and when it is remembered
