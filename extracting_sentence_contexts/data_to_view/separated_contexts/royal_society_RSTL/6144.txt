This decomposition may be due to the immediate action
of the discharge; or the deutoxide of nitrogen may, in the first instance, be resolyed
into equal volumes of nitrogen and oxygen, the latter combining as it is formed with
undecomposed deutoxide. Carbonic Oxide has given results of great interest, the investigation of which has already
occupied a considerable time, although it is not yet completed. The principal facts
have, however, been already ascertained, and as they present some remarkable analogies
to those already described in the case of oxygen, we shall briefly allude to them here,
reserving the complete investigation for a future communication. The carbonic oxide was prepared by heating oxalic acid with an excess of sulphuric
acid, and absorbing the carbonic acid by means of a strong solution of hydrate of potash. The gas, as it escaped from the end of the apparatus, did not produce the slightest
turbidity im lime or baryta water, and was completely absorbed by an ammoniacal solu-
tion of the subchloride of copper.
