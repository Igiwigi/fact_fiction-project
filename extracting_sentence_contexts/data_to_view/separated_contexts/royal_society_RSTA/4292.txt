Compared with other optical methods, such as total
radiation thermometry, it has the advantage of requiring relative intensity measurements of the
electromagnetic radiation. It has been shown how the method could fully exploit the mature technology of laser
frequency control and measurement, either in the near- or in the mid-infrared regions. In
fact, the DBT methodology has recently benefited from the extremely small uncertainties in
building an absolute frequency scale underneath an absorption spectrum. In this respect, two
main approaches have been described: one of the them is based upon the technology of optical
frequency comb synthesizers, the other one makes use of a reference oscillator that is stabilized
against a Doppler-free molecular absorption line. Such a reference oscillator can be based upon
an ECDL, a CO} laser or a QCL, as recently demonstrated [79].
