At present the mandibular pier has two points of fusion wibh the trabecula ; the
hinder of them is the pedicle (pd.), and the front one the palato-pterygoid bar (p.pg.) ;
the pedicle will be largely absorbed, and the palato-pterygoid enormously developed
during the metamorphosis of the Tadpole.

Before passing to the description of the well-developed Tadpole, I must refer again
to the intermediate stages (ibid., Plate 55, figs. 3, 4, 5).

On its way to the coronoid region of the mandible, the temporal muscle passes over
the palato-pterygoid bar, and under a leafy growth of the *suspensorium®—the *orbitar
process ” (or.p.). In Bufo vulgaris the apex of this leaf coalesces with the ethmoidal
cartilage, a rare character, This fact, and its nonconformity with what is seen in the
Tadpole of the Frog, were pointed out to me by Professor Huxuey five or six years ago.

In other species (even of Bufo) I do not find this very peculiar condition of things,
but the process itself is well developed, even in the wide-mouthed laryw of the
** Aglossa ” (ibid., Plates 56-61).

In the half-grown larve figured in my paper (ibid., Plate 55, figs. 4, 5, 5«), we 8ee
the formation of the * fenestra ovalis” as an oblique lateral cleft in the auditory
capsule ; and of the © stapes ” as the solidification of the soft tissne left in this space.
In larve three-fourths grown ossification begins in the tissxue over and under the
chondrocranium.
