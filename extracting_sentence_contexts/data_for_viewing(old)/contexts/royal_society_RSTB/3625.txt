are to be regarded only as a supporting substance (Stiitzgeriist), and not as essen-
tially nervous, the nervous function being, presumably, fulfilled by the homogeneous
liquid hyaloplasm.

Although it is not my intention to give an account of the giant fibres in Crustacea,
the work of ALLEN (1894, pp. 466, 467) deserves special notice in this connection.
He was able to show, by means of methylene blue preparations, that in the
embryonic lobster there are on the ventral surface of the brain two (a pair) large cells,
from each of which a moderately thick fibre arises, crosses to the opposite side, and
leaves the brain by the cesophageal connective. On entering the first thoracic ganglion
these two fibres become very broad, having a diameter many times greater than that
of any other fibre in the body; they are, in fact, the giant fibres. They run the
whole length of the nerve cord to the last (sixth abdominal) ganglion, in which they
divide into several branches.* These giant fibres give off a few branches to the
neuropile of the brain, especially at the angles of decussation, but there are no
collateral branches along their course down the nerve cord; the fibres end, as already

“stated, in branches in the last ganglion. As ALLEN pointed out, they serve the
purpose of putting some organ at the posterior end of the abdomen into direct
connection with the brain.

ApAray’s classical memoir (1897) contains important information on the subject of
giant fibres. The neurochords of Lumbricus are described as containing thin (with
sometimes one or two thicker) wavy neurofibrillz, some of which here and there are
