tenance of balance, and are possibly connected in a way with the muscles.

The direct cerebellar tract ends above in the restiform body which goes to the
cerebellum. According to BecuTEREw, this has nothing to do with touch, nor has the
posterior median column, which is supposed, however, by some authorities to be con-
nected with the muscular sense. We have then only one other long tract, which
degenerates right up the cord, which can convey other sensations, such as touch, heat
and cold, and painful sensations. This is the antero-lateral; it degenerates on the
same side above a hemisection. In my opinion no sufficient evidence has been
brought forward by Gowers for his views with regard to the origin of this tract from
fibres coming from the opposite side of the cord; nor by Epinaer for his view that these
fibres come from cells of the posterior horn of the opposite side, the nerve processes of
which decussate over in the anterior commissure. In fact, like the fibres of the direct
cerebellar tract, they appear to me to come from cells of the same side. The experi-
ments of Gorcu and Horstry support this view. The electrical reaction of the lateral
column of the same side on stimulation of a posterior root is four times that of the
