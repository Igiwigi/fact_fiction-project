over the sea at 750 metres, cannot be explained in a similar way. No other single
suggestion is more fortunate. But the fact that the Ben Nevisâ€”Fort William
average gradient in July and August, though it agrees with the kite gradient of the
United States Weather Bureau, exceeds the Berlin balloon gradient and the average
mountain gradient, points to an explanation depending on some differences of effect
of a high level station in that position as compared with a layer of free air at the
same height.

It will be noticed, on comparing the readings of temperature at Fort William
(Table C) with the initial temperature of the kite ascents (Plate 12), that there is no
corresponding difference between the sea-level temperatures at the two positions.

There is another fact which supports the idea that the Ben Nevis temperatures are
below those of the free air at the same altitude. The level at which the kites

entered the clouds was invariably higher than the level at which the clouds lay upon
the mountains. The Paps of Jura, some 2500 feet (760 metres) high, were often
covered with clouds at times when the kites did not reach the cloud level under
4000 feet (1220 metres), and the same rule held for lower altitudes. If, then, the
lower cloud surface over a limited district be considered as approximately coinciding
with an isothermal surface, and this does not seem improbable, it follows that
mountain temperatures are lower than those of the free air; at least this was the case
