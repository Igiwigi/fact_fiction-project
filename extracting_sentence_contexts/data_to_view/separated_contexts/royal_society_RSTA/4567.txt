Recognizing the importance
of such scale, Kajiura [34] suggested several means of estimating the tsunami energy in 1981. However, he concluded that the direct tsunami measurements (only tide gauges at the time) were
not adequate to estimate tsunami energy in a post-event mode, let alone in a real-time mode. The seismic source parametersâ€™ uncertainties and the fact that only a small fraction (around 0.1%)
of the energy released from an earthquake is transferred into the ocean to generate a tsunami
[28] make the seismic magnitude too crude an estimate for the tsunami energy. Kajiura [34]
estimated a factor of 2-3 to be the best accuracy possible with tide gauge and seismic data,
which made the energy scale impractical at the time. While seismic analysis of an earthquake has
improved since 1981, the factor of 2 accuracy for the earthquake parameters is still the limiting
factor for the tsunami energy estimates, especially in the real-time tsunami warning situation.
