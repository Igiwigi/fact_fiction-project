habitants of different districts are distinguished ; to the description and in-
fluence of their food ; to the maladies most prevalent among them ; and the
effect of their occupations, in producing, or modifying disease. These inquiries
would lead to the knowledge of many important facts, which would not only
be useful in throwing light on the nature of yarious obscure complaints, and
in particular of those of a calculous description, but would have an extensive
and advantageous bearing on general pathology.

I have alluded to a probable connection in towns, between the scrophulous,
and the calculous diathesis ; and in the Norfolk district, there is unquestion-
ably a great disposition to every form of scrophula, from a slight enlargement
of a submaxillary gland, to the severest states of articular, or pulmonary dis-
ease. Whether, however, the disposition is greater than in other counties :
and how far, in this case, it may be connected with the calculous character of
the district ; future observations must determine.
