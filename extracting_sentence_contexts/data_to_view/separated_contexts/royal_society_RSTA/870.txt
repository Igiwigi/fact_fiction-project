The expansion is an infinite series in both x and y. The terms +’ 9°
where s > r do not really concern us, as the seminvariants, with which only we are
concerned, never have the third weight greater than the second. In fact, the
generating function proper is the part called above

Consider the expression of the perpetuant as a symbolical product, it essentially
contains two kinds of factors (abu), (abc) ; then the index of x in the generating
function is the number of factors (abu), and the index of z is the number of factors
(abe). When 6 = 2,

G, a ery

giving the obviously correct result.
