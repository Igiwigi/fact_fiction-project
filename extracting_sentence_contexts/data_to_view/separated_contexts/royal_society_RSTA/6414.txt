Accordingly, the formal time reversibility of these equations, sometimes used to argue against
the arrow of time (the arrow of events is, again, rarely considered), has no physical significance.
(Technically, to maintain the formal reversibility of the equations of QM and QFT with respect to
t requires replacing variables by their complex conjugates, reflecting the mathematical structure
of QM as different from classical physics or relativity.) Rigorously speaking, what is reversible

°}. Barbour adjusted his view on this point in his more recent work, in principle allowing for the arrow of time (he does
consider the arrow of events), in connection with thermodynamics, within, however, a realist framework [20].


in them is not time, but the value of the parameter f in these equations. f is connected to
measurements, which respect the arrow of events, defined the ‘the irreversibility of recordings’
invoked by Bohr, in the double sense—from a quantum phenomenon to the ultimate reality
defining them and that of the later to an earlier phenomenon in any sequence, in which case
the arrow of event, in time, or time, is manifested in our readings of the clocks [6] (v. 3, p. 5). It might be added that symmetry considerations are crucial in considering and in fact requiring
the arrow of events in QFT, as it is currently constituted. Using for the moment the standard
language of time rather than events, time-reversal symmetry is prohibited insofar as quantum
theory holds, in view of the CPT (charge, parity and time reversal) symmetry, a fundamental
symmetry of physical laws under the simultaneous transformation of charge conjugation (C),
parity transformation (P) and time reversal (T). CPT is the only combination of C, P and T
observed to be exact symmetry of the ultimate constitution of nature, assuming that QFT holds.
