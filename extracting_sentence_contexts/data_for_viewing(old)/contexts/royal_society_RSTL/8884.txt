arranged for the heat to act on its side than on its end.” I tried many experiments on
the circumstances governing the position of the neutral point during exhaustion, and I
proved that, within experimental limits, the nearer the vacuum approached perfection
the stronger was the movement due to radiation.

In Part II. I described many improved forms of apparatus by which the move-
ments due to radiation could be studied in a more complete manner and numerical
results be obtained ; the action of the various kinds of radiation, from the obscure heat-
rays emitted by copper at 100* C. to the blue and ultra-violet rays of the spectrum, was
examined, the interference caused by passing the rays through various screens was
shown, and the phenomena of the neutral point were further discussed. Experiments
were described which satisfied me that the hypothesis of the movements being due to
evaporation and condensation at the surface would not account for all the facts of the
case ; and ample proof was afforded that © to get the greatest delicacy in these apparatus
there is required large surface with a minimum of weight,” an apparatus for the quan-
titative examination of this law being described.
