Pure atmospheric air, of 5 inches tension, does not
effect an absorption equivalent to more than the one-fifth of a degree, while nitrous
oxide of the same tension effects an absorption equivalent to fifty-one such degrees. Hence the absorption by nitrous oxide at this tension is about 250 times that of air. No fact in chemistry carries the same conviction to my mind that air is a mixture and
not a compound, as that just cited. In like manner, the absorption by carbonic oxide of
this tension is nearly 100 times that of oxygen alone; the absorption by carbonic acid
is about 150 times that of oxygen; while the absorption by olefiant gas of this tension
is 1000 times that of its constituent hydrogen. Even the enormous action last men-
tioned is surpassed by the vapours of many of the volatile liquids, in which the atomic
groups are known to attain their highest degree of complexity.
