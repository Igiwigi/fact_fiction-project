Busse & Sandham [54] reported similar results, but graphed their data according to a neutral
curve in (Ax, Az) space (figure 5dâ€”h). Along this curve, there was no net change in drag, as the
deleterious effects of spanwise slip were cancelled exactly by the benefits of streamwise slip. In
their analysis for Ad =Ax/dy greater than 5 (i.e. to the right of the neutral curve in figure 5d),
drag reduction was always observed. They found that spanwise fluctuations in the turbulent
statistics were limited by the peak value of the corresponding profile. Thus, the drag increase
caused by spanwise slip was found to plateau. In contrast, the streamwise slip always reduces
the intensity of turbulent fluctuations, and thus frictional drag steadily decreased with increasing
Az. In fact, they predicted that drag reduction would always be observed when A; > 5, regardless
of the magnitude of at. Jelly et al. [53] reported similar findings with their DNS results (figure 5c).
In their work, the authors showed that the Reynolds stresses differed over the regions of slip
and no slip. In fact, they found that over 70% of the skin friction on the no-slip regions (solid
surface) was a direct result of the Reynolds stresses caused by the presence of the slip regions (air
pockets). Overall, computational studies conclude that turbulent drag reduction is possible when
streamwise slip outweighs spanwise slip, and hence experimentalists must fabricate SHSs with
geometries that favour streamwise slip.
