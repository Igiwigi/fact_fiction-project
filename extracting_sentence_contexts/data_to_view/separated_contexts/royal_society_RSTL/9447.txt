Now, what I wish to
be gathered from the whole tracing is this : If the strength of the induction shocks
had been much greater than it was, Â«ll the contractions would have become strong
contractions, and tetanus would have been the result. But, as the strength of the
induction shocks was only slightly more than minimal, the exhaustion consequent on
every strong contraction 80 far diminished the irritability of the tissue that when,
during the process of relaxation, another shock gf the same intensity was thrown in, the
stimulus was only strong enough, in relation to the diminished irritability of the partly
recovered tissue, to cause a feeble contraction. And these facts tend still further
to substantiate the hypothesis whereby I have sought to explain the phenomena
of artificial rhythm. (3.) Upon the whole, then, I think that this hypothesis may be properly accepted
as a full explanation of the artificial rhythm; but whether or nob the hypothesis is thus
accepted, the facts which ib is adduced to account for remain as remarkable and signi-
ficant as they were before.
