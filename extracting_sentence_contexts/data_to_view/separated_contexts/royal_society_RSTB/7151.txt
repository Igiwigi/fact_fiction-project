According to Mellanby (19324, p. 226, figure 4), all large larvae of X. cheopis died within
24 hr. at 60% R.H. with 34° C. This is probably due to the fact that he had exposed larvae
without food. Subsequently, he (1933, p. 198) observed even that at 70% r.u. and 35° C
the larvae of this species did not develop successfully. The fact that the larvae of this species
survived in my experiments under almost identical conditions of temperature and humidity
is possibly due to the better nutritive conditions.
