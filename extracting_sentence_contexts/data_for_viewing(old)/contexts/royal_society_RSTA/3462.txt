progenitor had Mini © 14-16 Mo. This is consistent with what is inferred for the synthesized O
abundance from nebular spectroscopy [110].

Indications are that SN 2013ej may be more similar to SNe II-L than normal SNe II-P [111-114].
The RSG progenitor was identified in HST/ACS optical data [50]. Those authors pointed out that
the red progenitor is blended with a blue star; the photocentres of the two objects shift slightly
spatially, depending on wavelength. This renders the F435W (B) and F555W (I) detections useless.
Those authors estimated the progenitor was between 8 and 15.5Mo. We also added a ground-
based K, detection to the existing F814W measurement, as well as upper limits to detection in
the Spitzer bands. Once again, using DUSTY [100] with Ossenkopf silicates [106], we find that
the dust excess from extended circumstellar matter (CSM) around the star is © 2.5 mag and that,
with an input Ter = 3500K, the star had Lyo) ~ 10°? Lo, ie. a higher luminosity than that of the
SN 2012aw progenitor. This is consistent with the fact that the SN 2013ej progenitor is brighter
at Ks; (the band least affected by extinction) than the SN 2012aw progenitor. From the GRAMS
fitting to the two SED datapoints, we find that Lyol 10°! Lo and Teg © 3300 K. Comparison with
the known M33 RSGs [109] also indicates that Tog © 3300 K and Lyo © 10°!-10°? Lo. Again, from
the MIST tracks [91] we find that the star’s initial mass was Mini © 16-18 Mo. This higher mass is
consistent with expectations for a luminous fast-declining SN II-P [112] or an SN II-L with weak
CSM interaction [111], although not with the Mini © 12-15 Mo estimated from the nebular optical
spectrum [115].

5. Yellow supergiant progenitors of Type Ilb supernovae

We know that the best-studied SN IIb 1993] arose from a K-type supergiant [13]. Another well-
studied example is the progenitor of SN 2011dh [43,44]. The detailed SED for the star is best fitted
