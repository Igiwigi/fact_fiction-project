which accompanies the act of muscular contraction : notwithstanding this I termi-
nated the chapter referred to with the following words :—< I cannot take upon me
to affirm that the question is entirely solved, and I panse here from not knowing how
or by what way to advance to solve it,” 1

The importance, however, of the fact of induced contractions thus always appeared
to me very great, and consequently I have not failed to give my strictest attention to
the study of it, and I have reason to believe, latterly, with some success. I shall,
therefore minutely describe in this memoir all the experiments that I have instituted
upon the induced contractions, and I trust the reader will excuse the prolixity of the
description.

Before commencing a fresh series of investigations into the fundamental fact of
the induced contractions, I thought it necessary to repeat and vary the experiments
of which I have already given an outline, and which were directed to the purpose of
discovering whether there is a development of electricity during the contraction
of a musecle. In order to have a more fixed and considerable deflection, it was neces-
sary to employ piles consisting of a greater number of elements than those I had
made use of previously. I imagined thaf for this purpose a muscular pile would be
far preferable to a pile of frogs. I avail myself of this opportunity of referring to an
experiment made for the purpose of proving the existence of the muscular current in
the living human subject. I applied the nerve of the galvanoscopie frog with care to
the muscle of a leg laid bare by a wound. The most lively contractions were excited
in the galvanoscopic frog every time that the circuit was suitably closed between
the interior of the wound and the surface.
