advice-taking task, the participant is asked to make a quanti-
tative judgement on a factual question (e.g. ‘What is the
height of Mount Everest?’). Having given this first answer,
they are confronted with another participant’s answer, and
allowed to give a second answer. Accurate answers are
usually (but not always) incentivized (incentives tend to
decrease the egocentric discounting effect without eliminat-
ing it) [31].
