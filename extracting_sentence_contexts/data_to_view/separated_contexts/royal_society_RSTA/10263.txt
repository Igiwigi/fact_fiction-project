The
mass of the mountain itself, therefore, was probably relatively cold, and the drift of
surface air over the land might give a temperature difference even exceeding that of
the adiabatic gradient for dry air, but the difference of 11° on July 18, when there
was a northerly wind, @.e., blowing from the mountains towards Crinan, with cloud
over the sea at 750 metres, cannot be explained in a similar way. No other single
suggestion is more fortunate. But the fact that the Ben Nevis—Fort William
average gradient in July and August, though it agrees with the kite gradient of the
United States Weather Bureau, exceeds the Berlin balloon gradient and the average
mountain gradient, points to an explanation depending on some differences of effect
of a high level station in that position as compared with a layer of free air at the
same height. It will be noticed, on comparing the readings of temperature at Fort William
(Table C) with the initial temperature of the kite ascents (Plate 12), that there is no
corresponding difference between the sea-level temperatures at the two positions. There is another fact which supports the idea that the Ben Nevis temperatures are
below those of the free air at the same altitude.
