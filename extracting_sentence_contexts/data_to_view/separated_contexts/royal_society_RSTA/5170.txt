A good approximation to this integral is

128uQ;f 1 1
APpvis = - Fes ral : (A6)

With Q, = (2/4)D2 x v and v=80ms"!, we find that Apyis = 0.60/Dn (units are Pa if Dy is in
metres). The power required to pump the liquid through the system is the pressure drop multiplied by
the volume flow rate. Hence, we may write down an equation that describes the power (watts)
needed for a given flow rate, Q (m? s~!):

0.90
Py= (Ss 43.2 x 10°) Q (A7)
Da

= (— +3.2x 10°) Q. (A 8)

The second line is derived from the fact that the drop diameter is approximately two times the
nozzle diameter and the drop diameter is approximately four times the dry aerosol diameter, Dm,
so Dn =2Dm.

(b) Taylor cone jets

Here, we provide arguments for the application of Hagen-Poiseuille flow to the case of Taylor
cone jets and show that it is consistent with measurements by Neukermans et al. [11]. The Taylor cone jet method uses an untapered nozzle and does not require the pump to provide
drops with a high kinetic energy, because an electric field provides the kinetic energy instead. For
an untapered nozzle, the power required to overcome the pressure drop due to viscosity and

surface tension is:
