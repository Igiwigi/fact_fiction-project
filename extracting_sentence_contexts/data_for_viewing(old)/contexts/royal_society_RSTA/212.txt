and c=300000kms~! is the speed of light in vacuum. When energy (in the
form of photons) is converted to matter, equal amounts of antimatter appear.
Thus, to make an electron, one needs at least twice the energy of a single
electron, as a positron is also necessarily made (in practice, more is needed
as momentum needs to be conserved as well as energy). This process, called
pair production, has so far never failed when observed. Thus, as the universe
started out with no matter, the universe of today should contain equal amounts
of matter and antimatter. However, extensive searches for evidence of antimatter
in cosmic rays as well as by other means have been unsuccessful. The universe
hus seems devoid of antimatter.

The mirror-like symmetry between matter and antimatter described above
goes further than the expectation of equal production rates. In fact, the charge,
parity and time (CPT) theorem which is a fundamental consequence of quantum
field theory, states that under the combined symmetries of Charge conjugation
changing the sign of all charges), Parity transformation (exchange of left and
right) and Time reversal (letting time go backwards), all physical laws remain
he same. If we apply this transformation on a hydrogen atom we end up
with antihydrogen, and as all laws remain the same, any experiment on the
antihydrogen atom should give the same result as the corresponding one on
he hydrogen atom. In other words, the energy levels of antihydrogen should
xe exactly the same as those of hydrogen. If not, some parts of quantum field
heory will have to be reformulated.
