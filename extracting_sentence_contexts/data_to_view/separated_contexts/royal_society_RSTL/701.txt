The same circumstance occurred with certain inflammable
vapours. I have tried those of ether, alcohol, oil of turpentine
and naphtha. There cannot be a better mode of illustrating
the fact, than by an experiment on the vapour of ether or of
alcohol, which any person may make in a minute. Let a
drop of ether be thrown into a cold glass, or a drop of alcohol
into a warm one. Let a few coils of wire. of platinum of the
2.07 -; of an inch be heated at a hot poker or a candle, and
let it be brought into the glass;- it will in some part of the
glass become glowing, almost white hot, and will continue
$0 as long as asufficient quantity of vapour and of air remain
in.the glass.
