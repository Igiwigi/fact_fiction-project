the alloy was repolished for the heat-oxidation. A slowly chilled ingot, very sharply
chilled at 715°, was almost untouched by the strongest mixture of hydrochloric acid
and ferrie chloride, but heat-oxidation still reveals a little mother-substance.

The lower chills were etched in the usual manner with ferric chloride. Many of
these show polygonal divisions, but very little difference in the tint of the polygons,
and no pattern in them. Even the strongly exothermic change at E’ does not show
itself by any pattern in the pure Sn 25, for the obvious reason that both before and
after the change there are no two substances for the etching reagent to distinguish
between. In quite the lowest chills, and in the unchilled ingots, the patches
sometimes assume a bar-like form, especially if the polished and etched surface is
exposed to the air for some days before examination. This appears to be due to the
fact that the plates of 7, of which the ingot is composed when the temperature is
below E’, oxidise at different rates according to their position with reference to the
plane of the section. This effect is seen in fig. 66, an unchilled ingot. A similar
selective darkening of the y by atmospheric action was observed in a chill of Sn 28
at 725°,

The EF Alloys. Sn 26 and 27.—This region is not marked by a singularity in the
liquidus, and in harmony with this fact the first steps in the solidification are very
similar to those of the preceding alloys. But there is a greater difference between
the composition of the first solid and that of the liquid, and consequently the y combs
of the upper chills are revealed by polishing alone through the more brilliant network
of mother-substance around them, This effect is common to the upper chills of all
the alloys as far as the point G of the diagram. This network is rapidly eaten out
