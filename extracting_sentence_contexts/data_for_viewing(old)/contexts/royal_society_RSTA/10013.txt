Tables I. and IT., pp. 136 and 137, show that several lines reverse for a small range of
pressure only.

Diagram VII. illustrates the behaviour of lines of this type ee to Set A,
Groups I. and IL, the dotted parts of the curve relating to the reversed line. It is
apparent that for Group I. the atom absorbing the vibration follows the same course
under pressure as the one producing the radiation. But this is not the case for the
reversed lines of Group III., whose displacement curves may be compared with the
displacement curves for unreversed lines belonging to this group, and also with their
own displacement curves for that range of pressures during which reversal does not
take place.

The remarkable fact is brought to light that the lines of Group III. present two
rates of increase of the displacement with pressureâ€”one for the lines when unreversed,
and the other, very much lower, for the line in its reversed state.

Corroborative evidence of this phenomenon has been obtained from the second
series of photographs, Set B, for which similar curves are shown in Diagram VIII.
