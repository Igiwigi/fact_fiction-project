o*(x)
p(x)

If £* is not even required to be symmetric, then different row and column vectors could be used in
its definition. One way to define £ uniquely is to require that it would apply even in the presence
of a possibly incompatible ‘transformation strain’ 7 so that, in the presence of such transformation
strain, stress and total strain are related by

r=e("") (5.6)
Uv

It is possible to include such a transformation strain in the Hashin-Shtrikman formulation,
taking 7 to be sure. The estimate for £° survives, showing that it does in fact comply with this
uniqueness restriction.

Willis [33] developed a more flexible definition for effective properties than that employed
so far, by introducing a weighting function w(x,a), normalized so that (w) =1, and defined a

LY(x,2!) = [o*(@’) p*@’))- (6.5)


weighted mean displacement
(u) w = (wu) (5.7)

and associated weighted mean velocity (v)w=s(u)w or (0/dt)(u)w and strain (e)w with ij
