An interesting problem in the theory of elasticity is thus suggested, namely, the
determination of the displacement of the tooth and the strain and stress in the membrane,
corresponding to the application of assigned forces to the crown of the tooth. We are
obviously entitled to treat the problem mathematically as that of an infinitely thin
membrane, but we shall have to make other simplifications in order to reduce the
problem to a manageable form.

With this object: in view, we shall first make two hypotheses, of which the former
is reasonably likely to be true, but the latter much less so. These hypotheses are that
the membrane is elastically (i) homogeneous ; (ii) isotropic.

Our next hypothesis is that the membrane is incompressible.* We may justify
this assumption from the fact that the tissue is largely composed of water, and that
the only changes in volume arise when variations in pressure draw in extra blood from
the circulatory system or squeeze it out; but these changes will probably be small
unless the membrane is in a congested condition. Congestion, with consequent com-
pressibility, might be expected theoretically to cause a slight loosening of the tooth.
There is, however, another way of approaching this question of incompressibility, which
is of interest. It is improbable that, in the normal functioning of the tooth, the
membrane experiences finite} strain. or, in other words, that the linear elements of the
membrane experience finite elongations. On the other hand, in order to balance
finite applied forces, the stress in the membrane must be finite. Now finite stress
and infinitesimal strain can coexist only if at least one of the elastic moduli is infinite.
Having already assumed that the membrane is elastically isotropic, we have at our
disposal two moduli, the modulus of compression and the rigidity. It is improbable
