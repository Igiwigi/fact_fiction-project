computational science: implementing
verification, validation and uncertainty

quantification in silico’. The objectivity of science is its crowning and distin-

guishing feature. Its stock-in-trade are experimental facts,
Subject Areas: observations and theories which do not depend on who
computer modelling and simulation, reports them but rather on the notion that the same
computational physics, computational findings would be obtained by anyone else performing
chemistry similar procedures. This is what is meant by scientific

reproducibility. That, at least, is the aspiration.
