4. The Formation of Ridges: a Crucial Experiment.
â€˜per

The conditions for the formation of sharp ridges have been shown to be sufficiently
high frequency and an amplitude within a certain restricted range, too high an ampli-
tude leading to a general motion of the particles which makes the ridges blurred, and
too low an amplitude not being able to produce the phenomenon at all. In illustration
of this two general observations may be cited. When the amplitude is large, a few
sharp ridges are formed for a limited region near the nodes, although the ridges at the
antinodes are blurred, which demonstrates the unfavourable effect of too large an
amplitude. The fact that the ridges never extend right up to the nodes shows that a
certain minimum amplitude of motion is necessary.

The amplitude has been cited as the criterion, since it is open to direct observation,
but general considerations of the hydrodynamics of viscous motion would suggest
that it is the velocity of the air past the particles, possibly the acceleration, that con-
stitutes the criterion. The principles of dynamical similarity afford some information
on this point.

Suppose that the force F between two spheres of diameter h, in a vibrating medium
of density e and kinematic viscosity v, depends upon the velocity v and acceleration a
of the medium, as well as upon A, e, v and the distance J between the spheres, in a way
