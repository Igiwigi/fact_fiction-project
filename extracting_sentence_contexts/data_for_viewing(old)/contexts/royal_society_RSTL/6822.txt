where it is to be noticed that besides the expressed literal coefficients there are nume-
rical coefficients (not as the notation usually denotes, the binomial coefficients, but)

Supposing that (a, y/, z, w') are the current coordinates of a point on the line drawn
through the point (&, y, 2, w) to meet: the curve in two other points, the equations in g
must have two common roots, and this gives a system equiyalent to two equations, or 8ay
a plexus of two equations. If from the plexus and the two equations U=0, V=0 we
eliminate (&, y, z, w), we obtain an equation S$'=0 in (&, y', 2, w'), which is in fact the
equation of the scroll S(37*), taken (as is easily seen to be the case) thrice ; that is, S(m*) =
FDegree of &'. But observing that the coordinates (a, y', 2, w') enter into the plexus only
