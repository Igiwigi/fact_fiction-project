C+ C=PostP(C). We observe that, since the convergence of this method applied to the decomposition of two-
dimensional signals is still an open problem, we checked the meaningfulness of the outcome of
such a post-processing using the one-dimensional convergent MIF method. We consider, in fact,
the classification scores first along each row and then along each column of the classification
matrix, and vice versa. The results of these two procedures prove to be close to that obtained
by post-processing directly the two-dimensional classification using the two-dimensional MIF
method. The other method we present here is a pre-processing technique.
