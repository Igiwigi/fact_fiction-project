the range of electric field strengths applied here, the shapes of the radial density and hydrogen
bonding profiles are nearly identical to those in the zero-field case, as a few characteristic field
magnitudes show in figure 10a,b. Although figure 10a shows that the peak and trough values
of the density profile change as a stronger electric field is applied, the average density inside
the CNT is altered by no more than 2%. Similarly, for the hydrogen bonding measurements in
figure 10b, the maximum difference between the high-field results and the zero-field results is
even smaller than the maximum density difference (and in fact both measures are close to the
level of statistical error). To understand the orienting effects of the spatially patterned fields in each of the cases, we
consider the variations in pressure, velocity, anisotropy and biaxiality along the axial direction z. Figures 11 and 12 show plots of these profiles through the system (i.e. from the inlet reservoir,
through the CNT, to the outlet reservoir) for the zero-field case, as well as Cases B and C, which
were shown to reduce and increase flow rates, respectively.
