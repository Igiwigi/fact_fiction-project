turn freely round its centre of gravity, will be that of the lines of force*.” I have
not found in any of the subsequent numbers of the Philosophical Magazine the proof
here promised-. But I doubt not the conelusion involves the assumption that the
mutual action of diamagnetic particles is to weaken each other, and hence to pro-
duce a more feeble magnetization along a thin diamagnetic bar than across it—an
assumption which, as already shown, is contradicted by experiment.

It is scarcely possible to reflect upon the discovery of Fakrapar in all its bearings,
without being deeply impressed with. the feeling that we know absolutely nothing of
the physical causes of magnetic action. We find the magnetic force producing, by
processes which are evidently similar, two great classes of effects. We have a certain
number of bodies which are attracted by the magnet, and a far greater number which
are repelled by the same agent. Supposing these facts to have been known to
Amrzre, would he bave satisfied his profound mind by founding a theory which
accounts for only the smaller portion of them ? This theory is admirable as far as it
goes, but the generalization is yet to come which shall show the true relationship of
phenomena, towards whose connexion the theory of AMeERE furnisbes at present no
apparent clue. ?
