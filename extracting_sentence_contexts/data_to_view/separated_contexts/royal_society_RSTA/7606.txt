while the actual scalar distance can be put in the form

the number of values taken by 7 being equal to the number of dimensions of the
space. Quite analogous to these are the definitions of the components of the 6-vector A
(in 3 dimensions 3-vector) as integrals along any tubular surface S which joins the
lines L, and Ly, namely, the projections of S on the six coordinate planes, ¢.g.,

integrated over the portion of S bounded by L, and L,. Now if 2, and =, are any
two simple surfaces bounded by L; and L, respectively, on account of the fact that
S, 2,, and =, make a closed surface, A,, = (Z2),. — (4),, is the difference of a
function of the line L, and a function of the line L,. We shall call A the 6-distance
between the lines L, and Ly. It is clearly not a measure of the separation of the lines
in the ordinary sense for if L, can be transformed into L, by a simple translation,
then each of the components of the 6-distance between L, and L, vanishes.
