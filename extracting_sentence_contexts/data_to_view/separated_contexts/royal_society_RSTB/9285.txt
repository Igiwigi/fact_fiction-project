In human CLL patients with
subgroup 1 antibodies, the BCRs recognize oxidized LDL,
but fail to respond fully to BCR crosslinking in vitro [119]. Other CLL antibodies recognize antigens on apoptotic cells,
similar to multi- and autoreactive B cells [104]. In fact, some
VH4-34 antibodies in CLL look very similar to VH4—34 anti-
bodies in lupus: they can have a hydrophobic patch in
framework region 1 that binds to N-acetyllactosamine (NAL)
[110,120]. Also resembling VH-4—34 antibodies in lupus,
some of the VH4—34 antibodies in CLL can have positively
charged residues (arginine, lysine) in the CDRs, reminiscent
of anti-DNA antibodies in lupus [121]. Intriguingly, some
CLL cases have more than one functional L chain rearrange-
ment, which could be due to failed feedback inhibition of
rearrangement or to active (auto)antigen-induced receptor
editing [105].
