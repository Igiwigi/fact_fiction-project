Zmeasurements; and the proof that the Glacier du Geant is in a state of longitudinal
= compression is thus complete.

S Here then we have a yast ice press, and here we have the pure mow filling the trans-
Syerse channels of the streams. We are thus furnished with an experimental test on a
Zgrand scale of the pressure theory of the veined structure. In 1857 I examined a great
Znumber of these seams of white ice, and found in many of them « finely developed lenti-
BSeular structure. In 1858 I also examined the seams, and found some of them * rib-
Zboned ” in the most exquisite manner by the blue veins; indeed I had never seen the
'Byeins more sharply and beautifully developed.

= This structure was observed in portions of the seams at and near the centre of the gla-
Brier, where the differential motion observed at the sides does not exist. This fact, IT
Sthink, throws grave difficulties in the way of any theory which makes the veined struc-
ture dependent on differential motion, and more especially a theory which requires * «
gvery considerable amount of this differential motion to produce any sensible degree of
Estratification in the vesicles.”
