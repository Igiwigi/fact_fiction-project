44. In these inquiries I have not resorted to the view of electrical action I was led
to entertain in the first series of these papers, in which a portion only of the whole
charge is supposed to be appreciable by the electrometer, being unwilling to em-
barrass the inquiry with theoretical speculations not essential to a full development
of the experimental facts. I may, however, still observe, that the present state of
this department of science does not warrant any very perfect confidence in the*com-
mon mechanical explanations of the mode of operation of electrical forces generally,
and which after all seems to be of a cumbrous and difficult character. If we suppose
