It appears, however, that this
proposal by Sir Joux HErscneL has never been practically realized, and that, indeed,
no serious attempt has been made to construct an instrument of 8uch delicacy as to
show statically minute variations in total gravitation, notwithstanding the great oscilla-
tions to which a weight 80 suspended would be liable, and notwithstanding the influence
of changes of temperature and atmospheric density. General Conditions —Neither the pendulum nor the apparatus suggested by Sir Joun
HenscueL would be applicable to the measurement of the height of a mountain or
plateau aboye the sea-leyel, owing to the considerable error which would be caused by
changes in gravitation, through the local attraction of the mass of the mountain itself
above the horizon, nor would either instrument be serviceable on board ship for obvious
reasons, But if an instrument could be devised which would be capable of indicating
extremely slight variations in the total gravitation of the earth, subject only to compa-
ratively slight causes of error, it would be found, I contend, that these indications would
vary with the varying depth of water below the instrument, in such a definite ratio as
would render it possible to construct a working scale, the divisions of which would
represent depth of water. Attraction influenced by Depth of Water: General Statement, —The reason why the
total attraction upon the surface of the ocean must be less than on the shore, is evident
from the fact that the density of sea-water is nearly three times less than that of
such calcareous, siliceous, and aluminous rocks as constitute the principal portion of the
crust of the earth ; and it is also evident that, although the total mass of the earth and
the distance of the instrument from its centre remains the same in gliding along the
liquid surface of the sea, the total gravitation must be influenced in a greater measure
by the mass near at hand, and that in proportion to the thickness of the layer of the
substance of inferior density the total gravitation must be affected. Ratio of decrease of Gravitation with Depth.—The ratio of decrease depends, in the
first place, upon the ratio of the density of sea-water to that of 80lid rock. The mean
density of sea-water may be taken at 1:026, and the density of the rock composing the
crust of the earth may be taken to be the mean of the following densities —
