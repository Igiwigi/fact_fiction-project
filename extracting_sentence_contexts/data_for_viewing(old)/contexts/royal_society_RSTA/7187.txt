2Ae, — Ae, — Ae, = $AA(2, —f2—fs)»
and hence, according to (3),
Ae, = Ad{p, —3(bo+ps)}p --- etc. (9)

That is to say, as regards the plastic part of the distortion the (stress)-(incremental strain) relations
have normal forms, the effective values of Young’s modulus and of Poisson’s ratio being 1/AA and }
respectively.

The total strains associated with given stresses are, according to §3 (ii), the sums of these
plastic and of normal elastic components, so that (e.g.) the total strain

€ =e +@)5
and the fact that (2) relates to total, (9) to incremental strains, both expressible in terms of

total stresses, entails a serious complication of the formal problem. Combined, (2) and (9)
yield three equations of the type

Ae, = tbh — (Ape + Aps)} + Ad thi 2 (b2+Ps)}- (10)
These are the basis of our solutions.

Systems of plane strain and of plane stress. (1) The criterion of plasticity

7. This paper, being concerned with systems of plane stress and of plane strain, will
utilize the two-dimensional equations of transformation for stress and strain. Let z be the
