Suppose by absurd that the set R? \ 2; has a =
connected component K that does not intersect the connected set R? \ 2*. Then, we have that a
KC 2*,w <tonKand moreover, by taking ft + € for € > 0 very small, we can suppose that |K| > 0. a
Now, as wo* € H}(2*) ial Hy (2*) is the unique minimizer of the functional

[Vw :=
WR —w)dx, Dy
R\ 2 1a

in H\(2*), we can test its optimality with the function w € HU(2*) defined as : s&s

Wp= Wee on R?\K and w;=t onK,

obtaining that w; = we« and so wg» =t on K. On the other hand, as K is of positive measure, we
have Awg« =0 on K, which is a contradiction with the fact that —-Awg« = 1 0n 2*. As a consequence of the above observations, we obtain the following result. Theorem 4.1.
