‘They usually sit in a circle for these smoking parties; and in camp the ‘Bau-bau’ is
continually used. They grow their own tobacco, which is very rank, and not good
smoking at all. In fact, the natives themselves cannot inhale much, as it makes them
giddy; and they are not infrequently seized with severe fits of coughing when the fumes
have proved particularly suffocating. The supply of tobacco is carried in the armlet or
behind the ear.’ Technique in the Mekeo district.
