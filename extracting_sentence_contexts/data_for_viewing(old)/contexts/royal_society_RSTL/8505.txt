of work obtained from a corresponding weight of the undiluted gun-cotton ; and as nearly one third of gun-cotton
has been replaced in them by material of about one sixth its cost, a considerable adyantage is gained in point
of economy.
When equal yolumes of highly.compressed gun-cotton and of the © nitrate ” or © chlorate ” mixture, similarly
compressed, are compared, the explosive force of the latter is mnmch the most considerable. © Chlorated ” gun-
cotton is decidedly more violent in its action than the * nitrated ” preparations; but it is more costly, on account
of the comparatively high price of the salt, and because a larger proportion of the chlorate is required to furnish
the requisite proportion of oxygen, It is, moreoyer, yery susceptible of ignition by friction or percussion, and is
bherefore comparatively dangerous. For these reasons it does not compare fayourably with the © nitrated”
preparations. Of these, the mixtures with potassium nitrate are 8omewhat the *most readily prepared ; they,
moreover, have but little if any more tendeney to absorb moisture than pure compressed gun-cotton. The con-
siderable advantage which the * nitrated ” gun-cotton possesses in point both of cost and of power (especially
when compared with equal yolumes of compressed gun-cotton), added to the fact that it is as readily susceptible
of ignition by detonation and possesses othor valuable properties aboye pointed out, render it highly probable
that this preparation of gun-cotton will be largely substituted for the ordinary compressed material in many of
its applications. The cireumstance that carbonic oxide, produced in considerable amount upon the explosion of
trinitrocellulose, is present in the products of explosion of nitrated material in scarcely higher proportion than
it exists in those of gunpowder, appears likely to remove the objection against the employment of gun-cotton in
military mines, which arose from the large quantity of carbonie oxide developed when heavy charges of gun-
cotton were exploded,
