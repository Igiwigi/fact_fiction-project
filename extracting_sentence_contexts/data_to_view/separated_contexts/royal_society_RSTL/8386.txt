Near the fog-signal station a projecting
chalk cliff at C receives the impact of the sonorous waves and disperses them by reflec-
tion. The whole sea space between the line A B and the cliffs under Dover Castle is in
the sound-shadow. Within this line the instruments cannot be seen, without it they
can; and we have to account for the fact that the enfeeblement of the sound occurs not
only inside but immediately outside the boundary, and while the instruments are in
sight. A sudden subsidence of the sound is always observed on crossing the boundary
towards the $hore, and a correspondingly sudden augmentation on crossing it towards
the ea; but the stoppage of the sound on entering the shadow is by no means total. The whole of the shaded space is filled with sound of enfeebled intensity, produced in
great part by the divergence into the shadow of the waves which abut against the
boundary.
