H,S0, ; this is supplied by the liquid which in the case of EtOH loses some 10 to 20 c.c.,
but the vacated space is filled with vapour which is not a loss that can be charged to
the air current, and must therefore be allowed for.

Correction (5).—In most of the experiments a deposit was found in the U-tubes—this
deposit was weighed and an appropriate correction applied. The deposit was found
even in the tube connecting two vessels charged with the same liquid—it was for a long
time thought to be a temperature effect, but another more probable explanation will
be given under * 2nd vessel losses.”

It may be mentioned that the sum of the first four corrections, even in the case of
EtOH rarely exceeds 0-0100 grammes, but it should be borne in mind that there is
another source of error, the magnitude of which cannot be estimated ; it lies in the fact
that the vessels have to be handled (in “ taking down’) both to disconnect the train
and to wash and dry—this handling, if prolonged, may warm the contained liquid to
such an extent that loss occurs by increased diffusion past the stoppers—obviously a
liquid of low specific heat with a high ratio of change of vapour pressure will be most
affected. ‘To minimise this loss the vessels were never held with the bare hand.

Correction (6).—In this section it is convenient to discuss two sources of error since
each is the result of changes in temperature and the method of calculating the correction
is the same.

(a) The loss in the second vessel.—Before discussing this it is well to point out that
the elucidation of the cause of the second vessel loss is of considerable importance ; for
