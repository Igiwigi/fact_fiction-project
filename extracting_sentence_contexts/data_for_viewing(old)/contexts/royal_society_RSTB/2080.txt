interesting fact that in the Jurassic fronds of this species every pinnule appears to be
fertile, even the smallest segments at the base of the pinn, exactly as in Matonia
pectinata.*

M. Wiesneri, Krasser.

This species, from Cretaceous (Cenomanian) rocks of Moravia, was founded by
Krassert for some fern fronds with a Matonia-like habit. M. Wiesneri agrees
closely with the Malayan fern in the form of pinnules and in the occurrence of
anastomosing veins below the sorus; the sorus appears to be indusiate and circular.
KRaAssEr gives figures of a pinnule of the recent species,{ but, like other authors, he
overlooks the fact that the lateral veins are often connected by arching branches.
The Moravian species differs from M. Gépperti and agrees with Matonia pectinata in
