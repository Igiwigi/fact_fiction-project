In the plain of
Tchoukour are some isolated hills capped by beds of gravel, sand, and clay, containing
a number of recent marine shells, probably Quaternary, of which a short list is given,
but without the height above the sea. There are detrital deposits of local origin on the slopes of the hills, but
M. pe TcoHIHATCHEFF was uncertain whether they were Quaternary or modern,
Elsewhere, in speaking of the detrital deposits in the plain of Smyrna, he says that
‘they may probably be of the same age as the cave deposits. He remarks on the
absence of organic remains in the superficial drift of Asia Minor, and on the fact
that the detritus is always derived from the neighbouring hills, as a reason for
believing that it is of local origin (formé sur place) when the country had assumed
its present configuration. Although these observations leave much to be desired, they seem to indicate the
presence of a Rubble-drift and its comparatively recent origin. Cyprus.—Monsieur A.
