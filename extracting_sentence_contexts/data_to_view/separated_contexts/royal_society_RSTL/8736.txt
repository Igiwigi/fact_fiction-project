Franklin has attributed more power
to pointed bodies, than, upon experiment he finds to
be true, ;

The fixth letter to Mr. Franklin is upon the ana-
logy of thunder with eleQricity. This is a fact at pre-
ſent fo well eſtabliſhed, as to admit of no doubt,
But our author cannot agree with Mr, Franklin in his
opinion, © that thunder is at preſent in the power of
« men, and that we are able to diſſipate it at our
« pleaſure : that an iron rod (ſuch a one as Mr,
« Franklin has dire&ted, and ſuch a one as has been
** made uſe of) is ſufficient to diſcharge of all its fire

« a ſtormy cloud againſt which it is dire&ted,” For
his part, he confeſſes, that he cannot believe it ; firſt,
hecauſe he ſees too great a diſproportion between the
effe& and the cauſe: ſecondly, becauſe the principle,
which is given us to ſupport this opinion, is not ſuf-
ficiently eſtabliſhed. He can hardly think, that the
fulminating matter, contained in a cloud, capable of
covering a great city, can be drawn off in a few mi-
nutes by a pointed bar, as thick as your finger. If
even a number of theſe placed upon the tops of emi-
nencies were only neceflary to prevent the effects of
thunder, would not the vanes and crofles at the tops
of our ſteeples have been ſufficient to procure us this
advantage?
