This fracture
runs obliquely across our vertical sections; it must have been coincident with the
suture of the pterygoids against the basi-sphenoid, dividing the cranial axis from the
palate, for neither of the portions shows any trace of the pterygoid-basisphenoid
suture. There are two very distinct sutures traversing the cranial axis (text-figs. 4 and 5,
and Plate 17, fig. 1), and at first sight it would, perhaps, be natural to suppose
that these sutures divide the basioccipital from the basisphenoid and the basisphenoid

from the presphenoid, but on examining the relations of the bones more closely it
becomes clear that the more posterior suture lies between the basioccipital in front
and below, and the exoccipital behind and above, and that, in fact, the two
exoccipital bones meet each other in the middle line, and form the dorsal and
larger part of the condyle, while the basioccipital forms the lower part. The meeting
of the exoccipitals across the middle line is cited by Grecory* as occurring in
Cynodonts, and as one of their primitive reptilian characters. The more anterior suture lies between the basioccipital and the basisphenoid in the
neighbourhood of the sagittal plane (text-fig.
