surveyed in 1940 was 0-034 acre, and over the whole area of about 48,000 sq. miles under
grid survey in 1941 was 0-057 acre. This variation from year to year may be partly due to
the difference in the coverage of the two surveys, and also partly to variations in the pro-
portion of land sown with jute and changes in condition of cultivation. On the whole it
was found that the average value of the quad or size of the basic cells was something of the
order of say 0-04 or 0-05 acre. However, in Bengal the average size of individual plots is
about 0:4 acre; the size of the basic cells thus appears to be something of the order of a tenth
of the average size of plots. In revenue work the smallest fraction of which it is considered
possible to take cognizance is ‘1 anna’ (that is, 1 anna out of a rupee of 16 annas) or qeth
part of a plot; this supplies a rough unit of ;'gth of 0-4 acre, or 0-025 acre. Estimate of the
quad or the ultimate unit of jute cultivation is about 0-04 or 0-05, or say twice the lowest
unit recognized in revenue or agricultural practice. This is physically plausible and indicates
that the graduating equation has a real basis in fact.

225. However, to return to the more important quantity, namely, the numerical value
of the constant g. As already mentioned, extensive material relating to the proportion of
land under jute based on sampling units of various sizes ranging from individual plots to
40-acre grids was collected in 1935 and from 1937 to 1941 by both field survey and model

sampling experiments. A detailed discussion of this material will be out of place here;

I shall merely give a brief summary.

296. The results of certain model sampling experiments carried out in 1938 and 1939
are given in table 9, in which col. (0) shows the size of grids in acres. The name of each zone
