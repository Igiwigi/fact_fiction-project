Beyond biological control, examples of agent- and
function-oriented approaches include recent proposals to
introduce Tasmanian devils to mainland Australia to regulate
cat and fox impacts on small mammals (described below); be-
havioural and evolutionary modifications to ‘train’ species to
avoid novel predators; and targeting individual predators
that cause the most damage to vulnerable populations [28-30]. The discipline of invasion biology is now well established
[7]. It is predicated on the fact that some populations that are
new to a place cause problems, including undermining
important ecological functions and threatening species with
extinction. However, some concepts and language commonly
associated with invasion biology have been recently criti-
cised, notably the militaristic and xenophobic framing of
problems, the seeming incommensurability with animal wel-
fare concerns and the assumption that any influence of a new
population is negative [31-33]. It is increasingly recognized
that introduced or newly arrived populations can be valuable
additions to an ecosystem, a view which has obvious overlap
with rewilding advocacy [33,34].
