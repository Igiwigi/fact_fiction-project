By transmitted light, at a magnification
of 1000 diameters, the particles, which were of the order of 1 » across, appeared a
golden brown colour, against a much lighter background. With dark ground
illumination, produced by the ring illuminator, they appeared as bright spots,
see fig. 16, Plate 16. The background was uniform right up to the particles, and
did not show a region of clearance, as would be expected if the material of the
particles was drawn from the immediate surroundings, a significant fact which is
discussed later. It is natural to suppose that these particles are the first stage of crystallization, and
so they proved to be. Even with a 1/12 inch oil immersion objective, which on
ordinary theory resolves two particles about 0-25 u apart, it was impossible to detect
any crystalline form, but this, perhaps, is not surprising even at this resolution, with
particles 1 » across.
