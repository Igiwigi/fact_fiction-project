In open seas the time of the change of the direction of the current is of more
consequence to the seaman than the time of high water; and accordingly the
first has been often recorded, when the other has not : hence the observyations,
by means of which we are to trace the cotidal lines are more scanty than they
at first appear ; and, what is worse, are often very doubtful in their meaning. But having pointed out the nature and frequency of this ambiguity, the ano-
malies which may occur in tide observations will be less perplexing than they
were while such a sonrce of confusion was not adverted to; and we may
sometimes in such cases be able to distinguish the true from the erroneous
statement. The time of high water is the fact which is most important for
our present purpose ; but that and the time of slack water ought to be both
Separately noted in all careful observations of the tides.

2. The change of the Moon's angular distance from the Sun in the course of
the day.—The times spoken of in the preceding paragraphs as recorded for dif-
ferent places are the hours of the tide on the days of full and new moon, which
times are often called the establishments of the places to which they belong.
