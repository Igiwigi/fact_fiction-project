The annexed section (fig. 6) is supposed to pass through the Cava Grande in a north
and south direction, or at right angles to its course, and to intersect not only the newer
lava of 1689 (a, c, 4), but also the nine or ten older currents of Etna (e, * and &, F)
which constituted the walls of a ravine before the modern lava poured into it. The old
currents alluded to appear horizontal in the diagram, because they are intersected at
right angles to their dip. They are in fact inclined at about 7% eastward or towards the
sea, each laya being on an average about 10 or 12 feet thick, and separated by frag-
mentary matter belonging to the top and bottom scoriz of snccessive currents, or 80me-
times by tuff, 7. e. volcanic sand and mud transported by land-floods or the winds. These
partings are about equal in thickness to the solid beds, and exhibit at various heights
red or burnt strata, as at F, three of them being conspicuous on the left bank.
