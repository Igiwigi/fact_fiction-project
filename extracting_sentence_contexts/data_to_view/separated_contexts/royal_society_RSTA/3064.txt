Those extrapolations based on the RCP2.6 or RCP8.5 multi-gas emissions trajectories
suggest a residual budget of only approximately 100 GtCO2 from 2016 onwards. Recently, a study
claimed that the likely 1.5°C budget could be as high as 730-880 GtCO2. This was based on the fact
that the amount of cumulative CO2 emissions to reach current warming levels as backcasted by
Earth system models was lower than empirical estimates of CO2 emissions, and thus the amount
of COz emissions to reach 1.5°C might actually be higher than originally suggested [27]. Given all
this uncertainty, we consider a large range of 1.5°C budgets for our analysis here. Available 1.5°C pathways tend to lead to peak warming above 1.5°C and return to median
1.5°C temperature values by 2100.
