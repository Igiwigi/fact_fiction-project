I consider to be logarithmic, in which the ratios, as ordinates,
continually diminish, without ever vanishing, or coming to an
equality. The axis is an asymptote to the curve, as in the
atmospherical logarithmic.

CHAPTER Il.
On thermometric admeasurement, and the doctrine of capacity.

Before inquiring into the relative quantities of heat, con-
tained in different vapours at the same tension, it will be
proper to determine the primary and fundamental proposition
concerning the measure of temperature, It is singular, that
not one experimental fact has been advanced, capable of
settling this question, amid the contending opinions of chemi-
cal philosophers. Mr. DaLrow has, in particular, exerted all
the resources of his genius and science to destroy our confi-
dence in the thermometric scale; our sole guide in the yast

and intricate province of caloric. While I hope to be able to
fix this now indeterminate point, by a new train of investiga-
tions, and consequently to prove the entire fallacy of his
doctrine of temperature, the key-stone of his system of heat,
