foundational questions related with empirical science
Subject Areas: in general. Indeed, far from a purely formal
mathematical physics conception, Hilbert counted geometry among the

sciences with strong empirical content, closely related
Keywords: to other branches of physics and deserving a treatment

the axiomatization project was meant to play, in his
view, a crucial role.
