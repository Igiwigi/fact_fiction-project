and III, of Table IX. would have varied from 0884 to 1012. Change of composition of the films. —The fact that films formed under constant
hygrometric conditions obey Onm's law having thus been proved, the second part of
the enquiry refers to the change of composition which might under other cireumstances
be produced. This is illustrated by experiments on five films,

In the case of some of these the observed specific resistance rose as high as 204,
indicating, as that of the liquid in mass was only 1405, a considerable loss of water. To determine this the specific resistance was first reduced to 20* C. by the formula

PE=Pyy{1+(0:03+0:000138)(20—t)}, (See p. 475.)
