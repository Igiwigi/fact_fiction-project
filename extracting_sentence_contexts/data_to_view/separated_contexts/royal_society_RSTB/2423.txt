Much minute care has been spent by Sir Joun
Lawes and Sir Henry Greer in forming these estimates of acreage weights of fine
soil in the various depths, and the estimates are probably on the average as sub-
stantially fair as it has been possible to make them. But it is obvious that when the
contents of an acre of soil have to be calculated from the analyses of samples, the
error in the estimated weight of fine soil per acre for any individual plot may well
affect the calculation. Then, apart from the probability that no sample is entirely
representative of the plots from which it is drawn, it is not easy to deal with the
actual samples, consisting as they do of a mixture of clay, fine and coarse sand, and
gravel, so accurately as to ensure that the small portion ultimately analysed shall
quite fairly represent the bulk sample; while, even beyond this difficulty, we have to
face the fact that even the best analytical manipulation involves some experimental
error. When 10 grammes of soil are used for a determination, say, of phosphoric acid,
and the quantity found is calculated out to lbs. per acre in a depth of 9 inches, the
actual error of experiment has to be multiplied by some such figure as 120,000,000. Thus a difference of ‘001 gramme (or ‘01 per cent.) represents, in round numbers,
260 lb. per acre in 9 inches of soil ; and even ‘0001 gramme, working on 10 grammes
of soil (or 001 per cent.) affects an acreage estimate in 9 inches of soil to the extent
of 26 lb.
