SOME OBSERVATIONS ON WELWITSCHIA MIRABILIS. 273

profusion in which the cones, especially those of the male plant, are produced, is in
marked contrast with the slow growth of the stock. In Mossamedes, where the
leaves are used by the natives for fuel, the plants are said to flower for some time
after the leaves have been torn off.* A considerable age is probably attained before
flowering commences. it
That Welwitschia is dicecious seems to have been first recorded by Martoru.{ The
fact may, however, be stated again, as authors are either doubtful or convey the
idea that it is monecious.{ In Portuguese territory, according to Baum,§ the male
plants are more numerous than the female in the proportion of two or three to one.
Of the plants seen at Haikamchab on January 12, I thought the males were more |
numerous. Forty-two examined on January 13 included 16 males (one a graft
of two or more), 18 females, one dead, and seven whose sex was not noted. The male
plants when in flower are more conspicuous than the female ; this appears to be due
to the considerably larger number of cones borne by each inflorescence and to the
light colour of the exserted anthers. There is therefore some danger of exaggerating
the preponderance of male plants, if it exists,
According to Hooxer|| “‘ when the pollen is ready for transport, the female cones
“are still very small and the nucleus of their ovules is neither covered by the
“ ovular integument nor by the perianth ..... It is obvious that after the ovular
