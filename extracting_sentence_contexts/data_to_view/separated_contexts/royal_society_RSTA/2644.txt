Since they are charged particles, they undergo electromagnetic interactions
with the atoms of the material they cross in two interesting ways: losing energy through
ionization of the material, or being deflected as a result of the multiple scattering with the
material nuclei. Both processes have a strong dependency on the properties of the crossed
medium such as the density, the atomic number or the number of radiation lengths, providing :
a powerful handle to identify its size, shape and composition. This fact enabled the possibility of ig
measuring the attenuation or the bending of the muons when crossing an object to infer details
about its geometry. This technique is nowadays known as muon radiography (MR). The first
effort in developing this technology was made in the context of underground applications using
attenuation [2].
