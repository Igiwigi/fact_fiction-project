No
author has mentioned any bones belonging to different sets of teeth, on the real or
suppoxed differences of which many species were founded. The priority of mentioning
these teeth under the name of Ancodus is claimed by PoxeL in his Â© Catalogue; * but
as he neither gave a good description of them, nor illustrated his short notices by figures,
no palzontologist has accepted this name, and it may be considered extinct. In fact,
long before PoxeL, Cuvigs, having received a Jaw of this genus from Puy, compared it
with Cheropotamus and Anthracotherium; and as he had only the back molars, he

deemed it unnecessary to separate the new animal from Anthracotherium, and designated

it under the name of Anthracotherium velaunum. In the year 1847, however, Professor
Owexs, having received from the Marchioness of HasriNGs very good materials, as far as
the dentition was concerned, studied with great accuracy the structure of these teeth,
and found in them sufficient characteristic differences to justify their separation from
Anthracotherium under the name of Hyopotamus. Notwithstanding that one of the
characters on which the distinction was based (the complexity of the upper premolars)
was found to be a mistake, these complex teeth being milk-molars and not premolars
of the permanent dentition (see Quart.
