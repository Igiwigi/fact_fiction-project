There were also
large species differences in relative sizes of the core and shell
regions, where the shell had a significant log-linear relationship
with their brain section size, but the core did not. This meant
that shell regions were relatively larger in species with bigger
brains such as the gold and blue macaw, and the African
Grey and Amazon parrots that are considered to have more
advanced communication and cognitive capacities. The fact that the shell system AAC nucleus does not have
the direct projection to the vocal MN (which is restricted to
the core region of AAC), but may be correlated with more
complex vocal learning behaviour, indicates that such direct
projections may not be the only means to increase learned
motor behavioural complexity over innate motor behaviours. We speculate that it is possible that the direct projection may
not be required for the ability to imitate complex vocaliza-
tions, but strictly for the production of those learned
vocalizations. Clearly, further studies will be required to
explicitly test this hypothesis in parrots.
