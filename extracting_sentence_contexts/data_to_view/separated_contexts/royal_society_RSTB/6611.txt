This vertical
folding is accompanied by a retreat of the area striata from the lateral surface ; but
this retreat must be of a different order from that which occurs in the European races
because the particular Australian hemispheres practically all reveal the very
primitive form of the intrastriate sulci found in the higher apes in which the whole
area of the cuneus is often occupied by the area striata. Furthermore, these cases of
vertical folding also reveal a prominent medial operculation which is suggested, in
this type, as representative of the inner part of the “‘ Affenspalte ” as the sulcus lunatus
is of the outer part in those cases where the area striata is horizontally folded. Whilst
these two types contrast, the fact that a combination of the two occurs in three hemi-
spheres suggests that they are more closely related. It almost suggests two experi-
mental methods of repacking the striate cortex consequent upon the expansion of the

parietal lobe. One tendency—the vertical—might well lead to the European type
with absence of sulcus lunatus ; the other might equally well tend towards the
Chinese.
