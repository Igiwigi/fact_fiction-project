which give for the atomic volumes at ordinary temperatures
9°33, 18°00, % 14°76.

It is clear, at a glance, that the above denominators cannot be proportional to the
atomic volumes, but it is easy to show that in Zn, Cd, and Hg they are respectively
proportional to 9v, 8v, and 6v. In fact, the ratios to these come out to

002715 x 9v, ‘002715 x 8v, 002725 x 6v.

The ratios show a remarkable agreement with themselves and also with those of
the alkalies when referred to ‘986. The practically exact equality of the above
