This is an important issue ways in balancing the energy and carbon fluxes in diatoms,
because carbon allocation does not only influence Fe but starting from light absorption to end with the partitioning
also Fs (see above). The circumstance is further complicated of carbon within the cellular macromolecule pools. Further-
by the fact that diatoms differ from green algae due to their more, we highlight the current restrictions to identifying the
distinct metabolic compartmentation [4,5] and to the pres- regulatory elements of carbon allocation and present possible

ence of additional metabolic pathways (e.g. urea cycle, see solutions to overcome these problems.


2. Photosynthetic energy allocation and
metabolic costs

The quantum efficiency of biomass production is deter-
mined not only by the yield of photosynthetic light
reactions but also by the overall energetic costs of cellular
metabolism. Thus, metabolic costs depend on, for example,
energy requirements for nutrient acquisition, defence
mechanisms, the biomass composition, the cell cycle
activity and stress-induced repair activities (reviewed in
[8]).
