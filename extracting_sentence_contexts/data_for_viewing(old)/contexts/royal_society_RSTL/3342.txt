some function of the diameter of the speculum, By using a layer of pitch sufficiently
thick, a solid speculum of twenty inches aperture and a divided speculum of twenty-
four inches aperture, the subjects of these and many other experiments, were made
to define tolerably with a low power, and, at the swme time, had acquired a high polish.


LORD OXMANTOWN ON THE REFLECTING TELESCOPE. 517

Mr. Epwarps mentions that he had found, that, unless the pitch was of sufficient thick-
ness, it would not preserve its figure; he had observed the fact correctly : in assign-
ing the cause he was evidently in error, as he attributed it to the circumstance that
the thin coat of pitch, as he supposed, acquired more heat from the friction than the
thicker, while the reverse must have been the fact, as the thinner the imperfect con-
ducting material, the quicker the metallic plate, to which it was attached, would have
dissipated the heat, by radiation and conduction,
Mr. Epwarvs's specula were very small, and he found the thickness of half-a-crown
sufficient. It was, however, evident, both as a deduction from all that had been
written upon the subject, and from some experiments on small specula, that the ne-
cessity of using a layer of pitch thicker in proportion to the size of the speculum was
a great evil, and was alone sufficient to make it impossible to polish large surfaces as
accurately as small ones. A consideration of the theory, which I have ventured to
put forward, suggested a very obyious remedy. It was very evident that by grooving
the layer of pitch, provision might be made for its lateral expansion, wherever required,
without 80. great a thickness. The experiment was first tried by reducing the thick-
ness of pitch one-half, and making furrows in it by means of a hot iron quite down to,
