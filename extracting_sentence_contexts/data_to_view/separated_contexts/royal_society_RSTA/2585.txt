This is confirmed by the recent measures of these lines by
Nacuen.* The measurements thus suggest that there is a satellite on the more
refrangible side of the chief line, the separation being comparable with that in the
“4481” series if we assume that the tabulated \ 2797°989 refers to the chief line
itself. Such a reversal of the usual position of the satellite, however, would accord

with the fact that the more refrangible component of the “4481” lines is also the
stronger. While it is thus probable that the “4481” series is numerically related to the D
series of Wide doublets, there are objections to regarding it as directly derived from
that series—

(1) The “4481” lines, unlike the doublets, do not occur in the ordinary arc ;
(2) The separation of the components of the “ 4481” lines is much too small compared
with the F doublets of Ca, Sr, and Ba; the latter are roughly proportional to the

x Squares of the atomic weights—Ca 65, Sr 285, Ba 575—and a corresponding F series
& of Mg would be expected to havea separation of about 20 in place of the 0°99 actually
8 observed in the “ 4481” lines.

& The probable nature of the relation, however, has been revealed by the discovery
of a new system of doublets, with which the “4481” series appears to be directly
.o associated. Before referring to these new lines it will be convenient to give further
g data for the Wide doublets, for comparison with similar data which will appear
> later for the new series.
