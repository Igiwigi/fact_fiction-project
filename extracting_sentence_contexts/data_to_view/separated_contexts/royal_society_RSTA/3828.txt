This regime is thus where the sensitivity to the steel
model is expected to be the strongest. However, the JC model does not improve the simulation
results in this regime, and underestimates the experimental PPD. This may be partly due to the
fact that, as noted in ยง3b, our JC model predicts too much deformation in regime R2, causing an


excessive drag on the projectile. Another reason may come from the graphite yield strength. For
this reason, a second graphite model Yg2 has also been studied.
