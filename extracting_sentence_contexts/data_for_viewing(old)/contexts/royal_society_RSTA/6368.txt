After approximately 1985, the AMOC started to decline in both the CMIP5 and CMIP6 models
with an increased slowdown after the year 2000. While the overall post-1950 trend is on average
negative for the CMIP5 models, it is basically zero for the CMIP6 models. The larger standard
deviation of the CMIP6 trends furthermore shows that the spread within these models is larger
than the one within the CMIP5 models (table 1). This could be seen as somewhat surprising as in
general, the CMIP6 models due to, for example, their higher spatial resolution and improved
representation of clouds and aerosols, are an improvement over the CMIP5 models which
might lead to expectations of a convergence in AMOC trends and lower standard deviation.
Yet an improved representation of these processes does not necessarily lead to a convergence.
Indeed, there are other climate parameters whose range have increased from CMIP5 to CMIP6
such as climate sensitivity (the temperature response of the climate system to increases in CO
concentrations) [38]. Another possibility is that these differences stem from the fact that different
models were considered for the CMIP5 and CMIP6 project, i.e. we did not limit ourselves to only
consider those models that participated (and whose data were available to us) in both CMP5 and
CMIP6. In a study by Gong ef al. [39], this was done, i.e. they compared the AMOC in 18 models
that exist in both CMIP5 and CMIP6 (albeit with different model versions including changes in the
resolution). But they also found a large spread in long-term AMOC trends in the CMIP6 models,
and a greater deviation of the CMIP6 models (compared to the CMIP5 models) from the mean of
the RAPID observations, supporting our findings.

4. Comparison of the AMOC in observations and models

Comparing the modelsâ€™ AMOC evolution to the observational data (figure 3, lower panel), we
find that neither the CMIP5 nor the CMIP6 ensemble mean are successful at representing the
