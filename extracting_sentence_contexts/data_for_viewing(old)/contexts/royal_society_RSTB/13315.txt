for the case, developing the first models for it. See Gerbault et al. [27]
for an update on the case. Compare Lewens [18, pp. 86-93] who also
refers to it as a paradigmatic case to understand how to refer to the
channels of inheritance. Research on the case is still ongoing.

'? Another example that illustrates this point is the existence of differ-
ent departments in universities. One cannot just ‘see’ that universities
have different departments by looking at physical entities (e.g. the
buildings, the walls). One needs to ‘look’ at the people, i.e. their
causal interactions, to discern parts of the whole. Only if the elements
(members of the universities such as professors, staff and students)
interact more within individual departments than between different
departments is it justified to conclude that there are in fact different
departments of that university.

'SThe speediness of horizontal transmission is also why descriptions
of some cultural items as ‘spreading like viruses’ are so tempting,
especially after 2020, when the world had to witness so forcefully
that the horizontal transmission of the Covid-19 virus, leading to a
history-making pandemic, so easily outperforms government decrees
spreading in a too conservative magistral mode.

M4Por a book-length treatment of these complexities, see Morin [32].
The book is not oriented at distinguishing channels but at
understanding, as the title says, ‘How traditions live and die.’
