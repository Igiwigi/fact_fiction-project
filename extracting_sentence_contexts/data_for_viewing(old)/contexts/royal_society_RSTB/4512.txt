exercise, the respiratory quotient, which had fallen to 0°95 in the second observation,
diminishing further as the oxygen consumption increases, though it is still well above
the preliminary resting value in the last period of work.

After the stop of the exercise there is the usual immediate rise of the respiratory
quotient followed by a rapid drop. The respiratory exchange falls rapidly, and at
the end of 11 minutes has reached a value which remains practically constant for the
subsequent 684 minutes of the experiment. During this last 68} minutes the
respiratory quotient remains pretty steady at a figure considerably below the initial
resting value shown at the commencement of the experiment, the diminution of the
respiratory quotient being proportionally greater than in Experiment 8. The low
respiratory quotient is due to the fact that the CO, output is on the average 18 c.c.
per minute below the initial resting value as well as to the fact that the oxygen con-
sumption is 20 c.c. per minute above the initial resting value. It will, moreover, be seen
that the average oxygen consumption of 328 ¢.c. per minute during this period is
considerably above what was found in the previous experiments on Doveuas either
during the preliminary rest period or in the later stages of rest subsequent to muscular
work when the respiratory exchange has reached a steady value.

To allow of comparison with Experiment 8, the first and second periods after the
stop of the work may be added together. If this is done the oxygen consumption
averaged 660 c.c. per minute, and the CO, output 716 cc. per minute, with
respiratory quotient 1'085, during the first 5’ 9” after stopping the work.

In this experiment DouGLas was quite comfortable throughout the work, and
