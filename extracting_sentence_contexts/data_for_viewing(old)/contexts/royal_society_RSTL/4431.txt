marked transversely with parallel strize, it is known to act either directly in obedience
to the will, or to be capable of being called into operation through excito-motory
influence, whilst a muscle consisting merely of an aggregation of fibres more or less
distinctly nucleated, is known to act independently of the will ; hence muscles are
now named according to their function, voluntary and involuntary; or according to
their structure, striped and unstriped. In the class of striped muscles physiologists
are agreed to place the voluntary muscles, the upper part of the human cxsophagus,
and the heart; in that of unstriped ones, the muscular coat of the intestinal canal,
the bladder, the uterus and round ligaments. As it respects the parts included in
the latter division of this classification, I am obliged to dissent altogether in reference
to the structure of the round ligaments of the uterus, having found in every subject
in which I have examined them (the number being about a dozen) well-marked
muscular fibres of the striped variety, in fact that they correspond in all respects'to
regular yoluntary museles: with this conviction I am desirous to communicate the
result of my observations to the Royal Society. I may also add, that I have in my
possession numerous preparations, microscopic as well as ordinary dissections, in
which the accuracy of the facts stated in this paper are easily demonstrable.

The $0-called round ligament of the uterus, regarded as a muscle, may be said to
arise Ã¾y three fasciculi of tendinous fibres; the inner one from the tendon of the
internal oblique and transversalis near to the symphysis pubis, the middle one from
the superior column of the external abdominal ring near to its upper part, and the
