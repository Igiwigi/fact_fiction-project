Now it is easy to see that in this case the conditions for uniform convergency are

satisfied, except at the boundary, and except with regard to the stress rb, whose
approximate expression is not uniformly convergent, being in fact discontinuous for

At the boundary, I, («)/I,(«) tends to unity with x, its approximate expression,

Hence v is always uniformly convergent and its approximate expression likewise, so
for it the approximation, for sufficiently small values of ¢/a, holds throughout.
