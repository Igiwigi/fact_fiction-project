PART I -THE AGRICULTURAL RESULTS. In entering upon the diseussion of the s0-designated agricultural results, it is
necessary to premise that almost from the commencement of the experiments it became
apparent that more would be learnt, even of purely agricultural value, by continuing
them in 8nch manner as to obtain data bearing upon the important questions of the
annual assimilation of constituents, the resources and the exhaustion of the s0il, and
the deseription of plants, and general characters of the herbage developed, under
different conditions of season and of manuring, than by simply adapting the manures
to obtain, as a direct result, produce which, considered either in regard to quantity, to
quality, or to both, would be, in an economical sense, the mos valuable. In fact, in
some of the experiments conditions have been maintained which, though yielding very
large amounts of produce, have done 80 nob only at a great sacrifice of the quality of
the hay, but at an entirely unremunerative cost ; whilst, on the other hand, in some
cases very high quality has been obtained, but again at far too high a pecuniary cost. In other words, the design of the arrangements has not been to secure results which

should serve as direct models for practical agriculture, but snch as should provide the
data both for interesting scientific generalisation, and for useful practical deduction.
