E The number at the head of each column expresses the temperature Centigrade by
ET mercurial thermometers, at which the two metals written below it are thermo-elec-
& trically neutral to one another; and the lower metal in each column is that which
= passes the other from bismuth towards antimony as the temperature rises.
S It was also found that Aluminium must be neutral to either P, or Brass, or P,, at
= Some temperature between — 14* C. and 38? C.; that Brass becomes neutral to Copper
2 at some high temperature, probably between 800* and 1400*; Copper to Silver, a little
X below the melting-point of silver; Nickel to Palladium, at some high temperature,
5 perhaps about a low red heat; and P, to impure mercury (that had been used for
© amalgamating zine plates), at a temperature between —10® and 0%. P, appears to
become neutral to pure mercury at some temperature below —25* Cent.
101. The following Diagram exhibits graphically the relative thermo-electric bear-
ings of the different metals, and may in fact be regarded as a series of tables of the
thermo-electric order of metals at different temperatures from —30* to 300* Cent.

*
This determination has been added in consequence of information given by Mr. Jourz (December 1856),

that hardened steel at ordinary temperatures differs thermo-electrically from copper by about one-tenth of the
thermo-electric difference of iron from copper.
