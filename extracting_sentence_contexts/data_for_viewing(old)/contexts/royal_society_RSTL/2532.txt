turnal atmospheric tides ; but it answered sufficiently well as a check upon my other
barometers. Several others by G1Berr, used by myself and my friends, were found
to be similarly defective.

Auxiliary to the barometers, I had in use Aptr's sympiesometer. This instrument,
80 ingenious in its construction, I s00n found to be utterly inadequate to measure
the pressure of the atmosphere with the correction given to it for the expansion from
heat of the hydrogen gas in the tube. An inspection of my meteorological register
will show by a glance the inefficiency of the instrument as a substitute for the baro-
meter within the range of my observations. In fact, it constantly sunk with increase
of heat, and gradually rose with the return of cold. In very few instances in a whole
year was it found to have stood higher at 94 a.m., the period of the maximum atmo-
spheric pressure, than at sunrise; and in these trifling approximations to truth it
evidently deteriorated since the first record of its indications. A sympiesometer
in possession of the As8ay Master at Bombay was subject to the same defects. I
nevertheless continued my observations with the instrument sjmultaneously with the
barometers, to supply the inventor with the necessary elements for its correction,
should he desire to make use of them. I was further induced to keep the instru-
ment on my register, from the advantages I derived from the, attached elegant and
accurate thermometer, which had its degrees divided into fifths.

The temperature of the air was determined by two excellent DoLLoxD's FAnREN-
