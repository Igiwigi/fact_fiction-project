Sequel to an Essay on the Constitution of the Atmosphere, published in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1826 ; with some Account of the Sulphurets of
Lime. By Joun Dauron, D.C.L., F.R.S., &c.

Received June 9,—Read June 15, 1837. IN an essay of mine on the constitution of the atmosphere, which was printed in
the Transactions for 1826, I signified my intention of following it with a sequel of
experiments to ascertain if possible which of the two views therein deyeloped was
most countenanced by facts. I now proceed to give an account of such investiga-
tions relating to this subject as have engaged my attention during a long period of
years. It may be needful to premise certain facts which are, I believe, universally ad-
mitted as indisputable ; namely, that the atmosphere consists principally of two elastic
fluids, azote and oxygen, either mixed by some mechanical law, or otherwise com-
bined by a chemical principle in proportion nearly as four parts of the former to one
of the latter in volume; that the two elastic fluids may be obtained separately in
a state of purity ; that when thus obtained they may be mixed in all possible propor-
tions; and that the aggregate yolumes in such cases are just equal to the sum of the
two volumes of the ingredients : also, that any body which has a chemical affinity
for either of them $0 as to combine with it in a separate state, will also combine with
it in the mixed state.
