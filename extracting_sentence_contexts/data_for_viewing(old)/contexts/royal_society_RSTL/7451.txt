E 3. From these structural differences it is a fair inference that the segments have dif-
S ferent physiological meanings.

The higher refractive power, straight sides, and slender cylindrical or prismatic figure
of the outer segment may be adaptations for confining within the segment light incident
upon its end, and for preventing the lateral escape of light through the sides of the
segment into neighbouring cones and rods. 'These considerations incline me to adopt
the opinion that this segment has an optical function, an opinion which derives further
support from the fact that, in those animals in which the segment is 80 wide a cylinder
that a ray might be incident upon the inner surface of its sides at a 8mall enough angle
not to be reflected but to pass out, the segment is insulated by a sheath of black
pigment.

The inner segments of the cones and rods are the specially modified peripheral termi-

nations of the optic nerve-fibres; and at their junction with the outer segment the con
version of light into nerve-force may take place.
