| f(w)| is constant. The simplest example of this is presented by the curve-factor @, ; since the modulus
of this, within its linear range, is constant, a transformation in which f(w) consists
solely of a power of @, gives a free stream-line as part of the boundary. In fact, the
transformation

dz=A{w+(wâ€”cy*}*dw . . . . 1... (90)
gives a configuration of the general character indicated by fig. 1, with this special
