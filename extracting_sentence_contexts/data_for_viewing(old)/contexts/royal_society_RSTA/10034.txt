opposite signs, and approximately equal in magnitude.

This gives at once the physical explanation of the result (6). The rays pass
through approximately horizontally. If we compare two rays passing through at
different levels, the ray which passes through the regions of greater tension in N
passes through the regions of lesser tension (or greater pressure) in F, and the two
variations balance one another.

Further, since the amount of relative retardation as given by (7) involves only the
relative heights of the axes of the slabs and the source of light, the latter may be
moved parallel to the axes of the slabs without affecting the relative retardation.
Hence a horizontal line-source, parallel to the axes of the slabs, may be used instead
of a point-source. This was, in fact, indispensable in order to obtain the required
intensity.

§ 3. Description of the Apparatus.

Light from an are lamp L was passed through a condensing lens C and through a
thin horizontal slit T (fig. 2), which was placed from 24 to 3 metres away from the

glasses and straining apparatus. It was polarized by a Nicol P, whose polarizing
plane was roughly at 45° to the horizontal, and then passed through the two slabs N
and F, These were adjusted so that their levels differed very nearly by } centim.
