value of both ratios is shown by the tables in § 10 to be y’ = sin 8, where 8 is the
sun’s declination. If we compare the variations during the six summer months with
those during the six winter months, we must substitute for sin § its average value,
which is about 0°26. On the other hand, the results of my previous communication
allow us to deduce the ratios 0,7/0.? and ©,'/0,' from the observations, and we find in
this 0°6 and 0°8 respectively, or values between two and three times as great as those
calculated from the assumed law of conductivity.

To explain the difference we might imagine some cumulative effect, so that in
midsummer the conduction would be greater than in winter even for the same elevation
of the sun, but our present knowledge does not justify us in assuming this to be the
case. I am inclined, therefore, to consider that the cause of the discrepancy lies
in the fact that, as already suggested in the introductory remarks, the oscillations
responsible for the barometric and magnetic phenomena are to some extent independent
of each other, affecting different layers of the atmosphere. There are theoretical
reasons why this should be so. It is now, I think, generally recognised that the
importance of the semidiurnal variation of the barometer is due to the fact that the
free period of the atmospheric oscillation, dependent on the velocity potential y,*, is
very nearly equal to 12 hours. But it is to be remarked that if concentric layers of
the atmosphere be considered separately, there must be a considerable variation in
the free periods owing to differences of temperature, and in the highest regions, in
which alone electric currents of sufficient intensity can circulate, the temperature is
probably so low that the free periods would be more than doubled. If we take these
highest layers to oscillate to some extent independently, we should not therefore find
the semidiurnal variation stand out in the same way as it does for the lower layers.
