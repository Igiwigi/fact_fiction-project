Ten grammes of seed from each ginning were then weighed and counted out to obtain the mean seed weight. These operations began on August 12 and ended on November 5, taking two days in each week, and
making a total of 1300 pickings and ginnings, nearly 4000 weighings, and the counting of 150,000 seeds. The weighings for ginning out-turn were all made immediately after ginning, and are thus comparable
inter se although no correction is made for humidity ; hence the actual values are rather low, aided by the
fact that Giza is rather too far south for the Assili variety. Counting seeds in a known weight is both faster and safer than weighing a counted number when
native labour is employed. Grading.â€” About 500 grm.
