to see if there were any traces of such an event, but the surface, which had merely
been polished with fine emery, was much too rough for profitable investigation
under a high power. These anomalous crystals do not interfere with the normal
heat development of the film, and will not be further mentioned in its discussion.

The range of temperatures to which this film was subjected was wider than with
Ag 28. The first heating was for 1-5 hours at 230째 G, and sufficed to produce a
crop of particles, shown in fig. 16, Plate 16, taken by ordinary light, with ring
illuminator, at the same region as is represented in fig. 8.

Examination in polarized light, under higher magnification, showed the typical
figure. The fact that many of these particles are arranged ina straight line is a charac-
teristic which is discussed at length later. A second heating for 1-5 hours at 230째 C
produced little change. Heating for 1 hour at 300째 C led to the appearance of
further crystalline aggregates, and probably to some increase in size of those already

formed, fig. 17, Plate 16. The next heating, for 1-5 hours at 380째 C, produced a
definite change, which is not nearly so marked by scattered light, fig. 18, Plate 16, as
it is by transmitted light. The film constituting the general background to the
