44 shows a retonation-wave travelling more quickly than
g the wave reflected from the end of the tube. A study of a number of photographs
Â£ leads to the conclusion that the retonation is faster and more luminous when no other
Bbright waves have been thrown back by the advancing flame before the point of

& detonation is reached. & In considering the cause of the intensity of the retonation-wave we must remember
3 the facts illustrated in many of our photographs on collisions. The collision of two
3 flames, in which detonation had not yet been determined, gave rise to reflected waves
q more rapid and more luminous than the incident waves. Fig.
