One is postero-dorsal in
position and lodges the utricle and the semicircular canals, forming the canalicular
part of the auditory capsule. The other is antero-ventral in position, and accommodates
the ductus cochlearis of the saccule, forming the cochlear capsule. The shape and .
relations of the auditory capsule are difficult to describe, and this difficulty is increased
by the fact that the roof of the cochlear capsule appears to replace a part of the basal
plate, because it carries the suprafacial commissure and is attached to the alicochlear
commissure,

The medial and posterior relations of the auditory capsule have already been dealt
with, viz., the fusion with the basal plate medially and with the occipital arch posteriorly,
leaving the fissura metotica which is subdivided into foramen jugulare and apertura
medialis of the recessus scale tympani.
