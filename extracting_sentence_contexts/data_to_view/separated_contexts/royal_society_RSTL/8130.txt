When in motion the animal extends its tentacles and body to their
full length, thus becoming of nearly twice the length which it measures when at rest
and proportionately narrower. The tentacles are kept in motion in search of obstacles,
and the feet are moyed rapidly in pairs, the alternate pairs moving together with consi-
derable regularity, but at the same time with the peculiar progressive movement of a
caterpillar. The gait is, in fact, extremely like that of a caterpillar. There is never
any wriggling or 8inuous movement of the body like that in worms. The ventral
surface of the body is entirely supported free of the ground by the feet.
