Such observations as these militate strongly against the view of a special spindle
forming substance, either archoplasmic or kinoplasmic (cf. SrRAsBURGER (12)). They
point to the fact that the spindle forming or kinoplasmic fibres result from a
rearrangement of the ordinary cytoplasmic reticulum. That the spindle fibres stain more deeply with gentian violet, &c., than the other

* It is this substance which makes it so difficult to render visible the reticular structure of the cyto-
plasm. If the washing out with orange G. is insufficient, the substance in the meshes remains blue,
and obscures the reticulum; if the washing is carried too far, the blue of the reticulum becomes lost.
