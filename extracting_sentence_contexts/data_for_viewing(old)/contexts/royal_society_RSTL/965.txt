This peculiarity is a glandular substance, Surrounding the
cesophagus, immediately before it terminates in the stomach;
the orifices of which open on the internal membrane of the
cesophagus. Mr. MAcarTNey left me a drawing of the exter-
nal appearance. of the gland; when the stomach was in a
distended state, in which the muscular contraction between
the two portions was destroyed. He aid nothing about
the structure of the gland, and as it was a subject, which
did not then engage my attention, I thought no more about
it, In the course of the present enquiry it occurred to my
recollection, and upon comparing this gland with that of the
beaver (with which it corresponds very minutely in its internal
structure) it becomes a fact of no small importance in forming
a series of glandular structures belonging to the stomach: in
making use of this fact, I have great pleasure in acknowledg-
ing the source, from whence my first knowledge of it was
derived. This glandular structure viewed externally is like
a mulberry, being made up of a number of small projections ;
the orifices in the membrane of the cesophagus admit of disten-
Sion with air, and when expanded each orifice exposes three
