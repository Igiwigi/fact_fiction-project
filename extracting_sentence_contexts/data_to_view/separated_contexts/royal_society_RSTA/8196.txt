Again, putting p’ = p — 1, q’ = q, and then p’ = p, q’ = q—1, in 7.73, the number of
bounding figures

7.74 and 7.76 reveal the interesting fact that the numbers of vertices and of bounding
figures of the two types, take the same values (in different order) for three semi-reciprocal
polytopes. This fact naturally suggests, as a theorem worthy of consideration, that
the centres of the bounding figures of n,, are the vertices of polytopes similar to Pan

and q,,. Another way of saying this, is that the reciprocal of n,, has the vertices of

Pon X and Gry X 3 hence the name “ semi-reciprocal.” This fails when py = 0, because

Nog ( = %4n41) has only one type of bounding figure. But the theorem can hold
even in this case, if we make the convention

7.77 N-1)q = %n

(which agrees with 7.36, 7.42, 7.61, 7.72 and 7.74, though violating 7.71), and
re-enunciate it in the following form.

7.8.
