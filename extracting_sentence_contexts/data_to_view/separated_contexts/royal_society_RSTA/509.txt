However, the use of the matrix models has led to better SNR
figures, especially for the model that combines wavelet row-sparsity with a non-negative matrix
factorization. For the same constraint, the nonlinear model leads here to worse SNR results
compared with the linear model. This is due to the fact that the nonlinear model has significantly
more parameters. But once we start to use some of the constraints that are only available for
matrix models, such as the non-negative matrix decomposition constraint, we see improvements
over the linear model. The results for the Sheppâ€”Logan phantom are summarized in figures 6 and 7, where we show
box plots of the SNR values achieved with the different methods for 10 different random instances
of the two problem settings.
