The tetanus in each is instantaneously terminated by de-
stroying the corresponding portion of spinal marrow, the head, the limb, or
the tail, instantly manifesting a perfectly relaxed and flaccid condition of the
museles. The irritability remains unimpaired. 'These facts complete the proof that the phenomena which I have referred to
the reflex function, do not depend either upon sensation and volition, or upon
irritability. It is plain that the spasmodic actions in tetanus are not voluntary
actions, and they obey the same laws as the movements obseryed in an animal,
or parts of an animal, not tetanic, under the influence of stimuli. It is equally
plain that phenomena which depended upon excited irritability would not cease
whilst that irritability remained unimpairedÂ®.
