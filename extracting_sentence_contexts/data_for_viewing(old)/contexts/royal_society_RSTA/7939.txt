by the elimination of the vacant spaces between the rings; there will be a further
squeezing together and a uniform hexagonal pattern will be formed.


A. GRAHAM ON SHEAR PATTERNS IN AN UNSTABLE LAYER OF AIR. 295

Application of the Results to Cloud Forms.

8. The longitudinal, transverse and rectangular patterns may all be seen in the sky
in cloud formations. Photographs of these clouds have been published by WaLkur and
others. In these publications there has been no reference made to the fact that
the square pattern is at times placed diagonally to the shear. I have seen the
pattern in the sky associated closely with transverse rolls and disposed diagonally to
them, but unfortunately a photograph taken of the cloud was not very satisfactory.
The square pattern is often seen in a lenticular cloud bank, as shown by CuarKE,*
arranged with the diagonals along the long axis of the bank. In view of the fact that
in cloud banks of this type ripples are often seen which are clearly transverse to the
shear and are parallel to one set of diagonals, there is little doubt that the square pattern
is often aligned this way in the sky.

The “transitional” pattern of fig. 6 also occurs in the sky; examples of this are
shown by Ciarke, Plate 18 6, and in fig. 22, Plate 5, in this paper; this cloud form
has been seen to develop into the rectangular pattern.
