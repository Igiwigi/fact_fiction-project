I do not, therefore, admit
Bommer’s conclusion from this series of facts, that the position of the annulus in the
Cyatheaceze is determined by pressure. Nor do I think that pressure upon the developing sporangium can be held to be
the determining cause in other cases. The following facts bear on the question :—
In the Osmundacew, and especially in Todea barbara, the young sporangia are
pressed together in the still circinate leaf, so that they assume most irregular shapes ;
the apex may be flattened, and the sides may be squeezed and thrown into three,
four or five angles; but when mature, the sporangia show in their structure no trace
of these irregular early pressures. The same is the case also in Thyrsopteris. Con-
versely, in Gleichenia the sporangia stand quite aloof and free in their young state,
and are uniformly oval in form ; there is no sign of external or mutual pressure when
young, yet they develop a uniformly oblique annulus.
