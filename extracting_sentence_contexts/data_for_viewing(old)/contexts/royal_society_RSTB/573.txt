than the vertebral column, less specialized; so that it preserves structures, which
originally existed in the vertebral column, long after the vertebrae have lost them.*
I have compared the roof bones of the skull to the roof bones of the vertebral
column which exist in those plagiostomous Fishes in which there is a superior
intercalary segment introduced between two adjacent neural arches. This seems
to me to explain the presence in the skulls of lower Vertebrates of those bones
which have been termed inter-parietal, post-frontal, and pre-frontal. The inter-
parietal persists in some Mammals, and in some orders is absent. When it is
absent it is manifestly blended with the supra-occipital. I see no reason for
thinking that the inter-parietal gradually disappeared, and that the supra-occipital
grew at its expense; but, just as the inter-centrum may become blended with the
centrum, so these bones have blended with some associated elements in the skull.
The argument in favour of this interpretation rests upon the fact that in those Fishes
in which the intercalary neural elements are present the neural arches form an
unbroken continuous tube, whereas in those animals in which they are not found there
are more or less appreciable gaps between contiguous neural arches ; and, if any element
in the covering of the skull were absent, it seems more probable that a fontanelle
would result than that the other bones would take its place. Similarly, in certain
Chelonians, like Podocnemis and Rhinochelys, the pre-frontal bones retain the distinct
individuality which characterizes them in other Reptilia; whereas in the majority of
Chelonians this individuality is lost, and the pre-frontal bones are not differentiated
