Though the cells
forming its walls are arranged radially when seen in transverse section there is not
always a sharp line of demarcation between its ventral components and the subsomitic
mesoderm already mentioned. As development proceeds it becomes more difficult to
determine where somitic and subsomitic mesoderm meet. This difficulty arises chiefly
from the fact that the ventral wall of the somite forms a flowing mass of irregularly
shaped cells which soon lose to a certain extent their power to take up stain. These
cells are the primordia of the fat body and spread in a ventro-median direction over
the developing leg muscles whose development we have just considered (fig. 20). The
fat cells soon become vacuolated and separated into two masses, one of which lies against
the nerve cord, the other remaining in closer contact to the somitic mesoderm, so
forming the primordia of the ventral and dorsal fat-bodies respectively (fig. 17).
