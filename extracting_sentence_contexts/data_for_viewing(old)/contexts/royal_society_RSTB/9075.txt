thresholds, breakpoints and nonlinear relationships between the
environment and key demographic variables that are at the heart
of many biological processes. While this criticism is valid for
some statistical approaches, such as various tree-based modelling
approaches (where each node on the tree identifies a key value of
one or more environmental variable that splits a subset of the
data into presence and absence categories; the same variable
may appear in several different places and levels within the
tree, and with different key values, making biological interpret-
ation difficult), nonlinear discriminant analysis is based on the
assumption of a multivariate normal response of a species to cli-
matic variables, and can allow for thresholds, breakpoints and
nonlinearities. Key here is the fact that nonlinear discriminant
analysis allows the observations to be split into a number of
clusters (for both presence and absence observations), thus


accommodating a limited but realistic variety of responses of
species to environmental variables.

Briefly, data were extracted for all the Fourier processed vari-
ables at each presence and pseudo-absence site in the three
training sets. Before analysis, the data were clustered, using the
k-means clustering algorithm in SPSS v22 (Â©IBM Corporation
and others), into between one and eight clusters each for pres-
