Whether they act
directly, or by producing through their continued oxidation a lowering of the oxygen
pressure of the blood, we cannot say. We come, lastly, to the changes in blood concentration at high altitudes. Of the
stimulus to these changes no more can be said than of the stimulus to the change


PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS MADE ON PIKE’S PEAK, COLORADO. 303

in alkalinity, As affording some support, however, to the idea that abnormal
oxidation of metabolites in the blood causes an actual fall in the percentage saturation
of the blood within the average capillaries, we may mention the fact that it seemed
to us that the samples of blood drawn from the fingers on Pike’s Peak were on the
whole darker in colour than similar samples taken at sea-level. We were at any
rate somewhat struck by the contrast between the dark colour of these samples and
the particularly bright colour of the lips, face, &c. As shown in Section IX., there are two distinct reactions in connection with the
increase in the hzemoglobin percentage at high altitudes.
