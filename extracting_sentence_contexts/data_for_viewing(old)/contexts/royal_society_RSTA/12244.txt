s black nodes and m — s white nodes; to the left there are similarly placed s
nodes and m — s black nodes.

Of the graph of the number there are m points to the right of the centre at
white and black nodes can be placed in 2” distinct ways. Hence it at once foll
that the number 2m -+ 1 possesses in all 2" inversely conjugate composit
Otherwise, we may say that the number of inversely conjugate compositi
2m + 1 is equal to the number of compositions of m + 1.

It will be observed that the number 2m + 1 has precisely the same number, 2!
self-inverse compositions.

There is, in fact, a one-to-one correspondence between the compositions of 2m 4
which are inversely conjugate, and those which are self-inverse.
’ To explain this, take the graph last represented. Read according to the bl
nodes we obtain the inversely conjugate composition

(23121) of the number 9.

To proceed to the corresponding self-inverse composition obliterate the black no
to the right of the centre, and also the white nodes to the left of the cer
Substituting white nodes for the black nodes then remaining we have the graph
