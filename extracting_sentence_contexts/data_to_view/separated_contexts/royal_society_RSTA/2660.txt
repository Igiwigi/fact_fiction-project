The whole system is then divided up into 100 different grid cells, each
containing 20 x 20 elements, and the scaling coefficient B is calculated for the activity on each
different grid cell, by a least-squares fit to the rank size distribution. Similar results are also found
if the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) method [31] is used. The limitations in the resolution (both spatial and temporal) come from the facts that (i) the
locations of individual avalanches are imprecisely known, as the exact locations are convolved
with a mask of size ¢, and (ii) the system is divided into several (in this case 100) observation
boxes. It is important to note that the observation of a ‘subsample’ within the whole sample is not
