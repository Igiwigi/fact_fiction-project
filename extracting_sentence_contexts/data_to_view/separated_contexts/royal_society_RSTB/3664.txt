I have also shown in my earlier account of the development of the pineal organs
(Denby, 1899, b) that at Stage R pigment granules, similar to those found in the
pineal eye and sac, may occur in the corpuscles in the blood-vessels which lie between

the paraphysial tubules just (at this stage) beneath the pineal eye. This fact seems
to me to suggest that the pigment is migrating towards the pineal eye, for we can
hardly suppose that there is sufficient in the latter to require carrying away at this
early stage in its development; indeed, it has only just begun to make its
appearance in the retina. Tn two very interesting papers (Bernarp, 1896, a, b) dealing with the origin of
the sense of sight and the possible derivation of the Vertebrate eyes, both pineal and
lateral, from the skin, published as far back as 1896, H. M. Bernarp has already
expressed the view that the pigment-granules migrate into the eye from the
surrounding tissues. This migration in the case of the lateral eyes is greatly
obscured by secondary complications in the structure of the eye, but in the case of
the pineal eye BerNnarp (1896, b) observes: “I would call attention to Srencer’s
figures, a study of which leaves no doubt whatever that the pigmented cells are
streaming from the connective tissue capsule round the eye through the retina, just
as in the rest of the skin they stream out from the cutis through the palisade layer of
the epidermis.
