One note of caution is that the mixing-to-eruption time scales for mafic systems discussed

above tend to be shorter than the centuries to millennia of reactivation of near-solidus bodies : 3
to produce intermediate or silicic eruptions, and it is possible that mafic magma reservoir SS
systems are on average hotter than more evolved systems. Although mixing-to-eruption times :B
are typically short, it is still possible that the crystals in mafic magmas include cores that had :F
protracted storage in lower-temperature regions of the reservoir. In fact, some crystals in mafic : a
systems do show evidence for derivation from a crystal mush, implying relatively cold storage : =
and rapid remobilization (e.g. [73-76]), or perhaps endogenous development of a crystal mush : =
within a sill over a period of months prior to remobilization [48]. More data are needed in order to 1B
test whether mush storage (whether protracted or brief) is generally the case for crystals in mafic : =
systems, and if so to better understand the implications for the long-term thermal conditions in ZR
these reservoirs. Whatever the eventual result of a comprehensive study of the thermal conditions : o
of magma storage across magma compositions, it is clear that combining different types of : ~
data (e.g. crystallization ages with crystallization temperatures and with constraints on thermal :3
histories from diffusion durations) can be a powerful tool to understand the thermal history of : Ss
the parts of the reservoir sampled by the crystal cargo, and studies of this nature represent an 7

exciting avenue for future research.
