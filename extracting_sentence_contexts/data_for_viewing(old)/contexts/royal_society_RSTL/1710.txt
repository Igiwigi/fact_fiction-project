When the wire was very fine, and the gases had been mixed
in explosive proportions, the heat of the wire became suffi-
ciently intense to cause them to detonate. In mixtures, which
were non-explosive from the redundancy of one or other
gas, the combination of their, bases went on silently, and. the

Facts analogous to these were announced, in the autumn
of last year, by Professor DoprrxINER of Jena, with this ad-
ditional and striking circumstance, that when platinum in a
spongy form is introduced into an explosive mixture of oxy-
gen and hydrogen, the metal, even though its temperature
had not been previously raised, immediately glows, and
causes the union of the two gases to take place, sometimes
sllently, at others with detonation. It is remarkable, how-
