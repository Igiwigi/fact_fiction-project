nu’ (1—487—4,”) respectively.

As to the latter it may be noticed that the exact equation for refraction of a ray
impinging at the origin, and in the plane Ozy, is

w sin (tan-? 8) = w’ sin (tan-' 6’)
or, to our order,

un (1—$6*). 8 = nw’ (1-48"). 6.

Hence the aberration y may be described as due purely to the obliquity of the ray
to the axis, and the aberration w to the lateral separation from the axis, and we see
that the somewhat remarkable fact that two functions w, y suffice to express the
aberrations of every ray may be stated in the form that there is no term which is
produced jointly by obliquity and lateral separation.

If in any instrument we have a number of surfaces each introducing aberrational
terms, and if the schemes preceding and following the surface (7) be compounded so
as to read, say, {g,...}, {g’, ...}, then the whole may be represented by
