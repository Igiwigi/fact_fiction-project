higher than the neutral midpoint, and therapeutic transformations even more so than transformations used to enhance user capacities. (b) Situations in which
transformations aimed at weakening the two negative emotions of anxiety or anger were better accepted than situations in which transformations aimed to enhance
smiling. (c) Across situations, acceptability was positively associated with the participants’ familiarity with science fiction. Bottom row: covert use involving lying
about the true purpose of the transformation in order to improve its effectiveness. (d) Participants considered it morally acceptable that the user of the trans-
