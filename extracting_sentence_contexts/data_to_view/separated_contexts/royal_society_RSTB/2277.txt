Case 1 is normal, Case 4 which showed a relatively slight degree of
dementia approaches most nearly to the normal. Cases 5 and 6 of infants aged
respectively three months and one month come next in order, and Cases 3 and 4
of pronounced chronic insanity with dementia, occupy the last place on the list. This is a point of considerable importance in view of the facts that the 4th and 5th
layers show no constant variation, and that layer 3 as a whole is of the same thick-
ness respectively in the three patients with normal vision, and in the three cases of
blindness. In Table IV. (fig. 52), a similar relation is seen in the respective depth of
the conjoined 1st and 2nd layers of the cortex in the different cases.
