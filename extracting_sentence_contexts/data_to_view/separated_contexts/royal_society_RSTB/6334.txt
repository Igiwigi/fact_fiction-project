There
is no longer any necessity for the development of a centripetal fibre, for the body
of the ganglion cell is far removed from the primary sense cells. The sole function
of the bipolar element is to transmit impulses along the length of the cord, for which
purpose bipolarity of the cell would be induced. The Neurofibrillaaâ€”Reference has already been made to the fact that the greater
part of the thickness of the radial nerve cord is made up of the subepithelial plexus
of neurofibrillae. Most of these fibrillae belong to the association ganglion cells,
but the central fibres of the primary sense cells contribute, to some extent, to the
total fibrillar substance. One may say, in general terms, that the fibrillae of the radial cord run in a
longitudinal direction although, as has been seen, the central fibres of the sensory
cells, in the first part of their course, run at right angles to this axis.
