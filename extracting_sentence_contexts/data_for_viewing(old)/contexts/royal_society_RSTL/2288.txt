the zinc were in the acid whilst the platina was in the alkali, or whether the re-
verse order were chosen, the electric current was always from the zinc through the
electrolyte to the platina, and back through the galvanometer to the zinc, the cur-
rent seeming to be strongest when the zinc was in the alkali and the platina in the
acid.

940. In these experiments, therefore, the acid seems to have no power over the
alkali, but to be rather inferior to it in force. Hence there is no reason to 8uppose
that the combination of the oxide formed with the acid around it has any direct in-
fluence in producing the electricity evolved, the whole of which appears to be due to
the oxidation of the metal (919.).

941. The alkali, in fact, is superior to the acid in bringing a metal into what is
called the positive state ; for if plates of the same metal, as zinc, tin, lead, or copper,
be used both in the acid or alkali, the electric current is from the alkali across the
cell to the acid, and back through the galvanometer to the alkali, as Sir Humeary
Davy formerly stated*. This current is s0 powerful, that if amalgamated zinc, or tin,
or lead be used, the metal in the acid evolves hydrogen the moment it is placed in
communication with that in the alkali, not from any direct action of the acid upon
it, for if the contact be broken the action ceases, but because it is powerfully negative
with regard to the metal in the alkali.

942. The superiority of alkali is further proved by this, that if zinc and tin be used,
or tin and lead, whichever metal is put into the alkali becomes positive, that in the
acid being negative. Whichever is in the alkali is oxidized, whilst that in the acid
