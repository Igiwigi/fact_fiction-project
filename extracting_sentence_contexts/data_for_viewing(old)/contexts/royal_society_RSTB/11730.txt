report only.

Several arguments have been raised for why no-report
paradigms are important in consciousness research [31],
whereas others have pointed out that such paradigms
cannot work alone [32]. One main finding in no-report exper-
iments has been that neural correlates of visual consciousness
are more related to activity in occipital regions than in pre-
frontal regions [33,34]â€”a finding that is in accordance with
many report-based experiments (e.g. [35,36]), although not
all [37]. These experiments seem to suggest that prefrontal
activations that have been suggested to be correlates of con-
sciousness may, in fact, be correlates of functions related to
reporting.

Block has suggested that such results from no-report para-
digms also show that there are different neural correlates of
A- and P-consciousness: for visual perception, P-consciousness


is related to occipital regions, whereas A-consciousness is
related to prefrontal regions. The argument seems intuitively
strong, yet it is also premature to consider the findings
evidence for the dissociation between A and P. First of all,
it is difficult to make conclusions about functions on the
