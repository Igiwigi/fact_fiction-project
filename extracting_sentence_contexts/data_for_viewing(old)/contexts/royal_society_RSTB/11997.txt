Jennifer Donelson is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the ARC Centre of Excellence for
Coral Reef Studies located at James Cook University in Townsville Australia. Her love for the
ocean led her to complete her PhD in 2012 at James Cook University, before becoming a Chancellor’s
Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Life Sciences at the University of Technology, Sydney from
2013-2016. Jenni’s research began with an interest in parental effects and the impact that environ-
mental quality has on offspring phenotypes, subsequently expanding to explore the capacity for
within- and across-generational plasticity to ocean warming in marine fish. Her current research con-
tinues to focus on the plastic and adaptive capacity of marine fish in the face of changing
environmental conditions.
