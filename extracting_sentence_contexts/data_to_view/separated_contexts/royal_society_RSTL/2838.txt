But though the order and cycles of these changes were the same for the observed
diurnal inequality and for the lunar declination, the epochs of the changes were not
the same. According to theory, as we have said, the diurnal inequality ought to

yanish when the moon is in the equator. But it appeared that in fact the diurnal in-
equality did not yanish till about four days after that period. By taking the moon's declination four days anterior to the day of obseryation, and
reducing it to a proper scaje, it was found that the amount of the diurnal inequality
could be represented with great accuracy, as may be seen in the Plates, which are spe-
cimens of a comparison of this kind made for the whole of the years 1833 and 1834. It is to be observed, however, that the calculation of the diurnal inequality from
the declination was made by means of a coefficient which was somewhat different in
different months.
