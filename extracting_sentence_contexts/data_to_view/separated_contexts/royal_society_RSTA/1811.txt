Is this ¢4 the renormalized energy density
vac of the quantum vacuum? No, because the corresponding pressure pyac must be éyac/3. This
is a consequence of the fact that the energy of an electromagnetic wave is equal to its momentum

times the speed of light. The energy of a volume element filled with incoherent radiation must : =
therefore be equal to the momentum transfer, i.e. the pressure, in the three directions of space, : =
which gives €yac = 3pvac- 18

So where does €, and pa come from? Consider the conservation of energy and momentum : -
as expressed in the second Friedmann equation (2.3).
