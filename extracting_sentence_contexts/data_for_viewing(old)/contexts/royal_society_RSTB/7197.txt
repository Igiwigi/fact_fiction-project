with their long axis in the plane of the membrane, but otherwise at random.

The anterior wing margin bears scales that never flatten but continue to grow as cylinders.
Two sizes are shown in figures 13 and 14, plate 1. They may be compared with the bristles
of other insects, and in particular with the bristles of Drosophila, previously examined by
Lees & Picken (1945). For the sake of convenience they will be referred to as hair-scales.

Comparable to the hair-scales are the very much larger rudiments which develop into
the frenulumâ€”a tuft of stout bristles emerging from near the base of the hind wing on its
anterior border. The earliest recognizable frenulum rudiments show scarcely elongated
processes emerging from the wing margin (figure 28, plate 2). The sunken cell bodies also
show traces of birefringence. As elongation continues the birefringence of the frenulum
hairs increases (figures 29, 30, 31 and 32, plate 2). This is shown by the fact that in order
to compensate the rudiment to blackness, the 74g W.L. plate has to be rotated farther from
the null position; if, after compensating to blackness, the rudiment is rotated into the
addition position, the field is increasingly bright with successively older rudiments. This
may mean that the thickness of oriented material deposited in the cell membrane is
increasing, or that the degree of orientation of material already deposited is increasing
with age. Both may well occur.

The growth of the hair-scales, and of the bristles composing the frenulum, as elongating
mates ni merease is constant (Lees & Picken 1945).

In contrast, the rudiments on the lateral wing margins soon become club-shaped; their
