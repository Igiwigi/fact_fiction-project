direction of the cellulose chains in the wall corresponds to the ‘‘ major extinction
position” so that there must be only a single set of chains in the wall. Similar
determinations were carried out by them, on other cells, sometimes with the same
result. While their work is of considerable value from the present point of view
it is not definitely conclusive. The X-ray work was carried out on bundles of cotton
hairs and the determination under the polarizing microscope was an average of
readings from many cells. It seemed, therefore, essential to the present purpose to

determine by an X-ray method the direction of the cellulose chains in a single wood

cell and to relate this with the extinction positions of the wall. This is rendered

somewhat simpler by the fact that some tracheids on maceration are found to show

certain cracks, parallel to the major extinction position which previous workers have
assumed parallel to the cellulose chains, forming a single spiral round the cell. If
we can show that the cellulose chains are, in fact, parallel to the cracks, any doubt
as to the existence of a single spiral in these walls would be dispelled. The X-ray
photography of such minute cells presents a difficult problem ; their scattering
power is far too small to give a diagram in the ordinary spectrometer. Under the
