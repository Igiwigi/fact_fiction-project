1), probably give a very fair
indication of the fall in vitality of the leaf: :

It will be obvious that Kreuster’s results are not in the least the expression, as
he conceived them to be, merely of the effect of the temperature on the assimilation,
but are the outcome of the most various causes, so complicated, that it is impossible
to extricate from them the simple temperature effect. (ii) Consideration of the Researches of Other Investigators. The remaining investigations, except those of Hemricu, amount to little more than
a general confirmation of the fact that temperature does affect assimilation and more
or less isolated determinations of the lowest temperature at which this function
persists. Croiiz and Gratroter(6) (1851) found that for water-plants, the lowest
temperature at which assimilation would take place, was 10-15° C.

As regards land plants Boussincauur (7) (1867) found that oxygen was produced
by Pinus laricio and by certain grasses at temperatures of —0°5 C. to +3°5 C.,
from which he concludes that green trees and the grass of the meadows may very
well assimilate throughout the winter. No importance need be attached to the work of Francoprrt (8) (1864), who

attempted to express the connection between the assimilation and the temperature
by a mathematical formula.
