250 HAROLD JEFFREYS ON THE

The respective values of y*, the numbers of groups (reduced by 3 to convert to degrees
of freedom) and the corresponding values of P(x) from Fisher’s table are as follows. Against them I give Pearson’s values:

H.J. K.P.
n tid . n
Bisection 1 10 0-22 M4
2 13 O78 17
3 1 0-08 14
Bright line 1 9 O18 15 0-0006
2 9 O44 13 0-0000
3 15 05, vi 0-2933

Comparing the determinations of P we see that there are great differences, presumably
owing to the fact that I have grouped more of the regions with small expectations
together. None of my values of P would usually be taken as decisive evidence against
the law tested. Pearson, for the second “ Bright-line” series, remarks that the P would
differ from zero only in the tenth place; I get a perfectly normal value, He also gets a
value of y* for the first bright-line series that would imply rejection of the hypothesi
mine is within the expectation and its standard error, The reason is presumably that
these series contain outlying observations at distances where deviations would be
practically impossible according to the normal law.
