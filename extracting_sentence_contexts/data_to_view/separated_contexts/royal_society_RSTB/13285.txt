In C. virginica,
tandem duplication is the predominant evolutionary process
responsible for this expansion and is an ongoing process
[36,38]. In particular, gene duplications leading to the expan-
sion of gene families related to immunity may provide an
evolutionary advantage, for example in pathogen recognition
through increased diversity of recognition receptors [38]. This
exposure to the environmental variation that could select for
different variants, along with the fact that oysters are known
to be highly polymorphic [39,40], suggests that the additional
copies of particular genes in individuals could function as a
significant component of standing variation in this species
that may have led to gene family diversity. In order to understand the link between variation and
adaptation, we first need a better understanding of variation. Owing to the recognized importance of expanded gene
families in oysters, we focus our analysis on duplications
rather than other forms of structural variation.
