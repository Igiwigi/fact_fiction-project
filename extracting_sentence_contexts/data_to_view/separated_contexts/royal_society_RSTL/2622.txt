Should this ingenious
experiment really prove the diffusion of a stratum of an invisible subtle fluid over the
two surfaces of the plate, it would at the same time equally well demonstrate the
existence of electricity upon the interior surface of a hollow body, as, for example,
upon a hollow cylinder, into which we may suppose the steel plate in question to be
formed, since we have shown (28.) that the intensities evinced by a given quantity
of electricity are the same in both cases, and that consequently the distribution, 80
far as respects these two surfaces, must be similar.

47. Should the inductive susceptibility of the tangent disc be at any time, by its
position in respect of the electrical particles, reduced to zero, or nearly s0, it would
then fail to become in any degree charged, and would be as inefficient as a plate of
varnished glass or any other non-conductor, the inductive susceptibility of which is
80 little, that it will not, under ordinary circumstances, take up the least electricity
on being applied to a charged body. Now it is not improbable that a small insulated
plate plunged within a spherical charged hell is thus circumstanced : it may hence
fail to become charged, even although electricity should really exist there, and which
fact we have experimentally shown (31.). Similar effects would ensue in placing a
neutral body under any other circumstances involving similar conditions, as in placing
a very small conducting ball immediately between two large electrified globes. The
small globe does not, under these circumstances, according to CouLonBs, take up any
free electricity.
