It is now necessary to make the transition from lowest order perturbation theory to dressed
perturbation theory by the standard techniques. This involves the following steps:

(a) The self-energy, Green function and the correlation function in equation (3.10) are
changed to their dressed counterparts X(k, w), G(k, w) and Ci(k, @).

(b) It is assumed that the self-energy dominates the relaxation process (i.e. 2(k) >> (A, v)k?)—
a fact that will be justified a posteriori for the inertial range. The relevant self-energy
for relaxations is the zero frequency self-energy, i.e. we will be considering line shapes
(fluctuation spectrum) to be Lorentzian.

(c) There is only one time scale in the problem—i.e. the heat mode and the velocity mode
decay with the same power law in the inertial range. This actually is ensured by the
velocity nonlinearity, which in principle should have been present in equation (2.102)
and will be discussed in §4.
