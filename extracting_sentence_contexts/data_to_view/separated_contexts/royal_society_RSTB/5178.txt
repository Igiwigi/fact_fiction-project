and healthy roots inside the older petioles. Viewing the facts as they are, and they
have been sufficiently discussed above, we may conclude that these invading roots
entered only the stumps of fallen or decayed leaves, and that they grew downwards
till their progress was arrested by the living cells of the leaf-base. ‘The xylem strands
of the leaf-stumps might still have conducted a feeble stream of water, while possibly
the humified remains of the softer tissues may have provided the roots with assimilable
food materials. Thus it is not inconceivable that this Paleozoic tree-fern actually
reared itself, in part at least, ‘‘ upon its own ashes.”
