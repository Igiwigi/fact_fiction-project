type, also ceases to apply. This last result suggests the question, whether stability
would in fact be demonstrated if we could prove that all “normal” disturbances (te,

solutions characterised by simple exponential time factors) inevitably decay. We
state our reasons for believing that the proof would be sufficient as regards stability
for infinitesimal disturbances. This appears to be the view of most workers on the
subject.

7. The only paper we have found which investigates in detail the dependence of the
time factor upon “ Reynoups’ number ” is that of L. Horr (Ann. der. Phys.,’ 1914).
Hopr’s investigation indicates stability for infinitesimal disturbances ; but it is subject
to some quantitative uncertainty, estimated by him as never greater than 10 per cent.,
arising from the fact that he replaces Bessel functions by their semi-convergent series
and retains only the first terms of these. We believe that it reveals with sufficient
accuracy all the main features of the problem, and that Hopr’s conclusion in regard to the
stability is correct. But the failure of the conjugate relations between normal disturb-
ances (§6) makes it necessary to regard the use of approximations with considerable
distrust. Rayieicu, commenting on the work of Horr and von Mises, remarked :
“Doubtless the reasoning employed was sufficient for the writers themselves, but the
statements of it put forward hardly carry conviction to the mere reader.’*
