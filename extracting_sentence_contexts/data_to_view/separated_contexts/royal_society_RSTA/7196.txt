In the extreme case of the resistance depending only
on potential barriers (n, slowly varying with temperature), the coefficient of v( 7’) would
be constant for a given illumination. This requires 7,/7,, to be constant, and therefore ¢;
and o,, to increase equally rapidly with 7. The curves in figures 15 and 17 show that this
is not the case, in fact, not only are the plots of log 7, and log 7; quite dissimilar, but ¢;
actually decreases with increasing temperature, so long as ¢;>¢,. On the other hand, the
assumption that v(7') is constant would require ¢; a constant for 7,>0,, and this is very
much closer to the experimental results. The relatively slow decrease in 0; with increasing
temperature may, perhaps, be due to a slow decrease in mobility arising from increased
scattering by lattice vibrations.
