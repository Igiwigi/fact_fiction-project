has no counterpart in Estheria. In the latter the lumen of the duct of the antennal
gland is of uniform calibre throughout and also the cytoplasm of all three cells of the
duct system is continuous. However there appears no reason for considering this funnel
to have any special morphological significance. Its presence is probably connected
with the fact that the lumen of the efferent duct cell is considerably wider than that of
the loop cells.

Apart then from these details of structure, the antennal gland of the Ostracods
examined agrees very closely with the antennal gland of those Branchiopoda in which the
anatomy has been described.

A comparison of the antennal gland with maxillary gland of the Ostracods described
in this paper also shows a considerable degree of resemblance. ‘Ihe general construc-
tion is the same in the two glands and is, of course, typical. ‘The end sacs are very
similar in their histological details. The development of the maxillary end sac indicates
clearly that it must represent a coelomic sac. Its cavity appears as a split in a mass
of mesoderm and never has any communication with the hemoccelic body cavity.
