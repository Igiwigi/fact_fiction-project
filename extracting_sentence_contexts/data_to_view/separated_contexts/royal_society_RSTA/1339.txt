So, we confine attention to examples. A familiar biological example of a structure of the type shown in figure 5b is the microtubule. In
fact, it is argued in [33] that the axial seam of the microtubule is functional and aids in assembly
and disassembly of the microtubule.

(b) Viruses and quasi-crystals

In this section, we explain a relation between the use of non-discrete groups and known methods
of describing the structures of animal viruses and quasi-crystals.

(i) Virus structure

Reidun Twarock, Thomas Keef and collaborators [34-38] developed a way of looking at the
structure of icosahedral viruses, especially of the families Papovaviridae and Nodaviridae, that

atoms not seeing the typical local environment lie on a seam.
