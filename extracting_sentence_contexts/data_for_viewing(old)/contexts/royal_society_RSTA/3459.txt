These probabilities depend on the initial state % of the pair of players. By using the representation
of W% as superposition of the ‘certainty states’ gy, (see (3.1)) and Born’s rule, these probabilities
can be represented as

=p;(j;0), i=1,2, 7=0,1.

piGi) = lajol? + lajal? and p2(j) =leo,l* + lor,

for j = 0,1. In fact, for instance, we have p1(0) = (goo, 0)? + |(go1, %) |? and so on. If Yo is non-
factorizable (entangled), then p;(j) cannot be expressed solely in terms of the state of G and vice

°We do not claim that QBism is the proper interpretation of quantum physics. See Khrennikov [50] for reflections from one
of the authors of this paper on the applicability of QBism in quantum physics. But it is very natural to use it for our purpose
[33,50] for a motivation. We also remark that originally classical game theory and the theory of DM was formulated by
von Neumann & Morgenstern [7] in the statistical probabilistic framework: probabilities were treated from the frequentist
viewpoint. However, Savage [53] reformulated it by using the subjectivist viewpoint on probability. Nowadays, the latter is
dominating the foundations of DM and the axiomatic foundation of economics, but with the strong emphasize of the role of
Bayesian inference.
