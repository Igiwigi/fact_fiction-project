1-070 gm. of carbon (22 per cent.), while Ag. 15 gives 0-356 gm. (9 per cent.). Neither
species shows any other item of biochemical interest. It is obvious that both these
species, and particularly Clasterosporium species, Ag. 64, are worthy of further investiga-
tion, and an account of an investigation of the metabolic products of Clasterosporium,
species Ag. 64, is given in Part XVII.

Genus 7. Rhacodium, 1 species.
(1) Rhacodium cellare Prrs., Catalogue No. Ag. 13. Isolated at Ardeer from
wine cellar debris.

The carbon balance sheet for this species is given in Table XIII.

The only point of biochemical interest about this carbon balance sheet is the fact
that Rhacodium cellare appears to form small amounts, 0-158 gm. (6-3 per cent.), of
a non-volatile acid which may possibly be optically dextro-rotatory, since there is a
considerable difference between the glucose as estimated by the polarimeter (1-512
per cent.) and by the Saarrer-HaRTMaNN method (1-257 per cent.). With the exception
of this there is a complete absence of any other features of biochemical interest.
