The histogram on the right side shows that the distribution
is Gaussian. The mean value is 298.77 K, with a standard deviation of the mean of 0.13K, in
a satisfactory agreement with the set point [54]. The use of the Voigt profile can be justified
by the fact that the mean free-path of the molecules, L is much larger than 4/27. From the
kinetic theory of gases, assuming that the molecules behave like hard spheres, it turns out that
T=kgT/ (x0*/2p), o and p being the molecular diameter and the gas pressure, respectively. Using
the 12-6 Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential, it is possible to calculate the classical second
virial coefficient, from which o can be determined [56].
