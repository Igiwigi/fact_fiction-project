Post mortem Examination.—The only lesion in
the brain was a cauterized spot of the size of
a threepenny bit, corresponding to the bicipital
centre in the ascending frontal convolution (se
fig. 8). These three experiments, besides others where Fig. 8 represents the left hemisphere of the
the same regions became involved indirectly as re je "hs tins ty
the result of other experiments*, afford a simple convolution marked by the letter f indicates
and conclusive proof that the movements which the ion, I ND wa ALevE
are excited by the application of the electrodes
to the surface of the hemispheres in these regions are due to excitation of the grey
matter of the cortex, seeing that destruction of these same areas canses paralysis of
the same movements, while sensation remains unaffectedF. In the first experiment the more or less complete destruction of the cortex in the
region of the fissure of Rolando caused complete hemiplegia on the opposite side of
the body, affecting all the unilateral movements capable of being called into play by
the electric irritation. - In the next two, only those movements were paralyzed which had
their special centres destroyed in the cortex of the opposite hemisphere.

+ I am aware that tho conclusion here stated, and which scems to me well established by the above facts,
apparently stands in diametric contradiction to the conclusions which Heraaxy (f Archiv fiir Physiologie,”
Band x. Hefte 2 & 3, p. 77) has arrived at from a few similar experiments on the motor centres of the brain of
dogs. He concludes that because dogs ultimately recover completely from such disturbances of motor func-
tions as are a firs caused by the ablation of cortical centres, these centres cannot be motor in the true sense
of the term.
