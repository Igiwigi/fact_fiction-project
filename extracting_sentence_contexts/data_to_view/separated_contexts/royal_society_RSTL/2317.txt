We have yet to notice another seeming exception to the general law (16.) ob-
servable in accumulating variable quantities of electricity on insulated conductors,
and which is found to occur in that peculiar kind of accumulation induced in a body
by electrical influence. Many striking facts lead us to conclude, that excitation by induction, as above
stated (4. 5.), is the immediate effect of a tendency of accumulated electricity to a
given 5tate, or mode of existence : hence an electrified substance is obseryed to exert
a peculiar kind of influence upon surrounding bodies. The immediate result of this
influence, is a sort of temporary change, or displacement, of the electricity which
these bodies already possess; $0 that if they be insulated, a species of accumulation
is apparent in certain parts of them, depending upon a new disposition or state of
their own electricity. Now the attractive force thus induced in a neutral &nbstance,
by the immediate influence of a charged conductor, appears to be as the quantity of
the free electricity in operation directly, that is, as the intensity or exciting cause ;
and as the simple distance between the points of the opposed bodies inversely, which
may be gathered from the following experiments.
