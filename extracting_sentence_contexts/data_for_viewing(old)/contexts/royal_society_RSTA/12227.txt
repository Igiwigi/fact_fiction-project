Esuccessive additions of oxygen retard the rate more than the additions of nitrogen—
‘2 just as in the case of electrolytic gas. This means that in the cyanogen explosion the
B excess of oxygen and carbonic oxide are as inert towards each other (as far as the
propagation of the wave is concerned) as the excess of oxygen and steam are in the
= explosion of electrolytic gas. On the other hand, the carbonic oxide formed in the
= explosion of hydrocarbons, with excess of oxygen, meets with the steam also formed in
§ the flame. This is the condition necessary for its most rapid oxidation. We should
= expect, therefore, to find in the explosions of hydrocarbons that the retarding action
3 of large quantities of oxygen is partly counteracted by this secondary reaction, for the
E oxygen in presence of the steam is not inert towards the carbonic oxide. Asa matter

of fact, we find that the first additions of oxygen to the hydrocarbon mixtures retard
A more than nitrogen, but as the additions are continued the oxygen has less and less
retarding influence compared with the nitrogen.

When carbonic oxide, which has the same density as nitrogen, is added to
electrolytic gas, the retarding effect on the explosion is very nearly the same as when
an equal volume of nitrogen is added :—

* The greenish-grey tint, observable in the outer flame, may be due to some oxide of nitrogen formed
in the inner flame. A little peroxide of nitrogen gives a similar tint to an ordinary Bunsen gas flame ;
and peroxide of nitrogen is formed when cyanogen is burnt under certain conditions (vide ‘Chem. Soe.
Journ.,’ 1886, vol. 1, p. 390).
