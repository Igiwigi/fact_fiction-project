The conelusion to be drawn from this table is obvious. The divergence from Onw's
law increases rapidly as the conditions become less and less favourable to the pre-
8ervation of the film in a constant state. The amount of the divergence shown by
films in the same class varies considerably ; but this is accounted for by the fact that
the range of thickness observed, the time during which the film lasted, and the amount
of change in the hygrometer and thermometer during that time, are very irregular. There is only one film, however, for which the figure in column TIL. is less than those
which occur in Class I. In the case of this film (October 1, I) none of the usual pre-
cautions were taken, but two dishes of dilute sulphuric acid (specific gravity 1:159) were
introduced into the inner chamber.
