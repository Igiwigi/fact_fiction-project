64 DR. PHILIP ON THE NERVOUS AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS

It is true that as mechanical impulse affecting a nerve of yoluntary motion
is capable, after its separation from the brain and spinal marrow, of exciting,
through it, the muscle in which it terminates, and we cannot be assured that
we have separated from the muscular fibre the whole of the neryes with which
it is 80 intimately blended; if we were in possession of no other facts on the
subject, we should be led to the inference, that the excitability of the muscular
fibre can only be influenced through its nerves ; but when instead of a mecha-
nical, we employ a chemical agent, we find the result very different. We
attempt in vain to influence a muscle through the nerve which terminates in
it by the most powerful agent of this description, yet such an agent when
applied to the muscular fibre itself excites it as readily as the mechanical agent,
which is supposed only to affect it through the nerve.

Even if the power of the chemical agent be gradually increased until the
structure of the part of the nerve to which it is applied is destroyed, not only
the muscle in which it terminates, but even the other parts of the nerve itself
remain wholly unaffected. The nerye has not even the power of communi-
