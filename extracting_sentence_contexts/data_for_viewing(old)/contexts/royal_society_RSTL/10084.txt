neuroglia matrix derived from the delicate prolongations of connective cells snpporting
the meshwork formed by the repeated sub-divisions of the apical processes of nerve-
cells in the underlying strata. We meet here, as in the Sheep, Pig, and other animals,
with the DerreR cell. These cells are found immediately beneath the pia-mater, their
processes extending downwards into this layer and a larger process invariably being
connected with a nucleus along the sheath of a blood-vessel. As regards depth there is a
very evident diminution of this layer upwards and outwards over the exposed aspect of
the hemisphere as well as backwards towards the occipital pole. Thus in regions of
this upper limbic arc anterior to the corpus callosum the depth is 511 mm., whilst
posterior to this commissure it scarcely attains to *377 mm. A till more notable
diminution in depth occurs outwards, viz.: in extra-limbic regions where this outer
cortical zone measures but '279 mm. in depth. In the cortex of the Pig's brain a
similar fact was noted and is recorded in the table of depths of the cortical layers given
in my former paper.* %

2, Small pyramidal layer.â€”In the upper limbic arc of the brain of Man and of
some of the higher Mammalia I have described the typical formation as that of a five-
laminated cortex. In the same region, however, of the Rabbit's brain the cortex is four-
laminated, and this arises from the absence of the small oval and angular elements which
in Man constitute the second layer. In certain localities, more especially extra-limbic in
position, a shadowing forth of this stratum is represented by the closer aggregation of
elements superficially which become also appressed in small clumps at intervals and
may possibly represent a rudimentary form of this layer. $0 little marked is this in the
upper limbic are that it may virtually be considered deyoid of this layer. The second
layer, then, is in this region constibuted by a stratum of 8mall pyramidal nerve-cells as
