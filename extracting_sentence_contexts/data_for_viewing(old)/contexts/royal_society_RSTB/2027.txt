Ruscus aculeatus. Some of the rootstock taken up on July 7th. No starch found, but the cells of the
roots after treatment with alcohol were full of granular matter and gave the reaction for
inulin.

AMARYLLIDACEA.

Galanthus. Bulbs of G@. Imperati, G, Dlwesii, G. latifolius, and G. plicatus were examined and found to
contain starch and the same kind of inulin as @. nivalis, previously described.

Leucojum vernum and L. estivum. The bulbs of these two plants resemble those of Galanthus in the
form of their starch-grains and in the character of their inulin, which assumes the form of
casts, and is insoluble in cold water. Chemical proof of the presence of an inulin in the bulb
of Leucojum vernum has been given by Enruarpr.* From the fact that the substance he
isolated from the bulb was with difficulty soluble in cold water and had a specific rotatory power
near that of ordinary inulin, he considered it to resemble more closely the latter than such
bodies as sinistrin, triticin, &c., hitherto obtained from Monocotyledons. He, however, was
unable to procure it in the form of sphero-crystals. The above agrees with the properties of
the inulin which I have prepared from the bulb of Galanthus nivalis, and also with the nature
of the inulin casts precipitated in the cells by alcohol, which are insoluble in cold water and
not crystalline in structure.

Polianthes tuberosa. The tuber possesses no appreciable amount of starchâ€”a few very small grains
occur in the cells between the cortex and stele. Inulin is presumably present, since alcohol
produces in the cells a copious precipitate, again soluble in cold water and reactive to the tests.
