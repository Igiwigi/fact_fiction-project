silver can be present in the molecularly subdivided condition. The conclusion that
silver glass owes its colour to diffused spheres of silver will be verified in the following
section.

The absorption spectra of some colloidal solutions of silver, prepared by Brepic’s
method,* have been measured by Enrennarr. The continuous curve shown in fig. 3,
representing the calculated absorptions of a diffusion of silver spheres in water, is of
the same form as that which, according to EHRENHAF?’s measurements, represents
the absorption of visible light by a colloidal solution of silver.t Using ultra-violet
light, he further found that a brown colloidal solution of silver, examined before
coagulation had seriously affected its colour, showed an absorption band which began
at = ‘503 and attained a maximum at \ = ‘380, while the fluid was again quite
transparent at \ = 335. Except for the fact that the maximum ordinate of the
calculated curve for silver spheres in water is at \ = ‘389 instead of at \ = °380, the
above observations admirably describe the continuous curve shown in fig. 38. Since
the dotted curve given in that figure shows a maximum at \ = ‘360, and the absorp-
tion band does not begin until \ = *450, about, the colour of the “ colloidal” solution
is not that which would be exhibited by a suspension of discrete silver molecules, 2.e.,
by a true solution. We conclude, therefore, that the silver in a “ colloidal” solution
is present in the form of small spheres; discrete molecules may, however, also be
present, and, as indicated above in the case of gold, prepared by Brepia’s method,
probably also crystallites, the number and size of which will increase with the age of
the solution.

That the silver in a colloidal solution is in the form of small spheres is further
