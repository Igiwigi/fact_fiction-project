that the quickſilver in both inſtruments had , been fixed or |

probable truth, at the next meeting of the Academy held three

tions to acquire more palpable proofs of the fact. The ther-,
mometers ordered with this view, were, not ready till the 25th,»

ZAyINUs, Profeflor of Phyſics, he performed the experiment with
fimilar materials, and as ſoon as he found the quickfilver, 1um-
moveable, broke the bulb of his thermometer. Now all his ©
doubts were removed ; he obtained a. ſolid ſhining metallic maſs, 3
which extended under the ſtrokes of a peſtle, in hardneſs.
rather inferior to lead, and yielding a dull dead found like that |
metal. Profeſſor ze1xvs was occupied at the fame time in
ſimilar experiments, employing both, thermometers and ſimple. |
