that precipitation had ceased in consequence of the solution having become saturated,
fresh quantities were tried, but without any renewal of chemical action; although
other phosphatic fragments plunged into the same fluid were readily acted on. The
cause of cessation, therefore, could only be attributed to some change in the character
of the assay ; on examination, instead of being white, friable, and homogeneous in
texture, it had become fawn-coloured, dense, and striated ; and yielded unequivo-
cally, uric acid reaction. This accounted for the abrupt cessation of chemical
action, and bore testimony to the effects of the saturnine s0lution on the phosphatic
ingredients; for it was evident that the latter had constituted the outer coating of an
uric acid nucleus in the fragment under examination,

The result of experiments with other salts of lead, as well as with those of mercury,
baryta, and others, confirm the facts already stated ; viz. that almost all supersalts
of lead, especially with vegetable acids, act as ready decomponents of the calculi under
consideration. Even the acetate, which in its neutral state is inert, becomes active by
the superaddition of a minute quantity of its own proper acid: and, in like manner,
the addition of a few drops of lactic*, malic, racemic, or formic acids to solutions of
their neutral salts, produces a class of active decomposing agents, 80 effectual, that
either of them may be considered to afford secure means for discriminating the phos-
phatic from other varieties of calculi.

An interesting and perchance important circumstance connected with this part of
the subject, relates to the s/rength of the solution, which appears to be in inverse
ratio to its decomposing power. Thus, a saturated solution of acetate of lead,
acidulated pretty strongly with acetic acid, is inactive; whereas, one grain of the-salt,
