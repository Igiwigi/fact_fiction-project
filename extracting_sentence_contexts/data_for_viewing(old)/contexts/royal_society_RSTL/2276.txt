Having succeeded 'in determining from experiment the law
according to which the forces acting during rotation varied at
different distances, for which purpose principally I had under-
taken these experiments, my next object was to ascertain
whether the formula I had obtained would result from- the
principle, that time is necessary both for the developement
of magnetism by induction, and for its dissipation, and which
appeared to be implied in the formula.

We have as yet no facts which /indicate on what function
of the time either the developement or' dissipation ' of mag-
netism depends ; and until this can be ascertained, there
appears little prospect of obtaining a complete solution to this
interesting but intricate problem in magnetism. ' It appeared
to me not improbable, that when the distance of a magnetic |
pole from a body capable of becoming magnetic by induction,
is 8uddenly decreased, the magnetism developed in any. very
small portion of time, varies as the time and the magnetism
yet remaining to be developed, before it has attained the
maximum 'intensity of which it is susceptible at this dimi-
nished distance, and which may be called the intensity due
to this distance ; and that on the contrary, on the removal of
