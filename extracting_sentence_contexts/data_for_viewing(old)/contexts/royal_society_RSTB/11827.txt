10 [3]. Most of these herbivores are small- or medium-sized rodents, and only
six large mammalian herbivores occur in the Arctic [3]. Four of these six herbi-
vores have narrow distributional ranges and are only found in marginally
Arctic habitats (moose, Dall’s sheep, Siberian bighorn sheep and American
bison). This means that the only two large herbivores with wide distributional
ranges are caribou/reindeer (Rangifer tarandus; hereafter ‘caribou’, unless used
in reference to the domestic or semi-domestic sub-species) [4,5] and muskoxen
(Ovibos moschatus) [6]. The species richness of large herbivores in the Arctic
thus varies between 0 and 2 species in most Arctic regions. The most widespread
of the two herbivores, caribou, are also domesticated in many of these regions.
We will here explore how this low species richness of large herbivores influences
the vulnerability of arctic ecosystems to climate change, especially warming. We
also discuss implications of the fact that only domesticated herbivores exist in
many parts of the Arctic.
