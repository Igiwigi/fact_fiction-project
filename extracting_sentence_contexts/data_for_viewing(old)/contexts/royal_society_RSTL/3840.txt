exist between Orbitolites and Cycloclypeus, would seem to require that they should
be separated by the widest possible interval ; yet the system of classification adopted
by M. »'OrxmGNny would have forced him to associate them (if he had been acquainted
with the last-named type) side by side in the same Order (Cyclostegues).

IV. In like manner, the corresponding difference which has been shown to exist
between Orbiculina and Heterostegina, would seem to require that they should be
separated by the widest possible interval; yet the system of classification adopted by
M. y'Orprexy would have forced him to associate them (if he bad been acquainted
with the real plan of structure of the last-named type) side by side in the same Order
(Helicostegues).

V. The doctrine which I base on the foregoing facts, —that physiological con-
formity in the condition of each individual segment, as indicated by the structure of
its shelly investment, is a character of primary importance, whilst the plan of growth,
that is, the mode of increase in the number of chambers, is a character of subordi-
nate importance,—is further borne-out by the following considerations :

1. In Orbitolites, the general plan being cyclical, the early plan of growth is fre-
quently spiral.

2. In Orbiculina, while the early plan of growth is uniformly spiral, and this is
sometimes continued throughout life, it is very commonly exchanged in
adult age for the cyclical.
