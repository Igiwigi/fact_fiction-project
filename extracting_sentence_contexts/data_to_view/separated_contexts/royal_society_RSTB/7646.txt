Description. Shell subtriangular in outline, not very high, and with a submedian umbo
which is apparently rather broad. Valve not seeming to have been strongly inflated, but
this appearance of moderate inflation may be due to the fact that it is preserved on a shale
surface and has been somewhat compressed. Antero-dorsal margin moderately long,
slightly convex, moderately steeply descendent. Anterior end narrowly rounded, situated
rather low down.
