the references, s0 frequent in the observations, to a © working list.” It has been
my invariable practice to prepare before each night's sweep a list, in order of
R. A. with approximate polar distances, of the principal objects occurring
within the zone intended to be embraced in the sweep, and about 5' or 10'
above and below it. It is needless to mention that the nebulze of these lists
were mostly those of my Father's sweeps,—not, however, as taken merely
from his printed catalogue, in which only references of their places to the
nearest large stars are stated, but as reduced and digested (with great patience
and care) into a regular catalogue in zones, by my aunt, Miss Carotixe Her-
SCHEL. This valuable MS., which performs the same office with regard to my
Father's sweeps, as far as concerns the places of the nebulze, as the present
digested and reduced series of observations does to my own, has therefore been,
in point of fact, the groundwork of my whole proceedings, and I should be
not only ungrateful, but in a high degree unjust, were I to omit in this place
azknowledging the advantage I have derived from its use.

At the commencement of my sweeps, I contented myself, however, with a
bare notice of the chief expected nebulze, but finding that owing to the interest
excited by these objects, the zero stars were too much neglected, and smaller
nebulze missed, these came to be inserted at convenient intervals. Subse-
quently, tao, the double stars of STrRUvE's catalogue began to be entered on
the lists; and at length, experience having shown me that no trouble bestowed
on the construction of an ample and exact © working list” could be considered
ill bestowed, I threw aside all the earlier lists of this sort, and dividing the
keavens into zones of polar distance, of 3* in breadth from 0? to 1209, proceeded
