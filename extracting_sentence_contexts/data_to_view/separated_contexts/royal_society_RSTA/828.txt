law are combined, the effect is to give /, greater than 3, and therefore would imitate a
law of Type VIL without the normal law being in fact wrong. I think, however, that the
right, and in any

onus of proof, since Pearson’s paper, is on those who say that it is ev
case such a consideration would affect nothing in the treatment of actual observations. We could make no use of the fact that a series of observations was compound unless
we knew which observations belonged to each component law. If we did, we should

treat the laws separately; but when, as is certainly the usual case, we do not, it is neces-
sary to use the rules for the type of distribution as we actually find it. In either ease it

is wrong to treat all observations as of equal weight.
