The lines in (a) display 95% exclusion contours from ATLAS [11]
and CMS [12] jets plus missing transverse momentum searches. The region below each contour is excluded (adapted from [10}).

three solutions are predicted. In fact, it turns out that in this plane, all of the multiple solutions
have already been ruled out by previous experimental searches for charginos. Thus they do not
present a problem. At higher values of tan 6 and yu < 0, there is a strip where this is not a problem, and is shown
in figure 8b: the uppermost strip with two solutions (the lower strip is ruled out by having light
charginos that would have been seen at the LEP2 collider).
