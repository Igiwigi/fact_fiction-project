The course of these mucilage ducts has been followed in radial sections. They pass rather obliquely upwards and outwards to join the cortical series and form

an anastomosing system quite comparable to that which appears in the stem of the
modern Cycads. This connecting series of canals is clearly to be distinguished from
the horizontal series of the pines by the fact that in the latter the horizontal resin
canals do not extend to the pith, but have some secondary wood elements between
them and it; they originate also in the outer wood at various distances from the
pith, in connection with the increase in circumference of the stem. The occurrence of the medullary mucilage ducts in the cone axes and their
connection with those in the cortex, besides being interesting and probably
phylogenetically important, from the standpoint of the retention of a primitive
form of organisation (cf. Cycads and Poroxylon), has a bearing on the Lycopsid
or Pteropsid ancestry of the Conifers.
