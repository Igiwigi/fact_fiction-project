Lindseeformis, Bunpury.* There are, however, differences by which it may be
distinguished from either of these two species. In contrast to both, the pinnules of
R. circularis are more circular in outline, and never show the same degree of asymmetry. It differs, too, in the fact that the pinnules do not overlap the rachis, nor do they
overlap one another to any great extent. There is not the same pronounced unilateral
branching of the vein-system as is found in R. inequilatera and R. Lindseceformis, most
of the veins radiating from the base of the pinnule; but this tendency is seen in some
