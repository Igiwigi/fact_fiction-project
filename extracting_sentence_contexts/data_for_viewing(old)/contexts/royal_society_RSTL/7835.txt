The node C, is a triple point on the curve, the tangents being the nodal rays.

The node B, is a quintuple point, one tangent being X=0, 3dY+4Z=0, and the
other tangents being given by Z=0, (4a&6—308?, ad, bd, cd, FX, Y)*=0.

Each of the facultative lines is a double tangent to the curve, or we have 3'=6.

Reciprocal Surface.

100. Comparing the equation of the cubic surface with that for IV=12—2C,, it
appears that the equation of VI=12—B,—C, is obtained by substituting in that equa-
tion the values 3=0, /=1. But instead of making this substitution in the final formula,
d it is convenient to make it in the binary quartic (#3ZX, Y)*, thus in fact working out
the reciprocal surface by means of the function
