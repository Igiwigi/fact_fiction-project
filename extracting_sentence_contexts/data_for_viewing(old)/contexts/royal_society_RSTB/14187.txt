with relatedness and therefore decrease with dispersal
between groups (figure 1a—c). What is perhaps less intuitive
is that the coevolution of all four traits leads to a non-mono-
tonic relationship between payoff at the evolutionary
equilibrium and relatedness (or dispersal, figure 1d-f).
Specifically, depending on the individual cost of offensive
bravery, cp, the payoff in an equilibrium population can:

(ii) Bravery (1) decrease with relatedness (for small c,, figure 1d);
To understand equations (3.4b)-(3.4c), we can decompose (2) first increase and then decrease in a quadratic fashion
these as the product of four quantities with which both with relatedness (for intermediate cp, figure le); or (3)
forms of bravery increase: (1) the probability [1 —e~"] of increase with relatedness (for high cp, figure 1f). This reflects
raiding or being raided in a population where the average the fact that payoff increases with helping within groups and

belligerence is a* (equations (2.1) and (2.2) with apg =a=a"*); decreases with belligerence between groups. As dispersal
