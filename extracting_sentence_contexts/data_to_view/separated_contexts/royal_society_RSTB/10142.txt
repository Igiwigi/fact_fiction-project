In fact, it is untypically difficult, because the two moving
objects that the participant can encounter (the other partici-
pantâ€™s sensor and shadow) move identically. Distinguishing
them would require, from an individual perspective, not
only a complex strategy for testing socially contingent reac-
tions in these objects but also measuring these reactions in
a highly ambiguous sensory space. The fact that this computationally tough problem can be
resolved with relative ease in the presence of interactive
dynamics does not make this too meager an example of
social cognition. That its difficulty deflates dramatically
once we understand the collective dynamics is precisely the
theoretically pregnant point of the experiment. The type II regularities in the sensory signals that could help
distinguish sensors from shadows are statistically invisible in
the absence of a systematic sampling strategy.
