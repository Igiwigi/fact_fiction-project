The cusp on the talon is also larger than on the tooth in front. The first true molar
is bilophodont, each ridge consisting of two almost distinct tubercles. The cingulum

forms a small shelf-like ridge at the anterior end of the tooth and a larger one
behind ; in wear this latter becomes connected with the worn surface of the postero-
external cusp, and it forms the rudiment of a third ridge. The next molar is similar.
The last is likewise bilophodont, but has also a large tuberculate talon.

The relatively primitive character of M@ritherium is shown by the fact that the
skull presents no very striking peculiarities beyond the forward extension of the
maxille and the great thickness of the cranial bones. In the mandible the
massive symphysis is little elongated. In the upper jaw only one tooth (Pm. 1) of
the full Eutherian dentition is wanting ; in the mandible three (I. 3, C. and Pm. 1)
have been lost. The incisors are becoming specialised, but the premolars and molars
are of a simple type, though they already show a tendency to increasing specialisation
along the lines subsequently pursued throughout the group.

The discovery of an early and comparatively generalised type like Meritherium
naturally raises the question of the relationship of the Proboscidea to the other
mammals, and although at present it is not possible to arrive at any definite
conclusion as to the origin of the group, the view put forward by BuarnviLLE and
