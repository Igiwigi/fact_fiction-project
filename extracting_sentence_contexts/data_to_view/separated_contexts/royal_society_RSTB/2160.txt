The position of the secondary coil from the primary, at which the first contrac-
tion occurred, is represented in centimetres in the curve. (The secondary coil is
first approximated and then distanced with regard to the primary, the mean of
the two results being taken.)

S There is evidence here of a slight temporary increase of excitability after benza-
nine, though this is soon lost sight of, and the reaction thereafter is practically
parallel with that of the protected nerve.
& In cases of still deeper poisoning, especially when the heart showed unusual
Resistance, stimulation of the poisoned nerve caused contraction in three experiments,
&t 9°5 centims., 6 centims., and 5 centims. respectively, whilst the companion pro-
cted limbs responded at 15, 19°5, and 16 centims,
& Excitability of motor nerves is entirely suspended by doses of benzaconine just
insufficient to arrest a vigorous heart. Though all these facts may be demonstrated
with the aid of single induction shocks, similar phenomena follow stimulation by
faradisation, the muscle yielding a good preliminary contraction, which shows a
tendency to break down if stimulation is extended to 2 or 3 seconds. ‘Ihe
subsequent failure of response on repeated stimulation and recovery after a rest
pause are both witnessed.
