I have not yet discovered on what their differences depend, but in all probability
it is on the degrees to which they are alloyed with other metals. 85. The fact of copper changing in the thermo-electric series from below the
position of the platinum specimen P, to above that of iron, when the temperature is

raised from —30* or —20? Cent. to 3009, proves that every metal which lies between
P, and iron for any intermediate temperature, must become neutral to either P, or
copper, or iron at some temperature between these limits.
