The rat continued very lively for about
six hours, and then died. On examination after death, the
bite was found to have been inflicted on the left side of the
navel; and the abdominal muscles at that part, were in the
same 8tate as in the other rat, but in a less degree. It appears from the facts, which have been stated, that, the
effects of the bite of a snake vary according to the intensity
of the poison. When the poison is very active, the local irritation is s0
sudden and so violent, and its effects on the general system,
are 80 great, that death soon takes place. When the body is
afterwards inspected, the only alteration of structure met with,
is in the parts close to the bite, where the cellular membrane
is completely destroyed, and the neighbouring muscles very
considerably inflamed.
