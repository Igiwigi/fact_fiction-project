included in his genus Protophyllum.* My impression is that the American and Greenland
species are at least very closely allied. Frrre.’s contention is that the Greenland leaves
agree more closely with those of Nuphar luteum than with any Menispermaceous species.
Nuphar leaves are always auriculate and fleshy, but if I am right in believing Prero-
spermites multinervis and similar forms to be nearly related to M. Nordenskiéldi, the
form of the lamina conforms more closely to that of certain recent Menispermacee than

to any species of Nymphwacex. . The fact that some leaves included by Lesqurreux
in Protophyllum are peltate, whereas no undoubted examples of peltate leaves occur
among those from Greenland, is probably of no great importance. Drets* states that
some recent Menispermacee possess both cordate and peltate leaves. In Nuphar, as
Friret points out, the secondary veins are closer together than in the Greenland leaves,
which in the smaller and more distant veins agree more closely with Menispermace:.
The balance of evidence seems to be in favour of assigning the Greenland specimens to
the Menispermacez.

It is not clear on what grounds some of the leaves figured by KNow.ront from the
Raton formation are referred to Ficus rather than to a genus implying affinity to the
Menispermaceze.
