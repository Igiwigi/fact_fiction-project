Consider a magnetically isotropic body surrounded by a non-magnetic medium, and
let the magnetic region be denoted by the suffix a, so that I/=0. In accordance
with what has been just proved we consider only the normal part of the traction.
Thus,

— 87[{¢3 Uv ]..,= 47 [I', SUH], ,,+ Bi, [SUH]...

Let now [H’,],= HUvr’,. Thus

4or[T'sJe = (ue — 1) HU’, BY, = y/HUr,,
[SUr’'H'], = —H, [SUr'H'],.. =(' — 1) H,

the last coming from the fact that [H’,], = B’,. Thus

Hence for both paramagnetic and diamagnetic isotropic bodies surrounded by non-
magnetic media, MAXWELw’s stress leads to a surface traction which is always a
tension (except as in the anchor-ring when it is zero).
