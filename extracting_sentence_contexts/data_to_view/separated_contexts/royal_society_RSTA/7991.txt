The fixed platinum resistance N (about 20 ohms), wound as a thermometer, but exactly
compensated for change of temperature, was inserted in the case of the resistance box
for convenience. The fundamental interval of each thermometer was about 5 ohms,
so that the unit bridge coil (approx. 0-1 ) corresponded to 2° on the platinum scale. Each resistance coil of the box was compensated as described by CaLLenpary,
in fact, the same bridge was used. All contacts were either copper to copper soldered
