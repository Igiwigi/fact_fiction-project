This may be seen by comparing the tables in this paper with those which
I obtained formerly with Mr. Dzss10U's assistance, and in which the discussion of
the same obseryations was instituted with reference to the transit immediately pre-
ceding the time of high water. The variations in the interval between two successive
transits of the moon are, in fact, of the same order in amount as those in the interval
between the moon's transit and the time of high water due to the yariations in mag-
nitude of the attractive forces ; and when the interval between the time of high water
and the moon's transit immediately preceding is considered, (at least on our coasts,)
the variations from both these causes are mixed up together. As the tide-wavye trayels northward to the coasts of Great Britain from the Cape
of Good Hope, passing the French coast, the variations in the interval and in the
height at Brest must be similar to those at London and Liverpool. My results ought,
therefore, to agree with those which may hereafter be deduced from the observations
made at Brest by order of the French Government, and not yet published.
