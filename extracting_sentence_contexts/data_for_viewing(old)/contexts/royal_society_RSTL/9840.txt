EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 529

From these considerations we may conclude that the effect of the separation of a
satellite is to destroy planetary rotation, but to preserve angular momentum within
the planetary subsystem.

Hence we ought to find that those planets which have large satellites have a slow
rotation, but have a relatively large amount of angular momentum within their

| systems,

| A proper method of comparison between the several planets is difficult of attain-
ment, but these ideas seem to agree with the fact that the earth, which is large
compared with Mars, rotates in the same time, but that the whole angular momentum

_ of earth and moon is large.*

© * A method of comparing the various members of the solar system has occurred to me, but it is not
founded on rigorous argument.

bog Tt seems probable that the small density of the larger planets is due to their not being 80 far advanced
= in their evolution as the smaller ones, and it is likely tha they are continuing to contract and will 80me
© day be as dense as the earth.

= The proposed method of comparison is to estimate how fast each of the planets must rotate if, with
