chamber, the Belzoni chamber, in the Pyramid of Khafre; however the pyramid made by his father 2 |
Cheops had more complicated internal structures, including the King’s and Queen’s Rooms and

the Grand Gallery. Therefore, the researchers hoped to discover unknown chambers. Despite the 2
fact that ultimately Alvarez’s group discovered no unknown chambers inside the pyramid, this 8
pioneering work paved the way for the application of muography in the future. 1g

The first experimental evidence discovered with muography focused on the summit of 1S

Mount Asama, Japan [3]. Since this first experiment in 2007, the density distributions have
been muographically acquired from several volcanoes, not only in Japan [3-10] but also in
Europe [11-15]. Volcanoes are not the only gigantic target that has recently been measured with
muography.
