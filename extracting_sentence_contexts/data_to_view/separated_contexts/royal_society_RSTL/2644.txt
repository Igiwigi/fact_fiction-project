Every traveller, to be sure, has measured the temperature of
springs, but few have been aware of the difficulties which even this apparently simple
inquiry involves. We should have considered the accurate determination of the temperatures of
thermal springs the first step towards a theory of their production F. The constancy
of that temperature from day to day, from year to year, from century to century,
would appear one of the most essential facts to determine ; yet I am aware of scarcely
a single published obseryation capable of being satisfactorily employed in such an
inquiry. Not only are the errors of the instruments unknown, but the circumstances
