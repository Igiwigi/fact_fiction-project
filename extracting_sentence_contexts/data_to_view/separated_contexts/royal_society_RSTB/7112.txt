On the other hand, some larvae within the cocoons
of both these species (table 14), spun at an optimum humidity of 90% and a favourable
room temperature, pupated on subsequent exposure at 13° C even with 80% R.H.; possibly
water stored at the favourable humidity and temperature took a long time to evaporate,
and this permitted pupation. The effect of the subsequent loss of water was, however, felt
at the time of adult emergence, as only a few adults emerged from the pupal skins. The fact that a fairly high percentage of the larvae within the cocoons of X. cheopis
(table 26) failed to pupate at 35° C with 60% r.u., and that the proportions of advanced
pupae formed and adults emerged at this low humidity were significantly lower than at
higher humidities, shows that the 60% R.H. is harmful to metamorphosis. Moreover, both
the proportions of naked resting larvae that pupated, and of those that gave rise to adults
in X, cheopis and X. brasiliensis (table 23) at 17° C with 60% r.u. were significantly lower
than with 80% r.u. Even the proportions of adults which emerged from naked pupae of
both the species at 90°, R.H. were significantly higher than at 80% R.H.
