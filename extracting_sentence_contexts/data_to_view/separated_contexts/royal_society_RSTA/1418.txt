2 such a graph for an imaginary bar calibrated into # equal parts is shown by
the full circles. The end points of the graph are necessarily zero, for »(0/0), and 9(0/z),
are by definition equal to zero. This does not imply that in making readings on the two
end graduations no errors of observation have been made, and in actual fact, by forcing

the two end points to zero, we compel the other points to take on themselves errors

where <, and ¢, are the errors of observation on the zero and z line respectively. Referring to the definition of (m/n),, it will be seen from the graph that the vertical
height between the points P and Q represents 9(p/q),, 1.¢., the distance p/q in terms
of 0/« as correct, this quantity being taken as positive when Q is higher than P.
To find the error of position of any point in relation to p/q as correct, we first observe
that if, according to this particular calibration, the interval p/q is, say, short, in relation
to 0/x as correct, by an amount QQ’, then the length of any other interval m/n must be

longer, in relation to p/q as correct, by an amount — x QQ’ than it is in relation to

0/a as correct.
