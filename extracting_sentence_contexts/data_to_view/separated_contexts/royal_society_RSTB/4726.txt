Are we then to consider the branch from the lateral cutaneous artery, or the trunk
from the rete, or both, to be the source of blood supply to the lower lateral cutaneous
artery ? Ifthe branch from the lateral cutaneous artery is the sole source of supply, blood
would flow along it not only to the lower lateral cutaneous artery, but (as MitieR
thought) to the supra-hepatic rete. Apart from the fact that the branch from the lateral
cutaneous artery may be absent (specimen C), the relative size of the various vessels
forbids this conclusion ; for the lower lateral cutaneous artery and the rete trunk taken
together are four times the diameter of the anastomosis with the lateral cutaneous artery,
and the latter obviously could not carry enough blood to supply both. We can thus
only conclude that the rete trunk is the main source of blood supply for the lower lateral
cutaneous artery, and is thus efferent from the supra-hepatic rete, and not, as supposed
by Miter, afferent to it. How far the anastomotic branch from the lateral cutaneous artery is also a tributary
of the lower lateral cutaneous artery is not clear.
