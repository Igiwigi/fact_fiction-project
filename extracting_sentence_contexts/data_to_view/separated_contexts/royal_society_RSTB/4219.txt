11.—Percentage Distribution of Yield. For Spacings 1), 3), and 9/. ‘To illustrate the differential effect
of root interference in altering the form of the yield curve. Also, to demonstrate the fact that the
yield of ginned lint is closely similar to the yield expressed as number of bolls. Continuous lines
show results of observations expressed as Number of Bolls, and the adjacent dotted lines as Weight

of Lint.
