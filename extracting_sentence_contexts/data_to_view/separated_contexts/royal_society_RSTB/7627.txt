D. primus Branson & Mehl. Branson & Mehl’s generic description:

“Complex units consisting of an antero-posteriorly (?) elongate, arched row of denticles
'8 with deeply excavated and more or less laterally flared base; an approximately mid-length
recurved denticle, the largest. Lateral surface of unit markedly offset inward immediately
£ anterior to largest denticle and aborally extended beneath outer side of largest denticle.
% Arch in front of and behind largest denticle of varied length and crowned with a few
<< denticles.’
é Branson & Mehl observe (1933, p. 112):
3 ‘...We have selected a few distinctive forms as “trends’? which we here record as
3 species, regardless of the fact that we sometimes find it difficult to decide to which species
3 a given specimen should be referred.’
