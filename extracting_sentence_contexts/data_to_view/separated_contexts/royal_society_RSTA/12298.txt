I
have generally thought it inadvisable to increase the weight of gas dealt with by
exhausting the active sphere. In the process of exhaustion there was risk of spoiling
the weighings by contamination of the surface of the sphere. There was also the
risk of a back-leakage of air into the sphere during the process ; injurious, either by
the fact that it was undried or as an impurity if other gas was being dealt with. The number of observations made on the thermal equilibrium of the “empty”
spheres is some five or six generally. In the earlier experiments these observations

were more frequent, as trifling alterations on the valve or for leakage, &c., were
then often necessitated.
