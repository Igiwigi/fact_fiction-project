(13) Distribution of Resistance in Single Layer System.—The distribution of eddy-current
losses throughout the system does not represent the distribution of effective resistance. In fact the energy required to produce the losses in any wire is supplied by the currents
flowing in the other wires, and therefore the other wires behave as if certain resistances
were added to them. ‘

In order to determine these equivalent resistances, consider two coils (I) and (II)
carrying currents I,, I, which produce fields acting on a cylinder carrying no current. Ultimately these currents will be assumed equal, so that for simplicity they will be
considered in phase.
