three explicitly and twelve implicitly, each of the circles «, 3, 4, 3 containing three ; but
six equations of condition are implied by the fact of the four circles being mutually
orthogonal, and the identical relation «*+83*+/*+2*=0 (for constants are incorporated)
is equivalent to one condition. Hence the given form contains eight independent
constants ; and this is the number which determines a sphero-quartic.
