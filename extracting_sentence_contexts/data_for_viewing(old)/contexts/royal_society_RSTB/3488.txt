cell wall when viewed in transverse section.

The size of the air spaces is best seen in tangential section (Plate 3, fig. 1;
Plate 4, fig. 4). From the figures it will be seen that the palisade cells resemble
a number of pillars supporting the epidermis, and standing up in the large air space
into which the stomata open. The analogy can be carried further, for many of the
cells are enlarged where they abut on the melasmatic tissue. The pillar may consist
of a single cell or two or three filamentous cells joined end on end (ef: text-fig. 13,
Plate 4, figs, 1, 9, and 10).

The cells are very thin-walled, and are usually clear and almost colourless. They
occasionally contain one or two dark round spots which Prof. Sewarp has suggested*
may represent mineralised nuclei, but the fact that cells often contain two or three
of these dark bodies indicates that this hypothesis cannot be upheld. It is probably
safer to regard them as the remains of cell-contents. In other cases some cells
may have a deep brown colour, while they may often be partly or wholly filled with
a mass of small round granules (Plate 4, figs. 6, 10), which seem to be connected
only with the conditions of preservation, and probably have no important significance,
for they occur very largely in badly preserved specimens. The expanded ends of the
_palisade cells usually abut directly on the peculiar sheath of cells which surrounds the
bundle, and this must be next considered.
