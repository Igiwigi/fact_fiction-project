The
Arran trunk was referred by Wittiamsont to the genus Lepidodendron as
L. Wunschianum. Others have admitted the possibility that it may have been a
Lepidophloios, but it must be remembered that the external features of this tree have
never been observed, and that these opinions are arrived at entirely from the internal
structure. The importance of bearing these facts in mind is emphasised by the
recent discoveries: that at least two Lepidodendrons possessed the type of structure
hitherto regarded as characteristic of Lepidophloios. The Dalmeny stem was
described by Sewarp and Hix} as possibly identical with Lepidophloios Harcourtit
(Wrrnam). Here again the external features are unknown.
