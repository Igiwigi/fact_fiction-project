Thus for large j, h. + 5 > H(ajyj) + H(bjwj) = ly + Thy, whence
h>ly+h-y. However, similar to the classical case, the map 4 â€” I) is strictly subadditive. In fact, we have the
following lemma to that effect. Once lemma 2.2 is established, a contradiction is reached and we
will have shown that splitting cannot occur. Lemma 2.2.
