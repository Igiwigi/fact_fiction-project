Nevertheless, it is clear that the time structure of the data could be useful for estimating
the components. In ยง6c, we already used it to model dependencies between the components,
but even in the case of completely independent components, time structure can provide more
information. In fact, it is sometimes possible to estimate the ICA model even for Gaussian data,
based on the time structure (autocorrelations) alone, as initially pointed out by Tong et al. [65]
and further developed by Belouchrani et al. [34], among others (see ch. 18 of Hyvarinen et al.
[3] or Yeredor [36] for reviews.) However, such methods based on autocorrelations alone have
the serious disadvantage that they only work if the independent components have different
autocorrelation structures, i.e. the components must have different statistical properties. This is
in stark contrast to basic ICA using non-Gaussianity, which can estimate the model even if all the
components have identical statistical properties (essentially, this means equal marginal pdfs). Thus, it should be useful to develop methods that use both the autocorrelations and non-
Gaussianity.
