It yields the best vibrational energies obtained
so far for the LiH molecule (figure 5). For v = 13, the deviation between the experimental and
theoretical data increases, as the probability of the average internuclear distance getting closer
to the distance where the avoided crossing between the two lowest electronic states occurs,
increases. Extended line lists and tables of cooling functions were compiled for LiH comprising
lithium isotopes °Li and 7Li and hydrogen isotopes H, D and T [60].

(c) Vibrational shifts by effective mass models: a unifying AIM approach

Though the results obtained so far are encouraging, the fact that two different methods should
be used, depending on whether the molecule is polar or non-polar (e.g. in the LiH calculations),
is not satisfactory. Amaral & Mohallem [61] recently developed a unifying single method which
uses the stockholder atoms-in-molecules (AIM) approach by Hirshfeld [62], more precisely its
iterative variant, Hirshfeld-I due to Bultinck et al. [63], to separate the core and valence electron
density contributions. In his approach, Hirshfeld defined the density of a ‘promolecule’, which is
the sum of the densities of the isolated atoms, as

pP(r) = 50 pf"). (2.9)
I
He then introduced the following atomic weight functions:

- 1 2.1
wy(r) Py’ (2.10)

which, when applied to the molecular density, give the AIM densities.
