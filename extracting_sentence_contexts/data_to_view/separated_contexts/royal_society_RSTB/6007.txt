Dorsal to each polar cartilage and ventro-
anterior to each pila antotica, another pair of chondrifications has appeared, known
as the suprapolar cartilages (s.t.). They correspond to the supratrabecular bars which
in the lizard (Gaupp, 1906) and in the Primates (FiscHER, 1903) connect the anterior
with the posterior clinoid processes. The ophthalmic artery runs out beneath them,
and their precocious appearance is probably related to the fact that the recti muscles
are attached to them. The anterior parachordals have established connexion with the parachordal and cochlear
capsules, and the basal plate is now complete, enclosing a basicranial fenestra (b.c.f.). At the same time, the basal plate is extending to the side, by lateral growth of the
originally cylindrical parachordal.
