multiplication. But the most striking illustrations of this principle are perhaps to be
derived from those cases, in which a continual production of cells possessed of some
special endowment goes on during adult life, Thus it is necessary for every act of
secretion, that a new formation of secreting cells should take place within the ultimate
follicles of glands. These ultimate follicles are really to be regarded (as shown by
Prof. Goops1RÂ®) in the light of parent-cells, which produce the trae secreting cells
in proportion as the materials of their growth are supplied by the blood. Now these
parent-cells themselves possess no-secreting power, their vital force being entirely ex-
pended in the production of the true secreting cells. On the other hand, the rrue
secreting cells possess no reproductive power, but die and are cast off when they have
reached their maturity ; as if their whole vital force were expended in the secreting
process, Which is itself nothing else than a portion of the act of growth. 'This will be
found, the author believes, to be the type of a large order of facts, of which some
others will be presently noticed. Again, the cells which are endowed with the spe-
cial reproductive power, exercised in the true act of generation, Seem to pos88ess no
other endowment ; they do not exercise chemical transformation, nor do they undergo

histological change, nor do they multiply after the ordinary fashion. But here, again,
we find that these cells are produced within others, whose whole endowment seems
that of multiplication ; the sperm-cells being generated in vast numbers within folli-
