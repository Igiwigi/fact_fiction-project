But my apparatus consists of one uniform brass tube,

Anomalies of the knife edge $uspension. It has been shown by Captain Sapixg, in his Account of Experiments, &c.
page 195, that, in a pendulum with knife edges, a considerable difference may
arise in the results, if they be used with different planes: but it does not appear
to have occurred to any one, versed in these experiments, that a much greater
difference than that which he has recorded may arise from using the same
knife edge with the same plane. This fact has probably hitherto escaped de-
tection from the peculiar manner in which pendulum experiments are usually
conducted: for, on examining the detail of most of those experiments, it will
be found that after the pendulum at any one station has been placed in its Y's,
it has never been removed therefrom, but merely raised and lowered again as
occasion may require, till it has been ultimately dismounted, and packed up
for another station ; whereby any anomaly that might otherwise have occurred,
is thus avoided, and consequently escapes detection. Experiments, however,
of this kind, ought to be varied in every possiþle way, in order to guard against
any unsuspected source of error. When Captain Bas, Har returned from his voyage to the Pacific Ocean,
where he had undertaken to swing the pendulum at various places, it was

found that the number of vibrations which the pendulum made, on his arrival
again in London, differed by 0:97 (or not quite a second of time) in a mean
solar day, from the number of vibrations made by the same pendulum previous
to his departure : and yarious causes were as8igned for (what was called) s0

with the invariable pendulum were considered almost as infallible.
