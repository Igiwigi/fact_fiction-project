Tenzek & Nickels [52] point out that these unrealistic portrayals
can be confusing to young children, but propose that parents
and educators may use them to frame conversations with
children about the realities of death. Alongside concerns about unrealistic and inaccurate depic-
tions of death and grief in the mainstream media, there is also
recognition that carefully crafted media portrayals can have a
positive influence on children’s understanding of death
[6,52,58,59]. For example, there is a small children’s literature
on death education, aimed at providing facts about death
and suggesting ways to cope and normalize grief [59]. Clini-
cians and educators recognize the value of these books both
in promoting children’s understanding of the realities of
death and in stimulating communication between children
and their parents [59]. In the USA, a now-famous episode of
the children’s television show Mister Rogers’ neighbourhood
focused on the death of a goldfish [60,61].
