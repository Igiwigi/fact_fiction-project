It seems to me necessary to make
(X, Y, Z) and (a, 8, y) vanish, although from one point of view it might suffice to
make (X’, Y’, Z’) vanish throughout the conductor. We have next to determine how these quantities inside are related to the similar
quantities outside the surface. The fundamental equations integrated through a thin
shell in the usual way show that the tangential component of (X’, Y’, Z’) is continuous,
but the fact that we have no right to assign the fundamental equations or the above
form of (X’, Y’, Z’) to the inside of a conductor raises a doubt. If (X’, Y’, Z’) is
continuous as regards tangential components, then the tangential component ot
