Hydrat of soda ought, according to
theory, to contain 1 proportion of soda 29.5, and 1 of water
8.5, which will give in 100 parts 22.4, of water; and the
experiments that I have detailed, conform as well as can be
expected with these conclusions. The proportions of potash and soda indicated, in different
neutral combinations,” by these estimations, will be found to
agree very nearly with those derived from the most accurate
analysis, particularly those of M. BeRTHOLLET ; or the dif-
ferences are such as admit of an easy explanation. I stated in my last communication, the probability that the
oxygene in the hyperoxymuriate of potash was in triple com-
bination with the metal and ox ymuriatic gas ; the new facts

that water consists of 1 particle of oxygene, and 1 of hydrogene ; but I have since
found that this opinion is advanced, in a work published in 1789, A comparalive
View of the Phlogistic and Antiphlogistic Theories, by WiLL1am Hiccins, In
this claborate and ingenious performance, Mr. Hic61xs has developed many happy
sketches of the manner in which (on the corpuscular hypothesis) the particles or
molecules of bodies may be conceived to combine ; and some of his views, though
formed at this early period of investigation, appear to me to be more defensible, as»
suming his data, than any which have been siace adyanced; for instance, he considered
nitrous gas as composed of two particles of oxygene, and one of nitrogene. Mr.
Hisg1ns had likewise drawn the just conclusion respecting the constitution of


combinations of Oxymuriatic Gas and Oxygene, &c. 11

respecting the peroxide confirm this idea, Potassium, per-
fectly saturated with oxygene, would probably contain six

sulphuretted hydrogene, from its electrical decomposition. As hydrogene is the sub-/
stance which combines with other bodies in the smallest quantity, it is perhaps the
most fitted to be represented by unity ; and on this idea the proportions in ammonia
will be 3 of hydrogene to 1 of nitrogene, and the number representing the smallest
proportion in which nitrogene is known to combine will be 13.4.
