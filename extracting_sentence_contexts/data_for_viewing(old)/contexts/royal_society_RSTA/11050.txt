So far as the mean yearly and winter values of «, b and b/a are concerned,
Tables V. and X. are in practical agreement, but the equinoctial values of ) in
Table X. are decidedly lower, and the summer values decidedly higher, than the
corresponding quantities in Table V. The fact that the equinoctial values of b/a for
D and H in Table X. fall slightly below the summer ones seems hardly likely @ priori
to be a natural phenomenon, and it is not in accordance with the results obtained for
Greenwich, in Tables IT. and III., from the longer periods, where the variation of the
mean sun-spot frequency from month to month is naturally less than in 1890 to 1900.

§ 19. The effect of the substitution of the smoothed sun-spot frequencies on the
values of b and b/a from month to month is most easily followed by expressing the
monthly values as percentages of their mean for the 12 months. Table XI. gives the
mean of the results thus obtained for D and H, employing smoothed and observed
sun-spot frequencies for the “quiet” days, and observed frequencies for the “all”
days. The employment of smoothed frequencies for the “all” days would alter the
results to about the same extent as it does in the “quiet” days.
