Two key conceptual results of our work, with important policy implications, are (i) investment
in specific low-carbon generation technologies over time may strongly depend on the
(deterministic, stochastic or robust) approach and risk aversion of the planner, and (ii) optimal
generation investment decisions need to be complemented by decisions on investment in smart
grid technologies and/or network assets. In these regards, the proposed model allows one to
fully capture synergies and competition among different generation, smart and transmission
technologies so that the truly optimal solution is attained. In contrast, the deterministic planning
approaches (often in the form of ‘roadmaps’) and relevant planning tools that are currently used
are bound to deliver solutions that are not only more expensive, but also misleading in terms
of optimal technology mix (generation, storage, etc.). This is particularly important in the light
of, for example, setting policy incentives for certain technologies, for which enabling smart grid
technologies such as FACTS and batteries should also be considered to be optimal complements
to renewable generation.

Following up on the findings highlighted above, we then also presented the state of the art in
power system planning under uncertainty and discussed the need for new optimization tools
that can properly value the benefits of flexible, smart grid solutions by embedding detailed
operational aspects in the planning problem. In particular, important progress is necessary in
terms of sampling techniques, decomposition methods, parallel and cloud computing, among
others, to fully unlock the application of mathematical programming to plan investments in
electricity grids when considering a large number of potential future scenarios in the long term,
and a detailed representation of system operation in the short term.
