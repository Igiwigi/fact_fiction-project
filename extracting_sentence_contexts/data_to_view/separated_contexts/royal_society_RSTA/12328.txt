One part of M, N, P, Q arises from a true change in the tide when the longitude
of the moon’s node changes, and the remainder (nearly equally large) merely depends
on the reference to true instead of fictitious transit. The quantities t and } depend
partly on a portion of the equation of time and partly on the annual tide. We must now explain the computation of 2 dJ/dT and of 2 dh/dT.
