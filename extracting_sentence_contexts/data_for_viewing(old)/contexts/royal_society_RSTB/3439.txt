(c) Heart and Blood-vessels (Blood-pressure).

Kymographic experiments were made on rabbits and cats with a view to
determining the effects of the venom on the blood-pressure and the respiration.
In these experiments we were confronted with the difficulty that other investigators
have experienced with Viperine venoms, namely, that the introduction into the
circulation of doses of Echis venom sufficiently large to have any pronounced effect
on blood-pressure causes intravascular clotting, unless special precautions are taken
to prevent it.

It was, however, possible to determine the uncomplicated action of the venom on
the circulation by taking advantage of the fact, first investigated in regard to snake
venoms by Marriy,* that a condition of incoagulability of the blood can be produced
by the preliminary slow injection of a dose of Echis venom which, if injected
rapidly, would produce intravascular clotting. This was the method adopted in the
following experiment :—

Experiment 29.—December 28, 1909. Table X. Figs. 7-16 inclusive. A cat,
weighing 2000 grm., was anzsthetised with chloroform. The trachea was then
opened and a canula tied into it through which the animal respired. Ether was
thereafter inhaled through this canula and chloroform discontinued. The blood-
pressure was taken in a carotid artery, the respirations were recorded by means
of a double stethograph, and the venom was administered by a canula tied into the
external jugular vein.
