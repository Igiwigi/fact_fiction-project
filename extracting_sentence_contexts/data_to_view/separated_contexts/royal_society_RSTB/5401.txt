It may be mentioned that observations with reflected light and also some of the
film-pulls have shown indications of the elongated cells of the sporangial wall radiating
between the stalk and the line of dehiscence. The wall is not, however, sufficiently
preserved for detailed description or figures. Even had no further evidence been obtained it would be justifiable to regard the
sporangial nature of the appendages as established by the consistent body of facts
regarding their shape and the presence of the line of dehiscence. A fortunate prepara-
tion, however, enables us to add the conclusive fact of the presence of spores in the
sporangia. The sporangium in question is the lower one on the left in fig. 26.
