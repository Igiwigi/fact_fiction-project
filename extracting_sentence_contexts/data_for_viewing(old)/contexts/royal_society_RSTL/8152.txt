Slight effort to strengthen its buttresses by exogenous additions to their exteriors. In
tangential sections of the cortical layer the vascular bundles exhibit the regular arrange-
ment characterizing the taxis of all Lepidodendroid stems.

Before attempting to draw any general conclusions from the preceding facts, T would call
attention to two interesting modifications of the same Lepidodendroid type that have
recently come under my notice. One of these, represented in Plate XLV, figs. 33 & 34,T
found in one of the Oldham nodules; the other is in the cabinet of Mr. NizLD, of Oldham.

Plate XLYV. fig. 33 represents a transverse section of the first of these plants; it is a
young Lepidodendroid shoot a little more advanced in growth than Plate XLI. Ng:
in other respects the general appearances of the two closely correspond. The chief
difference lies in the centre of the medullary axis, which in Plate XLV. fig. 33 is
very large and well defined. On turning to the longitudinal section of the medullary
cylinder (fig. 34) we see that this medulla () is a cellular structure; but instead of
the cells being nearly cubical, they are elongated vertically and almost fusiform ; still
they retain much of the disposition to arrange themselvyes in vertical columns that is 80
