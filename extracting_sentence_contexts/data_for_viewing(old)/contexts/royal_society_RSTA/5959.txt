of small tables for better visibility, each for the lagtime that is indicated at the top. An estimate
of the statistical weights of different states can be calculated using the normalized eigenvector
corresponding to the first eigenvalue. The weightages of different states, corresponding to the
three-macrostate model, are listed in table 3d. We observed the system to rest in an LL-LSC state
for about 75% of the time of the ensemble runs, a fact also reflected by the PDFs of persistence
times.

(d) Markov property by eigenvalue spectra

Based on the ensemble run data, we now proceed to test the Markovianity of the macrostate
evolution. This is done by means of the eigenvalue spectrum of the transition probability matrices
A; at different lagtimes t as discussed in the last section. To begin with, we calculated the
ensemble averaged transition probability matrix A; at different lagtimes t >t, where t, = 3t, is
chosen as a reference time for Markov analysis. The eigenvalues A;(t), i=1,...,6 are always
ordered according to descending magnitude. The largest eigenvalue is 4; = 1 at all times, since the
matrices are stochastic. The subsequent eigenvalues may remain unity for times f < t,; afterwards
the trajectories start to leave the initial macrostates and the eigenvalues decrease thereafter.
