If the rays are short they too may be

“ storeyed, and this combination of features is of still further use in recognizing woods. In the Sterculiaceae, the uniseriate rays are often storeyed, but, owing to their peculiar
method of growth, the large rays are often quite independent of the storeys. VI—VESsSELS

(a) Vessel-Member Length
The study of vessel-member length throughout a large number of families has
shown (BAILEY 1920) that the length of a vessel member is approximately the same
as that of the cambial initial from which it was derived, and the significance of vessel-

member length lies in the fact that it provides a measure of the length of the cambial
initial where the initials themselves are not available. In hardwoods generally a wide
range in vessel-member length may be encountered, and Frost (19304, 6, 1931) has
shown that there is a relation between the length of the vessel members, the type of
perforation plate and the type of intervascular pitting. He has also established the fact
that, on the whole, woods with long vessel members, scalariform perforation plates
and scalariform intervascular pitting are more primitive than those with shorter
vessel members, simple perforation plates and alternate intervascular pitting.
