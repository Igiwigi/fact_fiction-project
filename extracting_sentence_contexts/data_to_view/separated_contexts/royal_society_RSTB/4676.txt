The general proposition, however, that the caudal vertebree are in a less advanced
stage of evolution than the trunk vertebree is not universally accepted, for GRAHAM
Kerr, in his text-book of Embryology (London, 1919, p. 294) writes, that in
sketching out the development of the vertebral column: “The assumption will be
again made use of, as it was in dealing with the mesoderm segments, that the trunk
region has in all probability departed least from the primitive conditions . . . Some
writers will be found to assume that the caudal region is more nearly primitive.” Kerr's conclusion is based upon the fact that the Vertebrate is essentially a ccelomate
animal, and that the existence of a tail-region devoid of splanchnoccel is secondary. But while, as regards the general evolution of the vertebrate animal, few will deny
that the anus was primarily posterior, and that the caudal appendage appeared as a
later growth, the axial skeleton of the primitive vertebrate—as Prof. MacBripr
has been good enough to point out—probably remained notochordal for a considerable
time after the evolution of the tail, and any differences in the structure of the
vertebrae of the caudal and trunk regions arose comparatively recently in a vertebral
column that was, despite this late origin of the tail in comparison with the trunk, for
a long time more or less uniform throughout.

At one period of the inquiry it seemed as though the hindermost caudal vertebra,
owing to their simplicity, might afford a clue to the significance of any substantial
differences that might be observable in the trunk vertebra of two species of fish.
