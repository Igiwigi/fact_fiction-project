In the pith of the rootlets are a few of the brown
secretory cells, of which there are also a number outside the wood elements. Habit.â€”From the anatomy of the large axis there appears to be no question but
that it is of stem nature. The fact, however, that its only appendages are roots,
and that there are so many of them, strongly suggests that it was a rhizome, or at

as does the placing of the vascular bundles towards the centre of an undifferentiated
cortex, and the walled uninterrupted cork layer. Saururus, with which the fossil has many points of likeness, has aerenchyma tissue,
