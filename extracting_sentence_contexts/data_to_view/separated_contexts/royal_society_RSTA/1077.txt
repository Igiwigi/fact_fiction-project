The disturbance is of the same form as (2.1). As the modes evolve nonlinearly, their amplitude is governed by the amplitude equation (2.2)
with the nonlinear term NV being given by (2.3). An important fact is that the nonlinear interaction
drives a spanwise dependent mean-flow distortion, the streamwise velocity of which exhibits a
jump J, across the critical layer, through the jump 7%, (whose expression is given in (2.16)), a
mean-flow distortion, modulated slowly in both space and time, is generated in the main layer
with the streamwise velocity being of O(e) [42], and the pressure is €R-2/ 3m cos(2mé), where pm
is found to satisfy the equation,

With the second-order derivative with respect to x being absent, this is the long-wavelength limit
of the compressible Rayleigh equation. Across the critical layer, the pressure p,, is continuous, but
its radial gradient exhibits a jump
