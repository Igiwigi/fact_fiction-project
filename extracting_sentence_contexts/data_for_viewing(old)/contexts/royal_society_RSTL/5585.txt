The Zenic thus produced agree in number with the Cysticerci swallowed, at least never
exceed them ; they may be traced in progress of development, and when given success-
ively at suitable intervals, the resulting Teanic present corresponding differences of
advancement. :

The Cysticercus cellulosw is believed to be the scolex of the Tanic sotium, which infests
the human alimentary canal; and in an experiment made on a condemned criminal,
these cystic parasites put into the food a short time before execution were afterwards
found in the intestine converted into incipient Tenic, recognizable as the Twnia solium.

The Z7enia being thus developed from the Cysticercus, it should naturally follow that

the Cysticercus is, in its turn, derived from the Tenia ; and the fact is established by
experiments which may be regarded as complementary of the former. Mature segments
of tape-worm, full of embryos, have been given to different animals with their food, and
the tissues of these animals have become infested with Cysticerci. In this way the Tenia
canurus, given to sheep, has been followed by the production of Conurus cerebralis in
the brain of these quadrupeds; Cysficercus fasciolaris has been produced in mice from
the Tenia crassicollis of the Cat ; Cysticercus pisiformis has been generated in rabbits
from embryos of the Tania serrata of the Dog ; and, not to mention other cases, pigs
have become infested with the Cysticercus cellulose, after receiving with their food ripe
segments of the Tenia 80lium of the human 8ubject. Moreover, STeIx found in the
alimentary canal of the larva of Tenebrio molitor, the usual six-hooked embryos of an
undetermined species of Tenia, and on the outer or peritoneal surface of the stomach of
the same larye, numerous encysted Cysticerci, on nearly all of which the six hooklets
