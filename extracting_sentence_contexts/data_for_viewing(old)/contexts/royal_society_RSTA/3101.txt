and can be lower in 1.5°C pathways. The uncertainty about the TCRE and non-CO2 warming
leads to considerable uncertainty about the actual carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5°C
(table 1). Current 1.5°C budgets discussed in the climate policy context are heavily influenced by
extrapolations of the multi-gas budget estimates derived in the Fifth Assessment Report of the
IPCC [20]. Those extrapolations based on the RCP2.6 or RCP8.5 multi-gas emissions trajectories
suggest a residual budget of only approximately 100 GtCO2 from 2016 onwards. Recently, a study
claimed that the likely 1.5°C budget could be as high as 730-880 GtCO2. This was based on the fact
that the amount of cumulative CO2 emissions to reach current warming levels as backcasted by
Earth system models was lower than empirical estimates of CO2 emissions, and thus the amount
of COz emissions to reach 1.5°C might actually be higher than originally suggested [27]. Given all
this uncertainty, we consider a large range of 1.5°C budgets for our analysis here.

Available 1.5°C pathways tend to lead to peak warming above 1.5°C and return to median
1.5°C temperature values by 2100. The resulting ‘return budgets’ for the period 2016-2100 are
expected to be lower than the peak budgets for CO2 emissions trajectories that peak temperature
at 1.5°C due to hysteresis in the temperature response to net negative emissions [28,29]. Available
estimates for 2016-2100 budgets in a class of 1.5°C pathways with temporary overshoot including
pathways that fall below 1.5°C in 2100 range from —110 to 110 GtCO, [30] and 0 to 220 GtCO,
[7]. Further research will be needed to narrow down the uncertainty about the remaining carbon
