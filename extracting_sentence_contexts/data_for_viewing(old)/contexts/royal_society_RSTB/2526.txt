Sydney for their kindness in this matter.

Polypodiacee,—This group is important from the standpoint of stelar morphology,
because, although possibly not so ancient as some of the foregoing, by its com-
parative luxuriance under modern conditions it affords us the best field for the
study of the possibilities of modification in the so-called polystelic type of cauline
axis, It is further important because most of the work on stelar development has
been done in this order, Van TrecHem states that the polystely which is so charac-
teristic of these ferns, originates by the repeated bifurcation of the central cylinder.
Lecterc pu Sasion (‘ Ann, Sci. Nat. Bot.,’ 7 Ser., vol. 2.‘ Recherches sur la Tige
des Fougéres”) has made a study of the development of the stem in several Poly-
podiaceous species. I have been ableto confirm his results for the most part.
Curiously enough, he does not draw attention to the fact that the data of develop-
ment do not support Van TrrGHEm’s theory of polystely resulting from repeated
bifurcation of the young concentric cylinder. The figures of Lecterc pu SABLON

show that the central cylinder of the young stem quickly becomes a concentric tube
with foliar gaps. The tubular nature of the central cylinder is finally disguised by
the overlapping of the foliar lacune.

Perhaps the most interesting of the species studied by Lecuerc pu SaBion is
Polypodium aureum. He describes the young central cylinder of P. aurewmn as being
