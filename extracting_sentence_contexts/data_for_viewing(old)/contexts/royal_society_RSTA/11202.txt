and 4° C. to the dissociation of “ice molecules” having a greater molecular volume
than the water molecules. This view was elaborated by SurHERLAnD (‘ Phil. Mag.,’
1900, vol. 50, p. 460), who suggested that RénreEn’s ice molecules had the formula
H,0, and might be called tihydrol, whilst the water molecules consisted of dihydrol,
H,0,. A further discussion is given by Srrapuine (‘Jour. Frank. Inst.,’ 1901,
vol. 152, pp. 257-268) with reference especially to the compressibility of water. It
is probable that the simplification in the density-temperature curves of the preceding
Part III. of the paper, which results from the addition of soda or from an increase
of temperature, is due primarily to the destruction of the ice molecules to which
water owes most of its abnormal properties. A similar explanation may be given of
the large negative solution volume of sodium hydroxide, which is most pronounced at
those low temperatures at which the water contains a large proportion of the bulky
ice molecules. This explanation does not, however, in any way account for the fact
that the molecular volume of sodium hydroxide decreases from 70° C. to 100° C. The
only explanation that we can offer to account for this unexpected behaviour is
that over this range of temperature the water contains a large proportion of steam

molecules, having the simple formula H,O, that these, like the ice molecules, have a
larger molecular volume than the water molecules, and are destroyed by adding soda
to the solution. The addition of soda may then be regarded as simplifying the
solution mainly by lessening the proportion of associated and dissociated water
molecules, the water molecules themselves being converted into hydrates of soda
