The chromosomes of Crepis virens are of an extremely viscous nature, which renders
their outline so irregular that it is evident that their width measurement can neither
be definite nor constant. Moreover in ©. taraxacifolia this character is further
accentuated so as to make it impossible in this species to gauge the average width of
the chromosomes.

Tt has already been noted that the chromosomes of the archesporial divisions show
a somewhat early split, and constantly become flattened prior to splitting (figs. 22


CHROMOSOMES CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO PHYLOGENY. 17

and 23). These facts add considerable complications to the taking of width measure-
ments. In order to obviate error on this account only chromosomes in side view
have been measured. The results give many widths of 1:2, with some
measurements at 11 p.
