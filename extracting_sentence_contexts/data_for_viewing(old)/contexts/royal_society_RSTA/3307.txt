orbitals are labelled according to D.., and D,, irreps, respectively, with the corresponding correlations with D,, and G,, point

(tables 6 and 7). Note that although the optimized structures predicted from the CAS(8,12)/AVTZ
calculations are in excellent agreement with those obtained at the FVCAS/AVTZ level, the
inclusion of all valence space in the ndc treatment reduces the energy difference between

forms are separated by 145.6 kJ mol~!. Note that the energy splitting between the 5Bog and TAs
rhombic structures is predicted to be 136.5 kJ mol! at this level. Such a result is in reasonable
agreement with the corresponding vertical excitation energy of 187.2k} mol”! reported by Mass6

decreased if one considers the relaxation of all nuclear coordinates.

The isomerization of LCC dE ) into r-C4 Bog) structure occurs via a C, transition state [r-
CyCA”) (figures 11 and 13). At the CASDC/CBS-8 level, the latter is about 262.4 kJ mol! above
the corresponding linear minimum. The full valence ndc treatment reduces that value by about
108.3 kJ mol~!. Indeed, the classical barrier height predicted from our ve-CASDC/CBS protocol
is 154.1kJmol~!. The corresponding ORC path for such an isomerization reaction is depicted
in figure 13. For this we performed CAS(8,12)/AVTZ constrained optimizations in which a
