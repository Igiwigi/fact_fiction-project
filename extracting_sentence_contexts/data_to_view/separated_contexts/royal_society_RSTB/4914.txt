The female catkin scale of Betula might well be a megasporophyll bearing
three carpels derived by condensation from a pinnate structure. Tt seems to me that once this group of plants had evolved the carpel and the stamen—
the units on which cross pollinating influences could work—it was bound to evolve
various types of floral structure in which the essential units were arranged in different

fruits of some genera of the Menispermacee. Here the development of the fruit is
often accompanied by a great enlargement of the dorsal side, while the ventral side
elongates but little.
