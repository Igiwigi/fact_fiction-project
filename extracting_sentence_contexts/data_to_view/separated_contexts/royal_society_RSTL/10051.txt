W. K. BROOKS ON LUCIFER :

stating that T have fortunately been able to complete his observations upon Lucifer,
and to furnish a very perfect account of its entire metamorphosis, as well as a few
important facts with reference to its development in the egg. : :

At the end of April, 1880, T found a single specimen of Lucifer with two eggs
attached to one of its appendages, and I was led by the great importance and interest
of the subject to make every effort to trace its life-history. For four months I met
with no success whatever, but about the 186 of September I found a few advanced
larvw, and traced them to the adult, and I then sncceeded in finding earlier stages
and tracing them as far as the stages which I had previously found, but it was not until
the last week of my season at the sea-shore that T 8neceeded in hatching the Nauplius
from the egg, and the last gap in my series was bridged by a moult which occurred
only a few hours before my departure. As the result of my four months” efforts I can now state that I have seen the eggs
of Lucifer pass out of the oviduct.
