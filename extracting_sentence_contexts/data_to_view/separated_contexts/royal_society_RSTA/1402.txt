By contrast, for CanWE#4 and #6, the maximum intensity usually occurs after midnight



but the diurnal cycle is less pronounced than for the ‘convective’ CanWEs, as seen in [53], and
matching also what is seen during active monsoonal periods [29]. So, CanWE#4 and especially #6
may be related to larger-scale structures conveying moisture (either when the monsoon is fully
set or where orography or orientation are optimal versus the moisture flow) enabling convection
across larger and longer scales. The fact that CanWE#4 and mostly #6 are more frequent during
the core phase of the monsoon, when the large-scale low-level monsoon flow takes place and can
sustain longer and larger WEs, seems to confirm this interpretation. Future studies examining
the dynamical and thermodynamical environments of the CanWEs are needed to support this
hypothesis. In particular, the possible modulation of CanWEs due to synoptic-scale LPS and
tropical cyclones, or regional-scale intraseasonal oscillations, needs to be deeply explored.
