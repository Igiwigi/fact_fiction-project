14+ (VW,
LACAN) _ py? + I — QUI Pl? = (POP + (1 PL — QI Pw),

and it is readily shown that
PQP + (I — P)(I — Q)I— P) =I — (P + Q) + (PQ + QP).
As P and Q enter in this expression symmetrically, the expression is precisely the same for

LAMAN — POW? + IM PE — Qui.

The empirical QQ effect now follows from the assumption that the operators P,Q do not vary
across respondents (being determined by the questions alone), whereas the mixture of the initial
states y has the same distribution in any two large groups of respondents. At the same time, the
question order effect follows from the fact that |QPw||? is not generally the same as ||PQw \(?.

The QQ equality trivially implies (3.2), ie. lack of contextuality. Therefore, to the extent that
the QQ equality can be viewed as an empirical law (and [26] demonstrates this convincingly
for 72 out of 73 question pairs), the criterion of non-contextuality should be satisfied for any
(V1), (W1), (V2), (W2). We can confirm and complement the statistical analysis presented in [26]
of the 72 questions by pointing out that the overall x? test of the equality (3.3) over all of them
yields p > 0.35, d.f. = 72.

The singled out pair of questions that violates the QQ equality is taken from the Gallup poll
study reported in [27]: paraphrasing,
