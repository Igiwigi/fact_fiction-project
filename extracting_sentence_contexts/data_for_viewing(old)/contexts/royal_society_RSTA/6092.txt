included because energy in any form must participate in the universal gravitational interaction.

Since vacuum energy is liberated from the stress tensor, consequently A is free of the Planck
length, and it could then have any value that the observations determine. It is not to be slated
against any other length scale. Thus A could very well account for the accelerated expansion of
the Universe without any embarrassment and hesitation.

5. Expansion of the Universe

In the text books and elsewhere, the most effective and pragmatic way of envisioning expansion
of the Universe is by taking the coordinate grid that expands. This is perfectly fine as a
computational tool and works excellently. The question I wish to pose relates to the fact that
expansion of the Universe means expansion of space-time which is a physical entity. It bends
or curves like a wire, and should therefore have microstructure with its discrete building blocks.
Further discrete microstructure would also facilitate free propagation of zero mass particles or
electromagnetic and gravitational waves.

Now when we envision its expansion, what is it that is actually expanding? The Universe is
all-inclusive: there is nothing into which it can expand. The only way such an entity can expand is
that at every epoch new space-time is being created everywhere out of nothing [14]. This question
is not admitted in the existing theory: one has therefore to go beyond GR, and again a quantum
theory of space-time and gravity would be required for understanding this creation process.
At each epoch new space-time is continuously being created out of nothing as the Universe
expands. The Big Bang not only created the Universe at one epoch, but also provided energy
