(a) Universal biology

Universal biology is the quest for a fundamental understanding of the basic properties of
living systems, independent of their precise instantiation in chemistry or other media (e.g.
[1]). Such a theory, if it in fact exists, would be the biological counterpart of the abstract
theory of universal computation, due to Turing [2], von Neumann [3] and others. This theory

established the foundation for practical computers, by showing, in principle, that universal :2
computation was possible, and by describing, in general terms, the different components : =
necessary for computation. The theory of universal computation has survived intact during the [3
evolution of several different technologies from the relays, vacuum tubes and switches of the : =
1940s and 1950s up to the present day technology of massively complex integrated circuits. 8
The basic architecture devised by von Neumann, and anticipated by Babbage, remains in use eri
today [4]. im
