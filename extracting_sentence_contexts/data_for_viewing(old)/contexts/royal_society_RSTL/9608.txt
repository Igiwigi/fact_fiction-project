some overlapping sections had completely and permanently destroyed contractional
continuity in the strip, excitational continuity clearly remained intact, as shown by
the occurrence of a decided tentacular wave at the opposite 8ide of the umbrella
whenever the free end of the strip was irritated. That contractional continuity had
in this case been effectively destroyed was proved by tetanising the free end of the
strip four hours after the section with strong faradaic enrrents, and also with Spirit.
Under the influence of such strong stimulation of the free end of the sbrip, the lobes
of the polypite violently writhed, although the umbrella remained quiescent.”

This response on the part of the polypite is of conelusive value as proving the
occasional persistence of excitational continuity after contractional continuity has been
destroyed. My notes contain the record of several other obseryations confirmatory of
this fact, but it is needless to quote them at length. The writhing movements of
the polypite under these cireumstances are often very decided ; but they are usually
wonderfully late in beginning, This is probably owing to the prolonged and uncertain
period of latency which, as stated in my previous paper, is manifested by the polypite
of Aurelia ; for even in experiments where the contractional continuity of the umbrella
tissue has not been destroyed by section, the response of the polypite to strong stimu-
lation of these tissues does not begin till after the violent contractions of the umbrella
have been in progress for a considerable time.

$2. Effects of Erhaustion in impeding the passage of contractile waves —In my
various modes of section of Aurelia I have several times observed a fact that is worth
recording. It sometimes happens that when the connecting isthmus between two
almost severed areas of excitable tissue is very narrow, the passage of contractile
