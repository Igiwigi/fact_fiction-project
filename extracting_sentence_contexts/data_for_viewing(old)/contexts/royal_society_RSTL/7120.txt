It ought not to be forgotten that the blood in all of these cases was not only taken
from the same animal, and the product of one bleeding, but in every respect, both before
and after being put into the receivers, subjected to precisely similar influences, under
identical conditions. The difference in the results must therefore be regarded as entirely
due to the effect of the alkaloids upon the blood.

AcTION OF ANASTHETICS ON BLOOD.

Chloroform.

From the fact that of all anzsthetics at present employed chloroform holds the first
rank, its action upon blood was carefully studied. The results obtained were exceedingly
uniform and all tending to one conclusion, namely, that this substance has a powerful
effect in retarding those chemical transformations and decompositions upon which the
process of respiration depends.
