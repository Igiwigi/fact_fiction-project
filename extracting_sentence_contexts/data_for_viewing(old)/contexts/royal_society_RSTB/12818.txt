the normal evolution of the PLL. An extension of the model into
a 3D domain would be therefore recommended.

In this respect, it is worth noting that the extension of the
model to a 3D domain is not trivial (but not impossible).
Given a spatial domain QC R® and the stripe HC 2,
where the stromal-derived factor is produced, it requires a
careful reassessment of several aspects, e.g. the cell range of
influence and perception, the non-local cell-cell and cell-
chemicals interaction terms. From a biological point of
view, in a 3D context, we could further enrich the model by
including the fact that, during migration, leading cells are
relatively flat with respect to trailing cells. The latter, in fact,
become taller because they constrict at their apical ends
to acquire apical-basal polarity and reorganize into
epithelial rosettes (a process that from a 2D point of view is
obviously neglected).
