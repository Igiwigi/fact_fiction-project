experiences to posterior hot zone activity seems less well sup-
ported (see also [85]). Consequently, the findings uncovered
by studies comparing successful dream recall with no
dream experiences have no clear implications with regard
to the debate between the access and no-access views on
consciousness.

(c) White dreams and the perfect experiment

Before concluding that the evidence emerging from studying
dream experiences is, in fact, uninformative with respect to
the access versus no-access debate, one more phenomenon
needs to be considered: white dreams. White dreams, also
called contentless dreams, are reported dream experiences
without the ability to recall any specific content: after awa-
kening, subjects are certain that they were dreaming but are
unable to report any details about these dreams. In serial
awakening paradigms, approximately 30% of recorded
answers report white dreams [31,50,121-123].

Siclari et al., beyond contrasting successful dream recall
with having no dream experiences, also investigated white
dreams and compared their neural correlates with the
