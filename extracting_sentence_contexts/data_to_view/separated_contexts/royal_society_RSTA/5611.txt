Correspondingly, in d space-time dimensions
we have
Smax = Area - f-?, (1.4)

where Area ~ R4-?,
The second bound on entropy reads

Smax ==, (15)

a
where a denotes the (dimensionless) running coupling among the elementary constituents
evaluated at the scale R (for momentum-transfer 1/R). The two bounds are not independent. In fact, for a self-sustained system (1.1), they are equivalent. For example, in d = 4 a self-sustained
state of N=1/a particles of wavelengths R breaks the Poincare symmetry spontaneously. The


decay constant of the corresponding Goldstone mode is given by (1.2).
