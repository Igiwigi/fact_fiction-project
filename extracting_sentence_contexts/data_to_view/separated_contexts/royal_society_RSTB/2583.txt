Yet, unlike the “mural bars,” they are not placed opposite each other
in adjacent loculi so as to form a continuous ring of thickening. Its Systematic Relationships. If we now compare Porites with Eupsammia, a certain resemblance obtains, which
is due merely to the fact that the growth-parts of the septal trabecule are clearly
defined throughout the whole corallum of Porites. This gives regularity to the
general structure, and, when secondary deposit renders the septa and pali appa-
rently one continuous surface, partly porous, partly compact, the resemblance to the
Eupsammia septum is very great. A comparison of the micrescopic sections,
however, shows a very different fibrous arrangement within the trabecule, that of
Eupsammia being undoubtedly much nearer the Fungide than it is near Porites,
The latter agrees with Turbinaria and Madrepora and differs from Eupsammia in
the contemporaneous time-relations of the development of mural and septal structures,
and in the absence of an “ area of divergence ” at the periphery of the septum.
