Two subsequent
discoveries formed the more immediate backdrop to Harry’s experiments. The first was the
observation by Charles Barkla that ‘secondary’ X-rays were emitted when primary rays fell onto
an elemental target; and that the secondary emission contained a component ‘characteristic’
of the element in the sense that the X-rays from different elements had different powers to
penetrate through thin metal foils [20,21]. Barkla also found that a given element could in fact
emit two different sorts of characteristic X-ray: more penetrating (harder) K-type X-rays and less
penetrating (softer) L-type X-rays [22]. The second was the observation by Friedrich and Knipping
that a spot pattern developed when X-rays from a Crookes tube were transmitted through a
crystal onto a photographic plate, the first experiments involving copper sulfate and zinc blende
(ZnS) [23]. Following Réntgen’s discoveries, there had been ongoing speculation as to whether
X-rays were corpuscular or were a form of high-energy wave-like electromagnetic radiation [24].
