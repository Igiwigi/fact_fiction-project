Either in its ordinary shape, or in its © reticu-
lated ” modification, it is common to the Calamites, the Sphenophyllums, the Astero-
phyllites, and the Lyginodendra. Amongst our British Lepidodendra we have as yet
found only the simple barred form ; and this statement applies not only to the plants
recognised by my opponents as Lycopodiaceous, but also to those Diploxyloid ones for
which they claim Gymnospermous rank. It is a fact of some importance that T have failed to detect in any one of our
British fossil Lepidodendroids (including Sigillari®) a trace of those fibres with
' which exis6 abundantly im all living Cycads, in which
latter, as I showed long ago,* modifications of the spiral and the pitted states can
be discovered in the same individual vessel.+

But M. Rexavrr has discovered in France an important group of carboniferous
plants which undoubtedly possess the barred and areolated tissnes in the s8ame
stems, to which group he has given the name of Porozylg&es; as he points out, these
Poroxylons appear to connect the Sigillari® on the one hand with the Gymnospermous
Cordaites on the other. This very important discovery, the reality of which there
is apparently no reason to doubt, unquestionably links the Palzozoic Lycopodiacee to
the Gymnosperms of the same age, 80 far as elementary structures are concerned, as
completely as any Evolutionist need desire.
