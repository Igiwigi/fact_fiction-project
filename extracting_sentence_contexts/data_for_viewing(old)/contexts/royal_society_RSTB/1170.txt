While Priiczr’s law concerning the upward internuncial discharge of spinal nerve
centres undoubtedly prevails, nevertheless the anatomical investigations of LockKHART
CiarKr, the physiological observations of Brown-SfquaRo, and the anatomical
researches of Go.ai, recently confirmed by Ramon y Casa., show that there must

be descending channels from at least the afferent sides of the spinal nerve centres,
even if there are not direct descending channels. In fact, Goxar’s work goes to show
that there are such direct paths, and this is extended by Kénurker. We commenced
the investigation of this point by the galvanometric method with an attempt to

ascertain whether any electrical change can be detected in the cord below the entry
of the stimulated afferent nerve, and have obtained positive results, Our plan was
to divide the cord in two places, as in Chapter VIII, and to connect the lower
