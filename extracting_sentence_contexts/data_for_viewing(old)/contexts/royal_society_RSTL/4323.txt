area is bordered by cotida] lines nearly parallel to the shore. I must confess, how-
ever, that at present I am unable to carry this hypothesis into comparison with the
general body of the facts. Such a comparison would require obseryations much
more numerous than we as yet possess ; and, as I have already said, even with nume-
rous observations, we can only hope to draw the cotidal lines in the neighbourhood
of the shores.

18. For the same reason I shall not attempt to determine the general course of
the tides in the Pacific ; but I will remark that the view now given of the distribu-
tion of the tides in an ocean explains several of the features of the Pacific tides which
were before very perplexing. If we suppose an ocean tide from the borders of which
proceed tides having their progress marked by cotidal lines, we can easily draw the
lines 80 as to include the following facts of observation :â€”

(1.) The easterly motion of the tide-wave round Cape Horn, which is established
by Capt. Kixe's observations*, and which, as I formerly observed+;, is difficult to
reconcile with the supposition of a tide revolving from west to east round the south
pole. This is explained by its being a tide proceeding from the oceanic tide,

(2.) The tide being at nearly the same hour along a large portion of the coast of
South America, namely, from the western extremity of the Straits of Magellan for
twenty or thirty degrees northward. This shows that the cotidal line is nearly
parallel to the shore.

(3.) The very small tides or no tides at the islands in the centre of the Pacific,
