ever, of the human foetus, have led me also to the conclusions, that during the most
early periods, the cartilage of the epiphysal extremities of bones does not contain any
blood-vessels, and that notwithstanding their absence, the cells of this cartilage are

developed, and its growth carried on; and that at the same time the cells of the epi-

physal and the articular cartilage are formed and developed without the presence of
vessels.

I think it may be naturally deduced from the facts demonstrated in the foregoing
dissections,â€”

First. That during the most early periods of fetal life, the growth of cartilage
takes place, and that its component cells or corpuscles undergo certain progressive
changes in their form and size, without the presence in its substance of any blood-
vessels.

Secondly. That the vessels encircling the cartilage contribute to effect such changes
in its corpuscles, and that the changes are facilitated by the softness of the substance
of the cartilage.

Thirdly. That at the more early period of foetal development the synovial surface
