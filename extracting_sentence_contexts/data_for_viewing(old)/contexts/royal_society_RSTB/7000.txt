E. G. PRINGSHEIM ON IRON FLAGELLATES 319

The height at which the ring first appears depends to some extent on the concentration
of the heavy metal salts. Anthophysa was inoculated into tubes containing leaf mould and
sand, to which 4, 2, 1, 0 drops respectively of a solution of 0-2°% ferrous ammonium citrate
and 0-2°% manganous sulphate were added. Five days after inoculation growth was
observed in all the tubes, being most abundant in those which had received 4 drops and
very poor in those without any addition. The differences concerned especially stalk forma-
tion. Cultures with 4 drops showed long and thick stalks, those with 2 drops only short and
thin ones, those with a single drop still shorter ones. The distances of settlement from the
surface were: 4 drops, 1 cm.; 2 drops, 1-8 cm.; 1 drop, 3 cm.

These observations can be explained by the fact that Anthophysa lives in the zone where
the lower oxide is transformed into the higher. Ferric salts are not poisonous because they
are immediately precipitated. The boundary is therefore determined by the unsuitable
conditions obtaining in the lower regions, which lack oxygen and exhibit a certain con-
centration of ferrous compounds, the two being interdependent. The oxygen is consumed
by the cells of Anthophysa and by the chemical oxidation of the lower oxides, the concen-
tration of which is responsible for the level of the boundary. This is also proved by the
influence of the amount of lower oxides added, which shows that the level, at which the
swarmers settle and develop into colonies, is determined by the concentration of lower
oxides present at that level and the amount diffusing from the region of reduction to that
of disappearance by oxidation.
