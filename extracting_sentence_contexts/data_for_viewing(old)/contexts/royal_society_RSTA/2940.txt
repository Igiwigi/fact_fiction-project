C=2N* cos 20 + cos 269. (3.18)

In figure 4a, we show four different portraits of (3.18) corresponding to the various values of
N. From the results of figure 4 one can clearly distinguish between the three distinct types of
trajectories: (1) trajectories piercing the same localized state without reaching the opposite one (i.e.
© =0, 1 /2—state of complete energy localization on the axial/lateral vibrations, respectively));
(2) trajectories interconnecting both localized states; (3) trajectories that never pass through any
of the states. We define these three types of trajectories as returning, channelling and disconnecting.
In figure 4a(iii),b(/ii), one can clearly observe the existence of ‘channelling regions’ containing
only the channelling trajectories. These regions gradually shrink with the growing value of N
and at a certain critical value of N= Ncr =27'/2 (figure 4c) vanish [56]. Increasing the value of N
further (N > Ncp), one can observe the disappearance of the ‘channelling regions’ (figure 4d). In
fact, the presence of the ‘channelling regions’ on the projection plane (9, @) does not necessarily
mean that each channelling path connecting the lower state (QE =0) with the upper (0 = /2)
one will lead to the complete energy exchanges. As was shown in [56], the only trajectory of the
channelling region corresponding to the complete, recurrent energy transfer must satisfy

2N? cos 20 + cos 269 = 0. (3.19)
