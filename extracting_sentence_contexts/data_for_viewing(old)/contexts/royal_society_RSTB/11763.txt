ing evaluations of summary statistics of visual elements that
cannot be reported. Finally, task relevance and its effect on
categorization appear as a critical variable that determines
report accuracy in tasks such as JB that are often taken as sup-
port for no-Overflow. While this does not provide a full
refutation of the no-Overflow position, it does show that its
proponents fail to supply a unitary explanation of alleged
cases of consciousness without reportability. Since the
relation between consciousness and reportability is precisely
what is at stake, we take it that proponents of no-Overflow
would not wish their view to be based on an insistence that
‘whenever represented stimuli are not reportable, they are
not conscious’. In this context, the fact that different mechan-

(b) Seeing without knowing

A sceptic could (counterintuitively, we believe) argue that
even if people stare at a two concentric circles’ stimuli and
attend to the outer circle (under no attentional or WM over-
load), they somehow do not experience the colour of the
inner circle. To test this possibility, Eitam and colleagues ran
a second experiment [33] in which they capitalized on a
number of recent studies, showing that amodal completion
occurs only when the inducers of the illusory shape are
consciously experienced [58-60].
