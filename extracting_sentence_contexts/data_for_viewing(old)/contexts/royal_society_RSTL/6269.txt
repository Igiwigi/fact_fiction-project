represented by @v=0, and let &, y be any two distinct roots ; we have not only

IN Writing 0=(z—y)*, s=#7+y, we have

e=(o+w/3 0), y=4(8—v/0),

values which are to be substituted for z, y in the equations

ex+98y=0, IE,
We have thus two equations rational in s and 0, and the elimination between them of
the quantity s leads to the required equation in 0. But it is proper to modify the form
of the system ; in fact the two equations are, as regards s, the first of them of the degree n,
the second of the degree n—1 ; but if we write

ox=0, p&y=0, but also ex+y=0,

(@+9)(pr=8y) _Q _f=99 =0,
T=y ET =

then each of the equations will be of the same degree n—1 in s.
For instance, let @py=(, b, c, dv, 1), then a=4H(8+,\/0), y=4(8+\/0); the equations
