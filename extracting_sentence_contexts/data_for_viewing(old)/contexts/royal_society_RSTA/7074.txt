These are equations (5), (6) and (7) of Emmons & Brainerd (1942) in different notation,
the relation between the notations being as follows:

Here Hit; pile 2n* u* v¥ Qw
Emmons & Brainerd (1942) ¢ 6=T/T, 7 U V €&/@

the second of these relationships following from the fact that is constant in Emmons &
Brainerd (1942) so that 7/7, = p,/p.

A further change of independent variable simplifies considerably the numerical or
mechanical integration both of the set of equations (6-8) for zero pressure gradient and, at
least for constant ¢, that of the more general equations (6-7). This is the use of

n= | dy (6-9)

as an independent variable in place of 7*, the integration in (6-9) being understood to be
carried out at constant &. This simplifies the highest derivative term in (6-75) and also, for
constant @, that in (6-7c), with important results in the later treatment of these equations.
