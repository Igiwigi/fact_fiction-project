Diseases of the nervous system, then, may be divided into those which have
their origin at the nervous centres, and those which originate at a distance
from those centres ; and especially in some part of the neryous arc, the func-
tion of which has formed the subject of this paper,—into those of centric and
into those of eccentric origin. It is highly probable that the diseases of the
latter class are more numerous than they may at first be supposed to be.
Chorea, hysteria, tremor, and convulsion have, doubtless, sometimes a centric,
sometimes an eccentric origin. In the latter case, the neryous centres may be-
come morhidly affected in the course of the disease, and the appearances after
death may mislead the medical inquirer as to the original cause and seat of the
disease. But the whole of this investigation must be reseryed for the Trans-
actions of another Society. I shall add but one fact more of a medical cha-
racter in this place.
