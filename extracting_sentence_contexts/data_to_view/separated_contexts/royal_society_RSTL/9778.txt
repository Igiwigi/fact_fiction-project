The lead-silver iodide (p. 1149)
:2 practically does the same thing. This matter is alluded to in greater detail in the
2 general discussion of results (pp. 1162, 1163). S (4) Ib is a curious fact that until the percentage of iodide of silver in the compounds
S becomes considerable, its chief influence is exerted between a narrow range of tempe-

_ oâ€”_ and more than this, s0 s00n as the contraction is over the mass undergoes far
= more rapid expansion than any of its constibuents when heated through the same

= range of temperature. The condition is obviously one of great complexity. Take

5 the case, for example, of the chlorobromiodide No. 3. Between 0* C. and 124* C. any
SV mass of 100 molecules consists of 58 which are undergoing slight contraction on
heating, while 42 are undergoing rapid expansion.
