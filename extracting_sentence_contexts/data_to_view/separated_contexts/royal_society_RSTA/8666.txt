The
direction of the line TS from Tuskar to Ramsey is 8. 574° W. The angle turned
through by the co-tidal line from 6h. 15m. to 8h. 10m. is therefore N. 86° W. minus
8. 57° W. = 364°. As a matter of fact the angle turned through by the co-tidal line is, if anything,
rather greater than this, because the true co-tidal line for 8h. 10m. must be a little
north of Bardsey and south of South Arklow, while the true co-tidal line for 6h. 15m.
must run from a point slightly north of Tuskar Rock to a point slightly south of
Ramsey Island. The true angle between the co-tidal lines for 6h. 15m. and 8h. 10m.
is therefore slightly greater than 363°. Now let us turn to the explanation.
