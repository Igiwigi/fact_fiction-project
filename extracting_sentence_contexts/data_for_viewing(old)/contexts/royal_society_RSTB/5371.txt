as insular for retaining the word “ Corallian ” in his vocabulary. In 1913 Dr. Saureitp
wrote, ‘* Dispensing with Dr. D’OrsicNy’s separate stage of Corallian, I agree with OprEL
in extending the Oxfordian stage up to the Kimeridge, the lowest zone of which I recognise
to be that characterised by Pictonia baylei” [37, p. 423].

At first sight this simplification appears to be an admirable one. For the loss of our
Corallian appears to be amply compensated by the abolition of the, to an Englishman,
extremely confusing terms Argovian, Rauracian, Sequanian, Astartian, Strombian
and Continental Corallien. As we read on, however, we begin to be disillusioned. This
new “ Oxfordian *’ is divided into an Upper and a Lower substage, but the base is drawn
at the base of the zone of Cardioceras cordatum and C. tenuistriatum, that is, somewhere
in our Lower Calcareous Grit. This leaves the Oxford Clay outside the Oxfordian,
for the term is still used sensu Gallico. By this expedient, in fact, the complication is
only transferred lower down, and we are still faced with the irreconcilable English
Callovian and Continental Callovian, Chanasian, Divesian and English Oxfordian,
into which to parcel the Oxford Clay and Kellaways. Further, not all writers since
1913 have followed Dr. SaurEtp, and he himself has not been quite consistent. In
another paper published in the same year he speaks of Lower and Upper Oxfordien as
together an upper subdivision of the “ Oxford ” [38].

Dr. Mortry Davies in his correlation table [25] of four years later brings the base of
the Kimeridge down to the top of the Martelli Zone, and extends the Oxfordien, sensu
