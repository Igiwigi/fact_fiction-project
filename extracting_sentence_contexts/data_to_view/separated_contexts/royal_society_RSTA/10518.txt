Now these are not enough to make Q and § coincide with any two given
polynomials on the upper and lower faces of the beam, Obviously, however, the term
containing x*~' both in Q and § is independent of y and therefore cannot satisfy a
perfectly general condition. If we make this term disappear by writing C, = A,/4,
D, = — B,/4, we have now only 4n — 4 free constants left, but our polynomials


BEAM OF RECTANGULAR CROSS-SECTION UNDER ANY SYSTEM OF LOAD. 147

being now of the (n — 2) degree, we should have enough constants to be able to
identify Q and 8 with any two given polynomials on either face of the beam. As a matter of fact this is not so; for there are solutions, namely, those for:
(i.) a uniform longitudinal tension, (ii.) a pure bending couple, (iii.) bending with
constant shear, which make Q and S zero over both faces and yet do not annul all
the 4n — 4 free constants. There must therefore be relations between the 4n — 4
equations giving the constants. They are not all independent and, consequently,
not every system of surface stress expressible in polynomials corresponds to a
solution of this type.
