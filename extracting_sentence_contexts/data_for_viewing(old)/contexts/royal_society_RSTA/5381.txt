emperature superconductors, the exact path to turbulence, and fluid-dynamics
stability in three dimensions. Among them, we can also include the exact border
oetween classical and QMs and their transition {10]. This latter is closely related
o our present discussion on nonlinear dynamics in nano and meso ‘worlds’.
ndeed, what can lead to nonlinear behaviour at 10-°-10~° m characteristic sizes?
Could typical classical dynamics rule at those scales? Would pure QM, described
by a linear Schrédinger equation, give rise to chaos? Is an intrinsic nonlinear
QM possible? And finally, can the quantum-classical border itself be responsible
for nonlinearities?

Surely, all these are important questions and, in many aspects, far from
1aving definitive answers, each deserving a whole special issue dedicated to it.
Here, we just outline some facts and results, putting the above queries in a
oroader perspective, and presenting partial answers to them.

(a) How small can a classical nonlinear phenomenon be?

To describe nano and meso scale systems, the very first point is to determine
whether the dynamics of interest can be described by classical physics or if
it already behaves quantum mechanically [11,12]. Actually, this may not be a
