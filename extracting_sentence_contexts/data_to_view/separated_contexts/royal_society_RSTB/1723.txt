At the same level all the segments
cut medianly are sterile or all fertile (Photographs 12 and 13). It follows from
these facts that of the six segments of each sporophyll, either the three upper must
be fertile and the three lower sterile, or vice versd. The question whether the
upper or lower segments are fertile may seem a simple one to determine, but as
a matter of fact it has presented great difficulties, and for a long time it was
not possible to obtain direct and conclusive evidence from the material available. The segments are long and slender and in only one instance could the same segment
be traced through its whole length from axis to periphery. This was in the case of
one of the inferior segments of a sporophyll, shown in the approximately radial
section of the basal part of the cone (see Plate 3, photograph 15, and Plate 5,
fig. 154).
