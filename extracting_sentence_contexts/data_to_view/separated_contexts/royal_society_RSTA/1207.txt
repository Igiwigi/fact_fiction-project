The movement of the microscope
over the interval between this location-signal
and the next can then be commenced, by slow
rotation of the big wheel, counting the bands
as they pass steadily through the silver-ring
reference centre and pair of spider-lines, and
adjusting the speed so as to secure deliberate counting. To miss a band or
make a single error in counting is, of course, fatal. A very helpful fact, however,
is that if one rests the ball of the hand on the top of the pedestal on which
the big driving wheel is mounted, and which is fortunately so shaped as to make
a comfortable rest, and effects the rotation of the wheel with the first finger and
thumb, it so happens that one can only pull the wheel over sufficiently to bring one
more band to the centre, so that two bands at a time in rapid succession can never
pass and cause any missing of a band. One band per second is a very suitable speed,
both safe and not tiring. After the passage of 100 bands, the fact is noted in oneâ€™s
notebook, and each 100 as it arrives is duly given its proper sequence number.
