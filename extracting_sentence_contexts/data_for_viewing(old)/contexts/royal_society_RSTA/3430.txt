At time f = €, now without post-selection, the pointer system is not described by a pure state, but
by a mixture. A straightforward calculation yields the density matrix describing this mixture

= (P+Q7)/4A? 4g ((Q—2ge)?+(Q'—2ge)?)/4A?
= e +e . 5.7.

The distance between pex and ®¢, the state of the pointer after coupling to an eigenvalue, is
———_—__— €
Dal@e, pex) =arccos ( (Pel pexl®e)) = $+ Ole). (6.8)

This is a significantly larger distance than (5.5). In fact, the distance (5.8) is of the same order as
(5.2) and cannot be neglected for small e.

While the pointer states (5.4) and (5.7) for a small enough € correspond to similar probability
distributions, they are fundamentally different. As in the case of an eigenstate (5.1), the final
pointer state (5.4) corresponds to a shift of the original distribution given by a single number, the
weak value. When the system is prepared in a superposition of eigenstates, the result is a mixture
of two independent pointer distributions centred around the values 0 and 2, which cannot be
described by a single parameter anymore.

Our demonstration of the weak value as a property of a single pre- and post-selected system
shows that recent classical statistical analogies of weak values [46] which can be formulated only
given an ensemble are artificial.
