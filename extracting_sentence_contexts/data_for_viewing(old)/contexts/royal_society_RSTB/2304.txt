in fig. 45, for these illustrations show that the visual area in this case does not occupy
the usual position but is limited to a part only of this, viz., to the lower lip of the
stem and of the anterior part of the body of the calcarine fissure, together with the
anterior part of the lingual lobule. Hence Lronova, who prepared the sections
described in the paper just referred to from some part of the calearine fissure not
clearly indicated, probably entirely missed the area of special lamination, and so
described the ordinary visuo-psychic cortex in anophthalmos as visuo-sensory.

I have attempted in the following table (fig. 11) to group together the different
classifications of “ occipital” or ‘“ calearine” cortex to which I have previously
referred. It will be seen that my own classification agrees exactly with those of
Meynert and Berz, except in the absence of a scattered spindle layer, which omission
T have already alluded to (pp. 184-185), and in the fact that the layer which I speak
of as “ polymorphic,” is described by Mrynerr as consisting of deep granules, and by
Berz as being composed of isolated pyramids. It also agrees with that of Scunapp,
except in the detail that he subdivides layer 2 into two parts. Krause subdivides
layer 1, and groups layers 2 and 3a as his third layer. Both Lronova and Casau
subdivide layers 2 and 3a differently from other writers, as they do not recognise as a
separate entity the important outer granule layer, and Casau also recognises the
spindle layer of cells. HAMMARBERG also figures the spindle layer, but includes in
his third layer half of the line of GENNARI.

(The basis used for describing the depth of the different layers in the table is the
general average of the measurements taken from Case 1, and stated in Table L., fig. 49,
(p. 212), and Table IIL, fig. 51 (p. 216). It of course does not correspond with
