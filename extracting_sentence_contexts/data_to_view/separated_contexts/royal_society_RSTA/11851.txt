We can refer to Part II. for a point about 16°C. The full curve
of the diagram, Part IT, gives the specific heat at this density, and knowing the weight
(110416 grms.) affording this density we calculate @ and so get the point marked

a if. This is a very reliable point, and as will be seen it carries back with uniformity
S the course of the line at the upper temperatures.

‘= The line for p = 0'124 is given by the following equation :—

2 w == a (100 —t) +b (100 — 7)? + ¢ (100 — 2),
© where @ = 0:003915 ; b = — 0°00000139 ; ¢ = 0:0000000375.

‘a If these numbers are multiplied by the latent heat of steam and divided by W,
By ue. by 536°5/11°042 = 48°56, we get, by differentiating with respect to ¢,an equation
‘a for the specific heat in terms of temperature at the density 0°124 :—

3 C, = a + 2b (100 — t) + 3c (100 — ¢)*.
& where

8 a= 0719020000,

a b = — 0:00006750,

g c=  0'00000182.

= This, of course, is plotted, virtually, by the inclination of the curve upon the plate,
& the ordinates all being supposed as lengthened in the ratio 1 to 48°56.
3 The line above this, p = 071800, shows a rapid upward curvature below 35°; liquid
3 in fact was present up to 18°5. Nothing being accurately known as to the specific
F heat of the saturated vapour, we cannot safely assume anything as to the course of
2 events between the 13° and 35° points. A theoretical point obtained from the curve
A of Part IL, at the initial temperature 15°, lies on the prolongation of the experiments
at the upper temperature.
