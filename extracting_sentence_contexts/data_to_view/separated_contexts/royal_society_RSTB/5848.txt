The specimen shown in fig. 53 can be closely compared in all its principal characters
with the specimens figured by ScuimpeEr (1869, Plate 34, fig. 1), ANTEvs (1914, Plate 1,
figs. 1-8) and Harris (1932, p. 58, Plate 5, fig. 16; Plate 6, figs. 2,10). Dr. Du Torr
(1927, p. 400, Plate 28) records this genus from the uppermost Beaufort beds at Aliwal
North, but his specimens were preserved in sandstone and show little beyond the general
form of the fronds, so that their identification with Lepidopteris stuttgardiensis (Jaeg.)
is very uncertain ; in fact, we cannot be certain that they belong to the genus. FROM THE MESOZOIC ROCKS OF SOUTH AFRICA. 251

The plant found at the Waterfall locality is distinct from the European forms previously
described, but is close to Lepidopteris Ottonis (Goepp.) Schimp. It differs from this
form in having a rachis which is comparatively smooth, especially in the upper part of
the frond, and lacks the characteristic blister-like swellings in the lower part, while the
epidermal cells show sinuous anticlinal walls which are very marked in some of the
specimens.
