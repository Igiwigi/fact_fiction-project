They will now be discussed in turn. As to the first questicn the evidence indicates that in Rhoeo the centre of a primordium
or a small central region is determined first and that from this centre the flanks extend
round the apex until they meet. For the fact that in Rhoeo the flanks of P, continued to
extend round the apex after the centre of P; had been removed shows that once this
extension has begun it does not depend on the presence of the centre. It might, indeed,

be suggested that the whole area occupied by P, had been determined to form a leaf
before the centre was removed and was only gradually occupied by the flanks; but the
results of some other experiments in which the apex was split do not support this suggestion.
