those articular surfaces 80 narrow vertically in proportion to their breadth as they are
in the cervical vertebre of the Pterosauria (76. figs. 1, 2, 12-14, 6b, c): in the dorsal
8eries the cup and ball present more ordinary saurian proportions.

This fact, being established, will give new and increased interest to the working out
and examination of any detached vertebre from secondary rocks which resemble in
texture and 8ize those of Birds and Pterodactyles. It has been alleged, for example,
on microscopic characters of the osseous tissue, that certain pneumatic wing-bones found

8il in Stonesfield slate, are those of birds. But every such vertebra from that lower
Solitic bed which I have yet seen, has the simple terminal articular concavity or convexity
Aaracteristic of the Pterodactyle. A single specimen showing the interlocking joint,
Ee. a transverse concavity and vertical convexity, or the reverse, would establish the fact of
the existence of birds during the period of depoxition of the stratum containing snch
Basil vertebra. There is but one exception, 80 far as I know, in the whole class of
Pirds, to the foregoing type of vertebral structure; this occurs in a bird (Aptenodytes)
Fhich does not fly, but has the wing-bones dense, solid, and modified in form to serve
Hie office of a fin, and is exemplified in but a small part of the vertebral column. In
ER third to the eighth dorsal vertebre inclusive, the fore-part of the centrum is simply
*gonvex (76. fig. 22, c), the hind part concave, and this part is concave in the second
Yorsal; but the fore-part of this dorsal vertebra is concavo-convex, as in the cervical
gertebra of the Penguin, and in the cervico-dorsal vertebre of all other birds. But,
Hosides the reverse positions of the cup and ball in the above dorsal vertebre of the
Penguin, as compared with the dorsal vertebre of the Pterodactyle, the latter might be
Bistinguished by the absence of the large bifurcate hypapophysis (76. fig. 22, hy) which
