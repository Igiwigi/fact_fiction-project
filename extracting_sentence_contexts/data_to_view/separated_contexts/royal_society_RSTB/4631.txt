The cause of this reticulation and the colour of the
scales has given rise to a lengthy discussion,* but the explanation is very
simple, as may be seen by examining the cross-section given in Plate 1, fig. 18. The fine striation is formed by little round bosses, Â«, under which runs a
faint indication of a cuticle, but as the whole scale is pigmented, this is very
difficult to distinguish. The reticulation is due to the fact that the scale is
looped up, as at b, so as to become very thin, and consequently a white line
appears by transmitted light. In between two such thin places the scale is much
thicker. This causes the density of certain polygonal areas, as well as their bright
colour by reflected light, because an increase in the pigment of the absorbing
layer prevents the dilution of the green colour by reflected white light.
