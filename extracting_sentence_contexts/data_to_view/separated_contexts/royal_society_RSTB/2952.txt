In another case (apple) the observed
and calculated rates were 11°2 and 10°83 cub. centims. ; the difference being probably
due to the fact that a little of the water passes through the tracheides and walls of
the wood vessels. Full proof that in the absence of air the flow takes place in
accordance with definite physical laws was obtained by selecting straight young stems
bare of lateral branches for lengths of 10-25 centims., and saturating the stems fully
with water under pressure. The stems used remained living for some weeks after-
wards, Clean surfaces were then cut, water driven through, and the theoretical and
actual amounts of flow compared.
