404 DR.C.CHREE: ANALYSIS OF RESULTS FROM THE FALMOUTH MAGNETO-

extreme years of an 11-year period amounting to 0°73 C. At an average extra-
tropical station, according to HANN, this latter figure is reduced to 0°54 C. Allowing
tentatively a corresponding reduction on the 0°55 C., it becomes 0°41 C, Thus the
differences recorded in Table XX. are not merely of the normal sign, but even of
somewhat the same order of magnitude as they should be according to Hann at an
average extra-tropical station on the average of a number of sun-spot periods. The fact that in Table XX. a rise in the mean annual temperature is associated
with a diminution in the mean daily range may be accidental, but is possibly worth
fuller investigation. § 19. Table XXI.
