roded, by the explosion in the first experiment, as to be ren-
dered quite unserviceable; and what is still more extraordinary,
the barrel itself, notwithstanding its amazing strength, was
blown out into the form of a cask; and though it was cracked,
it was not burst quite asunder, nor did it appear that any of the
generated elastic fluid had‚Äùescaped through the crack. The
-barrel, in the state it was found after this-experiment, is still
in my possession.

These unsuccessful attempts, and many others of a similar
nature, of which it is not necessary to give a particular account,
as they all tended to shew that the force of fired gunpowder is
in fact much greater than has generally been imagined, instead
of discouraging me from pursuing these inquiries, served only
to excite my curiosity still more, and to stimulate me to further
exertions.

These researches did not by any means appear to me as be-
ing merely speculative ; on. the contrary, I considered the de-
termination of the real force of the elastic fluid generated in
the combustion of gunpowder as a matter of great importance.

The use of gunpowder is become s0 extensive, that very im-
portant mechanical improvements can hardly fail to result from
any new discoveries relative to its force, and the law of its ac-
