The passage of
the blood downwards is due to the pressure under which blood is extravasated into
the intracranial cavity. Under ordinary circumstances, as we have shown, the
intracrauial tension rises very markedly at the moment of shot, and continues to rise
as the secondary extravasation occurs. That this rise is the cause of the blood
tinding its way downwards is shown by the fact that in the experiments in which the
cranial vault was removed, this passage of blood to the fourth ventricle did not occur,
although the lateral ventricles were opened by the bullet. Besides, in many
instances of excision of portions of the hemispheres, the ventricle is freely opened
without harm, both in man and the lower animals. The influence of pressure,
however, in these cases may produce the fatal injection just described, as one of us
has witnessed.
