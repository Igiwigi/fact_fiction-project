active electrically, and they are greatly to be preferred as subjects for experiment.
Mr. Wars noticed, in the fish on which he experimented at Rochelle and the Isle of
R&, a retraction of the eyes of the Torpedo at the instant it exercised its electrical
function. This I have not witnessed in the Torpedos of the Mediterranean ; nor,
indeed, have I been able to associate any visi√æle sign, any apparent movement of the
fish, with the electrical discharge.

The electricity of the Torpedo, theoretically considered, offers a wide field for
speculation. Is it, it may be asked, merely a form or yariety of common electricity,
or a distinct kind, or not a single power, but a combination of many powers ?

The first opinion, which is commonly received, and which has been ably advocated
recently by Mr. Farapary, is supported by the majority of the facts adduced in this
paper. The cireumstance principally hostile to it, at least in appearance, is the inter-
ruption of the torpedinal electricity by the smallest quantity of air, and its want of
the power of attraction and repulsion in the air.

These peculiarities are seemingly in favour of the second opinion, that the electri-
city of the Torpedo is specific and peculiar. But, till the opposite surfaces of the elec-
trical organs can be perfectly insulated, 80 that no easier mode of communication is
afforded than through air, they can hardly be considered as deserving of much
weight *. The origin of the electricity of this fish perhaps offers a stronger argument
in fayour of its specific nature ; being, apparently, peculiar and distinct from any
known mode of electrical excitement, independent, as far as we can judge, of chemi-
cal action, or change of temperature, or change of form. But this argument may be
