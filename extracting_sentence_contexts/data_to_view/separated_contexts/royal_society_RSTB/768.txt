In comparing Notornis with
other Rails (26) I took as my standard the length of the trunk as measured from the
anterior end of the coracoid to the posterior end of the pelvis; Fireriverr (11)
employs for the same purpose the length of a thoracic vertebra. But both these
methods would preclude the comparison of the earlier stages, and on the whole I am
disposed to think that the standard here adopted answers the purpose satisfactorily. Graphic representations of the same facts are given in Plates 6 and 7. In fig. 45 the
various parts of the body ar represented in a conventional manner, the vertebral
column being made in each cass 100 mm.
