Note that every parameter dropped considerably. This new proof is not only simpler by the
basic measure of length but also by the other measures as well. We can see that the hint matchers
dominated the search by the fact that the proof was found after only 169 given clauses were
generated. To focus on what I think is important here, I will no longer report the given clause
number; it continues to drop, but does not change significantly after a few iterations of this
procedure. We repeat the process, extracting the 265 clauses from this proof.
