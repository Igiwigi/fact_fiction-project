Although the addition of reactions in the 03 sub-mechanism does not consider synergistic
effects, or how the addition of these reactions affects the rates of reactions present in the original
mechanism, good agreement has been found between experimental results and the simulations
[19,20,22]. From the one-dimensional simulations, flame speed enhancement with 11000 ppm of O3
was found to be over 11%, while the experimental enhancement was approximately 7%. This
difference is partly due to the fact that the one-dimensional simulations fail to capture any
stretch effects that would be present in these flames as the one-dimensional calculations are at
zero stretch (figure 4). So while the kinetic processes would be captured, the comparison to the
stretched flames in the experiments may not be suitable. Therefore, two-dimensional simulations
were performed using the unsteady ignition and combustion with reactions (UNICORN) model
[28,33-36].
