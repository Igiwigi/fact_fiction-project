burnt in the respiratory passages. They had great difficulty in breathing, and felt
choked ; some noticed a gentle return current, which brought fresh air and relief to
the suffering. The burns on the bodies of those least severely injured were often
beneath their clothes, which had not been ignited or destroyed. In the north end of
the town the corpses were superficially charred; their clothing had often entirely
disappeared. It is probable that in many cases death was instantaneous, though
many of the stories which were printed in the papers as to the attitudes in which
the bodies were found are not worthy of credit.

The Effects of the Eruptions on St. Pierre and its Vicinity.

We visited St. Pierre in the beginning of July, 1902, and are able to confirm
from our own observations the majority of the facts already described by Mr. Hrx1,
Professor Russet, and the French Commissioners. Before we arrived much time
had elapsed, and the eruptions of May 20th, 28th, and June 6th had added their quota
to the sum of destruction, Moreover, the city had for 36 hours after the first eruption
been the scene of a gigantic conflagration. The piles of coal on the wharves still
smoked when we were there. No good evidence is yet available of its condition when
the first blast had finished its deadly work, except, perhaps, the reports furnished by

and demolished many houses, weakened as they must have been by the fire which
consumed the city. In the north end of the city, across the Rivi√©re Roxelane, all
houses were levelled with the ground, except where they stood below the bluff which
