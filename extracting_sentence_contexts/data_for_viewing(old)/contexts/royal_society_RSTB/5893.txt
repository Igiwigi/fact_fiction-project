rostrum of the frontal lobe, is more evident in the Chinese, a feature already noted by
PaRKER and MILs (1886) and by Dercum (1889, 1892).

The average of the Japanese-skull is slightly less mesocephalic than the Chinese.
Apacut gives the Japanese an index of 78-3 for the males and 79-3 for the females ;
others give it a slightly higher index, 80-82. Thanks to the kindness of Professor G.
Fuse, in Sendai, I had at my disposal eight brains from Japan, all of them well fixed. In
Plate 45 I give photographs of three of these brains. In all my specimens the following
points may be seen :—

The Sylvian angle is less small (average 31-5°) and the superior temporal convolution
in all cases has a distinct frontal curve, though less so than in distinct brachycephalics.
Corresponding with these facts the temporal lobe is somewhat larger in dorso-ventral
dimension and its fissuration tending more to transverse fissuration than in the Chinese.
Concerning the Rolandic angle (average 64°) I should not like to make any statements.

The rounder form of the frontal lobe as compared to the Chinese is evident on first
sight in all my eight specimens ; it may be more emphasised by connecting the temporal
perpendicular, where it intersects the dorsomedial edge of the brain, with the most
frontal point of the frontal lobe.

The angle thus formed with the temporal perpendicular is constantly larger in my
Japanese (average 40°) than in my Chinese brains (average 35°). The same is seen in the
three Japanese brains described by Serat (1913).
