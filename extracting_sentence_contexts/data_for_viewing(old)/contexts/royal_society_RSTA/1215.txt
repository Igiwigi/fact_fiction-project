This evolution process describes the fast ageing with small number of mutations during mitosis
compared to the total number of offsprings.
Define now two mappings 71, P : L(G) > L(G),

where e; and e; are the left and right eigenvector of K associated with 4 =1 and normalized so
that e; - ey = 1. Let I denotes the m x m identity matrix. Note that /71|p™ is the spectral projection
onto the eigenspace ker(I — K) along ran(I — K) while P is a projection onto the finite-dimensional
subspace R” Cc L1(G). Here and in the following, R” is considered either as linear space (R”, ||-Il,)
or as a linear subspace of (L1G), Il L1)), that is the subspace of the edge-wise constant functions
on the graph, which does not cause an ambiguity.
In the following results, we shall use the facts that K is contractive and 4 = 1 is its semisimple
eigenvalue, see [49, eqn. (17), Rem. 1]. For the considered biological model, they are naturally
satisfied.

Theorem 4.1 ([49, Cor. 1&3, Thm. 4.1]). For any ¢ > 0, let u,(t) = T(t)xo for xo € L!(G) be a solution
of (2.5)-(4.1). If u(t) = T(t)u(0) is a matrix semigroup solution in R" of the problem

u(t) = 1, QMu(t), £>0,

u(0) = IT, PXx9, (43)

then the following results hold.
