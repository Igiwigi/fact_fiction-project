Probably, therefore, the stomach cuticle of the Septibranchs is merely an
extension of the gastric shield of the other Lamellibranchs. Surrounding the epithelium there is a well-developed layer of circular muscle
fibres (c.m.), and fine fibres also pass between the cells of the epithelium, especially
in the centre of the ridges. The presence of these muscles, and the fact that the
stomach in Cuspidaria is practically free from the surrounding tissues, provide further
important distinctions between the stomach of the Septibranchs and those of the other
Lamellibranchs. Digestive Diverticula.â€”The opening of the anterior and smaller duct of the digestive
diverticula in C. cuspidata is shown in fig. 7 (d.).
