EPhe result was a slight apparent increase of resistance, but the irregularities were so
Great that no certain conclusion could be drawn except the following :—The con-
ductivity observed was almost entirely, if not entirely, in the sulphur itself, and not
gon the surface. This was further proved by removing the drying substance (phos-
‘phorus pentoxide) and blowing in a current of warm air saturated with water vapour,
gWwhen it was again noticed that no appreciable change of resistance took place. We
‘Eshall see later on that the explanation of this result lies in the fact that sulphur
Zdoes not appear to condense moisture so as to reduce its apparent resistance, as glass
Adoes. With the arrangement described the conductivity of the condensed layer was
‘osmall compared with that of the sulphur itself. This result was true whether the
quartz rods were in or out.
