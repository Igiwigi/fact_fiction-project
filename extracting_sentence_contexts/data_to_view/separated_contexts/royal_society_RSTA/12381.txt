A. Comparisons or Viscosity Macnivepms av ran BorLina-Pour. Following the suggestion of Scuréper and Kopp, the temperature of the ordinary
boiling-point has been largely used in the comparison of the physical constants of
liquids ; at this temperature the vapour pressures of the substances ave, of course, the

Ssame, and this equality seemed to justify the use of the boiling-point a8 a comparable
Stemperature,

& Gunpserc has pointed out that the reason why Korr obtained relationships

cprotiably lies i the fact that the boiling-point is approximately n so-called oore-
geponding temperatare.

e It may be contended, however, that this argument is not altogether valid. Seeing
