finding good agreement with the theoretical predictions. Both types of experiments have an
oscillatory nature and exhibit phase invariance in the absence of external perturbations. In [41],
a PRO was submitted to temporal periodic rocking, and the transmutation of vortices into phase
domains and the stable excitation of phase domain walls were demonstrated. A similar set-
up, but now with a small aspect ratio (small Fresnel number in the optical terminology) was
considered in [42], now under spatial rocking. That experiment could evidence the phase-bistable
nature of the rocked emission, but clearly not the pattern formation predicted by the theory; an
experiment addressing pattern formation in a spatially rocked PRO is under progress at present.
The nonlinear electronic circuits considered in [37,43] were Chua circuits, which are highly
versatile and controllable, in particular they can be tuned to a Hopf bifurcation giving rise to self-
oscillations. Clearly, these systems are zero-dimensional in space; hence, in those experiments,
only the phase-bistable response associated to rocking was demonstrated, both under periodic
rocking [43] and under random rocking [37]. The fact rocking shows its effectiveness in systems
as diverse as optical and electronic evidences its universality.

From the theoretical side, rocking has been investigated in PRO models under temporal
[41] and (small aspect ratio) spatial [42] rocking. Two-level laser models have been studied as


well: temporal rocking in zero-dimensional class B lasers was considered in [44], spatial rocking
in small aspect ratio lasers (with just two transverse modes) was studied in [45], and zero-
dimensional bidirectional lasers under temporal rocking were investigated in [46]. In all cases,
the basic phenomenon, phase bistability, was demonstrated, which in its turn yields new types
of solutions, especially in the bidirectional laser case [46]. The spatial rocking has also been
numerically investigated in semiconductor-based lasers, namely in broad area semiconductor
