The
xylem, though slightly deformed, is evidently triarch, and agrees well with that of
the other specimens, but in this case no secondary growth had yet taken place. Immediately beyond the phloem, which is partly preserved, is a zone of larger cells
which were evidently undergoing active tangential division. This zone, in fact,
represents the periderm at an early stage of its development. Adjoining it, on the
outside, is a single layer of large cells, which do not fit on to those of the periderm. We can hardly interpret this layer otherwise than as an endodermis, though I could
not satisfy myself as to the presence of the characteristic marks on the radial walls.
