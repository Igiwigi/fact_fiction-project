Simulations were run for


35-50 ps of production time using supercell sizes of 32 (CuCl), 64 (LiCl) or 108 (CuBr, Cul, Agl)
atoms (except CuBr, which was run for 16 ps). For CuX, a CP fictitious mass of 800a.u. and a
timestep of 0.15-0.2 fs were used. For AgX, a CP fictitious mass of 400 a.u. and a timestep of 0.3 fs
were used. For rocksalt LiCl, a single vacancy was introduced in the 64-atom supercell to facilitate
hopping, and a CP fictitious mass of 400 a.u. and a timestep of 0.2 fs were used. All simulations
were run at 700K except LiCl, which was run at 800 K.
