attack. The usual source of those forms of disease is in the intestinal canal,
the stomach being irritated by improper diet or the bowels by morbid contents.
This division of the subject leads to an important distinction of these cases
into those which admit comparatively more easily, and more difficultly, of cure.

Epilepsy is plainly of two Kinds : the first has a centric origin in the me-
dulla itself; the second is an affection of the reflex function, the exciting cause
being eccentric, and acting chiefly upon the nerves of the stomach or intes-

frequent occurrence of a fit of epilepsy in coitu is very interesting in reference
to the reflex function : it distinctly connects these two events ; and it affords
another instance of an influence exerted, through the medium of this function,
between distant parts of the spinal marrow. There is but a step, as it were,
from the normal affection of the nervous, muscular, and respiratory systems, in
that circumstance, to an attack of epilepsy itself.

The disease termed asthma claims rather more than an incidental notice in
this place. True asthma, viz. that form of this disease which occurs in youth,
and assumes a distinctly spasmodic form and course, like 80 many other mor-
bid conditions of the reflex function, frequently arises from gastric or intes-
tinal irritation. It is also frequently excited by the contact of certain powders,
