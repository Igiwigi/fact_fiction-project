The long time during which blood

* From what has been Â«tated in the text, it is evident that the ammonia theory of Dr. B. W. Rronanvs0x
does not account for the fluidity or coagulation of the blood within the yessels. But the facts mentioned
by that gentleman in the valuable exsay which has gained the las} A8TLEY Cooper prize, and also my; owty
experience [xee the paper before referred to], haye convinced me that a certain amount of the volatile alkali
does exist in freshly-drawn blood, and that it has the effect of retarding the process of coagulation. This
principle must be borne in mind in all experiments upon this subject, in order to understand circumstances
which would otherwise be inexplicable.
