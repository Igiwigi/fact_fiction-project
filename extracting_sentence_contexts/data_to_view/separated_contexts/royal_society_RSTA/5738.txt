Although the two spatial points in the pair both oscillate independently as two separate
Mixmaster universes, we pose the question whether or not the ‘receiver’ B achieves
perfect synchronization with the transmitter point A independently of any initial conditions,
asymptotically towards the singularity gradually, and at an exponentially fast rate. In that case,
A and B will thereafter oscillate in absolute unison towards the singularity. In fact, the thought
strikes one that B may be able to do so even if it receives from A only part of the information that
fully characterizes the state of the transmitter point A, ina manner analogous to the Pecora-Carroll
model described earlier. A solution to this problem is found in this paper. In the following, we are not interested in the separate dynamics of two Mixmaster points A, B,
the first given in terms of the (N, ) variables and the second in terms of the (M, /7) ones, but
in their interaction dynamics, their synchronization dynamics, which is a third, new, dynamics
satisfying equations to be derived below.
