seem to be much deeper in significance and far more difficult to understand. The black
pigment patches and minute black dots are cuticular and superficial, while the ground-
colours are sub-cuticular and deep-seated ;. and in the most brightly coloured pupz they
are mixed colours due to the existence of different pigmentary (and probably chloro-
phylloid) bodies present in the different elements and at different depths of the’
sub-cuticular tissues of the same pupa. In other pupe no trace of such colours can be
seen. Hence we see in these most complex and varied effects of the stimulus
provided by the reflected light, which deepen into their permanent pupal condition
very many hours after the stimulus has ceased to act, the strongest evidence for the
existence of a chain of physiological processes almost unparalleled in intricacy and
difficulty, while a theory of comparatively simple and direct photo-chemical changes
induced by the stimulus itself without the intervention of such a physiological circle
seems entirely inadequate as an explanation of the facts.

Observations upon the Colours of the Pupe in the Genus Ephyra.

After the consideration of the variable pnp of many species of Rhopalocera it is
interesting to compare the results obtained after an examination of the equally exposed
and variable pupze of a single genus of the Heterocera—the genus Ephyra. In 1883
I had the opportunity of studying the life-histories of three species of this genus
(Z. pendularia, E. omicronaria, and £. orbicularia), and an account of the investiga-
tion is published in the ‘ Transactions of the Entomological Society of London,’ Pt. L.,
1834, pp. 50-56. A short summary of the results obtained is given below. The
larvee of EL. pendularia ave dimorphic in the last stage, appearing in the two most
usual colours, green and brown; those of 2. omicronaria are similarly dimorphic, but
