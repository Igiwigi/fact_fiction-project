The central mass is composed of large rounded polygonal entoderm
cells, which differ little in strucbure from those of the ectoderm.

$3. General considerations and comparison. with other forms. With the Å¿ormation of the germ-layers the segmentation may be regarded as
finished, and it may be useful to review the facts in comparison with other forms, in
order to appreciate their significance. Examples of the continued division of the segmentation nucleus before cleavage of
Sthe vitellus are very common, but in most cases the nuclei become far more numerous
Nbefore cleavage occurs than in the ovum of Renilla. In the case of the Isopod Asecllus
Z(Vax BEeNEDEN) the 8egmentation is entirely similar to one of the forms observed in
=Menilla, the nuclei multiplying to the number of eight, and the vitellus then dividing
Sat once into eight spheres.
