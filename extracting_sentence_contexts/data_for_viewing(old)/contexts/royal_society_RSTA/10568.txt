that 8V,/8A is negative for normal changes of current though it is positive for
non-normal changes with these carbons, currents, and length of are.

To sum up the change in the value of 5V,/8A produced by coring one or both of
the carbons, we find that while coring the positive carbon alone makes very little
difference in either the normal or non-normal change of cross-section that accom-
panies a given change of current, coring the negative carbon diminishes the change
of cross-section, both for normal and non-normal changes of current, but more for
the second than for the first, and more when both carbons are cored than when the
negative alone is cored. Thus, coring the negative carbon both diminishes and
retards the change in the cross-sections of the are that accompany a change of
current. This retardation of the change of cross-section is quite sufficient to account
for the fact already mentioned on p. 311, viz. that if I quickly altered the resistance
in the cireuit outside the arc, when both carbons were cored, I could sometimes see

the first quick swing of the voltmeter needle in the same direction as that of the
ammeter, but never when both were solid. For as the resistance did not alter
directly after the current, with the cored carbons, the new current would be flowing
through the old resistance for an appreciable time after the change, and so the
accompanying change of P.D. in the same direction as the change of current would
be able to influence the voltmeter needle.
