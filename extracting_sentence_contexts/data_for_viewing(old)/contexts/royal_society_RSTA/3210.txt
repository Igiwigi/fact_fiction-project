the previous section should be revisited. Except for the last one: again, the virtual antiquarks in
nucleons will be sensitive to a non-vanishing coupling to the background. These possibilities are
not so explored, and it could happen that the experiments with trapped antihydrogen yield the
best constraints for certain models (more at the end of this section).

The gravitation for antimatter in the context of theories with spontaneous breaking of Lorentz
invariance has been studied in [8,9] (see also [35]). Eventually, it seems that some of the coefficients
of this formalism (called SME) may be constrained for the first time by future experiments of
trapped antihydrogen. I still believe that the proper calculation of the effects of the SME (including
the antimatter contribution) in the nucleons would also allow one to test these coefficients with
experiments involving pure matter fields.

Concerning the bounds coming from the fact that scalars and vectors couple to different
bilinears (WW and Wy"W), one can also find new possibilities if Lorentz invariance is broken.
For instance, a scalar can effectively be coupled to x,Wy"W Â« Wy. Besides, the kind of forces
mediated by bosonic fields around background values depending on space or time can be
different from the standard ones; see [36] for an example with scalar fields.

A systematic study of all the possibilities opened by these new options may reveal novel
interesting phenomenology. Maybe even a repulsive effect between matter and antimatter! (recall
that in the standard case we could only get extra attraction). However, one should be aware of
the baroqueness that I am introducing without any experimental or strong theoretical motivation.
But no fundamental caveat seems to hold.
