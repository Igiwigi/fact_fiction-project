numerous applications of the apparatus. In all the experiments the tube remained
perfectly transparent throughout, and, on pumping, the needle in each case returned
accurately to zero.

d 3. In my last paper I brought the fact s0mewhat prominently forward that the elementary
bodies which I had then examined were far less hostile to the passage of the longer
undulations than the compound ones; and I founded at the time certain theoretic con-
siderations on this fact*. TI was desirous this year to extend the experiments to one or
two of the coloured gases and vapours, and on the 20th of September resumed my expe-
riments on chlorine. This gas is itself highly coloured, and of a specific gravity of
2-45; one of its compounds, hydrochloric acid, is quite transparent, and of specific
gravity of only 1:26.
