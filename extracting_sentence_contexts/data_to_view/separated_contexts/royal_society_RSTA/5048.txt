To

understand the wide utility enjoyed by X-ray imaging

in its most commonly realized forms, to take a second

example, it is enough to appreciate that an X-ray can also

e-mail: d.mcmorrow@ucl.ac.uk Questions relevant to the physical sciences demand
not only using these two particular aspects of the
photon-matter interaction, but also the fact that a photon
carries angular as well as linear momentum, has a
magnetic as well as an electric field, can be inelastically
as well as elastically scattered, has a polarization,
etc. [1]. These photon attributes allow the myriad
forms of spin, charge and orbital ordering and their
dynamics to be characterized and understood. At the
same time as opening up new opportunities, exploiting
the full range of photon characteristics represents a
formidable challenge for the provision of specialized
