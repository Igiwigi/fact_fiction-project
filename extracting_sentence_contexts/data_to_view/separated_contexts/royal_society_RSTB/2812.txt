The tracts which bear the sporangia
being thus variable, it would appear that the Equisetum-type is merely an extreme case,
in which the whole series of sporangiophores which form the terminal strobilus are
collectively above the last leaf-sheath, and that last leaf-sheath is of a reduced type,
and appears as the annulus.

* It is not contended that structures similar in form to these sporangiophores never originated from
phyllomes ; for instance, the foliar nature of the carpels of certain Cyeads are clearly of phyllome nature.

My own opinion is that in the present state of our knowledge the case is not proved
either for the phyllome theory, which is out of harmony with the known facts in the
fossils, or for the non-phyllome theory, which certainly is a less obvious explanation of
the Hquisetum strobilus. But the balance of evidence seems in favour of the latter,
as without undue pressure it covers the whole area of facts, while it harmonises also
with what is seen in other groups of Pteridophytes.

(5). Toe Type oF THE FILICINEA. In view of the difference in construction of the sporophyte in Ferns from that of the
strobiloid Pteridophyta, it is necessary first to inquire what are the probable relations
of these series.
