In nouns. Friel have an elongated acute spire, as in the various species of
Fazciolaria, and in the turreted shells, snch as the Terebre, Cerithia and Tur-
ritelle, it entirely fills the cavity of the tips, which, from their small size and
original thinness, would otherwise have been liable to be broken. Its deposi-
tion is not confined to adult shells, for I have observed it filling the cavity of
the upper volutions, and lining the succeeding ones, in a slit specimen of a
young Strombus gigas in the possession of Mrs. J. P. ATxIxs, to whom I take
this opportunity of expressing my thanks for her kindness and liberality in
allowing me to examine the numerous dissected shells in her collection.

In those Volates which retain the nucleus (or that: form which the shell has
when first hatched,) that part, which was originally very thin and brittle, is
gpeedily filled up with the deposit in question. In fact, all shells whose spires
are exposed, and, being thin in their young state, would be liable to be broken
off by the action of the sea, have that part strengthened by the internal deposi-
tion of calcareous matter.

'The distinction between these and the decollated shells, such as Bulimus
decollatus, Cerithium decollatum, &c., is, that in the latter, the animal, instead
of lining the upper whorls with an internal coat, snddenly withdraws its body
from them and forms behind its extremity a concave septum ; and the vital
communication between the body and the apex of the shell being thus cut
off, the latter part decays, in the manner of a dead $hell, and falls off in par-
ticles*,
