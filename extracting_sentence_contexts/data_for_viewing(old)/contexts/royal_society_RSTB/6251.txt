THALAMIC CONNECTIONS IN THE BRAIN OF THE MONKEY 335

a circumscribed but quite small patch of cell atrophy (not more than 1 mm in
diameter) is present close to the dorsal surface of the thalamus in the boundary
between the medial edge of the element Zé and the lateral margin of p§, fig. 15.
A few sections further rostrally this patch of atrophy has disappeared.

Except for this small area at the caudal end of the thalamus, the thalamic nuclei
(including nucleus fd of the pulvinar) are all entirely normal throughout their
whole extent. The slight degree of cell atrophy in the thalamus in this experiment
is evidently related to the fact that the cortical lesion was mainly confined to an
area of the parietal lobe which, as shown by Portax’s researches (1932), does not

receive thalamo-cortical fibres. The degeneration in the caudal end of the lateral
nucleus may be secondary either to the involvement of the caudal margin of
PotAK’s “ somatic sensory ’’ region, or to the involvement of the upper end of his
projection area of unknown significance, which he found in immediate relation to
