group of cells is the forerunner of the young asci, and may be termed the Ascogonium.

As development proceeds continuously, the outermost layers acquiring thicker and
more deeply coloured walls, the above named group of upright cells become relatively
larger, increasing slowly in number by a few divisions, while the difluent, compressed
cells between them and the outermost layers slowly give up their contents, and
become reduced to mere granular streaks embedded in a jelly-like mass of swollen and
fused cell-walls (se Plate 42, fig. 31). This process is exactly comparable to what
takes place in the developing embryo-sac of certain phanerogams,* or of the pollen
mother cells in the anther, in 80 far as the larger cells clearly develop at the
expense of material derived from those around.

The tuft of 8uecessful cells thus nourished is, in fact, the © ascogonium” of this
fungus. Ab a lightly later stage than the one last figured, the space formerly
occupied by the deliquescent remains of small cells is filled with an almost trans-
parent semi-fluid mucus, in which a few bright granules are embedded ; while the lower
part of the perithecium contains a tuft of asci in various stages of development
(see Plate 44, fig. 33), and which have evidently proceeded from the large cells of
figs. 28 and 31 (Plates 44 and 42), which have devoured all, or nearly all, the
smaller oft, cells surrounding them.

Sections of perithecia at a stage between those shown in figs. 31 and 33 (Plates 42
and 44) have not been obtained, but enough evidence has been secured to enable me '
to conclude that the asci are the direct result of the transformation of the elongated
upright cells of fig. 31 (Plate 42), which are nourished at the expense of the cells of
