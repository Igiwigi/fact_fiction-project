Still, these inversions are often convenient, because they are relatively quick, and they
always give a result (as long as they converge). However, this latter feature is dangerous, because
structures along the line of sight make a reliable interpretation difficult: if there is a compact
dense and a more extended less dense structure along the line of sight, the resulting density will
be somewhere in the middle, not necessarily reflecting the properties of any of the structures
along the line of sight [61]. This simply reflects the fact that these inversions often are an ill-posed
problem [62]. The inversions make implicit assumptions that are often forgotten when using an inversion
code as sort of a black box, e.g. for the emission measure inversion or density analysis with
tools such as CHIANTI [63]. Examples for the implicit assumptions are ionization equilibrium =
or absence of deviations from the line formation temperature due to flows and fast temporal :
changes.
