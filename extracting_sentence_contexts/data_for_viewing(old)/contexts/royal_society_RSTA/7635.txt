pression (1-2), which was propounded by Gladstone and Dale (1858, 1863) as the result
of experiments on water and carbon disulphide at different temperatures. Sutherland
(1889) has attempted to give a theoretical basis for this relation, though without much
success.

The third relation is probably the most interesting both theoretically and practically.
It was independently derived by L. Lorenz (1880), of Copenhagen, and H. A. Lorentz
(1936), of Amsterdam, from entirely different theoretical grounds, the former by con-
sidering the passage of light through ponderable media consisting of spherical molecules
immersed in an ether having the properties of an elastic solid, and the latter from his
own theory of electrons considered in relation to Maxwell’s system of equations for the
electromagnetic theory of light. Lorenz, Prytz and others have found it particularly
successful in correlating the facts when a liquid passes to the gaseous state.

In general, the experimental comparison of the three relations in the case of gases at
normal densities is not so easily made as it is in the case of liquids, although a consider-
able amount of research has been devoted to the subject owing to the ease with which
the density of a gas may be varied by alterations of temperature and pressure. ‘The
reason for this difficulty is that the refractivity of gases at normal densities is small,
and the first and third relations quoted above therefore reduce, as a first approxi-
mation, very closely to the same simple form as the second, as has been shown by
Lorentz (1936, 2, 88).
