of the two gases; they burnt violently within the cylinder,
but, though the upper part became nearly white hot, yet no

explosion was communicated, and it was necessary to with-
draw the cylinder to prevent the brass 'wire from being
melted.

These results are best explained by considering the nature of
the flame of combustible bodies, which, in all cases, must be con-
sidered as the combustion of an explosive mizture of inflammable
gas, or vapour and air; for it cannot be regarded as a mere
combustion at the surface of contact of the inflammable matter :
and the fact is proved by holding a taper or a piece of burning
phosphorus within a large flame made by the combustion of
alcohol, the flame of the-candle or of the phosphorus will

appear in the centre of the other flame, proving that there is
oxygene even in its interior part.

The heat communicated by flame must depend upon its
mass; this is shown ,by the fact that the top of a slender
cylinder of wire-gauze hardly ever becomes dull red in the‚Äù
