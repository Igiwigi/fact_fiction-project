He obtained it, in
the preparation of the nitro-muriat of copper, and also by a
partial abstraction of the acid of the deliquescent muriat, by
means of an alkali, I have found that it may be procured in
several other ways. It may be made directly by adding the
hydrated blue oxide of copper to a solution of muriat of cop-
per; and it may be very readily and economically prepared,
by exposing to the atmosphere slips of copper partially im-
mersed in muriatic acid; and it is also produced by the expo-
Sure of cuprane to the atmosphere. Its production in the last
instance is accompanied with that of the deliquescent muriat
and the formation of both seems to be owing to the absorption
of water and oxygene; for cuprane, I have found, though appa-
rently not in the least acted on by dry oxygene gas, is quickly
changed when moistened with water and confined in a jar of
this gas, and there is a rapid absorption of oxygene,*

I have not examined all the specimens obtained by these
different methods minutely, though sufficiently, I conceive, to

* I have been informed that submuriat of copper is sometimes found in the neighÂ»

bourhood of volcanoes, particularly in that of Vesuvius, By means of the above facts,
It is evideut that its production might be accounted for in such situations,
