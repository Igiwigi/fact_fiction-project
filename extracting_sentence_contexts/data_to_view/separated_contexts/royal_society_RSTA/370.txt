The slope of

the long axes of the molecules to the ¢ plane is generally pro-

nounced, varying from about 127 to 135°. (There are devi-

ations at either end of the series.) This molecular arrange-

ment (figure 2) can be considered as a fundamental from

which a great many of the others described here are built up, |

in fact, all the remaining normal type structures. Its relation poe

to the type of ergotetraene (b 211) (figure 3) in which the a tis
and } axes are interchanged is obvious from the nomenclature. |
