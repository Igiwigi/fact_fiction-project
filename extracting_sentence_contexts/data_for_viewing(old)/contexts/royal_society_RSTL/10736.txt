of increase commenced,

larger, and we might expect to find some relation between the decrease of velocity
of increase of resistance and the difference between the breaking-load and the load
actually on the wire. A further examination of the results given in Table XII. shows
that a relation does exis6 of an extremely simple nature ; in fact, if we denote the
breaking-load and the actual load on the wire by P and p respectively, the decrease
per unit of the velocity of increase of resistance is inversely proportional to P—p.
The value of P was carefully determined by loading pieces of the wire by moderate
amounts at a time, and allowing each load to remain on the wire ome ten minutes
before each further addition, and measuring the diameter close to the point of breakage
by means of a wire-gauge graduated to '01 millim. The mean of several trials gave a
value for P of 2625 kilogs. per square centimetre.

Now if t;, ts, t, &c., are the times taken to increase the resistance by successive
equal and small amounts, the ratios t : tt, ty : ft, &c., have been proved to be constant
for the same value of þ : let this constant be denoted by r; then the decrease per
