'=0 Is considering the powers of life, I shall in the first place inquire into the
a Seat, the functions and the nature of each of these powers; and then point out
5 the manner in which they are associated in the production of their more complicated
results*,

© OF the powers of the living animal the simplest is that by which the motion of its
= various members is effected, and which essentially contributes to all its more com-
Sh plicated functions, the contractile power of the muscular fibre, the healthy action of
ES] which is not a state of uniform contraction but of a constant and generally rapid suc-

5 As far as I can, to render what I have done useful, it is necessary that the various facts should be com-
2 pared, and thus the inferences they afford ascertained. They are dispersed through so many publications,
> eleven papers in the Philosophical Transactions, published in the course of twenty years, an Inquiry into the
= Laws of the Vital Functions, a Treatise on the Influence of Minute Doses of Mercury in restoring the Fune-
7 tions of Health, my Gulstonian Lectures on the more obscure affections of the Brain, &c., that although they
= are frequently referred to, it has almost always been, more or less, under mistaken views; because the
2 writer, in commenting on one part, has been unacquainted with others with which it is intimately con-
S nected, for in 80 protracted an investigation, few will take the trouble to keep pace with the inquirer.

y It will appear from the references in the following paper how each of the various facts, dispersed through
p51] 50 many publications, has contributed to fill up the great outline of the laws that regulate the animal fune-
© tions, which has been the object of my labours, and from which the topics of the day have never induced me to
5 swerve. It is evident that this outline must be ascertained, before the functions of particular organs can be
