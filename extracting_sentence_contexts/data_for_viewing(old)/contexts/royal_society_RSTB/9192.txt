Gene Ontology biological processes, Reactome pathways,
KEGG pathways and Wikipathways enriched among the 199
candidate genes are illustrated in figure 2. Overlapping gene
sets are clustered and identified using ClueGo [30] under
default parameters. A number of disease-associated modules
are identified—including tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, cholera
infection and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We suspect that
the enrichment of such categories is a consequence of high
levels of research effort into identification of disease-associated
genes and arises from enrichment of genes generally involved
inimmunity and pathological processes. This view is supported
by the fact that highly specific disease-associated gene sets are
tightly clustered with more generic immune and cytokine pro-
cesses. Hence, the enriched tuberculosis and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS) gene sets are tightly clustered with a
number of pathways and processes involved in tumour necrosis
factor signalling and inflammation. Tumour necrosis factor
plays a major role in the response of the human body to tuber-
culosis infection [49] but additionally regulates trophoblast
migration, invasion and apoptosis in early pregnancy [50—
52], and proteins associated with the tumour necrosis factor
pathway are specifically involved in remodelling of spiral
arteries [53]. Similarly, the leishmaniasis gene set is tightly clus-
tered with biological functions and processes involved in
