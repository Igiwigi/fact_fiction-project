to get to Larissa, but also the reason why. Perhaps the explanation. Such cooperative thinking, as we may call it, S

reason is because Larissa is to the north and this is the road P . P 8 y 7 8

both depends on common ground (what has been passed =<,
down to us from the previous generation) and contributes 2
to it (and sends forward to the next generation). Suppose
one generation believe that the arrows with hawk feathers — w
fly best because hawks fly fast. An individual in the next gen-
eration realizes that the reason hawk feathers work well is = S
because they tend to create a helical shape when attached S
to an arrow, and that if a turkey’s feathers are twisted to Ss
create a helical shape they will work just as well, in fact
better because they are more malleable. Once reasons are
part of our common knowledge, this reason can be added
to the shared pool of knowledge, augmenting everyone's
ability to make good arrows given the greater abundance of
turkey feathers over hawk feathers. Now that we all know,
and we all know that we know, why some feathers work
better than others in the flight of arrows, further individual
or cooperative reasoning about, for example, the specific pla-
cement of feathers for maximal performance can take place.

At the limit, this process results not just in pieces of reason-
ing about the way the world works being inherited and refined,
