smaller than those of
September 14th. With regard to the comparative maturity at various months of the
year, the curve shows it to be more or less constant during April and May, but
decrease rapidly through June and July, till it reaches a minimum about the middle of
August. From this time it begins to increase very rapidly, much more rapidly, in fact,
than it had decreased during June and July, till, by the beginning of October, it he
reached the level it occupied in April and May. As the effect of maturity is so marked in the sea-urchin, it does not seem improbable
that it might have a certain amount of influence in higher animals, and that, for
instance, the offspring of mammals, conceived just before the reproductive organs
become functionless from age, should be, on an average, of smaller size than thos
conceived during their full maturity, This does not seem to be the case, however, ¢
Mr. Gauron has informed me, in a private communication, that a provisional inqui
made by him did not seem to show any difference between the children of old couples
and those of ordinary couples, or any difference between the produce of old and young
thoroughbred stallions. In the curves of Fig, 4 the values given up till April 17th are only calculated one
The larvee in these observations were mostly measured after five or six days’ develop:
ment, and hence corrections obtained from other determinations have been made, #
bring them up to their size after eight days’ development.
