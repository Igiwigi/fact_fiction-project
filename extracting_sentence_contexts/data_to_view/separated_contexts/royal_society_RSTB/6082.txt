By
his finger manipulation Berrrorr brought the posture of the unilaterally delabyrin-
thized animal back merely to symmetry. By the same means as it can be undone,
the original asymmetry can be over-corrected, and the frog will then retain for a time
a posture in which it actually leans to the intact side. This striking fact provides
further evidence that, when once the labyrinth has settled to rest, it ceases to signal. Receptors for the Gravity Reactions

If a frog is both delabyrinthized and blinded, it gives no invariable reaction to
gradual tilting of the surface on which it rests. Usually, at some high inclination of
the substratum, it merely falls off, without having made any previous movement.
