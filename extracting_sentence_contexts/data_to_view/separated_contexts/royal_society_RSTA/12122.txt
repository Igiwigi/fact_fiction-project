There is rather a nice point to be considered in connexion with change (2),
viz., what the pitch, as perceived, really depends on. The coarse statement of exa
tion candidates that it depends on wave-length, or on the frequency of vibration
source, is of course not true; it depends on the frequency of disturbance reaching
receiver. This fact is suggested by listening or looking through a different m
wherein the wave-length is quite different ; though, indeed, it must be admitted
the medium in ear or eye cannot be changed. It is proved (for the case of sou

ereased frequency of arrival, the wave-length remaining unaltered.
