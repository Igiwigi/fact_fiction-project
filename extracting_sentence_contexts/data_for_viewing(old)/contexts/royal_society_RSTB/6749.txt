Where the crater of the mountain would be expected one finds only a mighty cleft
some thousand or more feet deep. This crack appears to have been formed as a result
of earth movement, possibly that which gave rise to the fault-scarps along the south-
eastern margin of the lake.

The western foot of Kulal is surrounded by middle and late Pleistocene basalts
which have been fractured by the faulting that gave the southern end of the lake its
present form. The age of these lavas has been fixed by interbedded lake deposits which
can be related by their altitude and contained fossils to beaches of known age within the
lake basin.

North-west of Kulal Peak and north of Elmolo Bay is Borr Hill, a prominent cone of
aegirine-phonolite. It is in fact an outlier of the older rocks (Miocene?) which stretch
away to the north, where they form the rocky coastline of Longendoti as far as Alia
Bay. Ina journey from northern Horr to Alia Bay the east extension of the same lava
fields was encountered. It then became apparent that although overlain by younger
lavas in places, as at Galass Waterhole and again at Gaza, the main series of lavas was
older and had been faulted (and folded?) by forces acting in an east-west direction.
Since it was found that the lavas were overlain by Pleistocene lake beaches correspond-
ing in altitude to the highest on the Losidok Range, it is probable that the movements
which disturbed these eastern lavas were the same as those which affected the Miocene
volcanics on the west side of the lake. Seen from the-west these lava scarps, like mirror
images of their counterparts in Turkana, form scarps increasing in magnitude towards
the lake where they culminate in the cliffs of Longendoti.
