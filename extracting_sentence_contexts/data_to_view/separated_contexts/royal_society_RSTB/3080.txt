But it is possible that these are unfertilised ovules, though they have
attained the length and diameter of a ripe seed, and it is also probable that figs. 6
and 7 represent normal conditions of the ovule at different stages. However, this is
only a supposition, suggested by the fact that the condition represented by fig. 9
occurs in almost fully developed infrutescences of two different species. Opposed
to this is the fact that the embryo is not differentiated until late in the development
of the infrutescence.
