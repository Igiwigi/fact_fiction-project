SPENCER ON THE

All the fossils are preserved as moulds. It is usual to find only portions of the body of the
starfish within the nodule, but these portions are very perfect. Casts from the mould show
fine details, spines, joints and facets for the accompanying musculature, grooves for vessels,
in fact all the information which can be obtained from a well-preserved endoskeleton. The explanation which seems to fit the observations on the material is that the portions
preserved were within the mud of the sea-bottom at the time of death, and that chemical
interaction between the animal matter and the surrounding mud caused the enclosure of
the remains in a ‘flint’ casing. During this interaction the calcite of the skeleton was
gradually dissolved away.
