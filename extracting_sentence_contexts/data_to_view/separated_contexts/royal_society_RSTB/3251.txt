But when analysed into three sub-series and
three sub-curves in the manner just indicated, the numbers become ranged into three
consistent sub-series, and the irregular zigzag internode-curve becomes analysed into
three consistent and tolerably regular sub-curves (see Curve 26). Now, if the series or
internode-curves be analysed into two, four, or five sub-series or sub-curves, no such
consistence or regularity results. These facts indicate that, whatever be the interpreta-
tion of the construction of the awis, it is determined by three sets of component unitsâ€”
morphological or physiological in significance. This conclusion conforms with the view upheld by Sz. Hinarre, Roeper, Brawn,
Kuerzinc, Wicanb, and Ercuter, that the stem of Ampelopsis is a concatenation of
the basal parts of alternately unifoliar and bifoliar branches, which terminate in
tendrils.
