The superphosphate of lime alone yielded more gross produce, but only a little more,
than was obtained without manure, and the excess was the less in the later years. Indeed, not only the actual amount of produce, but the yield per acre of both nitrogen
and mineral matter declined more rapidly with the superphosphate alone than without
manure. In fact, the superphosphate of lime alone yielded, over the first 17 years of
its application, less than two-thirds as mnch produce as the mixed mineral manure, and
not three-fifths as much nitrogen. It is obvious, therefore, that the results which were

Sbtained on plot 7 were in only a very small degree due to the superphosphate which
She manure supplied. Let us see how the botany of the superphosphate plot bears out,
is conclusion.
