purified by alcohol; and, that it is not due to any influence of the charged state,
formerly described (1250.), first absorbing and then eyolving electricity, is indicated
by the instarntaneous assumption and discharge of those portions of the power which
are concerned in the phenomena, that effect occurring in these cases, as in all others
of ordinary induction by charged conductors. The latter argument is the more
striking in _the case where the air apparatus is employed to divide the charge with
the lac apparatus, for it obtains its portion of electricity in an insfant, and yet is
charged far above the mean.


SPECIFIC INDUCTIVE CAPACITY OF GLASS AND SULPHUR. 31

1270. Admitting for the present the general fact sought to be proved ; then I's,
though it expresses the capacity of the apparatus containing the hemisphere of shell-
lac, by no means expresses the relation of lac 10 air. The lac only occupies one half
of the space o, o, of the apparatus containing it, through which the induction is sus-
tained; the rest is filled with air, as in the other apparatus ; and if the effect of the two
upper halves of the globes be abstracted, then the comparison of the shell-lac powers
in the lower half of the one, with the power of the air in the lower half of the other,
will beas 2:1; and even this must be less than the truth, for the induction of the
upper part of the apparatus, i. e. of the wire and ball B (fig. 1.) to external objects,
must be the same in both, and considerably diminish the difference dependent upon,
and really producible þy, the influence of the shell-lac within.
