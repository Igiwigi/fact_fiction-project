Thus
these quantities are four to five times their probable errors, and we conclude that
fecundity is certainly inherited. The intensity is far below that suggested by the Jaw of ancestral heredity, but it
nevertheless exists. Its lowness is probably due to the fictitious character of the
fecundity owing to the causes indicated on pp. 298-9. An attempt must now be made
to eliminate some of the factors disguising the fecundity, but to do so is by no means
so easy as in the case of fertility in man.

(iii.) My first idea was that by taking a higher limit to the number of coverings a
closer approach might be obtained to the true, i.e, the inherited fecundity. Accordingly Table XIII. was formed for the correlation of 1000 mares and their
dams, when the minimum number of coverings was eight.
