<= Two comments may be made:
S (a) In cases where shearing stress, leading to breaking of the crystals, can initiate detona-
~j tion, the probability of occurrence will diminish with decreasing size of crystals. This is due
3 to the fact that a crystal will break through shear only if this exceeds the holding strength of
E any crystal flaws. With small crystals the chance of slipping over one another will be
increased, and a breakage of a single crystal will be less likely. a A sure sign that shear sensitiveness is important is that the addition of lubricants has
a beneficial effect, e.g. with cheddites (chlorate mixtures) and with cyclonite.
