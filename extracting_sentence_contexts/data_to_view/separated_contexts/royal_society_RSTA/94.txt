Lowest-order
calculation, as represented by figure 2a, gave results in good agreement with experiment. (The
photon is traditionally labelled y and represented by a wiggly line, a relic of the idea that light
is formed of waves. Conventionally, time goes upwards in these diagrams.) The trouble was
that all the higher-order corrections, represented by diagrams such as those of figure 2b,c, gave
infinite answers. The solution to this problem, the concept of renormalization, was discovered in 1947
independently by Schwinger [1] and Feynman [2], and in fact earlier, in 1943, by Sin-Itiro
Tomonaga, whose work in war-time Japan took some time to reach the West [3]. What these
authors found was that it was possible to group all the infinities into corrections to the mass
and charge of the electron. An electron is always surrounded by a cloud of ‘virtual’ photons
and electron—positron pairs, whose presence changes the measured mass and charge.
