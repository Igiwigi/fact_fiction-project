They melt at 59-60° C., and can be distilled without decomposition at 134°°8 C.
The substance has a neutral reaction and a pleasant smell recalling both acetic acid
and chloral,

To prepare the body an aqueous solution of hydroxylamine hydrochloride is mixed
with acetone. The reaction takes little time, the smell of acetone very soon
disappearing. This solution is then extracted with ether, and on evaporation the
prisms are deposited.

I have investigated the physiological actions of this substance by the same methods
as those employed for the previously described bodies, and have found these actions
to entirely correspond with those of the fatty aldoximes, more especially propyl-
aldoxime. In the presence of this fact it is interesting to observe that the molecular
weight of acetoxime is exactly equivalent to that of propylaldoxime. It will there-
fore be unnecessary to do more than merely point out the salient features.

General Action—The general action of acetoxime in frogs resolves itself into
depression of the spinal cord. Reflexes become abolished, and the limbs finally hang
limp whilst the heart is still beating.

Voluntary Muscle.—In the action of acetoxime on muscle elevation of the base
line and depression of irritability occur to approximately the same degree as in the
action of propylaldoxime. With solutions of equal strength, however, the loss of
irritability is a little more quickly produced by acetoxime, and the contracture is a
little less marked.
