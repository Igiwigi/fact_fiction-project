I 'The next experiment I tried was to make four short radial incisions in the margin as
E before described, and then to continue one of these incisions the whole way up the bell.
- By careful observation I could now perceive that all the marginal ganglia did not

discharge simultaneously; for when those situated nearest to the long radial cut
L happened to take the initiative, the resulting contractile wave, having double the

= (or, as in the experiment described at the beginning of this subsection (5), if this radial
= cut had only been of the same length as the other three radial cuts), could now be fol-
© lowed by the eye in its very rapid course round the bell, Now the fact that in this
