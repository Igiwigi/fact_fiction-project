Tn all but two of the thirty-two experiments the positions of the gaps available for the
new leaves were such that at some stage soon after the operation, though often not
immediately after it, three successive leaves arose forming one turn of a spiral round
the apex. In eleven of the experiments, the direction of this spiral was opposite to
that of the original genetic spiral. Once this condition had been reached, the spiral
continued in the same direction, and there was a gradual return towards the normal
phyllotaxis, each leaf arising in the gap between the next older but one and the next
older but two, as in a normal plant. The divergence angles between these later leaves
probably returned gradually towards the normal angle, as in the previous investigation
(1931, Tables IV and V), though in the present experiments they were measured only
in No, 29, section 18. But these facts do not show that the apex possesses any power
of regulating the phyllotaxis or the divergence angles so as to bring them back again
to the normal. For on the basis of van Irmrsonâ€™s theory, every phyllotaxis, with its
contact systems and its divergence angle, can be regarded as a condition of equilibrium
depending mainly on the ratio of the sizes of the leaf primordia to that of the apex on
which they arise. Consequently it is to be expected that when an arrangement some-
thing like the normal has been set up again after the operation, the phyllotaxis will
then continue to approach more and more closely to the normal.

This explanation is supported by the results of two experiments, Nos. 30 and 31,
section 18, in which the normal phyllotaxis was never restored, although 13 or 14 leaves
had arisen since the operation. For in these experiments, in both of which both Ia
and Ik arose, the positions of the gaps were such that apparently there never arose
