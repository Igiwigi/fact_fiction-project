But, if the vibrations of the bell were more frequent than those
of the surrounding bodies, the undulations it would occasion in
the elastic fluid, would tend to accelerate the vibrations of the
surrounding bodies : on the other hand, the undulations oc-
casioned by the slower vibrations of the surrounding bodies,
would retard the vibrations of the bell; and the bell, and the
surrounding bodies, would continue to affect each other, until, by
the vibrations of the latter being gradually increased, and those
of the former diminished, in consequence of their actions on
each other, they would all be reduced to the same 7one. Supposing now, that heat be nothing more than the motions
of the constituent particles of bodies among themselves, (an
hypothesis of ancient date, and which always appeared to me to
be very probable,) if for the bell we substitute a hot body, the
cooling of it will be attended by a series of actions and reactions,
exactly similar to those just described. The rapid undulations occasioned in the surrounding*ethereal
fluid, by the swift vibrations of the hot body, will act as calorific
rays on the neighbouring” colder solid bodies; and the slower
undulations, occasioned by;the vibrations of those colder bodies,
will act as frigorific rays on; the hot body ; and. these reciprocal
actions willicontinue, but with-decreasing intensity, till the hot
body, -and' those» colder bodies which surround it, shall, in

consequence of these actions, have acquired the same tempera=
ture, or until their vibrations have become isochronous,

According to this hypothesis, cold can with no more propriety
be considered as the absence of heat, than a low or grave sound
can be considered as the absence of a higher or more acute
note; and the admission of rays which generate cold, involves |
no absurdity, and creates no confusion of ideas,

On a superficial view of the subject, it may perhaps appear
difficult to reconcile solidity, hardness, and elasticity, with those
never-ceasing motions which we have supposed to exist among
the constituent particles of all bodies; but a patient investiga=-
tion of the matter will show, that the admission of that supposed
fact, instead of rendering it more difficult to form distinct and
satisfactory ideas of the causes on which those qualities of bodies
depend, will rather facilitate those abstruse researches. Judging from all the operations of nature, of the causes of

which we are able to form any distinct ideas, we are certainly |
led to conclude, that the force of dead matter, (and perhaps of
living matter also,) or its power of affecting, that is to say, of |
moving, other matter, or of resisling its impulse, depends on its
motion. If, therefore, solid (or fluid) bodies have any powers whatever,
either of impulse or of resistance, it appears to me to be more
reasonable to ascribe them to the living forces residing in them,
—to the never-ceasing motions of their constituent particles, —
than to suppose them to be derived from their want of power,
and their total indifference to motion and to rest.
