It is further supposed that
such substances can penetrate into non-infected cells of a plant and then set up a
protection against a second invading virus. Infection or immunity therefore becomes a matter of the ultimate equilibrium
between blocking elements and the “strength”’ of virus. The fact that such a theory

demands the existence of neutralizing substances in the sap, for which there is no
evidence, is acknowledged by Thung. This objection, as well as the localization of one
or other virus in definite areas in mixed infections militates against the possibility of
humoral immunity in plants. One cannot altogether evade the thought that in some cases discussed by Thung the
first two invading viruses have, so to speak, exhausted the clinical capacity for morbid
reaction of the plant, and that a further virus, which acting alone would call forth a
severe necrosis in its host, has now no stage on which to display its capacity for damage.
