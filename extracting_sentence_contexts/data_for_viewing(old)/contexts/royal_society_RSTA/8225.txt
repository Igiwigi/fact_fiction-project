in (6.04) and (6.10). This factor would be justified if (6.00) included the emission
stimulated by black-body radiation at temperature T. This is evidently not so. The
real use of (6.11) in Miune’s theory is to make the mean absorption coefficient finite,
since the “straight ” mean involves the integral

which is divergent without the extra factor. A difficulty of this sort is discussed by
Eppreron,t who seems to argue that Kramers’ theory includes the stimulated emission
since in the absence of incident radiation the electron could not maintain the assumed
orbit. The quantum theory, however, does not support this argument. In fact, it
