is equal to the strength of the sustaining parts, they do not
usually rupture their fleshy fibres, but break their tendons, or
even an intervening bone, as in the instances of ruptured tendo
Achillis, and fractured patella. Instances have however oc-
curred, wherein the fleshy bellies of muscles have been
lacerated by spasmodic. actions ; as in tetanus the recti abdo-
minis have been torn asunder, and the gastrocnemii in cramps ;
but in those examples it seems that either the antagonists pro-
duce the effect, or the over-excited parts tear the less excited
in the same muscle. From whence it may be inferred, that the
attraction of cohesion in the matter of muscle is considerably
greater during the act of contracting, than during the passive
state of tone, or irritable quiescence, a fact which has been
always assumed by anatomists from the determinate forces
which muscles exert.

The muscular parts of different classes of animals vary in
colour and texture, and not unfrequently those variations occur
in the same individual.

The muscles of fishes and vermes are often colourless,
those of the mammalia and birds being always red: the am-
phibia, the accipenser, and squalus genera, have frequently
both red and colourless muscles in the same animal.
