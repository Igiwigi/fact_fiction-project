With tropical birds living where there is little or no
variation in the length of day, seasonal breeding may still occur, as recorded by
BANNERMAN (1930, 1931, 1933) and others, and it is suggested that it is determined
by the recurrence of the rains and various ecological factors. â€˜These factors may also
act through the intermediation of the nervous system upon the anterior pituitary. The outstanding fact remains, however, that in nearly all animals breeding
phenomena occur in response to seasonal change, and in the vast majority of these
(but not in all), as shown by observations. under both natural and experimental
conditions, the principal stimulus is increase of light. Changes in temperature and
food are generally eliminated by control observations, though in some cases these
factors not merely condition the phenomena but play a part in determining the
sexual cycle.
