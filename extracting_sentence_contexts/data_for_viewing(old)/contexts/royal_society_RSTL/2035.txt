On the east, coast of England, for instance, the breadth of this wave reaches
from the Orkneys to the coast of Norfolk, which are the places where its two
ridges contemporaneously are,â€”the hollow of the wave being then on the coast
of Yorkshire, and perhaps twelve or fourteen feet lower than the ridges. And
in the Atlantic the wave is still wider, one ridge being in the Antarctic Ocean,
while the other is at Newfoundland.

It will be seen from what has been said, that we cannot trace very distinetly
the causes which produce 80 great differences in the velocity of the tide-wave
in different places. The difference of depth has probably a great share in pro-
ducing these differences; and accordingly we find that in narrow seas, which
are also generally the shallowest parts of the ocean, the velocity is much dimi-
nished, and the ride-waves consequently thronged: and this fact appears with
remarkable uniformity in every part of the map. Other causes of the differ-
ence of velocity are probably the obstacles to motion offered by the uneven
form of the bottom and shores: and as we are in a great measure ignorant of
the form of the bottom of the sea, we may easily conceive that the course of

| the cotidal lines may exhibit many inexplicable anomalies.

If we calculate the effective depth of different parts of the fluid on LacraNnGE's
principle, from the velocities above stated, we find that the effective depth of
the Thames from London to Richmond is 13 feet ; from the Nore to London,
90 feet : the effective depth of the sea on the east coast of England, 120 feet :
of Scotland, 360; of the Atlantic, west of Ireland, 2600 feet ; of the Atlantic
