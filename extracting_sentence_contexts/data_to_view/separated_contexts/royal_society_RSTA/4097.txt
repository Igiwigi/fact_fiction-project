Suppose, for example, we are dealing with three attributes (A, B, C and
their contraries), Twelve second order and eight third order groups can be formed
from these. It might appear then that if the frequencies of the second order groups
were given, there would be a sufticient number of equations to determine the
frequencies of the third order groups. As a matter of fact this is not so; the twelve
second order frequencies do not form independent data, and the question arises, How
many are independent ? or, in general, how many independent frequencies or groups
are there in the mth order groups produced from n variables? i.e., how many of these
