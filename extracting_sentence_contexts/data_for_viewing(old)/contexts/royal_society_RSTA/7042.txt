This condition is fulfilled, at least in the case of diamond and graphite, by a close
similarity of the N(Z) curves for all values of £, and not merely by the approximate
equality of the average electron-energies.

We propose finally to give an account of those characteristics of the bands which
are of most general interest. We begin with those of the metals, the curves of which
have been given in figure 12.

In § 3, we have already referred to the fact that the N,,,(Z) and N,(£) must be
considered as components of the N(£) curve, which show different peculiarities. The
I(E)/v3 curves give, for the L,-spectra, N,,,(£), and for the K-spectra, N,(£). From
the curves of figure 12, by adding the results of the K- and L,-spectra of a given metal,
it can be seen that an N(E) curve of the general form shown in figure 2 is obtained.
But, since our curves unfortunately do not give N,,,(Z) and N,(Z) in absolute units,
there is no simple way of determining the proportion in which the two sets of experi-
mental results should be added. The individual peculiarities of the K- and L,-spectra
have been mentioned in § 3, where we have seen that the ‘peak’ of the N(E) curve
occurs only in N,(£), whereas the discontinuous ‘kinks’ occur in N,,,(Z). A general
examination of figures 11 and 12 shows this plainly.

These peaks and kinks furnish direct evidence of the Brillouin zones, which are
