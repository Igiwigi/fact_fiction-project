belonging to the nose remained.

14. The defect of nervous influence in depriving the muscles of the velum
and pharynx of due tension (as in apoplexy,) produces stertor or snoring.
That this depends in a great measure on the relaxation of the velum, appears
from this, â€”that changing the position of the head, 80 that the velum shall not
hang against the back part of the pharynx, removes the distressing sound.

15. In extreme weakness, as from wounds and loss of blood even to insen-
sibility, groaning proceeds from the condition of the glottis ; as if the call for
sympathy and assistance were intended to be the last effort of life.

By these facts it appears; 1st, That the trachea gives out no sound of itself;
2nd, That when the passage of the trachea is much encroached upon, the co-
lumn of air is not sufficient to move the cords of the glottis ; 3rd, That what-
ever interferes directly with the motion of the glottis, reduces the voice to a
whisper ; 4th, That when the larynx is separated from the pharynx, delicate
sounds are not produced ; and therefore an influence of the pharynx upon
the stream of air is necessary to the production of such sounds ; 5th, That
any permanent opening or defect of the velum, which shall prevent the disten-
tion of the pharynx and the closing of the passage to the nose, renders articu-
