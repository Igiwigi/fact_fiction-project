in the field.

To this end, further multi-scale physics schemes, combining different families o
methods, such as molecular dynamics or DPD with LB or Navier-Stokes solvers,
need to be developed in order to attack a new class of problems, which woulc
otherwise be inaccessible to any of these methods alone. The potential of nove
multi-scale methods to tackle a qualitatively new class of problems, accounting for
relevant microscopic physics within the scales of interest to modern engineering
design (nanoresonators, carbon nanotubes, nanocomposites and so on) cannot be
overestimated. We believe that discrete simulation approaches will have a special!
role to play in this important context for many years to come.

The pervasive nature of fluid flows—the fact that they are key to virtually
all human activities, but also to life itself (air, water, blood)—is one of the
compelling aspects of the field, as well as one of its major strengths. Jus
as complex fluids research is characterized by common underlying problems,
so computational methods, algorithms and implementations must transcenc
disciplinary divides, hence the need of the new synthesis discussed earlier on
in this Preface.
