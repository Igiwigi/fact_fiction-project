MR. A. B. KEMPE ON THE THEORY OF MATHEMATICAL FORM. 29
as —_ or —_ It is, however, to be understood that the term © self-correspondence ”

will always be used, as heretofore, with reference to self-correspondences which involve
the correspondence of undistinguished collections only.

167. The two systems 8 and X of ec. 81 are of the same form. In the tabular
representation of either the unified columns will represent the units of the other.
Further, S and X are independent systems, no special relation except that of
similarity of form exists between them. Each aspect of S is arrived at by con-
8idering a correspondence of S and X ; it may in fact be regarded as such a corre-
8pondence, 80 that a unified aspect is a unified correspondence, and the whole system
of unified aspects of S represent a system of unified correspondences of two systems
of the same form, in which we are restricted to such correspondences as those referred
to in 8ec. 163.

168. When two systems are regarded as corresponding they may be spoken of as
being projections of each other in as many ways as there are unified correspondences.

169. If we represent the units of one of two independent systems of the same form
by the symbols (Xa), (Ab), (Ac), &c., we may represent, those of the other by the
8ymbols (pa), (pb), (pc), &c., where in one correspondence we may conveniently sup-
pose that (Xa) corresponds to (pa), (\b) to (pb), and so on ; but it is not to be sup-
