scale, and therefore approximately at right angles to the wing-surface when the
latter is normal to the line of vision, the plates must be near grazing incidence, and
vice versd. When, therefore, the wing is turned from the normal through an
increasing angle, the plates will change from grazing incidence to the normal, but
the colour will not change towards the violet or shorter wave-length, as has always
been aftirmed,} but towards the red, because the path of light within the plates is
becoming longer, If it can be shown that as a matter of fact the colours do change
