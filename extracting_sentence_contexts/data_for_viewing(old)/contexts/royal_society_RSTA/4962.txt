Since the linear terms are equal in magnitude to the nonlinear terms in critically balanced strong is
turbulence, the linear plasma physics continues to have an important impact on the dynamics in :3
magnetized plasma turbulence, unlike hydrodynamic turbulence. An important consequence of :g
this fact is that the turbulent fluctuations may exhibit some linear mode properties, properties :
which may be exploited to illuminate the nature of plasma turbulence [14,102]. The relevance
of linear physics to plasma turbulence is responsible for the numerical finding that the picture
of energy transfer to smaller scales presented in §2a, derived rigorously in the weakly nonlinear
limit [17], remains qualitatively correct, even in the limit of strong, critically balanced turbulence,
well beyond the formal regime of applicability of the solution [20]. =

It is worthwhile explaining physically why critical balance—equivalently described by a state :

in balance—naturally arises through the dynamics of a turbulent plasma. In these variables, nee)
