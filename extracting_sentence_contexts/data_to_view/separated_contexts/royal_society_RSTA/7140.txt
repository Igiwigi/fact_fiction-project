A new method employed by Thomas & Olmer (1942) furnishes the closely
confirmatory figure 14:92 at 10°C. Mercury vapour contains a small proportion of
diatomic molecules. Allowing for this fact, the heat of vaporization into free atoms at 25° C
is calculated at the National Bureau of Standards, Washington, to be 14-66 kcal./g.-atom.*

(e) Boron

Reliable vapour-pressure data for elementary boron are almost entirely lacking. This
element melts in the range 2000 to 2075° C (Ceuilleron 1944, 1945), and most published
estimates place the boiling-point in the range 2200 to 2550° C, From the spectroscopic
energy levels of the vapour and the heat capacity of crystalline boron, extrapolated to an
estimated sublimation temperature of 2700° K, the heat of sublimation into free atoms in
the ground state is calculated at the National Bureau of Standards to be 94 kcal./g.-atom
at 0° K,* which corresponds to 95 keal./g.-atom at 25°

(f) Aluminium

The review of Ditchburn & Gilmour (1941) provides the best representative equation
for the vapour pressure of liquid aluminium over the temperature range 1476 to 2237° K,
being based mainly on the work of Baur & Brunner (1934). From this it can be deduced
by means of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation that the heat of vaporization of aluminium is
78-92 kcal./g.-atom in the neighbourhood of 1779° K, the harmonic mean of the absolute
temperature limits to which the vapour-pressure equation refers.
