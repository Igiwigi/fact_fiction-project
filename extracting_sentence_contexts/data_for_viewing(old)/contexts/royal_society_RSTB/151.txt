this is shown by a comparison of Plate 22, fig. 1, and Plate 25, fig. 32, which represent
the various obliterated cords attached to the aorta. Each of these maintains the
relative position which in early foetal life it occupies, aud which a subsequent
shortening of the large trunk would have altered.

ComPaRATIVE ANATOMY OF THE CAROTID AND SUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES.

General Statement.

The examination of the comparative relations of the carotid and subclavian arteries
in the different groups of Vertebrates throws additional light on the manner in which
these vessels are developed in the Bird. The chief difficulty is to be met with in
connection with the nomenclature, and is to be accounted for by the fact that
accurate comparisons between the arteries of different groups have not been made,
observers having often named vessels from their position in one form without
reference to their relations in others. This is particularly the case with reference to
the carotid system.

The carotid system consists of the following parts:—(1) The third arch ; (2) its
dorsal prolongation towards the head ; (3) its ventral prolongation towards the head.
The last-named portion, the ventral prolongation towards the head, is, in the Amphibia,
an artery supplying the ventral aspect of the neck, extending as far as the tongue, to
which it distributes branches. It has been named variously “lingual artery” and
“external carotid artery,” but, if the name carotid be applied to it at all, it were
better called “ventral carotid.” Passing from the Amphibia to the higher forms,
