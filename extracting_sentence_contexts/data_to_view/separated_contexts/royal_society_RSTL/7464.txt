In a subsequent Memoir, published in 1839, © Sur les Deviations
Sde la Boussole produites par le fer des vaisseaux,” M. Poiss0N adapted his formulz to
*>observations made on shipboard in the particular case of the 8oft iron being symmetri-
Seally distributed on either side of the principal section of the ship. The memoir was
Saccompanied by a practical application and verification of the theory, showing the
Saccordance of the calculated results with the facts recorded in the Arctic voyages of
Z1818, 1819, and 1820, spoken of above. A careful examination of the disturbances of
x the needle in the © Erebus” and © Terror ' in their passage from England to the Cape of
