'= different pressures. All substances liquid at the ordinary temperature freeze at the
Blower temperatures required for these gases. But it is possible to employ liquid
ethylene, cooled either by external application of liquid air, or by causing it to boil
Sunder reduced pressure; both these means of obtaining a known low temperature
3 have been used, but only a small range of temperature is thus covered. The results,
*B Moreover, were not so trustworthy as those obtained when a liquid of known boiling-
point, boiling under atmospheric pressure, was used as a refrigerant.

3 The plan adopted, therefore, was to determine the pressure corresponding to certain
known temperatures, and then by means of the formula suggested by Ramsay and
Youne,* the accuracy of which has been demonstrated in a great number of instances,
to ascertain the vapour-pressures at intermediate temperatures. This method
depends on the fact that the ratios of the absolute temperatures of two liquids
corresponding toa series of pressures are a linear function for one of them corre-
sponding to the same pressures. It therefore becomes possible to calculate a whole
series of vapour-pressures of any substance, if the pressures are corresponding to two
or more temperatures accurately known ; the application is briefly as follows :—

The vapour-pressures of the substances are determined at absolute temperatures
