The second of the additional points of interest mentioned above is that, in photo-
graphs of the fine animal hairs. such as Merino wool, much of the centre is obscured by
another halo of high “ spacing.” Plate 2, fig. 3, shows this effect well ; in fact, in Merino
photographs, the (100) spots cannot be observed on this account. The effect is less
obvious in Cotswold wool and practically non-existent in human hair and porcupine
quill. It seems clear that this intense central halo arises from the scales of the hairs,
which are most prominent in Merino wool, less so in Cotswold, and least of all in human
hair and porcupine quill.
