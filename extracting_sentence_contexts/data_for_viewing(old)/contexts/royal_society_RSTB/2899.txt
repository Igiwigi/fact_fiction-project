tion. The remaining columns (one for each experiment) give the number of beats per minute of the isolated
frog-ventricle in successive minutes. The strengths of the different solutions of venom used are also shown.

We pass next to the consideration of the effects of Cobra venom in more dilute
solutions, and are now confronted with new difficulties. A heart which is perfused
for 2, 3, 4, or more hours shows definite changes in its tracing, even to
a superficial observer. When one comes to closely analyse such a record, and

to count the beats in successive minutes throughout, one finds that the rate of beat
varies more than one had suspected. There is in fact a gradual tendency for the
heart to beat faster at first and slower later on. At the same time its excursus
slowly and steadily diminishes, and the organ drifts towards a position of diastole.
Rarely one finds a heart pass very slowly towards the systolic position, but this is
almost certainly due to some change in the blood used. Such a sample of nutrient
fluid should, of course, be rejected, as it introduces fallacies into the research.
Bearing the above facts in mind, one had to make a large number of tracings, both
normal and otherwise, and to carefully exclude all those into which fallacies, due to
the changes above described, had apparently crept.

Some of these results are given in the subjoined table, and were selected from
tracings in which the heart was either very steady, or actually slowing, at the time
venom was introduced. (For tracings illustrating this section see Plate II.) Briefly,
