Figure 3. Inverter output with PWM-coded input. (Online version in colour.)

For the inverter-based PWM to voltage converter shown in figure 2, with the input clock duty
cycle at 50%, the average output voltage is around V4q/2 (figure 3). This is due to the fact that
during the interval of time when the input is low the output capacitance is charged with current
from the power source via the PMOS transistor, and during the interval of input being high the
capacitance is discharged via the NMOS transistor. With a 50% duty cycle these two periods of
time are the same length and, assuming the transistors are balanced, their voltages average out to
half the supply voltage. When the duty cycle deviates from 50% the average value of the output
voltage deviates from Vqq/2 proportionally in the same direction.
