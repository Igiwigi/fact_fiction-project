In the liquid crystal, the LE displayed three different regimes characterized by different decay
rates and specific interferences. In the polycrystalline ferrocene, however, the LE decayed in a
monotonic way. This absence of features and time scales could be assigned to the fact that our :
experiments involve an average over all possible microcrystalline orientations in the polycrystal. :=
In both samples, when assessing the relative importance of the different MQC orders, the LE
proved to be a useful tool in order to remove the decoherent behaviour. This not only facilitates
the comparison among the build-up rates of the different MQC orders observed in ferrocene but, nee)
more important, it highlights information that otherwise would be hidden in the background :
noise of long-time behaviour. a]

As a complement for our MQC experiments, the spin counting for both systems was DNS
performed. In the case of ferrocene, we introduced a two-cluster model that successfully allowed if
us to separate the growing correlations of the many-spin system into a small and a large areal
cluster of correlated spins.
