days, and the heat of the rectum was found to be 93*; the wound in the abdo-
men being 80 small that it would not admit the thermometer*.

« A comparative experiment was made with a puppy, the atmosphere at 50?;
the heat in the pelvis, as also at the diaphragm, was 102*.

* In summer, the atmosphere at 78*, the heat of the hedgehog, in an active
state in the cavity of the abdomen, towards the pelvis, was 95*; at the dia-
phragm, 97%.”

There is an error in the admirable work of M. Epwasvs, in relation to the
present subject, which it is important to point out. M. Epwarps first ascertained
the interesting fact, that the very young of those species of animals which are
born blind, lose their temperature if removed from the contact of their parent ;
and justly concludes that they have not sufficient power of evolving heat, to
maintain their natural temperature when 80 exposed. M. Epwarps then sub-
jected hybernating animals to the action of cold, and observing that their tem-
perature also fell, he concludes that they, like the very young animal, have not
the faculty of maintaining their temperature under ordinary circumstances *.

It is remarkable that this acute physiologist did not perceive the error in this
reasoning. In no instance does the young animal maintain its warmth, when
exposed alone to the influence of an atmosphere of moderate temperature.
Can this be said of the hybernating animal ? Certainly not. In ordinary tem-
peratures, the hybernating animal maintains its activity, and with its activity,
