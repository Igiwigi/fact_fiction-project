Here also
it is increased by the contribution from the secular change, but 8 average quiet days
suffice to produce an increment in the force equal to the full secular change for the
year. The non-cyclic effect in H is on the whole wonderfully uniform throughout
the year, but it appears somewhat reduced at midsummer. Relative to the range
of the diurnal inequality, it is most important in winter; in January, in fact, it
averaged over 20 per cent. of the observed range. In V, see Table VIIL, the non-cyclie effect is considerably less conspicuous than
in H or I, but more conspicuous than in D, There is a decided preponderance
of months in which it has the negative sign, and the mean annual value is positive
in only 2 out of the 11 years. According to Table X., the magnitude of the non-

cyclic eftect in V is considerably dependent on the season of the year, being greater
in summer than in winter.
