adjoining sample units were obtained and two separate estimates of the area sown with jute.
The degree of agreement between these two estimates supplied a good idea of the precision
of the survey.

37. There were many difficulties on the organizational side. There was not a single
trained worker to start with. Apart from considerations of economy, one important reason
why it was essential to adopt the gradually increasing scale of work was the need of building
up the necessary human agency for carrying out surveys on a country-wide scale. On the
statistical side also it was necessary to organize the computational work, standardize routine
methods of preparing the sample units, and arrange for continuous and systematic tabulation
of the field data and their final analysis.

38. In fact, apart from the study of the cost and variance functions, one of the great
advantages of the exploratory method was the opportunity it gave for developing suitable
methods of controlling mistakes arising from the human factor, for giving training to the
workers and to build up the necessary human agency for both field and statistical work.
Once this was done, and the cost and variance functions were determined, the final stage
was reached when the planning of the sample survey could be undertaken on scientific lines.
In one sense there is, of course, no final stage. Conditions are changing from year to year;
and it would be obviously desirable to continue auxiliary work of an exploratory type (along
with the main survey) with the help of which the efficiency of the survey can be continuously
improved.
