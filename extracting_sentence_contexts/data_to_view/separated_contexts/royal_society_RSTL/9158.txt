The Photographic Process. The original method of photographing employed by Dr. MiLER we have found to be Â©
defective : first, because the more refrangible end of the ultra-violet spectram is
extremely weak, if not entirely wanting, when photographed on plates containing
a plain iodised collodion ; secondly, a web collodion process is disadvantageous when z
long exposure is sometimes necessary ; and thirdly, when working in a small room the
0zone generated by bhe electric discharge acts upon web collodion plates in snch a
manner that they become coated with a thick deposit of silver directly the developing
s0Jution is applied, the deposit being densesb where the bath solution has most
accumulated, Much larger and better spectra are obtained by using ordinary bromo-
iodised collodion and an iron developer, but of course this process' is rendered useless
by the action of the ozone on the silver svlution. The extraordinary improvements made of late years in the preparation and develop-
ment of dry plates, together with the foregoing facts, combined to recommend a dry
process. Successive trials have been made with plates coated with washed collodio-bromide
emulsion, with the Berony standard dry plates, uranium plates, Mr. KexNertT's and
WrarTex and WAinwRIGHT's gelatine pellicle plates. The gelatine plates are to be
preferred for two reasons ; if they are wanted for the production of negatives to
print from, the film is exceedingly fine and even in texture, and on the other hand,
if transparencies showing absorption bands are desired they need nob be varnished.
