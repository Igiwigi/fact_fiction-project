working memory may be capacity-unlimited.

4, Reformulating overflow?

Block [10] explicitly formulates his overflow claim in terms
of the relative capacities of perceptual consciousness and
cognitive access. Capacity-unlimited conceptions of working
memory directly challenge this claim. A natural reply is to
reformulate overflow in other terms, so that it does not
depend on a capacity-limited conception of working memory
[54-57]. The previous section contains an obvious suggestion:
because capacity need not be exhausted, reformulate overflow
in terms of the comparative number of items in fact encoded on
some occasion. The challenge then is to find evidence that, on
some occasions, not all items represented in perceptual con-
sciousness are encoded in working memory. Note that Gross
& Flombaumâ€™s [38] alternative explanations of post-cue effects
do not invoke a decrease in number of items actually encoded
across stores.* But even if there were a decrease across stores, it
would not follow that perceptual consciousness should be
identified with the earlier store. In particular, once the upper
bound on capacity is removed, the later store may still represent
a sufficiently large number of items, even if on that occasion
fewer than the earlier store, to support rich perceptual con-
sciousness. An appeal to other considerations would then be
