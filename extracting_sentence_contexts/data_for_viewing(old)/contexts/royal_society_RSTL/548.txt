Stance, we assume @ [2 ] to be equal to a W , we should find

the equation of the curve to be
y=(a+z2)c
c being the constant introduced by integration, and on sub-
$tituting this value of y in (a) we shall find c= o, 0 that
y=(a+a)o
Let us suppose a to be infinite and equal to, then we have
= (=+ 2) c=b += b, since c=0
which is the equation of a straight line parallel to the axis
of the »x's, which in fact agrees with the conditions of the

Problem. If we suppose 9 (2) = 4*= a constant quantity,
we should find

a= vVP=a
this value being substituted in (a) gives for determining c the
equation

(+1) =0
whence c=0 and c=+4/—1, using this latter value we have

a= =1 x VFIP=VD
