Mosb of them have only a
secondary interest. One other fact, however, is worthy of notice. Tt is nob only ab
the orifice that jets are easily affected, In fact it is easy, especially by mechanical
means, to produce disturbances at a distance from the orifice. But the intensity of
the effect on the jet diminishes as the distance of the point of application of the dis-
turbance from the oritice increases,

At a very early stage in this investigation the question naturally presented itself :
Would jets of water and other liquids exhibit the same properties as gaseous jets ?
Referring to the historical notice at the beginning of this paper, it will be seen that
much more had been done in the way of reliable experiment with liquid than with
gaseous jets ; probably because the phenomena of 8uch jets appeal to two senses, sight
and hearing, and are therefore more easily studied. A few simple experiments sufficed
to 8how that all the results obtained with gaseous jets may also be obtained with liquid
jets, and in a more marked and satisfactory way.
