This theme appears repeatedly in other papers in this collection
and Silvertown and Dodd show, with some worked examples, how phylogenetic information can
be used to correct comparisons for phylogenetic independence. They show that secondary
chemistry and life form (woody vs. herbaceous), two traits which are conserved in angiosperm
phylogeny, are significantly correlated due to convergent evolution, providing important support
for theories of anti-herbivore defence. Lest ecologists rely too much on specific evolutionary trees
Donoghue and Ackerly caution that ‘It is highly likely in fact that, virtually every phylogenetic tree
found in the literature is wrong in one way or another.’ and they describe the use of sensitivity
analyses to explore the robustness of phylogenetic conclusions. A major part of the eco-evolutionary game has been explored by demonstrating what it is about
particular species that enables them to live where they do and what it is about them that makes
them seem the best (or the best compromises) in the best of all possible worlds. Extraordinarily
little effort has been put into ecological and evolutionary explanations of why almost all species
are always absent from almost everywhere!
