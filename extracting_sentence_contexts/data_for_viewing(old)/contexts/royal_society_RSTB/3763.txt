be looked on with suspicion.

Turning next to the imago in captivity, a few notes must be given on the cages
which were found suitable. For the first 25 broods, medium-sized cages, 4 feet long
by 3 feet 6 inches wide by 6 feet 6 inches high, of fine brass gauze were used. The
male and female which were desired to pair were released in one of these cages, and
were left permanently together unless a pairing was actually observed—a somewhat
rare event. This proving unsatisfactory, a much larger cage, 16 feet long by
8 feet wide by 6 feet 6 inches high, was built, and the old cages were utilised for
females which had been observed to pair and from which eggs were required. In the
small cages the butterflies had evidently realised their captivity, but the large cage
seemed almost to reproduce natural conditions—a statement which perhaps requires
some justification. This may be found in the fact that an error was made in the
mesh of the wire netting, and on the first occasion on which the cage was used
the butterflies crawled through the netting and escaped ; these individuals, however,
had not been fed since their emergence—some 24 hours earlier—and it was found
subsequently that, provided the insects were well fed, they made no determined
efforts to escape. This appears to be distinct evidence that conditions in the large
cage were sufficiently natural to cause the butterflies no positive discomfort.

Feeding was of paramount importance, for unless nourishment could be obtained
whenever it was wanted no pairings occurred, and the females refused to oviposit ;

fortunately it presented no great difficulty ; dilute syrup was placed on flowers, and
the insects usually responded to the stimulus of bright colours and fed without
