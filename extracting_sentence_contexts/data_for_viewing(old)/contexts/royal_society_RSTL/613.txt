From the results of these experiments (which were made
with the greatest possible care) it appears, that the radiations of
cold bodies act on warmer bodies, at a distance, and gradually
diminish their temperatures.

It will likewise be evident, when we consider the matter with
attention, that the cooling of the vessel which was suspended
over the ice-cold platter, was/in fact 'considerably more acce-
lerated by the frigorific radiations from that cold surface than
it appears to have been, when we estimate the' effects produced
