is 6-4 per cent., the
agreement between the two percentage gains is not only as close as can be expected,
but the small difference between their mean and the gain for five-times turning
(Table IIT.) may well be due to pure accident. On the whole, Tables IIT. and VI. may be said to establish the fact that when the amount
of egg turning is raised from twice to five-times in 24 hours there is a real improvement in
the hatching of the order of 10 per cent., and that for a further rise from five- to eight-
times the corresponding change in the hatching—if any—is negligibly small. One of the “ Factors in Incubation” studied by Prof. Kirkpatrick (loc. cit.) was
the effect of turning. Using about seven times as many eggs as the writer, his average
hatch percentages were 61-1 and 55 -4 for five-times and twice-turned eggs respectively,
making his gain in favour of the five times turned 5-7 per cent.
