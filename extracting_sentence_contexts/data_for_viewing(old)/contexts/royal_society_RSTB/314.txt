are intermingled, whilst the’ thin-walled innermost ones, ¢’, present an obvious
procambial aspect.

In fig. 14 we find the medullary vascular cylinder dividing in the regularly
dichotomous manner seen among the larger forms of Lepidodendra. In fig. 15, on
Plate 5, we have a section of my only example of this species in which the medullary
vascular cylinder, @, b, is invested by a secondary, exogenously-developed zone, d.

The plant just described again illustrates the gradual development of a medulla
within the interior of a vascular bundle where, in the youngest state of the bundle,
no traces of cellular structure could be discovered, but the germs of which must
necessarily have been furnished by the procambium from which, in the youngest
twigs, the entire bundle originated. The probable philosophy of these facts may be
considered after describing some additional undescribed types.

Figs. 16, 17, and 18 represent sections of a Lepidodendron from Halifax, for which
T propose the name of ZL. intermedium, and which is remarkably distinct from any
other form with which I am acquainted. Its vasculo-medullary axis, a, b, differs
from all other known Lepidodendra, with one exception. The true medulla, a,
consists of well-defined parenchymatous cells. The medullary vascular cylinder, b, is
composed of numerous large barred tracheids. The external boundary of this cylinder
is sharply and regularly defined, but its inner border is very irregular, some of its
largest vessels being detached from it, and isolated amongst even the most central
cells of the medulla.* In addition to this characteristic feature, we have an exogenous
zone, d, which is equally characteristic. The entire thickness of this zone, from its
