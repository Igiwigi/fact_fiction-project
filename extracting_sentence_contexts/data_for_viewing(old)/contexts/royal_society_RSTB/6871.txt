as evidence, it is still difficult to resist the conclusion that the testimony of these
photographs is trustworthy. All obvious objections have been examined carefully and
will be considered in the discussion, but no facts have so far been found which could
be interpreted as incompatible with the above results. Whilst recognizing that further
confirmation is desirable the measurements will therefore be provisionally accepted.

But this result, if true, leads to some very important conclusions. It has already
been shown that a somatic chromosome at its fullest extension is equivalent in length
to a chromosome at pachytene. It would now appear that as a preliminary to pairing
the meiotic chromosome, during preleptotene, not only stretches out the 14 coils
retained from the previous division but also experiences a genuine increase in length
of the order of 50%. It therefore follows, of necessity, that the act of chromosome
pairing itself, the central fact of meiosis, must be carried out when the chromosomes
are in quite an exceptional state. The length attained as a preliminary to pairing has
no counterpart at any point in the mitotic cycle, and this statement may well express
a very fundamental, if not the most fundamental, difference between the prophases
of mitosis and meiosis.

In this connexion it is perhaps appropriate to notice two sentences written by
Grégoire in 1907 (p. 391): “La différence entre la prophase somatique et celle-ci,
c’est que, dans la premiére, les filaments 4 peine formés, subissent tout de suite une
condensation rapide qui les transforme en rubans chromosomiques, tandis que, dans
