16. Given a curve m, then (as in fact mentioned in the investigation for ND(m))
through any point whatever of the curve there can be drawn

(—m+2=)mP+m—2+M
lines meeting the curve in two other points, or say [mP+1M—2+I lines through three
points. But in general no one of these lines meets the curye in a fourth point ; that
is, we cannot through every point of the curve m draw a line through four points ; there
are, however, on the curye m2 a certain number ( =4G(m)) of points through which can
be drawn a line through four points, or line G(m*).

17. But the curve 1m may be such that through every point of the curve there passes
a line through four points. In fact, assxume any skew surface or scroll whateyer, and
upon this surface a curve meeting each generating line in four points (e. g. the intersec-
tion of the scroll by a quartic surface). Taking the curve in question for the curye m,
then it is clear that through every point of this curye there passes a line (the generating
line of the assumed scroll) which is a line through four points, or line G(m*).

18. It is to be noticed, moreover, that if we take on the curve m any point whatever,
then of the [mP+m—2+M lines through three points which can be drawn through
this point, three will unite together in the generating line of the assumed scroll (for if
0 be the point on the curye mz, and 1, 2, 3 the other points in which the generating line
