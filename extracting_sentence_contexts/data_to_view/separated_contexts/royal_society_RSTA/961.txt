We conclude that a front that is too asymmetric may only be observed
to be propagating in one direction (i.e. one specific sign of c). The delayed feedback then speeds
up the front in that same direction. Second, the fact that the speed approaches constant values as
tT â€” oo implies that we may replace u(z + ct) in equation (3.12) by its asymptotic limit for z large,
ie. u=1. The reduced problem then becomes an ordinary differential equation which is easier to
solve. Using (3.12) with u(z + cr) = 1 we found analytically the correct speed limits.
