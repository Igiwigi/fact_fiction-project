Tue investigations described in the present paper deal principally with the
phenomena of annealing, They form a continuation of the research described in the
Bakerian Lecture for 1899 (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ A, vol. 193, 1900, pp. 353-377). In iron,
steel, and brass these phenomena have been studied with the aid of the microscope
by various workers, among whom Arnotp, Cuarpy, Sreap, and Roserrs-AUSTEN
should be particularly mentioned. As a result of their labours it is well known that
annealing is accompanied by a re-arrangement of the crystalline grains of the metal.

Thus, when a piece of iron is strained in tension its crystalline grains become
elongated in the direction of tension ; but when the specimen has been subsequently
annealed by being heated to a bright red, all signs of such elongation disappear from
the crystalline pattern revealed by the microscope. In fact it is not generally
possible to find any definite connection between the crystalline pattern seen in the
same specimen before and after annealing. In general, the pattern seen after
annealing resembles that found in a similar specimen before it has been strained,
but the scale and character of the pattern produced depend very much on the
details of the annealing process, particularly upon the temperature applied, the time
of its application, and the rate of cooling. ARNotp and Sreap have shown that
prolonged annealing tends to produce large crystals in iron and steel. But even
short exposure to a suitable temperature is well known to produce complete re-
crystallisation, and it has been suggested that these changes occur at critical points
corresponding to the “arrest-points” in the cooling of the metal. These arrest-
points indicate evolutions of heat, and it is natural to suppose that they are evi-
dences of re-arrangement of the structure of the metal.
