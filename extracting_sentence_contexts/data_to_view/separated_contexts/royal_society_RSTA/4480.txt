Correlated among themselves. Both these conclusions are of the utmost importance. The first enables us to
obtain the probable errors of the frequency constants; the second depends upon the
fact that C,,, G,,, and F,, are in general not zero. The standard deviations of, and
the correlations between, the frequency constant errors can now be calculated by the
ordinary theory of normal correlation. Before, however, proceeding to these calculations, we may draw one or two other
conclusions of considerable generality and wide significance.
