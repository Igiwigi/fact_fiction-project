memory of illness-inducing substrates has been described as
an example of imprinting (i.e. the rapid learning that occurs
during a critical period early in life, and establishes a long-
lasting behavioural response to a specific stimulus) in C. elegans
[59], and may apply to other organisms as well. Thus, the lack
of pathogen avoidance behaviours observed in immature
bonobos could in fact be adaptive in the sense that it helps
them develop the adaptive arm of their immune system. Yet,
this kind of exploratory behaviour can also lead to intestinal
diseases if soil-contaminated objects [60] or faecal particles
[61] are put into the mouth, as well as intoxication if poisons
are ingested. As such, one would expect that both innate and
