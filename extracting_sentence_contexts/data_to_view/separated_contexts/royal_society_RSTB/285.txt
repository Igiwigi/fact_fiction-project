III. With regard to ligaments, we find that with the exception of capsular ligament
at the masticatory joint, the only constant one is the lig. hyomandib. mandibulam
internum, s. lig. sustentaculi. This is phylogenetically very early developed; it i
in fact, found in all the cartilaginous Fishes above the Notidanide. This ligamen
moreover, frequently contains fibrous and even hyaline cartilage, e.g., in G
Trygon, Torpedo. ;

There exists not unfrequently a ligamentous connexion between the labyrinthie
region of the cranium and the proximal end of the hyoid element, e.g., in Oxyrhina,
Centrophorus, Sphyrna, Trygon, Raja; and these ligaments are certainly not the
remnants of cranio-hyoidean muscles, although they sometimes (Oxyrhina) do serve
as additional supporters of muscular fibres. :

Ceratodus.â€”The massive first visceral arch is divided into three parts, the upper
bar being differentiated into a palatine and a quadrate element. The latter is fused
with the cranium by its proximal broad end, and therefore resembles the conditions
met with in other holostylic skulls, as, e.g., in Cestracion and Chimera.
