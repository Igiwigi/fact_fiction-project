Next suppose that 0, and 6, are also subject to pendulum errors, as of course they
will usually be. The actual values of 2 will now be unpredictable; but since the
chances of the error in either 0, or 0, being positive are equal to those for its being
negative there is still the probability that they will be complementary ; a conclusion
which also holds if the error in 6, happens to be negative. It is, of course, necessary for this that these secondary oscillations should persist
beyond 06;, and we found in fact that they did so; their damping coefficients being in
general far smaller than that for the oscillations of the R effect. If, therefore, the numbers in Table VII. are to be taken as indicating the effects
of pendulum disturbances, we should expect these numbers also to exhibit the
complementary character ; and this in fact they do. We found that the departure of these numbers from unity increased rapidly when the
