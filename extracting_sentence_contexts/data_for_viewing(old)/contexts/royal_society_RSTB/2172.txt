Abundance of leucocytes can be seen in these sections of the gastric gland of
Ostrea, and it is doubtless partly through their agency that the coloured fatty and
other matters are carried from the gut to be deposited in the pigment-containing
cells of the connective tissue, and in the granular cells of the gland itself.

There is a very striking contrast in the appearance of the pigment found in the
gastric gland of Mytilus edulis to that of Ostrea; thus in the former we find it not
enclosed in definite cells, but it looks as if deposited at random, as it were, and
scattered in the connective tissue, between the acini of the gland. It can also be

* Polygonal from mutual pressure. I believe, to coin a new word, this is an ameehoeytogenous tissue
—a “lymphatic tissue,” in fact.

referred to later on). And the impression one forms, after examining sections of the
gastric gland of Mytilus, is that the pigment has been introduced directly by absorp-
