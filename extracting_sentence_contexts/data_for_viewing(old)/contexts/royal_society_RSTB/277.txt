(3.) The water-pore is on the right side, posterior to the right body-cavity. It is
usually on the left of the middle dorsal line, anterior to the left body-cavity.

8s (4.) In the later stages the right body-cavity surrounds the cesophagus; in all
‘s other Echinoderms it is the left body-cavity which does this.

= (5.) Looking at the animal from the side on which the right body-cavity lies, the
= alimentary canal winds round in the same direction as the hands of a watch ; whereas,
3B as Lupwia has shown, the same direction for the winding of the alimentary canal is
3 obtained in other Echinoderms, even in the bilaterally symmetrical larvae, by looking
; 6 at them from the left side.

2 These facts afford, I think, an almost overwhelming proof that the old orientation
oh is wrong; but, as a final argument in favour of Barrots’s theory, I will show what a
iG close comparison it enables us to make between the larva of Antedon and that of
3 Asterina gibbosa, as described by Lupwia (16). In doing this, however, I am

compelled to differ somewhat from Lupwia’s nomenclature of the parts of the larva,
which he gives on p. 143, since I regard the mouth as ventral, and the whole of the
larval organ as anterior, representing the przoral lobe.

With regard to the external form not much can be said: but in both types the
larval mouth lies in the middle of the ventral surface, and in both there is a large
preoral lobe; and it is perhaps not extravagant to compare the large sucker of the
preoral lobe in Asterina with the “praoral pit” by which the larval Antedon fixes
