In the gun, therefore, the temperature of the
cordite has an influence on ballistics, since at a higher temperature, the pressure
being raised more quickly, the projectile has less time in which to move forward;
consequently there is a smaller space behind the projectile at times of equal
developments of gas, and higher pressures are therefore realised. Temperature,
therefore, is of no importance in determining the pressure-density relation, but is all-
important in the investigation of time rises. I am not clear that other investigators
have borne this in mind—their publications take no note of the fact. Mr The pressure-density relation of M.D. cordite is shown graphically on fig.
