The anterior rounded ends
of the crura cerebri, present a mass of healthy medullary sub-
stance. The outer surface of the cerebellum is divided into
the parallel layers or folds, and those vermiform processes,
which distinguish its general character. The narration of these appearances assists and confirms
other facts, in demonstrating, that the formation and growth
of animals in the uterus, are independent of any influence
from those parts of their brain which properly belong to sensa-
tion. We have to regret, that this animal did not live to
shew the phenomena of volitions directed to its limbs, and other
apparatus, without that intelligence from the organs of the
senses which regulates and directs the efforts of perfect animals,
The careful observance of such circumstances may, in future,
bring us to discoveries of the highest value, in that part of phy-
Sology which is now enveloped in deep mystery : the factsat

with their mental particularities; the anatomical history of
maniacs, all promise, when properly cultivated, a series of
truths, which it may not be extravagant to hope, will open
sublime views into those recesses. of our construction which
