In many cases the pro-embryo continues its course down the canal
formed by the embryo-sac-tube, which formerly brought the female nucleus which
has given rise to it. On the other hand, it frequently bores a new path through the
hitherto uninjured nucellar tissue: Gravity can have little if any influence upon its
direction of growth. Apart from the fact that the female cones, and with them the
ovules, are usually inclined at a considerable angle to the vertical, there are
circumstances in which the pro-embryo will grow directly upwards towards the
micropyle.{ This has been observed only in a few cases, in all of which fertilisation
has occurred above the line B (text-figure). It would seem therefore that the
direction of growth is determined mainly by conditions of nutrition and, further, the
downward course will usually be that of least resistance. It may be that oospores
situated near the micropyle are within the range of influence of the sugar left by the
drying up of the micropylar fluid.
