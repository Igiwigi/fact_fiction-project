The range to the right of what is shown in figure 5
is problematic for another reason. For high-enough energy it is suggested by numerical analysis
that the full system undergoes delocalization for lower coupling values than predicted by the
averaging-based approach. The reason for this may be attributed to the fact that for high energies
the system is highly nonlinear and higher resonances than the 1:1 resonance assumed to occur
may come into play. Moreover, there may be resonance overlap. Clearly, if this happens for higher
coupling than predicted by averaging, it is irrelevant to the onset of delocalization.
