Both series
may be considered as * valley-gravels;” but for the sake of distinction I purpose calling
that which occupies the bottom of the valleys, and reaches to a comparatively small
height above the river-leyel, the © low-level valley-gravels,” whilst to that found on the
adjacent hills, I would apply the term * high-level valley-gravels.” The height of the
latter above the valley is variable; and though generally limited to one main platform,
it is not always on the same level, and there are cases of minor intermediate terraces
between the extreme levels. The heights are of course relative one to the other, and
not directly to the sea-level. Valley of the Waveney.—The levels recorded in my former paper establish the fact
that the flint-implement-bearing deposit of Hoxne is at a height of 40 feet above the
Gold Stream, and 50 feet above the Waveney, of which the Gold Stream is a tributary. Mr. Evaxs and I found a very similar deposit, also overlying the Boulder Clay, at Athe-
lington, a few miles higher up the valley of the former stream.
