S The yelk-sac took the dye freely ; considering its thinness and translucency perhaps
V much 80 as the formative yelk ; the dye was deepest in the thickest sacs. , When an
Sg was crushed by strong pressure, 80 as to reduce the layer of relle-rnbatanos to the

Zme thickness as the yelk-sac, the colour was seen to be quite as deep in the buttons

this latter as in the formative yelk, but of a s0mewhat, more yellowish red. The dyeing is independent of any acid reaction of the substance dyed, as macerated
yelk-sacs, which had become alkaline from decomposition, took the dye freely. This
independence of the acid reaction is also further seen by the fact that the acid food-yelk
does not take the colour at all. The fine structure of the yelk-sac is rendered less distinct by this method, partly in
consequence of the action of the glycerine, partly from the action of the acetic acid. Ammonia does not impair the distinctness of this structure, although it makes the sag
very clear.
