Overall, probing and extending the limits of generalizabil-
ity of experimental results will require researchers to observe
evolution over long (approx. 10* generations [177]) and ultra-
long (approx. 10° generations [105]) timescales that are still
accessible in some experimental systems (see §6) and in
more diverse experimental and semi-natural communities
with non-model species. For example, it is now possible to
study microbiome evolution in the mouse gut [178] or

how such communities evolve compared to their microbial
