Consequently the ray theory fails to describe the propagation of the extraordinary
wave in this stratum and the wave-function fails to be of the form (9). This is simply
because reflexion of the extraordinary wave is actually taking place in this stratum
where the value of g for the upgoing extraordinary wave is approximately equal to the
value of ¢ for the downcoming extraordinary wave. Similarly, in the neighbourhood
of the height where the electron density has the critical value NV, corresponding to the
point B in fig. 7, there is a stratum within which the ray theory ceases to describe the
propagation of the ordinary wave owing to the fact that the wave is in process of being
reflected. To describe what is actually happening within a reflecting stratum it is
necessary to obtain a more exact solution of the electromagnetic equations than that
upon which the ray theory is based. This has been done (Gans 1915; Hartree 19316)
under certain simplifying restrictions, and, so long as damping may be neglected, it
appears that, although the ray theory fails to describe even approximately what is
actually happening within a reflecting stratum, nevertheless it does give practically
the right expression for the reflected wave.
