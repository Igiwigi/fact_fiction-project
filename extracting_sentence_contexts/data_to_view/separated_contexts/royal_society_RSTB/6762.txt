If, however, it is assumed that “‘diplotan” is, as it appears to be, the
equivalent of the plant pachytene, the general impression gained from Gelei’s figures
is not unlike that of Osmunda. Even were the evidence from Osmunda above reproach it would, however, still be
unsafe to attribute general significance to the conclusions as long as they refer to only
one organism. For this reason it has seemed profitable to publish the facts as they
stand in the hope that confirmation (or the reverse) may be obtainable by other
workers on other material. Should this be forthcoming it will perhaps be possible to
reply to the next question which has to be raised, namely, when exactly does the
prophase elongation cease? Is it really completed before pairing begins or is the
chromosome still lengthening during zygotene?
