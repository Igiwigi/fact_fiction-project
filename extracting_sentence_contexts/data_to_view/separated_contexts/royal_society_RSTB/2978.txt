Moreover, unlike
these latter it, except in the case of green Hippolyte, plays no protective r√©le ;
blueness on dark nights at sea confers no advantages. It must be regarded either as
a prdision for a possible green episode in the colour-history of the animal or as being
of no protective value. The former hypothesis meets with no confirmation from such
facts as we possess. Many [Hippolyte, as we know, have no period of greenness. It is
with the greatest difficulty that a brown Hippolyte can be induced, even after weeks of
enforced sojourning on Zostera, to make any show of greenness.
