Of these experiments three series, those with 300, 400, and 500 proportional parts of
sulphuric acid, give numbers which conform approximately to the relation y=ae-*, but
the more rapid action which occurs with $800 and with 1000 parts of acid cannot be
expressed by an equation of this form. 'The excess of the other reagents over that which
suffers reduction is as great, and that of the sulphuric acid greater, in these than in the
first experiments. Some other cause than a change in the medium in which the gradual
action takes place must therefore produce this departure from the theoretical result.
Comparing the former set of determinations with these, it appears also that the diver-
gence in both is of the 8ame kind, and therefore presumably due to the same cause.
In both the ratio of the descending series gradually diminishes. The true reason is
probably to be found in the fact that more than one gradual change takes place under
the circumstances of our experiments, and that we have only been able to measure the
total result. Our attempts to Separate these actions and investigate them singly have

been unsuccessful, and we have been compelled in consequence to leave the examina-
tion of this reaction, and seek for a simpler case of chemical change. We may, how-
ever, in concluding this part of our work, show, first, from independent experiments,
that we have probably been dealing with more than one reaction; and secondly, that
numbers agreeing with those of all the experimental series may be calculated from
equations expressing the hypothesis that three simultaneous changes take place.
