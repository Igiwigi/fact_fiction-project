The authors observed that laminarin was used as a major
source of energy, and as a signal molecule, which induced transporters and digestive enzymes
to also use other compounds released from the lysis of diatom cells. These studies confirm the
link between Flavobacteria and microalgal blooms with their capacity to degrade and use algal
DOM. It is consistent with the fact that all the bacterial strains belonging to Flavobacteria tested
in our biodegradation assay were able to grow on the pelagic microalgae C. neogracilis exudate. However, depending on their genetic material, bacterial strains differ in their ability to degrade
DOM according to its composition. It implies the occurrence of different ecological niches in
which bacterial strains use the energy source to which they are the most adapted.
