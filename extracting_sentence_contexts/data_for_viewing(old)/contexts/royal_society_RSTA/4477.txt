It must be noted that absence of contextuality in behavioural and social systems does not mean
that quantum formalisms are not applicable to them. A good argument for why this conclusion
would be groundless is provided by the question order effect discussed in §3: it is precisely the


applicability of a quantum-mechanical model in the question order effect analysis [26,28] that
allows one to predict the lack of contextuality in this paradigm.

When discussing contextuality, one should be aware of the likelihood of purely terminological
confusions. It is clear that in the behavioural and social systems, a context generally influences
the measurement of an object within it. For instance, the distribution of answers to a question
depends on a question asked and answered before it. One could call this contextuality, and many
do. This is, however, a trivial sense of contextuality, on a par with the fact that the distribution
of answers to a question depends on what this question is. One should not be surprised that
other factors (such as temperature in the laboratory or questions asked and answered previously)
can influence this distribution too. We call this inconsistent connectedness, and we offer a theory
that distinguishes this ubiquitous feature from contextuality in a different, one could argue more
interesting meaning.
