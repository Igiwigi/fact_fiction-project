of the foot, from the pedal ganglia, I propose to consider them as parts of the foot
and to call them the © epipodia.” It has been long since shown by Van Bexzpen
and others that they have nothing to do with the respiratory function.

In this subtype the intestine opens on the right ventral side of the neck, and dis-
section shows its first, bend to be ventral, that is, towards the side of the pedal
ganglia.

2. The genus Psychek or Euribia offers a very interesting transition from the
foregoing to the second snbtype. This genus is commonly said to have a cartilagi-
nous shell, but this s0-called shell appears, upon careful examination, to be only the
thickened integument of the body ; it is not secreted by a true mantle, like that of
Cleodora, &. The notion of a hell has arisen seemingly from the fact that a sort
of cleft exists anteriorly from which the locomotive organs of the animal can be pro-
traded and into which they can be retracted, but at the margin of this cleft the softer

* The origin of the nerves of the acetabuliferous tentacula may probably throw some light upon this matter; I
have not had the opportunity of dissecting sufficiently large specimens of either Pneumodermon or Clio, carefully,
with regard to this especial point. From the figures of Eryoux and Sovrzyer, one would be led to believe
that the nerves of the acetabuliferous tentacles arise from the cephalic ganglia, which would be a very great
objection to the view adyocated above, since all the other parts of the foot, the mesopodium, metapodium and
epipodium are supplied by the pedal ganglia. (See Expoux and SouLsyer, plate 15. fig. 30, and plate 15 bis,
fig. 8.)
