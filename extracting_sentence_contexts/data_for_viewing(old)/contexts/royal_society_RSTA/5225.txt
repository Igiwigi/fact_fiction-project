factual imaginary of what ‘might have been’—that is, they start from the (unfalsifiable) contention
that climate policies would have been more ambitious had geoengineering not been part of the
discourse. Other commentators—including geoengineering proponents such as David Keith—
are more inclined to see the urgency and benefits of conducting research on geoengineering as
outweighing the risks associated with moral hazard arguments [24].


Curiously, though, for an argument that hinges so centrally on the perception that 4 |
geoengineering might offer a form of insurance against climate change, there has been very

little direct exploration of the moral hazard premise with members of the public. The claim 3
that geoengineering presents a moral hazard is an empirical one, about attitudes, decisions : a
and behaviour [14]. Echoing Hale’s concerns about counter-factual falsifiability, Preston [20] has : <
argued that the empirical nature of the moral hazard argument prevents a meaningful assessment : s

being made, because the impact of geoengineering on existing climate policies would only be
knowable when (or if) the situation actually unfolded. However, while it may not be possible
to know with certainty how the prospect of geoengineering will impact on public attitudes and
behaviour, it is possible to explore this question with members of the public now.

(b) The moral hazard argument and public perceptions

There is only very limited empirical evidence with which to begin to evaluate the perceived

risk of a geoengineering moral hazard among the general public. One quantitative study, using : 2
