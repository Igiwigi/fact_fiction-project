structions. He concluded (1928) that the symmetrical or asymmetrical disposition of
leaves cannot be explained by mechanical causes, nor by nutrition, but is “ the consequence
and visible sign of symmetrical or asymmetrical internal structure” (p. 876). The
theory of Htrmer (1922) also belongs to the first group.

The second group of theories originated with Hormetsrer’s observation that each
leaf arises in the largest gap between the previous leaves. To explain this fact he
suggested (1868) that the outgrowth of primordia produced a tension in the outer cell
walls, which tended to resist the outgrowth of further primordia. Each primordium,
therefore, arose in a position where the tension was at a minimum and thus came to
occupy the space that was farthest removed from the previous primordia. This theory
has received no further support, but the observation that leaves arise in the largest
gap has been accepted as a fundamental fact by several later writers.

ScHWENDENER realised the truth of HormetstEr’s law, but considered that the latter
had exaggerated its importance as a factor determining leaf arrangement (1878). In
addition, he considered the following factors to be of fundamental importance : (1) The
establishment of contact between a young primordium and at least two neighbouring
leaves at the end of its first growth phase. (2) The ratio of the sizes of the young
leaves to that of the axis on which they arise. He supposed that, when the leaves
had been laid down in a manner determined by these factors, they were displaced by
mutual pressures, which were the result of the unequal resistances encountered by
the extending leaves in the transverse and longitudinal directions. This theory of
displacement by contact pressures has received much criticism and very little support,
and it is now generally agreed that an actual displacement of leaf insertions rarely, if
