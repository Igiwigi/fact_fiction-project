As the supply voltage reduces, any oscillatory activity, such as a clock
signal, may show a reduced amplitude and reduced frequency. However, the ratio between the
time within a period when the clock signal is high and the time within a period when the clock
signal is low stays the same as both would increase at the same rate. Our method, therefore, is dedicated to finding ways of exploiting this fact by transferring
computation from the digital domain, which is affected by voltage and frequency variations, to
the relative temporal domain, which is not. This means making use of PWM-based techniques.

(a) Principles of duty cycle to voltage conversion

Figure 2 shows an inverter-based PWM to voltage converter, which produces an output voltage
whose value represents the value carried by the input PWM signal, i.e. its duty cycle. Here we
exploit the principle that if the input of an inverter is a periodic signal, such as a clock, the average
voltage on its output is inversely proportional to the duty cycle of the input signal.
