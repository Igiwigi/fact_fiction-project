LL authors, who have hitherto delivered pro-
LA ceſſes for making i&hyocolla, fiſh-glue or ifin-
glaſs, have greatly miſtaken both its conſtituent mat=-
ter and preparation. To prove this affertion, it may not be improper
to recite what Pomet ſays upon the ſubject, as he
appears to be the principal author whom the reſt
have copied *. After deſcribing the fiſh, and re-
ferring to a cut engraved from an original in his cuſ-
tody, he fays: © As to the manner of making the
« ifinglaſs, the ſinewy parts of the fiſh are boiled
© in water, till all of them be diſſolved that will dif-
« ſolve; then the gluey liquor is ſtrained, and ſet to
© cool, Being cold, the fat is carefully taken off,
© and the liquor itſelf boiled to a juſt conſiſtency,
* then cut to pieces, and made into a twiſt, bent in
© form of a creſcent, as commonly ſold, then hung
© upon a ftring, and carefully dried.”

From this account, it might be rationally con-
cluded that every ſpecies of fiſh which contained
gelatinous principles would yield ifinglaſs : and this
parity of reaſoning ſeems to have given riſe to the haſty
concluſions of thoſe, who ſtrenuouſly vouch for the
extraction of iſinglaſs from ſturgeon; but as that fiſh
is eaſily procureable, the negligence of aſcertaining
the fact by experiment ſeems inexcuſeable. Every traveller, as well as author, who mentions
iſinglaſs, obſerves that it is made from certain fiſh
