In this case,
EW symmetry breaking happens after most of the flavour structure has already emerged, which
will suppress CP violation from Yukawa variation during the EW phase transition and, therefore,
when sphalerons get out-of-equlibrium. The precise form of the ansatz (3.4) is not fundamental
for the argument we want to make. In fact it does not capture all behaviours encountered in
specific models. However the only crucial feature is that the Yukawa couplings are of order 1
in the symmetric phase and remain large in some fraction of the bubble wall. As the CP-violating source (3.2) is proportional to the second derivative of the mass parameter,
we expect the source for small (big) 1 to be localized outside (inside) the broken phase.
