aC. pelagica Watt, the other, C. leptopora; also of two kinds of coccoliths, the
Sronstituent plates of the two species.
= Plate 15, fig. 12, is a representation of the finer particles of the same deposit, as
shown in Plate 11, fig. 4 of the “Challenger” Report. It shows these particles as
gihey appear under an apochromatic objective and under the same magnification as
the coccospheres on our plate. The constituent plates of C. leptopora are very
clearly seen; in some of the plates the striae show a tendency to run in a somewhat
‘gscurved manner. Very numerous club-shaped rhabdoliths are present, and also a
‘gsingle specimen of the trumpet form, at the top of the figure.
& An examination also of material from Station 1668 (as figured in Plate 11, fig. 3
_ of the “ Challenger” ‘ Report on Deep Sea Deposits’) shows a large number of both
_ forms of coccospheres, besides very numerous coccoliths from both species.
F In spite of the fact that the shell of Coccosphara pelagica Waut., has been known
_ for more than a quarter of a century, and its constituent plates for a longer period,
| it has not hitherto been at all satisfactorily described. Watuicn’s figure has
undoubtedly the plates of the organism to which we have applied his name,
t C. pelagica, but it hardly seems to represent the complete shell as we find it at the
' sea bottom. The figures given by Harcken and by Sir Jonn Murray refer
_ either to imperfect specimens, or show very little detail of structure.
