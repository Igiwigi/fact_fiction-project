(1895, a), SrrinpBERG (1915, 4, 1916), and Wiesmann (1926) are of the same view.
Soon after the appearance of the yolk-like particles, minute, rounded bodies of
varying sizes are also seen (fig. 22, Plate 2). These bodies stain an intense black with
iron-haematoxylin. Their significance is obscure but they are probably responsible
for the disposal of the yolk-like particles mentioned above. The cells rapidly
increase in size and reach a maximum during blastokinesis, after which they
gradually become smaller, All these changes mentioned above might suggest a

relation to exist between the suboesophageal body and blastokinesis. However,
the fact that this body is absent in some insects, which undergo a marked blasto-
kinesis (Forficula), and present in others, where no blastokinesis occurs, is against any
such hypothesis. The suboesophageal body is present even in the freshly hatched
hopper, where it occupies a small area beneath the anterior end of the crop. Whether
it persists in the latter instars has not been ascertained. In the late embryonic stages
of Xiphidium (WHEELER, 1893) and of Forficula (Heymons, 1895, a) the cells of this
body become attached to the salivary glands. No such association was observed in
Locusta.

Discussionâ€”The suboesophageal body has been shown to exist in the embryos
of the Orthoptera, the Isoptera, the Rhynchota, and the Lepidoptera. It is usually
of a temporary nature except in Gryllus and the Blattidae where it persists in the
larva (Hrymons, 1895, a), and in the Isoptera where it is present even in the sexually
