Some intrinsic physico-chemical properties of P3HT, such as high hole mobility values Ss

of approximately 0.1cm?V~!s~! [10], good solubility and reproducibility [11], high thermal fS
stability [12] and commercial availability with proper price [13] make this polymer a potential al
alternative compared to PTAA and spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, the P3HT properties can
be tuned by varying the length of the side chains, which creates different polymeric regions
depending on the degree of crystallinity (order) or the number of amorphous regions [14].
The understanding of the carrier hopping through these crystalline and amorphous regions
in semiconductor polymers has attracted a lot of interest in the organic electronic community
[13,15,16]. Seminal papers on this matter have been reported, and had changed the paradigm
that better crystallinity leads to better solar cell efficiency [14,16]. In fact, the knowledge of the
energetic disorder in the organic material and its relation with the carrier transport and carrier
recombination is a key factor for improvement of the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs that
are equipped with polymers and other organic semiconductor molecules as selective contacts.

We have previously studied the performance of PSCs using different PSHT molecular weights
(MWs) [8]. Direct relationships between the MWs of polymers and their solar cell performances
have been investigated [3]. Recently, Dixon et al. showed that the recombination rate decreases by
increasing of the MW from 14 to 331 kDa and that the most efficient charge collection occurs
for P3HT with a MW of 48kDa, having 5 x 10-4 cm? V-!-s as hole mobility [14]. In these
studies, the carriersâ€™ mobility is attributed to the PSHT morphology changes from a paraffinic
microstructure to a semi-crystalline structure. Accordingly, at higher MWs, the entanglement
density increases, leading to a large fraction of amorphous regions. One could think that these
