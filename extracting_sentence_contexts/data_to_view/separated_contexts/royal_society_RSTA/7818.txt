At a speed greater than about 2 cm./sec. the longitudinal rolls of fig. 9, Plate 2,
were formed. In this as in the double shear experiments adjacent rolls rotated in
opposite directions. The speeds given above are necessarily only approximate, because complete regu-
larity of conditions could not be achieved, in fact, many of the photographs show
two of the patterns at the same time ; these photographs are useful in helping to piece
togetherâ€™the complete transformation from polygons to longitudinal rolls. This trans-
formation was not achieved experimentally, and was partly due to the fact that the
smoke settled or dispersed too quickly, and to the fact that conditions were not
sufficiently regular. A.
