birth of living only one-half as long as those in better-class houses, or they die nearly
20 years sooner, on the average, than those of the better class. This is an enormous
difference. If we take the mean age of those who died above 20, we find that a
similar lowering of the mean age at death likewise occurs in the worse class of houses,
though not nearly to such a marked degree. It is, in fact, only the strong ones who
have survived in the 1- and 2-roomed houses, the weaker ones having been mostly cut
off before they reach the age of 5 years. The higher mean age at death of those
who died above 20 years of age in 1-roomed houses, though possibly due partly to
the fact that a larger proportion of the people living in 1-roomed houses are employed
in outside labour during the day than is the case with the other classes, is, doubtless,
chiefly due to a process of natural selection, whereby the weaker ones have been
taken off earlier in life, so that those who are left are much more able to combat
circumstances unfavourable to life than are those in 2- and 3-roomed houses, and who
have not undergone this natural selection to nearly such a great extent.* The Table
also shows that in better-class houses persons above 70 are likely to live about a year
longer than those above 70 years of age in 1- and 2-roomed houses, although the latter
are to a much greater extent a “ survival of the fittest.”

notice.
