The latter statement has been intro-
duced in order to remove an impression which may haye been created in con-
sequence of the detection of iodine, as it is said, even in common pump-water*,
when very large quantities of it were evaporated ; from which circumstance it
might be inferred, that this principle is not only a constant accompaniment of
common salt, but that its quantity bears a pretty regular ratio to that of the
latter ingredient. Although I have myself eyaporated no less than forty-cight
gallons of the Oxford pump-water without finding the slightest trace of iodine
in the last portions, I shall not dispute the truth of the former position, which
might possibly have been borne out, had still larger quantities been operated
upon+; but that the latter opinion is untenable, will be readily seen from the

* Mr. Cuzx, a chemist at Bath, has also detected it in the hot springs of that place, by evaporating
about thirty gallons of the water.

accompanying Table, which shows that the proportion of iodine to chlorine
varies in every possible degree, and that the springs most strongly impregnated
with common salt are in some instances those in which I haye evaporated the
largest quantity without detecting any trace of iodine. The same remark wilt
equally apply to bromine ; 80 that the general inference seems to be, that
although these two principles may perhaps be never entirely absent where the
muriates occur, yet that their distribution is certainly very unequal, and there-
fore forms a proper subject of scientific research.
