LOWRY AND H. HUDSON ON OPTICAL ROTATORY POWER.

have been displaced to longer wave-lengths. This conclusion was confirmed by the
fact that a reversal of sign was detected in the methylene bornyl ester, IV, at about
7000 A., where a zero reading was observed, whilst a small positive rotation, Â« = 0:06,
[x] = 0-2, was observed at about 7100 A., using a carbon arc as a source of red light. In the region of absorption, however, the curves of rotatory dispersion are of just the
same type as those referred to above.

(d) Astill further displacement is observed in the diphenyl dithiourethanes, where the
first absorption band is shifted into the visible spectrum, so that the solutions have a
strong red colour. The anomalies associated with the Corron phenomenon are therefore
also displaced into the visible spectrum, so that TscHuGAEFE* was able to observe the
anomalous rotations and Bruna} to measure also the circular dichroism in the region
covered by the band.
