Inspection of a graph of WoLrer’s annual sunspot numbers, the upper curve in fig. 8
(p. 296) suggests quite definitely to my eye that we have to deal with a graph of the
type of fig. 2, not of the type of fig. 1, at least as regards its principal features. It is true
that there are minor irregularities, which may represent superposed fluctuations,
probably in part of the nature of errors of observation ; for the sunspot numbers can only
be taken as more or less approximate ‘index-numbers ” to sunspot activity. But
in the main the graph is wonderfully smooth, and its departures from true periodicity,
which have troubled all previous analysts of the data, are precisely those found in fig. 2—
great variation in amplitude and continual changes of phase.

If this interpretation is correct, it seems desirable to break away from the periodogram
method: the problem is, in fact, no longer one merely of determining the period, but
also of determining the values of ¢, the “ disturbances,” as I term them for short. It is
natural, then, to approach the problem from the standpoint of the equation relating
U, tO U,_1, Uz», ete. Starting also, as I did, with the conception of periodogram analysis
and harmonic periodicities in my mind, it was natural to assume an equation of the
form (6), and an equation of corresponding form for two periodicities. This gave the
first method tried. :

It only occurred to me later that the method started from an unnecessarily limited
assumption; that it would be better simply to find the linear regression equation of
U, ON U,_; U,—», and more terms if necessary, and solve this as a finite difference equation.
This gave my second method. As the results of the first method were interesting, I give
both methods below.
