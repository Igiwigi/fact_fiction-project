What is your view on this? &
Nigel Brandon The UK government didn’t do us any favours by deciding to move
away from a long-publicized commitment to support a fairly major CCS
demonstration. I think it was a particularly large cost item which could
be removed from the budget at a time when there were a lot of budget
constraints. As a consequence of that, a lot of folk were quite upset at the
fact that we didn’t make that commitment. In the UK, we don’t have a demonstration programme around CCS. Indeed, in lots of other countries, it’s been a struggle to get
demonstration programmes about CCS.
