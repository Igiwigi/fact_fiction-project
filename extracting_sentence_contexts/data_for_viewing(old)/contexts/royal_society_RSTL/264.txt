13. Durability.

There does not seem to be the slightest ground for the
apprehension, that the filling in should render the $hip's
timbers liable to decay: on the contrary, the timbers of the
Sandwich were found perfectly sound in the lower half of
their length, opposite to the wedges which had been driven
in between them, and completely decayed in the upper half,
where they had been exposed, in the usual manner, to the
action of the confined moist air and water; and this result is
perfectly conformable to analogy with the few facts that have
been ascertained, respecting the general causes of decay. The
utility of the filling in, for preventing the accumulation of
-filth, and for keeping the ship free from foul air, with respect
to the comfort, and perhaps to the health of the crew, is too
obvious to require discussjon. How far the ecotiomy of tim-

to believe, can best be ascertaiged by those who are in the
habit of estimating its value: but if the durability of the vessel
