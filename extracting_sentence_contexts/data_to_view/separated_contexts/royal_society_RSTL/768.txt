Since this Paper was written Dr. WoLLasTox has published
8ome experiments upon platina. He has found that palladium
is contained in very small quantities in crude platina. This fact
was mentioned to me more than a year ago by Dr. WoLLasToN,
I have not yet seen a copy of his Paper; but I shall merely

in a natural state, no conclusion can be drawn as to its being
simple or compound. Nothing is more probable than that
nature may have formed this alloy, and formed it much better
than we can do. At all events the amalgamation to which
platina is submitted before it reaches Europe is sufficient to
account for a small portion of palladium, -
