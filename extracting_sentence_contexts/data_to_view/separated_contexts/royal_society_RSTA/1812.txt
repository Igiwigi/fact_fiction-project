While there are many attempts [6,9]
to derive the cosmological term, none has been fully convincing—in the following sense. Physical

'n this paper, dark energy and the cosmological constant are taken as synonyms. One may also adopt a broader point of
view and call all sources of repulsive gravity ‘dark energy’.


theories do not just give quantitative explanations of measured facts, but they connect the facts
across several different areas of empirical investigation. The larger the range of explanation the
more valuable is the theory and the more likely it is that the theory captures a portion of the truth. The attempts of deriving the cosmological constant from theory seem to fall into two categories:
either they are off by many orders of magnitude, if they originate from other known physics,
or they are highly specialized and therefore highly speculative.
