the nerve-rudiments have at this stage but one point of attachment to the spinal cord,
and that this one corresponds with the dorsal or posterior root of the adult nerve.

The rudiments are, in fact, those of the posterior root only.

The next or second stage in the formation of these structures to which T would call
attention occurs at about the time when three to five visceral clefts are present. The
disappearance from the notochord in the anterior extremity of the body of a special
central area rich in protoplasm serves as an excellent guide to the commencement of
this epoch.

Its investigation is beset with far greater difficulties than the previous one. This is
owing partly to the fact that a number of connective-tissue cells, which are only with
great difficulty to be distinguished from the cells which compose the spinal nerves, make
their appearance around the latter, and partly to the fact that the attachment of the
spinal nerves to the neural canal becomes much smaller, and therefore more difficult to
study.

Fortunately, however, in Torpedo these peculiar features are not present to nearly
the same extent as in Pristiurus and Seyllium.

The connective-tissue cells, though they appear earlier in Torpedo than in the two
other genera, are much less densely packed, and the large attachment of the nerves to
the neural canal is retained for a longer period.
