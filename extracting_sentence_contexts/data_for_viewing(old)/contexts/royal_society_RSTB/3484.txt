revealed later in the preparations for the osculum, but would thus not be determined
till after spicule formation.

As regards the results of other authors, two papers only—Wrrson (’09) and
Miter ('11,)—have appeared. on this subject since Writson’s first paper (’07,).
Wizson has extended his experiments by proving that in Microciona these products
of coalescence grow up perfectly normal, and may become sexually mature, con-
firming the established view that the amceboid cells of sponges are potential germ-
cells, and further showing that the strange and violent treatment suffered by the
cells does not injure them in the performance of any of the functions of life.
Miter has repeated the experiments on fresh-water sponges (Spongilla lacustris
and Ephydatia Miilleri) and has obtained results very similar to Wison’s, adding,
however, the interesting fact that active division of many cells goes on even during
the period of reunion, He believes (though he cannot be quite sure) that the collar-
cells take no part in regeneration, while WiLson is not very explicit on the subject,
though he finds that they are certainly taken up into the masses during reunion.
In Spongilla the reunited masses seemed to be composed almost entirely of large
ameebocytes. In the Sycon masses, the collar-cells of the original sponge certainly
persist to form the collared epithelium of the regenerate. This is correlated,
doubtless, with their much greater relative bulk in Sycon than in the more
specialised types with small and scattered flagellated chambers, where an equal
current can be produced by fewer cells.

This utilisation of all the old materials is probably more primitive ; in Spongilla the
decreased importance of the collar-cells, together with the acquisition of the power to
