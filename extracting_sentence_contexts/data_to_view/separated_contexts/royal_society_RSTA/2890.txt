They advocated a common law recognition of a right to privacy, an
idea that has been highly influential, shaping the evolution of both common law and statutory
law across the USA. In 1960, Prosser published a summary of the subsequent jurisprudence on the right to privacy,
finding that a majority of American courts recognized the right. Furthermore, he found that
privacy law had evolved to comprise four distinct privacy torts, including intrusion upon a


person’s seclusion or solitude, or into his or her private affairs; public disclosure of embarrassing
private facts about an individual; publicity placing one in a false light in the public eye; and
appropriation of one’s likeness for the advantage of another [8]. Modern US courts continue to frame informational privacy interests in terms of the four
privacy torts, carrying forward Prosser’s emphasis on redressing specific, tangible harms
resulting from a rather narrow subset of privacy-invasive activities. This narrow view of privacy-
related harms, requiring a showing of actual or imminent physical, financial or property injury,
has led US courts to dismiss many data breach cases for lack of harm.
