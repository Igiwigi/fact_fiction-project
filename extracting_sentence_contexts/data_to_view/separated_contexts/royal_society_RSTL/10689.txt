The latter
numbers, it will be s8een, do nob give the true wave-lengths, but require a s8mall
correction, which will be found in the table. The correction for the nurabers calcu-
lated for the lines 12, 17, 18, on the portion 11-18, from photographs of spectra on
either side of the reflections of the slib, are shown by the table to be as nearly as pos-
8ible 2'9 and 33 tenth-metres, of negative sign for the spectra to the right and positive
8ign for those to the left. Guided by these corrections, and owing to the fact that
the lines 12%, P, y occur also on the photographs of the portion 6=12, the lines 17 and
18 on the photographs of the portion 17-26, the corrections for the remaining lines
have been deduced. Thus, for the portion 17-26 the corrections for the lines 17, 18
were found to be 3'6 and 3'8 respectively, and a correction of 4'0 was consequently
made to remaining lines of this portion of the spectrum. In a like manner the
corrections for the lines of the portion 6-12 were found.
