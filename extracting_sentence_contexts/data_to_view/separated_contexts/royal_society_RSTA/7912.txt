As before, the process involved is one of decay of tension and permanent
obliteration of the discontinuities characteristic of the three phases, and once more
it seems clear that we are dealing with side-chain transformations only which are
functions of both temperature and time. At higher extensions these changes are
revealed in the X-ray photographs by the “spreading” of certain spots already
mentioned, an effect which shows at its best in photographs of steam-stretched fibres
(fig. 23, Plate 8, human hair stretched in steam to 100% extension). ‘The phenomenon,
which will be dealt with crystallographically below, is one of first-rate importance
from the point of view of the general theory of protein structure, because it shows that
the dimensional disturbance in the keratin crystallites under the action of water, steams
and other reagents, is confined to a single direction only, that of the amino-acid side-chains.*
The disturbance first makes itself evident at extensions exceeding 50-60% ; that is
to say, soon after the onset of the transformation of the phase K;, from which it seems
a reasonable conclusion that it arises or is considerably intensified—in the transformed
crystalline phase, Ky, at any tate—through the rapid rise in stress in the transformed,
and therefore inextensible, K, during the progress of the transformation of the final
phase, K;. It is therefore a direct consequence of the fact that K, cannot be com-
pletely transformed into its @-modification without the aid of steam or caustic soda
solutions. The super-contraction of hair.—\t was observed by Speakman} that aqueous solu-
tions of caustic soda and of sodium sulphide can not only relieve the “ set ” of a steam-
stretched wool fibre, but can also cause the fibre to contract to a length which is
definitely shorter than the original. The explanation of this phenomenon at the time
of its discovery was not apparent, but it is now clear from the X-ray interpretation
of hair structure given here that it is a particular manifestation of a general effect to
which we have ventured to attach the term “ super-contraction,” to distinguish it
from the property of a normal stretched hair, when wetted, of returning exactly to
its original unstretched length.
