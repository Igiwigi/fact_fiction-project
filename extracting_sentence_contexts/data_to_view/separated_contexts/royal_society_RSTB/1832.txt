I have discussed the morphology
of the spike of Ophioglosswm, and found that the details of development are compatible
with a view of its origin by septation from a simpler non-septate body. It was seen,
moreover, that such a process of septation, producing somewhat similar results, has
occurred not uncommonly in the Anthers of Angiosperms. Comparative evidence
was also adduced which supported the view of septation for Ophioglossum, Having
thus the analogy of anthers of Angiosperms, and (on my view) that of the spike of
Ophioglossum before us, it may be inquired what bearing the developmental facts
have upon the origin of the sorus in Danea ; do they support a theory of fusion or of
septation as explaining the present structure ? It has been seen that in the synangial genera of Marattiaceze a “ superficial parent
cell” commonly gives rise to the sporogenous group, together with the cap of tissue
covering it, while a band of tissue, which develops into the septum together with the
tapetal layer on either side of it, separates the sporogenous groups one from another,
Such a structure of the young synangium would be compatible either with a view of
progressive septation or of sporangial fusion, if the septa were of uniform thickness,
and the archesporia all distinct from one another. GorBEL has already used the
developmental evidence in favour of the theory of fusion, assuming, in accordance
with his own observations on Maruttia, that there is this uniformity.
