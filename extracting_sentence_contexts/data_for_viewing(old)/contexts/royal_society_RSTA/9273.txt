compound plate, and it will be seen that such a plate can be bent in just the same way
as a simple plate by couples applied to the four edges. Taking the case in which the
couples over the long edges reduce to zero (although the corresponding stresses will not
be identically zero), we have the case of a very wide compound beam bent by couples
at the ends only. For although the extraneous forces required to balance the tractions
over the lateral edges are not identically zero, they are statically in equilibrium. We
may therefore superpose a system of forces in equilibrium, and equal and opposite to
these extraneous forces, to cancel them without appreciably altering the stress system,
since by Satnt-VENANT's principle (or the theory of local perturbations) the effect of a
system of forces in equilibrium acting over a small area is negligible, except at points
near that area.

We can, in fact, assume that the reactions at the boundary between the materials
introduces stresses within the beam which very nearly conform to the stress system
assumed in the solution of the plate problem, except at points very near the lateral
edges. Thus the stresses in the two cases « > o’ and o < o’ may be approximately
as in (a) and (6), respectively, of fig. 5.

In addition to the tensions and pressures indicated in the above figure, there will also

be certain shearing stresses at the boundary between the materials, especially near the
edges. Whatever the stresses near the edges may be, however, we may assume that
