are obtained via

Thus, the data used for the disentanglement are: the times of R-peaks, tx, and the respiratory phase

and the frequency, w(t) and w(t), and in particular w(ty) = Wy, and w(ty) = wy. Note that in this

test, two latter series are obtained from equations, while in fact respiratory phase and frequency

should be estimated from data, which will certainly introduce an additional error. The respiratory-

related and the non-respiratory-related components obtained via dynamic disentanglement shall

be compared with f," and tf," “, respectively.

Here, we illustrate the model data and the disentanglement results for the following values of
the parameters: w = 27, w, =2, ¢ =0.1, bp = 1.087, a=0.1, y- =0.1, 4 = 0.02, A1 = 0.03, A2 = 0.02.
The records used for the subsequent analysis contained about 10* inter-beat intervals, which
correspond to about 2.5 h of natural heart beat. The model data are illustrated in figure 3. Here,
