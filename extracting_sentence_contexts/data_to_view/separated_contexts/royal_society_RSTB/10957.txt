strated in vertebrates that lack the mammalian neocortex (see
Agrillo & Bisazza [4]). In fact, it seems highly unlikely that
the architectural plan of the vertebrate brain is necessary for
basic numerical cognition; cuttlefish, for example, have
recently been claimed to discriminate prey items on the basis
of numerosity [5]

Contrary to the notion that numerical cognition is a com-
plex, higher cortical function, theoretical studies indicate that
numerical discrimination requires no more than a classifier
and a threshold mechanism [6], which can be implemented
by known neural circuits ([7]; see also Rose [8]). The extent to
which such mechanisms can explain numerical cognition

remains to be determined, but the point is that we should not Figure 1. Landmark counting by honeybees in an open field.
