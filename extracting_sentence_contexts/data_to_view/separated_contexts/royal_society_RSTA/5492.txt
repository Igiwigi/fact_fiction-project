Mean error i on ied a +11 +08 ms +10 The star was not again observed until September 2, 1877 (the estimated magnitude
being 10°5), when the startling fact was at once apparent that the spectrum was
restricted practically to a single line. The measurements show that this was the line
near 500. On September 6, it was observed that in addition to the chief line there
were traces of one or two lines on the violet side of the chief line, but very close to
it.
