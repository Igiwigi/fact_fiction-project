it
is remarked that the continuance or decrease of the then
angular velocity of about 1* per annum for a few years,
would decide the question of rectilinear or orbitual motion. The present observations, then, go a great way towards de-
ciding this interesting question, as, s0 far from indicating
any retardation, their tendency lies the other way. In fact,
(supposing them free from error), no less than — g? z4' have
been described in 2.74 years, being at the rate of — 19.420
per annum. This star therefore merits peculiar attention, as
the great variation of its distance gives reason to suppose a
great ellipticity, or considerable inclination of its orbit. . (H.)
