Emanating from a physiologist 80 distinguished as Mr. T. Wnarrox Joxes, these
memoirs are entitled to the highest consideration. Although confined © to the more
readily procurable examples of the divisions Annulosa and Mollusca,” those on the
Crustacea and Insects excepted, in no instance have I been able to verify the observa-
tions of this author. 2

In their most recent communication to the Royal Society*, ALper and Hancock
adduce additional facts corroborative of their former conclusions. They maintain
*that in the Mollusks there is a triple circulation : first, the systemic, in which the
blood propelled along the arteries to the viscera and foot is returned, with the ex-
ception of that from the liver-mass, to the heart through the skin; there it becomes
partially aGrated, the skin being provided with vibratile cilia, and otherwise adapted
as an instrument of respiration ; second, the portal, in which venous blood from
the system is driven by a special heart to the renal and hepatic organs, and probably
to the ovarium, where it escapes, doubly venous, with the rest of the blood which
has been supplied to these organs from the aorta, and which is therefore only singly
venous, to the branchie; third, the branchial circulation, in which flows only the
more deteriorated blood brought by the hepatic vein, but in which also that blood
undergoes the highest degree of purification capable of being effected in the economy,
namely, in the special organ of respiration. This triple circulation has not yet, as
far as the authors are aware, been described in the Molluscan Sub-kingdom.
