epidermal constrictions divide neither abdomen nor post-abdomen but the ventral
stolonic vessel. Also in Clavelina it is the activity of the epidermis that results in
the separation of the stolonic vessel, and its ampullae from the remainder of the
zooid. Thus in Diazona, Archidistoma, Eudistoma, Morchellium, Aplidium, Sidnyum,
Colella, and Clavelina, isolation of buds is brought about by transverse epidermal
constrictions akin to strobilization. In Distaplia and Diplosoma a proliferation of cell
masses from the epicardia coincides with an associated extension of the epidermis ;
but it is difficult to say whether one activity induces the other, or whether some more
obscure factor is responsible for both. In Diplosoma the bud masses are able to
develop without physical isolation from the parent, though with the result that
the presence of the original zooid limits the extent of reorganization. In Distaplia
the buds are removed from any parental influence by the complete degeneration
of the original zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the zooid as a whole
does not involve the epicardial cell masses. Similarly in Pycnoclavella the masses
of trophocytes survive the general autolysis following degeneration. In Perophora
and Ecteinascidia the ventral stolonic vessel is long and branched, and buds are
formed by it while yet physically united to the parent zooid. Isolation must
accordingly be physiological rather than physical. A proliferation of epidermal
and mesenchyme cells to form a bud rudiment occurs always at some distance from
the zooid, later buds developing from the growing stolon at similar distances from
one another. In the perophorids the buds never form from the stolon tip, but
in the botryllids and polystyelids they develop always from the terminal bulge of
the atrial outgrowth, whether the outgrowth is so short that the bud is in contact
with the parent, as in Botryllus or Polyandrocarpa tincta, or at the end of a long
