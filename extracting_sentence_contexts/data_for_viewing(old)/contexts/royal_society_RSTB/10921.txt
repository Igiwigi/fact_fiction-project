the majority of anisotropic models, are predicted to have a
Brewster angle, approximately 50-55 degrees for most isotro-
pic biological materials. At the Brewster angle the polarization
component of light that is polarized tangentially to the plane
of incidence is completely transmitted, and is an effect that
arises purely due to the geometry of the stack system (table 1).

3. Chitin in golden beetles: increasing the
reflectivity via polarization mode conversion

The chiral structures found in beetles are documented in
many publications and the optics of the cholesteric or chiral
nematic-like chitin is well understood [2,7,28]. A fact that is
not often discussed is that this mechanism imposes a limit
on the maximum reflectivity of material. For incident unpo-
larized light, 50% reflectivity is a fundamental maximum.
Resolving the incident light into equal amounts of left-
handed and right-handed circularly polarized light, it can
be seen that the component that matches the handedness of
the structure will be transmitted and the component of the
light that has the opposite handedness will be reflected. In
reality, a degree of disorder and defects in the structures
make this a theoretical maximum and the reflectivity is
always somewhat lower. Figure 1a illustrates this in the iri-
descent green species Chrysochroa aurora, where with one
