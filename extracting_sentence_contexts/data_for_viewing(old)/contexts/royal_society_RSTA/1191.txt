(4) Adaptive/dynamic feedback. During fast imaging, the tip tends to ‘detach’ completely from
the surface at the downhill regions, an effect known as ‘parachuting’. To address this,
a dynamic controller was developed, consisting of a feedback controller that increases
automatically the gain when downhill regions are scanned.

HS-AFM has also been adapted to perform HS-FS. When AFM is operated in force
spectroscopy mode, the tip approaches and retracts perpendicularly to the surface at controlled
force and velocity. This allows detection of specific interactions using functionalized tips and
probing of mechanical properties of single molecules, membranes and other living cells. The
miniaturization of the cantilever in HS-AFM results in a very low viscous damping, which
is a prerequisite for a ps-response time. In fact, the components and their miniaturization
necessary to perform HS-FS are equivalent to those of imaging. Another technical particularity
to improve the performance of HS-FS is to tilt the surface 45°, minimizing the effective viscous
drag of the cantilever. With this configuration, it is possible to reach pulling velocities up
to approximately 30mms~! [43,44]. Such recordings required analogue-to-digital converter
with high temporal resolution (tens of megasamples/s). Other technical modifications have
been explored allowing the use of new methodologies with the HS-AFM set-up for improved
mechanical measurements. Smaller z-piezo actuators give access to high frequencies (up to
120 kHz) in order to probe the microrheology of soft samples at high rates [45]. The use of
torsional harmonic cantilevers also allows force measurements of receptor/ligand bonds with
ps-time resolution [46]. Micromachining of ultrashort cantilevers also remarkably improve force
sensitivity while maintaining ps response time [47].
