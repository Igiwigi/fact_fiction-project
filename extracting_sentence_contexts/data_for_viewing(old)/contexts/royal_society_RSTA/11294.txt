'= the eye, and thus a starting point for calculation is readily obtained. The difference
of ordinates of these points (P,P.) is proportional to the secondary circulations of
@ the corresponding shells. In fact, when multiplied by zy/(ScA — sin d), the products
8 give the values of those constants. It is therefore clear from the figure that these
& circulations are in opposite directions alternately, and that we get two alternate
8 series of ascending and descending values,

= The function S (A) =Sid — sin d denotes the area between the J curve and the
3 axis of « up to the point ». It is clear, therefore, that it has its maximum values at

= the odd , points, and its minimum at the even ones,

= The tracing of the current sheets is particularly easy from the fact that they are
& given by functions of the form
