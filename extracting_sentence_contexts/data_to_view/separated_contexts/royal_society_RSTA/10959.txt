Comparing first the partial coefficients with negative universes, | AB|y5|,
&c., with the total coefficients, we see that in every case, without exception, the
partial coefficient is greater than the total. Hence it cannot be true that any one ot
the defects noted is, or is even indicative of, a necessary connecting link between any
other two. That low nutrition brings on at once development defects and nerve
signs, or development defects and dulness, so that we find these pairs associated is,
for instance, a hypothesis that may be partly true but is insufficient to explain the
facts observed. Dr. WanrNeEr’s hypothesis that “ the connecting link between defects
of body and defective mental action is the coincident defect of brain which may be
known by observation of ‘abnormal nerve-signs’”* seems to me equally untenable ;
it may be so in some cases, but on the other hand the “connecting link” may be a
defect of brain not indicated by abnormal nerve signs, or not a defect of brain at all.
