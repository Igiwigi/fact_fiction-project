That it should have been abolished completely in the course
of about half an hour was, perhaps, hardly to be expected. In one experiment, as will be seen, the oxygen percentage was reduced, so that the
alveolar oxygen pressure was only 33°2 mm. In this experiment the subject was
quite comfortable, but there was slight hyperpnoea, as shown by the fact that the
alveolar CO, percentage had fallen distinctly and the respiratory quotient was high. The colour of the subject’s face was also slightly-bluish, and he felt somewhat “ slack ”
just after the experiment. The oxygen pressure of the warmed and moistened
inspired air was 54°3 mm, (corresponding to a height of about 25,000 feet).
