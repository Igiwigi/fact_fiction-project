Assuming two masses of
totipotent epicardial cells to be present along the sides of the oesophagus and some
factor inducing a physical or physiological discontinuity between the anterior and
posterior parts of the zooid at a region between the two masses, the rest follows. What happens is evidently a regeneration of the posterior organs by the anterior
entity, and of anterior organs by the posterior entity, the epicardia merely supplying
raw material in the form of plastic or totipotent cells throughout the process, just
as in budding or regeneration in many other ascidians. There is, in fact, a close
relationship between the budding process of Diplosoma and that of Distaplia and of
Eudistoma. This will be discussed later. The variations from the above account, apart from the detail of rectal duplication
described by Pizon (1905), are readily explained.
