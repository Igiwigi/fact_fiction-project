For this reason it is
difficult to treat in one description both the main trunks of the system and their branch-
ing networks, and I propose to give an account in the first place of the general disposition
of the main trunks, adding later some details of the fine plexuses by which they are
surrounded and to which they give rise.

A. The Main Components. In tracing the larger vessels of the system towards the mid-ventral line of the pharynx,
either from the open networks that they form amongst the lymphatics and arteries
upon the ventral surface of the body, or in the other direction from the plexus that
they form in the gills, one is struck by the fact that as the larger vessels of both plexuses
come in either direction towards the anterior end of the pericardium, they become
simplified and their constituents ultimately combine to form a single trunk* of rela-
tively large size (1 mm. diameter) that forms a common connecting stem between the
two (figs. 7, 8, m.f.). This trunk, which lies upon the lateral wall of the thyroid body and extends thence
across the ventral surface of the pharyngeal floor to the point of entry of the first afferent
branchial artery to the gill-chamber, forms, in fact, a main common stem or focus for
the entire system of vessels.
