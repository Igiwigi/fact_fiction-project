The lutein cells and nuclei in this stoat, fig. 17, Plate 29, are inter-
mediate between those of ordinary corpora lutea of ovulation and developing corpora
lutea of pregnancy, such as those of No. 259 the earliest implantation stage recorded. The occurrence of such corpora lutea in a non-pregnant stoat in March is significant,
since it shows that a luteinizing stimulus may be operative at the beginning of the
breeding season even after infertile mating. Neither of the other two mated, non-

pregnant females killed in March possessed similar corpora lutea, but this may be
accounted for by the fact that one female weighed only 140 gm, and its development
was perhaps retarded, while the other, killed on March 1, had old corpora lutea,
the products of an ovulation some time in February. The corpus luteum of ovulation or pseudo-pregnancy shrinks to about 0-55 mm in
diameter before the next oestrus, and disappears by the time the follicles have ripened. All corpora lutea in an ovary therefore belong to the same cycle ; the number varies
from 1-10.
