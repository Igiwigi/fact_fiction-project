immediately after they had been applied to it. Mr. GuLLrver#* long ago showed that
the spermatozoa of different animals are variously affected by different chemical tests ;
and Dr. Fxzrrcns4F, more recently, has found that a solution of caustic potass has
the property of entirely dissolving and destroying them. This material, therefore,
seemed to be peculiarly fitted for the object in view. But before any experiment, in

THE OVUM IN THE AMPHIBIA. 225

which this was employed, could be relied on, it was necessary to confirm the facts
ascertained by chemical investigation, by observing the mode of action of solutions of
caustic potass, and other chemical agents on the spermatozoa, by means of the micro-
scope. As my observations on the effect of chemical agents on the spermatozoa have
been confined for the present to those of the Frog, I shall state the results of these
observations with the microscope before mentioning the experiments.

All the observations were made immediately after the spermatozoa employed had
been obtained, by the course already mentioned, and not by vivisection from the
vesicule seminales or the testes, sources which are objectionable from the facts shown
in Dr. Frericns' analyses, that a large quantity of albumen is always found in the
immature cells in the testes, with which the spermatozoa, obtained from that source,
are constantly mixed, while there is no trace of albumen in the mature spermatozoa.
