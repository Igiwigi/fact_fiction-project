combinations of different graphs in the set, with different edge types, joined at different
combinations of vertices, would follow a pathway down a different branch of the tree, provided
the graph resulting from the join is an induced subgraph of G. It should be noted that, while we
are conceptually exploring the entire search tree, in practice it is not necessary to explore every
pathway as described above, as algorithmic implementations including branch and bound, and
other techniques, can reduce the computational burden.

(c) Choice of substructures

The choice of the basic substructures depends on the context of the desired complexity. For
example, if we are establishing the complexity of the word ‘banana’, then we could select the set
of unique structures {b, a, n}, where the complexity is relative to all other words that can be made
from those three letters. In fact, we could reasonably extend this set to include all letters of the
English language plus punctuation, so we could then compare the complexities of any arbitrary
phrase in any language using that alphabet. For a chessboard, natural units to choose would be


{black square, white square}, and the complexity would then be relative to all patterns that can
be made of black and white squares.

In selecting the set of basic subunits, we need to consider the class of objects that we are
comparing. For example, if comparing a polymer to all polymers made of the same types of
monomer, then the monomers could be our basic subunits, but if being compared to all molecules
in general, then we would be likely to select atom types or bond types instead. Although
the choice of basic subunits is context-dependent, a natural choice for the subunit is normally
