238 DR. S. P. KRAMER AND PROFESSOR V. HORSLEY ON THE EFFECTS

the carotid two preliminary facts have first to be remembered, viz.: (a.) That the
bullet cuts open numerous branches of the artery. (b.) That the intra-cranial
hemorrhage gradually brings about compression of the artery and its branches. It
is clear at the same time that these two facts tend to neutralise one another in
time, 7.¢., as the blood continues to be extravasated. Further, not only at the
incidence of the shot, but also later, it is not unlikely that the cannula in the
peripheral end of the carotid may act in part as that of an intra-cranial manometer.

The results actually obtained are as follows :—

The fall of pressure in the peripheral carotid cannula is very sharp (see fig. 8, p. 240),
and markedly contrasts with the slow and imperfect fall in the peripheral end of the
femoral artery. See Experiments 42, 52.

After the shot the pressure rises and subsequently exhibits a tendency to
parallelism, but not so markedly as in the case of the femoral.
