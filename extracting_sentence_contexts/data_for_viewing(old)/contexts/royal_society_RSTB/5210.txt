the reduction in the size of the gape is nearly always accomplished by a corresponding
elongation of the symplectic cartilage. In Gasterosteus (fig. 53, c) the jaws are of moderate
size and the symplectic process is fairly elongate ; in Gambusia (fig. 55, H), with a smaller
mouth, this process is correspondingly longer ; and in the Syngnathidee (fig. 55, 1) the
symplectic has become very elongate, and the comparatively minute jaws have been
carried forward to the end of the tube-like snout. On the other hand, in Anguilla and
Clupea, in which the gape is fairly large, the symplectic process is comparatively short.

The interhyal element of the hyoid arch may be regarded as a new structure, which
has been developed in correlation with the need for a stronger suspensorium for the
remainder of the hyoid arch after the hyomandibular had moved forward and become

associated with the jaws. The fact that in Amia and Lepidosteus this element arises as
an independent chondrification, suggests that it developed primarily as a separate

cartilage in the ligament connecting the hyomandibular with the ceratohyal. In Salmo,
however, it is segmented off from the upper end of the ceratohyal (Srour, 1882;
ZANICHELLI, 1909).

No interhyal is present at any stage of development in Gymnarchus.
