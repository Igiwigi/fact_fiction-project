of the induced magnetism remained after the magnetising force
was removed, giving a residual intensity of 1200 e.g.s. units of moment per unit of
volume. $0 far as T am aware no steel magnet ever holds 80 much magnetism as this. : In fact, if by retentiveness we mean simply the faculty of remaining magnetic when
magnetising force is removed, and in the absence of mechanical or other disturbance,
| Soft iron is far more retentive than either hard iron or steel. $22. One more example may be given of the application of a complete magnetising
