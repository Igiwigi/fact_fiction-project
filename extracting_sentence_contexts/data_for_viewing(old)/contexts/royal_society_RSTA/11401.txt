ghown by (i.) and (ii.) above) by the mixture.
& Let us next apply our theory to the above results. We are now dealing with
a, M’,, o,, a’ Assuming that there is no secular change o, = 02, and accordingly
ince o', = o”, sensibly, formula (xi.) shows us that both = o.
g Further, if M, = M., formula (v.) is a quadratic equation to find M, ; substituting
“for M’,, oi, and 7, we have, on solving and taking the only admissible root, M, = 3°4626.
dhen, applying formula (i.) to find M’,, we have :
°

& M’, = 5°660.

a 'This is not quite as high as the observed value 5°856, but it suflices to show that
our theory expresses the main facts. In all probability we have not entirely freed
our results from weighting with fertility ; because, although every endeavour was
made to take only one from each family, it is possible that pairs of sisters have occa-
sionally crept into the record.

(iii.) Table III. gives the result of 1000 cases taken from the Landed Gentry. As
we have already noted, the women recorded are largely “‘heiresses,” and we believed
this might be one of the chief sources of the heterogeneity of the material in Table I.
The conditions of selection were made somewhat more stringent, and were as follows :—
Only one daughter was taken from each family, and her marriage must have lasted at
