A similar reservation must be applied also to the expression for F, but there is here
an additional point worth noticing. It is not often remarked that the form given
tacitly involves an assumption which is derived as an independent result from
discussions based on this special form. In fact it involves the definite assumption
that no work is done by the magnetic forces during the motion of electric charges. Of course the usual expression for such force as proportional to the vector product of
the velocity and magnetic force confirms this assumption, but the derivation of this
expression by dynamical methods from results derived from the present discussion is
by so much deprived of interest. In fact, if to the assumption that these forces do
no work we add the further conditions that they are linear in the magnetic and
velocity vectors, it would appear that their form is completely determined, at least to
a constant factor, without further considerations either of a dynamical or any other
nature.
