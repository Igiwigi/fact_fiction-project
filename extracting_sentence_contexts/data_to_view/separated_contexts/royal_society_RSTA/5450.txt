342 MR. H. TOMLINSON ON THE INFLUENCE OF STRESS AND

decrement of are of torsionally oscillating wires ;* these were followed by a third,
dealing with the effect of magnetisation on the internal friction of iron.t The results
recorded in these memoirs seemed to favour the view adopted by G. WiepEmann, that
the main part of the dissipation of energy met with in a torsional cycle arises from
the permanent rotation of the molecules about their axes, and served as an encourage-
ment to attempt to ascertain how far the dissipation of energy which accompanies
cyclic changes of magnetisation would be amenable to the laws which regulate the
dissipation of energy in torsional cycles. The cyclic changes of magnetisation which
attend on cyclic changes of magnetising force have been studied by Ewrne and
others,t but mainly for comparatively great magnetising forces—for forces, in fact,
far exceeding those for which there seemed any likelihood of any svmple laws holding
good. Lord Raytricu has shown, however,§ that when the magnetising force is sufficiently
minute the ratio of induction to force (permeability) in iron, tends rapidly to a jinite
constant value as the force diminishes, and that the dissipation of energy in any cycle
can be very simply expressed. The author proposed, therefore, to make use of very
feeble magnetising forces, and to render their effects sufficiently evident by very
sensitive arrangements.
