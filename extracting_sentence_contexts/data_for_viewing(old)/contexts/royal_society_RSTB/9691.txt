ized and not innervated. These facts laid the foundation of the
wear and tear hypothesis of cartilage, which has dominated the
view of the arthritis disease for decades, but progress in cell
and molecular biology has now challenged the hypothesis [5].

The word chondrocyte emerged in Dorlands Illustrated
Dictionary in 1903. The chondrocyte is the main cell in cartilage
and is the producer of the matrix components of cartilage [2].
The chondrocyte is surrounded by a territorial and interterri-
torial matrix where the molecular constituents of the cartilage

matrix are laid down into large multimolecular assemblies 3. The treatment of osteoarthritis and
