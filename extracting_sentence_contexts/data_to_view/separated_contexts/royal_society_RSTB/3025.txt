The periodicity of the cestrus in certain of
those animals in the Gardens at Dublin is said to be markedly affected by accom-
modation, heating, and feeding, and can to a certain extent at any rate be regulated. This is comparable to what occurs among other mammals, such as Mares or Sheep
(Harr, 1900, MarsHaut, 1903). Taking all these facts into consideration and
remembering that the moncestrous condition, so far as is known, occurs most commonly
among animals in a state of nature, it may, perhaps, be inferred that this is the more
primitive condition, polycestrum being secondarily acquired not merely within the
limits of the order Carnivora, but in the Mammalia as a whole. *

3.—The Histology of the Uterus during the Cycle. For the purpose of describing the changes through which the non-pregnant uterus
of the Bitch passes, we divide the cestrous cycle into four periods as follows :—
