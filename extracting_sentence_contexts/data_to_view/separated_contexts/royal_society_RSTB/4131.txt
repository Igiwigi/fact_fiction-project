Spivomonas has appeared more often of late
than it did at first. Both of these forms, when present, begin to crop up after three
days. Spivomonas also remains active, in a particular phase, so long as the culture is
moist ; a remarkable fact is that, in spite of all my efforts, I have not yet been able to
find the cysts of this form (one reason for this will be given below). Perhaps the
earliest form to appear is a small heteromastigine type, which I have found after two
days; but it has occurred only seldom. Bodo (Prowazekia) caudatus has occurred
more often, but neither of these types ever dominates the culture, so to put it, in the

3 way that one or more of the other flagellates usually do.
