fication of the coal-deposits and plant-beds of Atanekerdluk (conf. Flora Toss. Arctica,
Pp. T). They show us that there is a considerable succession of sedimentary strata, pierced
by volcanic rocks which form the summits of the mountains. Fossil plants occur in all
the beds, but the siderite and limonite contain them in the greatest abundance and in
the best state of preservation. Tn fact the slabs from these beds are quite covered with
specimens, lying in every direction (7. c. p. 10).

Among the leaves I found two insects, a beetle and one of the Hemiptera. These
must have been inhabitants of dry land, as well as the plants. However, amongst the
latter we find several species which must have grown in marshy or moory ground, viz.
Phragmites, Sparganium, Taxodium, and Menyanthes. These plants indicate a fresh-
water formation, as does also a Cyclas (Plate LIT. fig. 10), the shell of which occurs in
the siderite, and which is undoubtedly a freshwater mollusk. These facts, combined
with the entire absence of marine plants and animals, prove to us that the siderite of
Atanekerdluk is most certainly a freshwater deposit—probably similar in its origin to
the limonite of onr own woods and marshes.

Mr. WurwreR's collection contains fossil plants from two localities on Disco Island,
viz. Ujararsusuk and Kudliset, which is opposite Atanekerdluk and nearly on the same
parallel of latitude. As before, T shall extract from his report and the notes of Mr,
BRowN the portions which bear on the geology of the place.

<& Coal-seams are exposed at a number of points both along the Waigat and on the
coast between Flakkerhuk and Godhayn. Dr. Rixx mentions* five places at which it
is found along these 8hores; there are at least three others, —one spoken of by G1zszckE;
