and were not separated by the origin of the large vessels.
The ventricle situated towards the right side of the body
gave off the aorta ; whilst the pulmonary artery arose from
the left ventricle, which was contiguous to the heart of the
left side. These vessels were united by a ductus arterjosus.
The pulmonary artery, however, was not situated before the
aorta at its origin ; it passed behind the superior part of the
right ventricle, 80 as to get behind the origin of the aorta,
where it was divided into branches, distributed to the lungs of
the right side of the chest. At this point also, the ductus
arteriosus was detached from the pulmonary artery, and fol-
lowing the direction of the aorta upwards, appeared like a
second arch, placed behind the arch of the aorta. In fact, the
arch formedby the ductusarteriosus verynearly resembled that
of the aorta, by sending off a large vessel from its convex side.

From the arch of the aorta the carotid arteries were given
off, as distinct branches, but no axillary artery for the arm of
the right side. This vessel, with the right vertebral, and the
inferior thyroid arteries of the right head, were detached from
the middle of the ductus arteriosus in one trunk, which s0on
divided into three branches. This aorta then descended a
little, and united to its fellow, from the heart of the left side.

I shall pass over the smaller vessels derived from the de-
