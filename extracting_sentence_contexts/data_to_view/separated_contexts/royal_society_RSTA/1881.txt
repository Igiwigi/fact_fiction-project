Fogg in the Physics Department
of the University of Michigan, James was asked to comment on two papers from the University of
Illinois just submitted by B. Smith Hopkins to the Journal of the American Chemical Society, dealing,
respectively, with isolation of element 61 and measurement of its X-ray spectrum [88,89]. The
papers were accepted even though there was in fact no hard evidence for discovery of element
61: values for wavelengths of two L-series X-ray lines of element 61 were listed but none the six
original X-ray plates mentioned in the paper were presented. Instead, we have: ‘In all cases our
lines were faint, indicating that our material is not in a very concentrated form. Our plates have in
all cases been verified by disinterested observers’.
