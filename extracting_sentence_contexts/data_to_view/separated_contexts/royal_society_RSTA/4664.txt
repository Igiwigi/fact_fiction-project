To explain this
geometrically, we consider a point z = (3/4)e, right above the origin. Then the half-space IT, :=
{x - Vu(z) > 0} contains the cone of monotonicity K(9, en). All directional derivatives in directions
v, that go into the half space are of course positive at z, in fact as they go strictly into the half space,

‘This is a consequence of the boundary Harnack inequality.


away from the edge of 7; they become strictly positive at z, proportionally to ¢(|Vu(z)|, where t
is the distance of v to the edge of J7,. On the other hand, if the direction happens to be also in the
cone of monotonicity, it is non-negative everywhere in our domain, say in a cylinder centred at
the origin. Therefore, from Harnack inequality, the directional derivatives that are inside the cone
are not only positive but comparable to ¢|Vu(z)| in, say, half the original cylinder.
