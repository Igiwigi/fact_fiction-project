Any function of the momentum py, must be invariant under this rescaling. This =

feature of spinorial ‘weight’. It is also important to know that, under a Lorentz transformation : re

If desired, the Dirac equation can readily be expressed in terms of 2-spinors, but it becomes
a pair of coupled spinor equations, rather than a single equation. This might seem a loss of
simplicity, but this separation of the electron into left- and right-handed parts is consistent with
its modern interpretation in the standard model. It should also be noted that, when extending
the 2-spinor calculus to general relativity (one of Roger Penrose’s early achievements), there is
no analogue of the 4-spinors.
