centims, of hydrogen at standard tem-
perature and preggure. Profeasor WILLLAMS0N has, from similar motives of utility, adopted an absolute yolume ??
of 11:2 litres, which is the bulk of a gramme of hydrogen, also at standard temperature and pressure. T now
propose to adyanee another step in the game direction, and to substitute the real for the fictitious unit, not for a
special object, alone, or to paye the way for more important theories, but for all the purposes of chemistry. See © Modern Chemistry,” by A. W. Hormanx, 1865, pp. 121 and 130; and « Chemistry for Students,” by
