INTENSITY RELATIONS IN THE SPECTRUM OF HELIUM. 149

In connection with the interpretation of this table, it is necessary to remark, in the
first place, that the actual numbers themselves give no information in the absolute
sense, or in the relative sense down one column, as to the relative intensities of the
three lines in question, for the photographic plate is not equally sensitive in three
regions. But the actual changes in the numbers from one column to another give
decisive information, since the intensity of \5876 is reduced to a uniform scale.
These changes are very small, though quite definite, even taking into consideration
the fact that the numbers are derived from an exponential type of formula, and
they cannot be regarded as within the error of observation and consequent calculation.
To at least a close approximation, however, the relative intensities in the Diffuse
series do not vary with the distance from the cathode.

The small variations which do occur present no striking regularity, and it is evident
that the behaviour of the last three photographs, already stated to be on a different
plate to the others, is not appreciably different in these regions, so that we have
further justification for the supposition that the two sets of photographs are directly
comparable. There is a small amount of evidence in the table, although it is not
decisive, that a slight energy transfer to the longer wave-lengths takes place with
increasing distance from the cathode, but if it be real, it is yet so small as to be a
comparatively unimportant phenomenon. There is no effective transfer of energy
