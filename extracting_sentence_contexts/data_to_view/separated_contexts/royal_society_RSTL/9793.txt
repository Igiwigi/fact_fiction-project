During the stimulation the beats of the base became weaker and more frequent, while
those of the apex were 80 much 8lower that only two beats took place, of which the first corresponded to
twelye beats of the base and the second to eight beats. After the stimulation the original relation hetween

the rhythm of the apex and base was restored, 80 that each apex-contraction again corresponded to four

base-contractions. Curves similar to this are those most frequently obtained with the clamp in this
position,


THE FROG, AND ON THE ACTION OF THE VAGUS NERVE. 1015

These facts alone make it probable that the vagus lowers the excitability of the
musele at one time and increases it at another. Now although this diminution of
excitability occurs at that period of the vagus action when the stimulation of the
nerve is known to cause a diminution of the force of the contractions, yet it is clear
that the connexion between the two is relative and not absolute. As has been seen,
when the contractions are synchronous with the impulses, stimulation of the nerve is
able to reduce the force of the contractions to the vanishing point, and yet up to the
las& moment of visible contractions every impulse is followed by a contraction—4.e., the
excitability does not in this case fall sufhciently, in relation to the strength of the

Q impulses, to prevent the muscle from responding to every impulse, even although the

J contractions become 80 8mall as to be almost invisible.
