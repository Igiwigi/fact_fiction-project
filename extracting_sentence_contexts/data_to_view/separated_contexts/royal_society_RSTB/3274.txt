results entirely support the conclusions previously mentioned in this paper (see
p- 180). Composition of “ Floor Nodule.’—The character and importance of the “ floor
nodule” has already been referred to (p. 180). The details of its chemical analysis
are given in Column VI, Table IV, and it will be seen that it compares very
closely with the average “roof nodule,’ except that the proportion of clayey
matter is unusually high (approaching 9 per cent., 7.¢., more than 40 times that ~
present in the coal ball), a fact, however, which is in complete harmony with its
position in the floor of the seam, where the only plant remains were roots penetrating
the soil. Large Amount of Magnesium Carbonate in * Coal Balls.”—Any hypothesis which
attempts to account for the formation of the coal balls must take into consideration the
magnesium carbonate, which so frequently bulks largely in the substance of the mass
(see Table I). In this respect, Brynzy’s (’68, p. 15) theory fails, for although his
analysis showed a fair percentage of magnesium carbonate, he ignores it in his
theoretical considerations.
