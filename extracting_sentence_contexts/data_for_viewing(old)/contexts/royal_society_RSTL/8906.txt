radial incision half an inch long, made on one side of a freely discharging lithocyst,
7. e. before the circumferential incision was begun at all. But snch extreme variations
upon the side of intolerance of spiral section are as uncommon as are the extreme
variations upon the side of tolerance. Now the fact that between these two extremes
there are to be found all possible grades of tolerance, appears to warrant us in concluding
that the contractile tissue of Aurelia aurita is not of a functionally homogeneous
nature.

And this conclusion is very much strengthened by the additional fact that at
whatever point in a contractile strip which is being progressively elongated by section
the contractile wave becomes blocked, the blocking is sure to take place completely and

Â© exclusively at that point. This fact, it appears to me, can only be properly explained
by supposing that more or less differentiated lines of discharge pervade the contractile
tissue of the gonocalyx, and that the sudden and complete blocking of the contractile
waves which invariably takes place at some determinate point during the progress of
the section is due to the latter having at that point severed some important line of
discharge, which had previously served to convey the influence of the lithocyst to the
undivided parts of the gonocalyx. Nevertheless we must bear in mind that this
deduction is 8upported by no histological evidence, and that it is, moreover, very difficult
to reconcile with the fact that some specimens of Aurelia aurita endure 80 enormous
an amount of the most severe forms of section without suffering loss of physiological
continuity between any of their parts.

The deduction also appears difficult to reconcile with another fact, viz. that in 8ome
