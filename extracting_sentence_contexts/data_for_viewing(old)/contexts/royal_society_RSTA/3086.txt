originate mainly within the detector.

The detectors are extremely difficult to control at this sensitivity level; they have a duty cycle
only around 60-70%, and even when in operation mode their Gaussian data are frequently
interrupted by these glitches. Since the LIGO detection criterion is that an event should be
coincident between the two detectors, the analysis constructs the probability that two randomly
occurring glitches could also be coincident, and could look enough like a binary inspiral to
masquerade as a signal. On that probability scale, we are confident that a ‘glitch event’ as strong
as GW150914 would happen by chance less frequently than once per 203000 years. This is a
probability equivalent to that of 5.lo in Gaussian noise, but of course the glitch coincidence
distribution is not a Gaussian one.

In fact, this is just a lower limit on the significance against glitches. In all of Advanced LIGO’s
data during the first observing run (O1) during which this signal was seen, there were no glitches
at any time in the two detectors that were strong enough to have masqueraded as this signal even
if they had occurred simultaneously, and extrapolating from the glitch distribution suggests that
no such glitch coincidence would have occurred even if the detectors had been operated for a time
equivalent to the age of the Universe! This was, therefore, an exceptionally strong event to have
occurred as the first detection. LIGO would have been confident to have claimed a first detection
for a much weaker event than this one.
