Second Series, a few experiments in which the girders differ most from each other in
Hction, dimensions, and bearing distance; and the results we obtain from the foregoing
firmula are given in the following pages, with the form of section and linear dimen-
-Sons. It will be seen that the value of z, or the direct tensile strength of cast iron,
- obtained, falls generally between the limits of #=14,000 and #=16,000.
In the Reports of the Commissioners for inquiry into the © Application of Iron to
ilway Structures” (page 9, &c.), there are given the results of about fifty experiments
Sn the direct tensile resistance of one-inch square cast-iron bars, under the direction of
Htr. HoDGKINSON ; these consisted of seventeen different kinds of iron, each set of three
Sars being of the like quality and manufacture, and in several of these sets, which one
Hight have expected to yield very nearly the same results, the difference is full as great
"Ss in the following Table, exhibiting in fact very nearly like numbers. This circumstance
ill, it is presumed, be considered satisfactory evidence of the general applicability of the
rinciples developed in the preceding pages to cast-iron beams and girders of every variety
Sf 8ection.
