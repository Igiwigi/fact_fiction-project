For v =0, the two groups do not interact with each other, while v =1 corresponds to random
mixing. In the following, we will assume that 20% of the population belong to the group at risk,
ie. fo = 0.2 and fy =0.8.

In figure 4a,b, we see that, similarly to a homogeneous population, both groups exhibit
recurrent epidemic waves driven by a varying prophylaxis level. Due to the higher infection
cost, the old group shows more intense prophylaxis and thus lower prevalence. In terms of the
temporal evolution, we observe that the elderly population also starts to increase prophylaxis
earlier (dashed lines) as prevalence increases and continues to do so for longer as prevalence
decreases. This is shown in figure 4c. Furthermore, the variation in the prophylaxis level of
the young is more pronounced and thus mainly drives the evolution of the prevalence. As a
consequence, in figure 4d, we observe how the prevalence of the young group increases more
rapidly and spills over to the old group. As a matter of fact, due to the increased prevalence
tolerance caused by a lower infection cost of the young group, the reproduction number among
the old is always below one. Accordingly, prevalence in the old group solely increases due to the
