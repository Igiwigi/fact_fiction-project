Clearly these “static” diffusion rates are the upper limit to any diffusion that
may be assumed to take place while the air is passing, and as they are much greater
than any second vessel loss, such an assumption is not incompatible with the facts. We will therefore assume that in the slow air currents of our experiments diffusion
is still in operation. We are not concerned with back diffusion for éven if such takes
place, it is easy to see that it will not affect the losses sustained.* We will also make
the further assumptions that this “ dynamic ” diffusion is inversely proportional to the
air speed over the range of our experiments, and as already stated, it is proportional to
the vapour pressure.
