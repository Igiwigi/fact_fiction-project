of time, was required to educate a fungus, already a parasite on one particular plant,
to become parasitic on another plant belonging to a family widely separated from
the one on which it was originally parasitic than to train a pure saprophyte to
become a parasite. The only suggestion I can offer on this point is that the obligate
parasite is much more dependent on one particular element for its development
than is the case with a saprophyte. The explanation however, I am afraid, cannot
be considered altogether satisfactory, inasmuch as at least many saprophytes are also
obligate, or, in other *words, are mainly if not entirely met with on one particular
kind of nutritive pabulum.

Tt may be argued that the method of injection described above wounds the host-
plant, and that the fungus grows as a saprophyte on the wounded portion of the
leaf. The fact that the fungus experimented with under such conditions eventually
becomes a parasite, whereas spores of the same fungus sown on leaves of the same
plant, not injected with a chemotactic substance, are not capable of entering the

tissues, proves, I consider, that the injected substance, to which the fungus already
responds, merely serves the purpose of enabling the fungus to become accustomed
by degrees to a new nutritive and chemotactic substance present in the living
tissues of the plant; when this acquirement on the part of the fungus is complete,
parasitism results,
