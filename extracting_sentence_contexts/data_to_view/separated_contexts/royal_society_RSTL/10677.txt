This spectrum is very constant, and 80 far I have found
it in the adrenals of man, dog, cat, rabbit, rat, guinea-pig, ox, and sheep. VULPIAN
has shown that taurocholic acid exists in the medulla,* and other observers have found
products which indicate the existence of an active downward metabolism. Taken in
connexion with my own observations these facts go to prove that the adrenals are organs
which are concerned in the retrogressive metamorphosis of hzmoglobin, and probably
of the pigments described in this paper—the histohzmatins and myohzematin. Hence
if the adrenals are nob in a fi state for the discharge of their functions we may
have pigments present in the circulation which are incompletely metabolized. Now, I
have shown that s8uch is the case, as the urine of Appisox's disease may contain a

pigment which I formerly deseribed under the name of © urohematin,”* which is a
pigment closely related to hzematoporphyrin, and which may also appear in the
urine when the adrenals are healthy if there be an excessive destruction of blood-
corpuscles, as in acute rheumatism ; in 8uch cases there being more effete colouring
matters present than the organs concerned in their further downward metamorphosis
are capable of dealing with.
