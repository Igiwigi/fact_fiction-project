where J(_) denotes the Jacobian of any four of the functions f, fi, fy,f,,ff4 with
respect to the variables specified in the bracket. Of these equations there are thirty,
but since they are given by the elimination of six quantities from twelve equations
only six of the thirty can be independent.

$15. One pair of these auxiliary equations will contain Jacobians of f, fi, fy Ay
and will in fact express the conditions that the equations

dy = pda, + prday
dz = qda, + qn

shall be integrable without restriction when p,, P2, qj, q2 have the values given by
the equations f, = 0 = fi, fg = %, fy = dy

Thus, if a pair of functions fj, f, can be found satisfying these two auxiliary
equations, the solution can be completed by solving a pair of simultaneous ordinary
equations. (See Mayer’s method, Forsytn, ‘ Theory of Differential Equations,’ pp.
