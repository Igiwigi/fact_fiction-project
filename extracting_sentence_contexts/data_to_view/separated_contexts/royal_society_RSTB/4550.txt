Where rupture of the tissues
is apparent, it is not due simply to the structures growing apart ; they are definitely
forced apart (e.g., frontals in Bothus, frontal and prefrontal in Pleuronectoids and
Rhomboids, vomer and ethmoid in Solea). The parasphenoid, the trabecular and
ethmoid cartilages are diverted from their ordinary longitudinal and vertical
directions of growth, not by mutual pressure or internal interference, but by
external forces. In fact, it is impossible to give a satisfactory description of the
asymmetries of the skull without reference to the external pressure and com-
pression. The ordinary course of development provides no motive force or forces
for the disruptive changes we see in the skull of Flat-fishes. Extra-eranially the oblique growth results from tension or strains ; an active force
or factor is discernible.
