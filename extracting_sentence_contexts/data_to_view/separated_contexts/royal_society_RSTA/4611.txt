To
understand these differences, one must realize that inter-annual variability is dependent on the
mean state of the ice pack. We expect, for example, a thinner and less concentrated sea ice cover
to be more responsive to inter-annual variability in the external forcing. This highlights the fact
that even within a stand-alone set-up, tuning a sea ice model to reproduce simultaneously the
mean, trends and inter-annual variability of the main sea ice characteristics is a delicate exercise. Interestingly, we find that the SST_TIME simulation outperforms all other model runs in almost
every single category both in terms of averages and correlations (note that the SFFT14 run is better
at capturing September SIE inter-annual variability). While this result is unsurprising in the sense
that a time-dependent SST from reanalysis captures a large part of the inter-annual variability of
the atmospheric and oceanic forcing as well as of the SIE, it nevertheless highlights once more the
importance of the upper ocean in driving the sea ice response and the coupled nature of the sea
ice-ML system [16,62].
