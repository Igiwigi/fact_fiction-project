1083. On using the thick wire helix (1055.), the same results ensned. Proceeding,
however, upon the known fact that electric currents of great quantity but low inten-
sity, though able to ignite thick wires, cannot produce that effect upon thin ones, I
used a very fine platina wire at z, reducing its diameter until a spark appeared at G
or E, when contact was broken there. A quarter of an inch of snch wire might be
introduced at x without being ignited by the continuance of contact at G or E; but
when contact was broken at either place, this wire became red hot ; proving, by this
method, the production of the induced current at that moment. 1084.
