374-380]. Hypotheses about the underlying causes—such as chemical compositions or
reaction mechanisms—of these sensible properties and their modifications threatened, if
not clearly distinguished from the facts of the matter, to sully objective knowledge with
mere opinion, subtle bias or outright dogma. For Priestley, the fundamental business of



the natural philosopher, and the bedrock of his pneumatic inquiries, consisted of the
heuristic deployment of hypotheses in the proliferation and accumulation of enough facts to
allow, at some future date, the induction of a ‘general theory’ to which they are reduced
[10, vol. 2, p. vii; 18, Part IIL, pp. 153-157].

The distinction tween facts and hypotheses influenced the narrative style of ‘Observations’.
Priestley [30, pp. ii-xx, 576-577; 18, Part 1, pp. 36-39] developed the ‘analytical and historical
style’ of writing in his earlier work in electricity and its history, for which he was elected
a member of the Royal Society in 1766, and he continued to adopt it in all his subsequent
scientific publications. He designed his new style to offset the prevalent ‘synthetic style’ of
presentation, which by assimilating science to the axiomatic theoretical activity of a few men
of genius, such as Isaac Newton, discouraged many people from making discoveries of their
own. Priestley wrote for a scientific community envisioned by his Dissenting interests in
individual liberty, associationist notions of the epistemological equality of all men, and Baconian
principles of the division of labour [31, pp. 132-135]. According to Priestley, discoveries in natural
philosophy depended not on individual moments of illumination in men of genius, but on
the ability to take infinite pains in gathering facts, and could therefore be made by anyone.
Designed to facilitate the inquiries of contemporary and future experimentalists, Priestley’s
