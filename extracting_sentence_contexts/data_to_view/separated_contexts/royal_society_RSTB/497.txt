I have observed the presence of sensory fibres in this in the following way :—
The connections of the ganglion stellatum were cut, with the exception of the white ramus, to the 1st
thoracic nerve and the two limbs of the annulus of Vieussens, the limbs of the annulus of Visussens
were tied, cut, and stimulated near the ganglion stellatum. I have mentioned above that stimulation of the peripheral ends of the spinal nerves
in the spinal canal does not cause any perceptible reflex action, but it can hardly be
doubted that sensory nerves are distributed to the sheaths of tne spinal nerves; and
it may be said that the result shows that, in fact, the electrical stimulation of a few
sensory fibres does produce no perceptible reflex effect. But this argument involves
the assumption that the sheath of each spinal nerve does not receive its sensory
supply through its own posterior root—an assumption which, so far as I know, is
unfounded, and which is at variance with some of the facts upon which the view of
“recurrent sensibility” is founded. Some direct evidence against the view that all the large medullated fibres are fibres
of general sensibility of the sympathetic system, is afforded by comparing the degree
of sensitiveness of different parts of the sympathetic with the number of large fibres
in them. I have taken thus the splanchnics, the homologous nerves running to the
inferior mesenteric ganglion, the hypogastric nerves, the lower lumbar and the sacral
sympathetic trunk, and the lumbar grey rami; and I do not find any satisfactory
correspondence between the readiness with which the nerves give a reflex body move-
ment or variation of blood-pressure and the number of large fibres, or of fibres of
greater diameter than 4 », contained by them.
