As regards the mean daily range of temperature,
whilst all the differences are of one sign, they vary much in size, and the mean from
the 11 years 1890 to 1900 at Kew was smaller than that from either sun-spot
period in (5).

§ 18. In the case of the mean annual temperature, the long-period mean was
intermediate in all three instances between those for the periods of sun-spot maximum
and minimum, and the differences between these two latter means are fairly similar. The existence of a difference between the average mean temperature of years of
sun-spot maximum and minimum is accepted as an established fact in Hawnn’s
‘Climatology.’* According to Hann’s figures the mean excess of temperature in a
period of four sun-spot minimum years over a period of four sun-spot maximum years,
situated relatively to maximum and minimum as in the case of the Falmouth groups
of years, is for a tropical station no less than 0°55 C., the difference between the two

extreme years of an 11-year period amounting to 0°73 C. At an average extra-
tropical station, according to HANN, this latter figure is reduced to 0°54 C. Allowing
tentatively a corresponding reduction on the 0°55 C., it becomes 0°41 C, Thus the
differences recorded in Table XX. are not merely of the normal sign, but even of
somewhat the same order of magnitude as they should be according to Hann at an
average extra-tropical station on the average of a number of sun-spot periods.
