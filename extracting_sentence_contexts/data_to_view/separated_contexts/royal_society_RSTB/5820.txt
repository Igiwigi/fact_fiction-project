perforated spaces, the optic tracts and the crura cerebri exposed to an unusual extent. The row of openings for the basal arteries, lying immediately posterior to the lateral
olfactory tract, is plainly seen; and almost the whole of the orbital surface of the
frontal lobe is exposed to view. The explanation of these facts is seen in the slender
pointed appearance of the temporal poles. The temporal lobes are ill-developed so
that they fail to extend forward and overlap the orbital surface. The orbital surfaces
look narrow and their contour is sharply delimited from the temporal contour by a
