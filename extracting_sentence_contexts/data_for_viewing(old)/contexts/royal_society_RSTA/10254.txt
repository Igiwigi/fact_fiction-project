FIGURE AND STABILITY OF A LIQUID SATELLITE. 241

Tidal friction is a slowly acting cause of instability, and from the point of view of
cosmical evolution the partial stability of Rocue’s ellipsoids is of even greater interest
than the full secular stability of the system.

The limiting stability of Roctn’s liquid satellite is determined by the consideration
that the angular momentum of the system, exclusive of the rotational momentum of
the planet, shall be a minimum. This exclusion of a portion of the momentum of the
whole system corresponds with the fact that we are to disregard the tidal friction of
the planet as a cause of instability. If all possible cases of the liquid satellite be
arranged in order of the corresponding (partial) angular momentum of the system, it
is clear that for given momentum there will in general be two forms of satellite ; but
when the momentum is a minimum the two series coalesce. If then we proceed in
order of increasing momentum, the configuration of minimum is the starting point of
two series of figures; it is a figure of bifurcation, and one of the two series has one
fewer degrees of instability than the other.

One of the two series is continuous with the case of a liquid satellite revolving
orbitally at an infinite distance from its planet, and this is a stable configuration.
Moreover, M. ScuwarzscHiLp has shown* that the whole series of Rocue’s ellipsoids
does not pass through any other form of bifureation. Hence we conclude that of the
