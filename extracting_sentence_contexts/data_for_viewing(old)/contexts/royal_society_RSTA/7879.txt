(j) Gries gives the line 4 3892-321 as 2, 3892-61.

(k) GiuvEs gives an intensity (4) to each of the lines 44 3663-47 (0), 3654-51 (1),

(1) Giiuxs gives an intensity (1) to the line ) 3616-916 (5).

(m) Ivaram lists 2 3939-49 as 2 3939-75.

(n) Gituxs lists 4 4367-1 (00) as 2 4366-91 (3).

(0) Giuixs gives an intensity (1) for the line 4 3899-27 (00) and classifies it as 4s *P, — 4p5P,. In
fact it lies 1-2 em.~! from the position predicted by calculation from these terms, which are well known
from other combinations. No line has been detected at the true position.

(p) A group of faint lines near 4 4100 can be arranged so as to give separations whose ratios approximate

closely to4:3:2:1. On these grounds and on the admittedly inconclusive results given by their measured
Zeeman effects, the lines have been tentatively assigned by Gitues to the transition 4s’ *P — 4p’ 5P
between quintet terms based on an excited § IV core. Since no further support for this identification
has been found, the classifications have not been included in Table II.
