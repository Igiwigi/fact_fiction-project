Larve caught in the surface film never metamorphosed (one apparent exception
recorded on p. 309), they were torn up and destroyed. Many such have been seen. The
tissues showed no signs of breaking down, they were torn purely mechanically and the
worm trunk was never everted. Other larvee from the same culture would metamor-
phose on a sandy bottom.

Contact of the Polygordius larvee with the sides and bottom of the containing vessel
might very well bring about metamorphosis, for we have seen that in Mitraria contact
with solid matter—in its case grit—is necessary. The fact that so many metamorphosed
in the tow-net, as recorded by WoLrEREcK, is strong evidence that contact stimulus
is a natural condition for the metamorphosis to take place. Possibly in the sea Poly-
gordius larvee do not change into worms until they touch the bottom. Therefore the
fact that S6pERsTR6w’s larve in his stirring jar did not metamorphose is not surprising
and is no argument against the naturalness of cataclysmic metamorphosis.

There remains S6pERsTROM’s own theory of the course of the normal Polygordius
metamorphosis to be mentioned. This he conceived as a gradual transformation process
and he gives figures (1924, a, figs. 15-18) of what he believes to be stages in this process.
He obtained these stages from larvee brought in from the plankton and kept in large
