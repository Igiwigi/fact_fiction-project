The above Table shows that with mechanical ventilation, the space per person being
the same :—(1) The carbonic acid was three-fifths, the organic matter one-seventh,
and the micro-organisms (see pp. 96, 97-98) less than one-ninth of what they were
in schools ventilated by ordinary methods. (2) That, notwithstanding this very great
improvement in the purity of the air, the temperature is very considerably higher in
the mechanically ventilated schools. To produce such improvement in purity by the ordinary methods of opening
windows, &c., would have reduced the temperature to a very uncomfortable and
dangerous degree. The improvement is also obtained with comparatively little

* The marked difference between these two classes of schools is shown still more distinctly by the
fact that of the mechanically ventilated schools only two contained more than 26 micro-organisms per
litre, whereas of the naturally ventilated schools only three contained less than 26 per litre.
