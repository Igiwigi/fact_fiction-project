This is
consistent with the study carried out by Thomsen et al. [6], who reported that total damping of
the blade vibrations in the edgewise direction may become negative, with a detrimental impact
on the structural performance of the blade. It is important to note that the occurrence of negative
damping arises from the coupling between the tower and the blades. In fact, the side-to-side
motion of the tower may result in coupling with the in-plane motion of the blade, leading to
an amplification of the oscillations associated with the time-varying dynamics. This is reflected
in time-varying stiffness and time-varying damping, with the possibility of negative damping. The omission of the blade-tower interaction in the model would not allow one to capture this
phenomenon and therefore it could result in an underestimation of the blade response.
