added to those I have named, by referring to the experiments of many other authors
who consider that their favourite theory of contact has been fully established. It is
not, however, my object to advert to these speculations : we have before us certain
facts connected with the action of the voltaic battery ; first contact, or successive
juxtaposition, and simultaneously with it, effects of fension; then the completion of
the circuit, and simultaneously with it, development of chemical action and current ;
but in all these cases contact is first in order, developing tension. BECQUEREL
descrihes it by stating, © When two bodies are in contact the affinities commence
exercising their action before combination takes place.” M. Ds La Rivs, © The elec-
tricity of tension deyeloped by contact of heterogeneous bodies.” PFarapay, © That
the particles of the electrolyte are brought into a polarized state, and raised to a cer-
tain degree of tension, before discharge takes place :” but I am not aware that there
are any experimental facts to prove whether this tension in the voltaic battery, which
itself-is of an opposite character at each terminal, and, as we have seen, can be ex-
alted 80 as to produce discharges in the form of sparks for many weeks' constant du-
ration (16.), is due to the chemical constituents of the battery, or to mere contact of
dissimilar bodies, without reference to their chemical affinities. I was therefore most
anxious to see whether some experiment could not be devised, which would test the
action in a satisfactory manner, and for this purpose I availed myself of an extended
series of GRove's gas battery, described by him in a paper already alluded to (23.)*.

one metal; with fifty series charged with oxygen and hydrogen, it is stated that the
