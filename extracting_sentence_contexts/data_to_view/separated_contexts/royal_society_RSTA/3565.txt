(3) The value of 8V/8A, with a given root mean square value of the superimposed
alternating current, depends not only on the nature of the carbons and on
the frequency of that current, but also on the magnitude of the direct
current, and on the length of the are. * Neer observed the fact that the P.D. fell to a minimum and then rose again, in 1886, but as he used
cored positive carbons only, he did not discover that this form of curve was peculiar to those carbons. + “The Resistance of the Electric Arc,” ‘Phil. Mag.,’ 1896, vol.
