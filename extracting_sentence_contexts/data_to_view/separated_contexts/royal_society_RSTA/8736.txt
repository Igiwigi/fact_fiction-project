If, taking account of
absorption and emission, we proceed to calculate the transmission coefficient by
comparing the calculated brightness distribution with the observed, we shall simply
recover the optical depth predicted by ScHwArRzscHILp’s theory. We may, if we choose,
remove the arbitrariness of an aSsigned photospheric temperature by imposing some other
condition, ¢.g. one based on refraction ; but this again merely has the effect of selecting
some particular layer, and the transmission coefficients are again meaningless. The
point depends on the fact that the law of darkening based on radiative equilibrium
very nearly fits the observed darkening with an absorption coefficient the same for all
wave-lengths and arbitrary in value; hence the true values of the absorption
coefficients can only be determined, if at all, from the discrepancies. If we abandon
purely radiative equilibrium, and ensure thermal equilibrium by allowing some réle
to convection, the case is stronger still; any darkening law then implies not a
temperature and transmission coefficients, but a temperature distribution as a function
of optical depth—again independent of the actual value of the absorption coefficient
(see §5 above). The misunderstandings on the subject of solar absorbing atmospheres have been due
in some measure to a failure to realise that the terrestrial atmosphere offers no analogy.
