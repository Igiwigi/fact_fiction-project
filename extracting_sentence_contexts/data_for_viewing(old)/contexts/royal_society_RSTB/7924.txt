and because kuru is the disease uppermost in people’s
minds in the region, false reports of kuru are common
and require careful attention in epidemiological
surveillance (they are recorded within the ‘redherring’
file of the database as recovery, rejected, reassigned
or relinquished). No true recovery has ever been
documented in a patient showing established signs of
cerebellar ataxia; however, some patients have a long
period of fluctuating illness at the beginning of their
clinical course before settling into progressive, ulti-
mately fatal, cerebellar disease.

The fact that other clinical signs of disease, involving
the brain stem, mid-brain, hypothalamus and cerebral
cortex, are found during the course of kuru is not
surprising considering the extent of the pathological
change at post-mortem. The neuropathology was
initially described by Fowler & Robertson (1959) and 6. TRANSMISSION EXPERIMENTS
