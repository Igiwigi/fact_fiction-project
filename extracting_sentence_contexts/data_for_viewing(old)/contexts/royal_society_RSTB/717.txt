The fresh lumps are brittle, and of a pure white, semi-opaque appearance, as said ;
but the opacity and brittleness may both vary, even in the same lump. When
touched with needles or forceps, the pieces are very apt to slip, and, when a hold is
obtained, to break ; if squeezed between glass plates, they are found to be very slip-
pery and elastic, reminding one of some forms of cartilage or stiff jelly. Consequently
it is not easy to fish out and transfer the floating lumps intact, unless a spoon or
similar instrument is employed. When dried, whether in air or over sulphuric acid
in vacuo, or in absolute alcohol, the volume diminishes considerably, and the shrunken
pieces become opaque and lustreless, and often acquire a yellow tinge; they also
become more brittle or more horny, according to circumstances.

In other cases, when in the stages of early development in the fermenting vessels,
the lumps are softer and more viscous than when fully formed; and, in fact, every
transitional stage can be met with from the condition of a slimy, semi-fluid, soft jelly,
to that of a hard horny mass which breaks like glue or cartilage.

These physical characteristics are dependent on the amount of water present
in the lumps.

Obviously the specific gravity of the fresh pieces will vary according to the amount
of water present, also: I have not examined this point in much detail, but the
following facts may be noted. The lumps fall rapidly in alcohol, in distilled water,
and even in Pasrrur’s solution and other media of high specific gravity. Some idea
of the amount of water contained in the lumps may be derived from the following
observation :—On August 27th, I started a culture in a sterilised soda-water flask.
