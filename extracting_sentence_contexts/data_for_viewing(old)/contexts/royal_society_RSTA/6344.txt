3. Evanescent multipole devices

The objective is to cultivate a region of ‘stillness’ in the vicinity of the origin of the Kirchhoff plate
where the incident wave does not propagate; in theory, within this region, an inclusion may be
situated without inducing a scattered field. We follow the footsteps of Milton and his co-workers
in their ground-breaking work [8-10]; however, as discussed in the problem formulation, here
we are dealing with the fourth-order biharmonic equation instead of the second-order Helmholtz
equation. The presence of the modified Bessel functions in the solution of the biharmonic equation
provides us with additional flexibility. By choosing only the Macdonald functions, Kn, as the
basis for the multi-polar sources and neglecting the Hankel functions, we construct the so-called
evanescent multipole devices. As a result, the analogous treatment of the active exterior cloak for
a thin plate somewhat simplifies. In fact, we only require that the devices cancel the incident wave
Uinc inside a small closed region 2 surrounding the origin, since the constraint of decay at infinity
is automatically satisfied by the nature of the evanescent devices.


We denote the sum of the fields generated by Q evanescent devices located at a distance 4 |
x? =6 from the origin (outside the region 92) by ugey(r,@) and require that ugey = —Winc for
réQ. The desired field may be actualized by taking a linear combination of outgoing waves -s
emanating from the devices’ centres xl,. : xe as : =
