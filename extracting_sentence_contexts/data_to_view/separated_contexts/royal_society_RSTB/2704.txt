The instances cited above have been chosen mainly to illustrate this gradation, to
which I have not seen attention called hitherto.*

That the variability is dependent largely upon climate and food supply can hardly
be doubted, and the Black-faced sheep and the Merinos in different parts of Scotland
and Cape Colony respectively furnish direct evidence that this is the case. On the
other hand, there can be no doubt that the varying degrees of breeding activity are
also in part racial characteristics, as is shown, for example, by the Dorset Horn sheep
of the south of England, and more evidently by the Limestone sheep of Westmoreland
and Derbyshire. But that an increase in the duration (or more frequent recurrence)
of the sexual season is not necessarily a highly artificial condition or the part result
of special attention in regard to food supply, &c., on the part of the flockmaster, is
shown by such a condition occurring normally among the half-wild sheep of Patani.

* From Hxaprâ€™s notes (1900) on the subject it would seem possible that goats and pigs could be made
to illustrate a similar gradation from the moncestrous habit in the natural state to varying degrees of
polyeestrum, under domestication or in captivity, but the facts about these animals are less perfectly
known,
