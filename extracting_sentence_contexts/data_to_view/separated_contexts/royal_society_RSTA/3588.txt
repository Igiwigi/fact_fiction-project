To speak about imagination in that way, however, is
already to identify it as something wider and more fundamental to human function than would
be suggested by typical uses of the word today. In its contemporary, more restrictive sense,
‘imagination’ would belong to the domain of artistic creativity. On that view, a novelist would
be ‘imaginative’ while she is writing her fiction but not, for instance, while she is driving her car. A sculptor would be imaginative in sculpting, but a member of the public would not necessarily
be imaginative in viewing what he had made. By contrast, within the broader philosophical account discussed in this paper, imagination is
not seen as the preserve only of those working in the creative arts.
