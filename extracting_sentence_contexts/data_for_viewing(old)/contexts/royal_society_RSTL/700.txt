At the end of 2 hours, reckoning from the beginning of the
experiment, the temperature of the water was found to be raised
to 1788.

At 2 hours 20 minutes it was at 200*; and at 2 hours go mi-
nutes it ACTUALLY BOILED !

It would be difficult to describe the surprise and astonish-
ment expressed in the countenances of the by-standers, on
Seeing 80 large a quantity of cold water heated, and actually
made to boil, without any fire.

Though there was, in fact, nothing that could justly be con-
sidered as surprising in this event, yet I acknowledge fairly
that it afforded me a degree of childish pleasure, which, were I
ambitious of the reputation of a grave philosopher, I ought most
certainly rather to hide than to discover.

The quantity of heat excited and accumulated in this expe-
riment was very considerable; for, not only the water in the
box, but also the box itself, (which weighed 1521b.) and the
hollow metallic cylinder, and that part of the iron bar which,
being situated within the cavity of the box, was immersed in
the water, were heated 150 degrees of FAHRENHEIT'S Scale;
viz. from 60* (which was the temperature of the water, and of
