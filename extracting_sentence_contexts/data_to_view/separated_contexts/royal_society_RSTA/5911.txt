Ramax is then a good proxy for the Rayleigh number based on the temperature drop between the


bottom boundary and the bulk of the fluid (the latter definition for the Rayleigh number being the
one used in previous experimental and numerical studies of this system, see [12,14,15]). Another
desirable feature of Ramax and Numax is that, up to factors of two, they reduce to the standard
definitions of the Rayleigh and Nusselt numbers when applied to the canonical fixed-temperature
Rayleigh-Bénard set-up. In the following, we derive upper bounds on Nu in terms of Ra, but we stress the fact that all
these bounds carry over to Numax and Ramax. Indeed, from the definition (6?) = So 62dz, we obtain
(6?) < maxz<[0,1}{02}, hence

Ra<Ramax and Numax < Nu. (2.12)

The upper bounds derived in the following are typically of the form Nu <c x Ra’, with y a
positive exponent and c a prefactor. From the inequalities (2.12), one immediately obtains that
these bounds carry over in terms of Ramax and Numax, ie.
