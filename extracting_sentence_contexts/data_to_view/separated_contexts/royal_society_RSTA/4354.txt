Adapted from [5]. While low cross-talk and zero net DMGD are aspirational targets in terms of reducing
the computational cost of MIMO processing, the optimum fibre parameters are likely to be
defined in practice by other considerations. Indeed, many contend that since MIMO processing
is almost unavoidable, the optics should be designed to take most advantage of this fact both
in terms of offering new opportunities for low-loss spatial channel multiplexing, for example,
allowing the use of photonic lanterns which naturally excite orthogonal groups of modes rather
than distinct modes for use as spatial channels [37], and to reduce the effects of intermodal
dispersion/gain/loss to maximum benefit. For example, for a system exhibiting weak mode-
coupling then a given data symbol carried by multiple modes with different group indices
will spread in time linearly with fibre length. However, if we use a fibre exhibiting strong
mode-coupling, the temporal spread follows a random-walk process and this will scale with
the square-root of fibre length [38].
