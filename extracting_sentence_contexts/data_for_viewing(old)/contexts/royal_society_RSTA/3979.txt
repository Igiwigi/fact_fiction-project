n expansion coefficient tensors, which, in turn, can be identified as the hydrodynamic moments 1S
(or a combination of those), e.g. a =p, a = pu, a? =P + p(uu — c36), where p is the fluid
density, u is the fluid velocity, P is the momentum flux tensor, cs is the speed of sound and 6 is
the Kronecker delta. In equation (2.1), we took advantage of the orthonormality of the Hermite
polynomials to truncate the series at the order N: the complete and the truncated distributions
have the same leading N velocity moments [24].

Starting from this common ground, the two mapping schemes can be established (see also
figure 1a for a schematic representation of the schemes). In particular, the projection step (DSMC >
LBM) allows one to project the DSMC hydrodynamic moments (fine level of description) onto the
LBM discrete distributions (coarse level of description). In correspondence of the overlapping
region, where both descriptions are accessible, the coefficients a” in equation (2.1) are computed
using the DSMC moments. In fact, because the distribution fN (x, &, f) is completely and uniquely
determined by its values at a set of discrete velocities, one has

where wy and &, are the weights and abscissae of a Gauss quadrature of algebraic precision of
degree >2N and q is the total number of discrete velocities. From inspection of equation (2.2)
and taking into account the classical procedure in which moments are computed in LBM, we
immediately see that the non-equilibrium discrete distributions to be supplemented to the LBM
at the coupling nodes are the scaled values of the continuous distribution function evaluated at
the quadrature abscissae,
