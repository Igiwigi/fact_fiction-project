This is due to the
fact that the loss of particles to the settled bed, which should decrease solid per cent, is almost
balanced by the reduction in the mobile volume that contains crystals. For example, in figures 1
and 2, the mobile volume is between the horizontal yellow line and the settled bed, and the
solid volume per cent stays nearly constant in that region. The fact that the solid per cent does
not change markedly as the simulations proceed suggests that there is a local self-similarity or
qualitative stationary state in the average mass per cent. The R value provides a global metric of the clustering in the system but does not provide
information on cluster size when clustering is present. To obtain more information about the
particle distributions we will use what are called Ripleyâ€™s K(r), L(r) and g(r) functions [80,81]; the
reader is directed to [66] for a more complete presentation.
