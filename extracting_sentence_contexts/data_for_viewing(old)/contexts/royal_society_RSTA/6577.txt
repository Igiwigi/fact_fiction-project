considerably greater when the vibrations are 8 in 16 seconds than eight times the
increase of logarithmic decrement when the vibrations are 1 in 16 seconds.

{Added Sept. 29th, 1887.—Experiment III. has shown that there is a definite
frequency of reversal of magnetising stress for which the damping effect is a
maximum, and it appeared to be of interest to ascertain more exactly what is the
frequency producing the greatest effect with the particular wire examined, and also

* See Experiments IT. and III.

+ The clockwork arrangement must have interrupted the current at least ten times in one second.
{Later experiments showed that the diminution of the effect of an interrupted magnetic stress as the
interruption-frequency increased arose from the fact that the difference between the vibration-frequency
of the wire and that of the interruptions increased. |

} The increases of the logarithmic decrement are ‘00346 and ‘00024 in the two cases respectively.
[September 25, 1887.—It was afterwards found that the results of Experiment III. are to be attributed
almost entirely to differences between the vibration-frequency of the wire and the interruption-

frequency. }
