longitudinal course on directly entering the anterior white columns.

But besides the transverse bundles which form the anterior roots, a continuous
system of exceedingly fine transverse fibres may be seen to issue from the anterior
grey substance. They pass through, nearly all at right angles to, the anterior white
columns, and disappear as they proceed towards the surface of the chord ; but as
many of them may be observed to turn round and take a longitudinal direction, it is
probable that at the points where they disappear they all follow the same course.
Within the grey substance they wind about and are gradually lost, mingling with
the fibres of the anterior roots, and with those proceeding from the fine bundles of
the posterior roots, which, perhaps, are continuous with them.

It may then, I think, be fairly laid down as a well-established fact, that nearly all,
if not the whole of, the fibres composing the roots of the spinal nerves, after passing
through the anterior and posterior white columns of the chord, proceed at once to
its grey substance; and that if any of them ascend directly to the brain, it must be
those only of the posterior roots which run longitudinally in the posterior columns.

That many excellent observers, with inferior means of observation, have arrived at
a different conclusion on this extremely difficult subject, is not at all surprising.
The opinions of Mr. Graincen are expressed in the following quotations from his
excellent work on the spinal chord :â€”* After the two roots have perforated the
theea vertebralis, and s0 reached the surface of the chord, it is well known that their
fibres begin to separate from each other ; of these fibres some are lost in the white
