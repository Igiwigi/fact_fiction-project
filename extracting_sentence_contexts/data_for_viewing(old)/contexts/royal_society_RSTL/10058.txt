DR. H. WATNEY ON THE MINUTE ANATOMY OF THE THYMUS. 1079

- The follicles, except in earliesb embryonic life, are composed of two parts, a cortex
and medulla, which, as we shall see, differ very materially in stracture. The difference
between the two parts can be seen by the naked eye in a thymus which has been left
for two or three weeks in bichromate of potash or monochromate of ammonia. Tn
8ections made from hardened tissnes and stained in hematoxylin, this difference is
easily seen (see Plate 83, figs. 1,2; and Plate 84, fig. 3), and depends on two main
facts : the first, tha the concentric corpuscles, the giant cells, the granular cells, the
numerous endothelial connective-tissue-corpuscles (together with the large vessels and
fibrous-tissne met with in certain states of involution) are found, with few exceptions,
â€” in the medulla, and that therefore there are necessarily much fewer lymphoid corpuscles
Sin that part of the follicle ; the second fact is, that the reticulum is but rarely met with
2in the medulla, while it 8urrounds nearly every lymphoid corpuscle in the cortex ; and
Sthe preponderating presence of these two deeply staining bodies, the lymphoid corpuscles
Sand the nodal points of the reticulum, causes the cortex to asxume a much darker and
Sbluer colour in Preparations stained by logwood. In some follicles there are seen to be
two or even three medullary portions (se Plate 83, fig. 1, c).
& The follicles are sometimes united by cortical-tissue (se Plate 83, figs. 1 and 2, a),
Sand at other times by medullary-tissne (se Plate 88, figs. 1, 2; and Plate 84, fig. 3, b).
ZThese follicles, when united by medullary-tissue, may sometimes be spoken of as com-
Zpound follicles (se Plate 84, fig. 3, b).
.2 It will be noticed thab processes of the connective-tissue penetrate the follicle in a
Sradiating manner (se Plate 83, figs. 1 and 2, ct). These processes often contain
Somewhat large vessels (See Plate 85, fig. 6, V'), and thus the medulla is in contact
