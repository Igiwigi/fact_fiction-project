warp direction shows more of a progression in failure of the material as shown in figure 14b and
deviations from linearity occur relatively early in the loading regime. However, due to the fact
that different fibre tows will have different stresses at the same externally applied displacement
indicates that the carbon may fail earlier than the glass and the failure envelope is progressive due
to the hybrid materials before two-piece failure. Numerical predictions using the two-scale multi-
scale method showed excellent agreement with experimental data for in-plane elastic moduli in
both the weft and warp directions for the idealized perfect geometry without any imperfections
(model I). After including the in situ geometrical imperfections and the fibre crookedness in the
FE model (model II), the predicted elastic moduli reduced the respective model I values (e.g.
warp-directional modulus 34.12 GPa and weft-directional modulus 39.95 GPa) by only 2.2% in
the warp and 2.3% in the weft directions. As we can see, there is a reduction in stiffness after
including the geometric imperfections. For this hybrid configuration, the weft direction is stiffer
than the warp direction due to the fact that there is one additional glass fibre tow layer in the weft
direction, as summarized in table 7.

The weft direction tensile strength was found to be 467.61 MPa and the warp direction strength
was 446.81 MPa, as reported in table 8 for model I; the former is 4.7% larger due to a 5.8% higher
