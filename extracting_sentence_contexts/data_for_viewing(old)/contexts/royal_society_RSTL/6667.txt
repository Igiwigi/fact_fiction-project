Morphological Conelusions respecting the Vomer, Ethmoid, and Intermazillaries
in Mammals.

I had desired that this paper should be as strictly observational and as little theore-
tical or controversial in its character as might be; but I find it is impossible, now that
T have arrived at this point, to refrain from indicating in what direction the obserya-
tions just made appear to tend. I am conscious that by entering on this theme I render
myself liable to the charge of presumption, in asking to be heard upon matters which
have been discussed by the greatest authorities. My excuse is, that it is the observa-
tional part of my subject which compels me into the theoretical: and in venturing an
opinion upon certain segments of the skull, I shall endeavour to limit myself as much
as possible to what seem to me to be deductions to which the facts diseussed inevitably
lead; facts, s0me of them at least, not hitherto known, or not previously collated, and
therefore not till now at the disposal of the theorist ; but a knowledge of which, I can-
not help thinking, is indispensable to the just conception of the segments to which they
relate.

I gladly embrace this opportunity of acknowledging my obligations to Professor
Goops1R for the use of books and specimens placed at my disposal, and for yaluable
information bearing upon topics treated of in this paper; and if, for the reason just
mentioned, I haye taken it upon me to adopt conclusions differing from his in certain
details (although not more than from those of others), I do not forget that to him
entirely I owe my morphological training ; nor am I the less sensible of the advantage
which I have enjoyed in being frequently indoctrinated by him in those great principles
