uncombined, and from its being necessary to depend, to a certain extent, on
the fidelity of the patient as to their source.

Dr. VexaBLes has kindly allowed me the inspection of his specimens, which
bear some resemblance (though they are mach more minute, and are of an
amber tinge,) to those which I have mentioned as coming under my own view ;
and he has stated in a letter to me, that in one instance, after carefully
filtering and putting aside for a fortnight, a portion of the urine from which

inside of the glass studded, in two or three places, with minate erystals of
sllex, strongly resembling those which were thrown down by the urine. The
precise modes in which silex is capable of being held in solution, have not all
of them been distinetly ascertained; but this fact bears a considerable analogy
to the deposition of regular crystals of rock crystal, from solations of silex in
fluoric acid, or in alkalis, after such solutions have been put aside for a consi-

I have not much to add to the statistical obseryations which I made in my

* former communication. I may remark, however, that it appears, from infor-
