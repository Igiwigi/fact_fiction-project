In
Plate 45 I give photographs of three of these brains. In all my specimens the following
points may be seen :—

The Sylvian angle is less small (average 31-5°) and the superior temporal convolution
in all cases has a distinct frontal curve, though less so than in distinct brachycephalics. Corresponding with these facts the temporal lobe is somewhat larger in dorso-ventral
dimension and its fissuration tending more to transverse fissuration than in the Chinese. Concerning the Rolandic angle (average 64°) I should not like to make any statements. The rounder form of the frontal lobe as compared to the Chinese is evident on first
sight in all my eight specimens ; it may be more emphasised by connecting the temporal
perpendicular, where it intersects the dorsomedial edge of the brain, with the most
frontal point of the frontal lobe.
