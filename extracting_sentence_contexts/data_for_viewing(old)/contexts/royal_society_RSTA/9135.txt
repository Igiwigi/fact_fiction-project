intensity of radiation scattered around such a primary beam,f

2, Polarization of the scattered X-radiation, proceeding in a direction perpendicular
to that of propagation of the primary radiation{ (such as is shown in light
scattered from the sky), and

3. The close agreement between wide limits, of the theoretical and experimental
distribution of radiation scattered in a plane containing the direction of pro-
pagation of the primary beam,$

are inexplicable except on the transverse wave theory.

These experimental results were, in fact, looked for as necessarily following from
such a theory. Similar results may, however, be obtained by transverse waves along
strings or flexible tubes. An arrangement of flexible tubes may be used in lecture
demonstrations illustrating mechanical phenomena exactly analogous to the three
above-mentioned X-radiation phenomena.
