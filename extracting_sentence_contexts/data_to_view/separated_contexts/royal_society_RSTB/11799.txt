Consider the classic case of a verb like regret in (51) when com-
pared with dream in (52). In addition to their more overt
meanings (disappointment and dreaming, respectively), both
verbs take propositions like he smoked as complements, but
the status they give to their propositions is distinct. The verb
regret requires its proposition to be a fact, something true of
the real world, while dream has no such requirement. Saying
(51) assumed the proposition he smoked to be true. Therefore,
we say that regret is a factive verb.

(51) Sam regrets that he smoked.
