The form of the preceding expressions is not affected however, for the ap-
proximation may be carried s0 that except in the case of commensurability
above mentioned, the mean motion of rotation being also nearly twice the
mean motion of the planet 71 in its orbit or greater,

n = constant + series of cosines without any constant quantity multi-
plied by the time.
c = constant + series of sines or cosines without any constant quantity
multiplied by the time.
@ = constant + series of cosines without any constant quantity multi-
plied by the time.

plied by the time.
wo = constant + series of sines + a constant quantity multiplied by the
time.
@ = constant + series of sines + a constant quantity multiplied by the
time. The constant quantity multiplied by the time in the value of 4, is the pre-
cession of the equinox. If = 0, (which amounts to taking for the fixed plane the orbit of the
