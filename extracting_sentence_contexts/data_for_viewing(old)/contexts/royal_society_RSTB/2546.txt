conveniently be used in the cases where the central cylinder of the adult no longer
presents the more primitive tubular condition,

The facts described in an earlier part of this memoir in the case of the Osmundace
and Polypodiaceze seem to leave little room for doubt, that the siphonostelic type
of central cylinder with internal phloem may give rise by reduction to a modi-
fication not distinguishable in any way from the medullated monostelie type of
Van TizcuEM. It seems reasonable on that account to derive the siphonostelic central
cylinder without internal phloem (.e., the medullated monostelic type of Van TrecHEM
and SrrAsBuRGER) from the condition with internal phloem, until some definite
evidence from development, anatomy, or phylogeny, is forthcoming to show that it
is originated in some other way. This hypothesis appears further to have the
advantage of affording a single explanation for a large number of facts, e.g., the
peculiar anatomical structure of Lyginodendron, as well as that of the lower
Gymnosperms, and also the peculiarities of sporelings and seedlings of the Marat-
tiaceze, Ophioglossacexe, Equisetaceze, Dicotyledons, and Monocotyledons.

Boobie (op. cit., p. 403) has recently made some novel and interesting theoreti-
cal suggestions in connection with his work on the Schizeaces. After criticising
the anatomical views advanced by the writer in an earlier memoir on the anatomy of
the Angiosperms, he states his opinion that the monostelic, medullated monostelic,
solenostelic, and dialystelic types of Van TrecHem are all reducible to one. He
regards the cauline fibro-vascular system as morphologically always circular in outline,
and the pith, where present, as always part of the stelar tissues, irrespective of the
distribution of the endodermal sheaths. He reaches this conclusion by extending
