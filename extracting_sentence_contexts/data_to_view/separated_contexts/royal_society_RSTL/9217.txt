The
regemblance in appearance is most striking. Tn the luminous shells which we have
Jusb deseribed there is the sxme convex bright outline pointing towards the negative
terminal, and the game hazy blue ill-defined hollow surface turned towards the shell
immediately behind or on the side towards the positive terminal of the tube, and there
are the game dark intervals dividing consecutive shells as divide consecutive striz. In
fact, this segmented discharge presents to us all the familiar phenomena of striated
discharges in which the strize have rounded or conical forms. Moreover, the conical is
not the only type of striz which can be successfully produced in this manner. Tt is
equally possible to form flat or annular strizz by proper adjustments of the air-spark
interval, as explained in page 192.
