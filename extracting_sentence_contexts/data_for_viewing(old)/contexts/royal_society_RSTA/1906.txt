of fission of a volatile chloride formed by interaction with ZrCly, thus placing the element at the
start of a new transition series underneath Hf. A competing claim came in 1969 from a team at the
University of California, Berkeley, who prepared En 104 through the reaction 3a CEC, 4n)ip7 104
and correlated the «-decay of the new isotope with the known decay pattern of the daughter
product 743No [6]. Writing in 1973, Bemis et al. noted that ‘the best evidence for the identification
of a new element is the observation of characteristic K- or L-series X-rays, as first used by
Harry, since the energies of these X-rays are directly connected to the atomic number of the
element’ [147]. These authors exploited the coincidence approach discussed above to show that
the characteristic Ka, X-rays of 733No could be detected in coincidence with a-particles in an
energy range between 8.5 and 9.1 MeV (figure 12) [147]. This established that the parent nucleus
must have atomic number 104. After many years of argument over precedence for the discovery,
element 104 was eventually ratified by IUPAC in 1997 and given the name rutherfordium (Rf),
a fitting tribute to the fact that Rutherford was the first to observe X-ray emission associated
with nuclear decay. This approach was extended in 1977 to measure L-shell X-ray spectra of the
A = 256 isotope of the last actinide 72$Lr in coincidence with a-decay of element 105 produced in
the reaction 3CEISN, 4n)762105, [148]. Element 105 was ratified as dubnium (Db), also in 1997.
