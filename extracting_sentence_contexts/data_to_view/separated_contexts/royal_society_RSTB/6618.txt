having been heavily eroded before the extrusion of the latter. This fact seems to indicate
a considerable lapse of time during which subaerial weathering was taking place, and
this may well have been during the Chelleo-Acheulian retreat of the lake. The
Mollusca recovered from the underlying deposits include only three species, but none
of these is known from other fossiliferous horizons of early Middle Pleistocene or
later age in the lake Rudolf Basin, and it suggests that the Gaza Beds are of still earlier
age. Finally, two of the three species of Mollusca from Gaza are identical with Kaiso
forms from Lake Albert and Lake Edward.
