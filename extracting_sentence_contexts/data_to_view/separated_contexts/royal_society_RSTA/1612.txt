The
proof of theorem 4.1 shows that all eigenvalues in (0,4 — tg) are points of global bifurcation
in (—0o, t — tg) x D(St) for the equation S;u + N(u) + (uv) =Au and that these are the only
bifurcation points in that interval. More precisely, from theorem 3.8 it follows that, if the
component associated with an eigenvalue yw in (0,4 — tg) does not have one of the properties
(a) and (b), then it contains a point (4,0) where A # w is another eigenvalue of S; in (0, 4 — tg). In
fact, this third possibility does not occur but excluding it requires a study of the nodal properties
of solutions. These issues are treated in [18] where (4.1) is replaced by the more general form
studied in [5]. The discussion of problem (4.4) in the next section provides an example of what is
involved.
