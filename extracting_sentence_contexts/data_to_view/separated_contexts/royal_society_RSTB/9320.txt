A much
smaller proportion of the materials examined in the laboratory
(5%) end up in court [21]. If one can expect trace evidence
materials to only form a small part of the totality of the forensic
materials collected at the start of the process, it is not hard to
understand why managers and policy-makers have recently,
and increasingly, asked whether maintaining a full service
trace evidence laboratory was justifiable [23]. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the interpret-
ation of trace evidence is generally challenging and may
require significant training and R&D capacity to generate the
required knowledge base, develop and maintain databases to
better assess the relevance of the transferred material and
sometimes perform experiments re-enacting the context to
clarify points of contention. Additional confusion is created
