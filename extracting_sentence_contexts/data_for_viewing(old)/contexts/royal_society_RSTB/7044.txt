a thick liquid when the cancer was opened. In extreme cases this liquid made up almost
the entire volume of the cancer, leaving only a thin rind of carcinomatous cells, and
occasionally, during widespread necrosis, the capillaries broke down to add their blood
contents to the degenerating central pool. Both cell necrosis and cell division were always
common throughout the whole cell mass, but it was a general rule for mitotic activity to
be greatest in the outermost zone of healthy cells (figure 36, plate 33). It was noticed that
in the fatty hypodermal connective tissue immediately surrounding the growth there were
occasional signs of mitotic activity. This activity, however, was very slight, and in no way
approached that seen after wounding.

As the structure of each cancer varied so greatly from healthy to dead tissue, it followed
that there were also marked local variations in the rate of cell division. The difficulties
which this fact presented to a comparative study of mitotic activity were overcome by
surveying the whole structure of each cancer sectioned, and choosing the most healthy
and mitotically active regions within it. The mitosis counts, recorded below, were then
made exclusively in these active regions on unit section areas of 0-01 sq.mm. The figures
obtained in this way show that the rate of cell division bore no relationship to the oestrous
cycle. Within the limits of individual variation and experimental error, mitotic activity
remained constant and high (figure 10).
