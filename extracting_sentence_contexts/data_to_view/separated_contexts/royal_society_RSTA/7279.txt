6. ‘SHORT AND ‘LONG’ WHISTLERS

It was stated earlier that while some whistlers definitely follow atmospheric clicks, others
do not. Measurements of the dispersions of the whistlers have been made at times when
both types could be heard, and have established that the whistlers which are accompanied
by clicks are consistently about twice as much dispersed as those with no clicks. This fact is
illustrated by figures 4 and 5.
