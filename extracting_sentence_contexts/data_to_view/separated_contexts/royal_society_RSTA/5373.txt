mathematician) were carried out by physicists on specific varieties to test mirror
symmetry, but the degree of generality is still not clear. There are nevertheless
some rigorous theorems exhibiting the presence of mirror symmetry for large
classes of manifolds, especially in the so-called toric case. In fact, there does seem to operate some sort of complementarity (in the
spirit of Niels Bohr) that makes it difficult to combine physical intuition with
mathematical rigour. The mathematical proofs of conjectures often proceed
not by making the physical intuition more precise, but by taking completely
alternative routes, familiar to mathematicians but foreign to physicists. Recent ideas from quantum gravity and string theory challenge the
fundamental concepts of geometry at an even deeper level.
