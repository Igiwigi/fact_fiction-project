However, the
impact on autonomic functioning is less pronounced than for A3-phases. Additionally, our GC analysis reveals a significant difference in the PWA — £ interaction
during CAP periods with predominantly A3-phases than during non-CAP periods. This could
potentially be a result of the fact that spontaneous arousals show cardiovascular activation prior
to the first signs of arousal in the EEG [51,52]. Such an increase in cardiovascular activity can be
caused by external perturbations as CAP can be triggered by external conditions [17]. On the other
hand, as a high percentage of arousals are preceded by slow waves such as K-complexes [53],
ASDA arousals do not take into account the slow element of the double EEG activation (slow and
rapid) that is typical in NREM sleep [54].
