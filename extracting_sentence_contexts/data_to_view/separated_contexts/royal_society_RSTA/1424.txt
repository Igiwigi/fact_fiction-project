To obtain a first approximation to the
A’s, the former are neglected pro tem. and the equations solved in the straightforward
way, introducing at the correct stage the equation of condition,

ZA, = 0,
Co
1.€.,

A, +A,+A;+A, = 0. This expresses the fact that the 0 end of the final graph is to be brought down to the
zero line. [The C, calibrations which have involved the point 0 are Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.]
Having obtained the six first approximations to A, ...
