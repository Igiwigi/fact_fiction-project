From this diversity of thickness, and from the unequal action of
the heat of the furnace, too great an irregularity had prevailed in
the refrigeration of the glass, to permit its attainment of a ho-
mogeneous texture. These circumstances might probably have
been counteracted by better devised precautions ; but the ine-
quality of the product is not to be regretted, since it has for-
tuitously disclosed some very singular peculiarities, in the

arrangement of bodies passing from a vitreous to a stony state,
which might have remained unobserved, if the desired homo-
geneity of the result had been obtained. Lshall now endeavour
to describe the various products of this operation; and I shall
also submit to your consideration, some remarks which appear
to me to arise naturally from the phenomena I have observed;
premising that, except where my opinions are supported by the
unequivocal demonstration of facts, I offer them with the utmost
deference to the decision of more experienced and judicious
mineralogists and geologists. It may be proper to give a concise description of rowley rag
itself, before I consider the products which it yields by igneous
fusion. This species of basalt is fine-grained, of a confused
crystallized texture; its fracture uneven in small pieces, con-
choidal in large pieces.
