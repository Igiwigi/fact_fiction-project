Instead, the legal effect creates ‘institutional facts’,
such as ownership, contract and human rights. Legal effect means that certain acts ‘count as’ or
‘qualify as’, for example, murder or personal data processing. Institutional legal facts are based
on the performative nature of speech acts and notably of legal text. In that sense modern, positive
law is based on text—it is a text-driven law. Modern law is the set of rules and principles that determine positive law; they establish
what ‘counts as’ or ‘qualifies as’ a violation of a legal norm or a legal right.
