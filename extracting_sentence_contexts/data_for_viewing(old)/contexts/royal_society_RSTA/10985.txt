flattened grains to the areas of perfectly granulated material. Minute lines of
granulated calcite first appear along directions of intense twisting in the mosaic, then
these become more numerous, and finally the complete breaking down of the mosaic
into finely granulated material, filled with twisted remnants of the calcite grains, can
be seen. The question of time does not seem to play any important part in the
character of the deformation, The structure of the marble deformed in 64 days
is essentially the same in character as that which was deformed to the same
extent in 10 minutes. In both cases the lines of cataclastic structure and the
intervening areas composed of flattened grains are found. It seems probable, how-
ever, from a study of the thin sections, that very rapid deformation tends to render
the former structure more pronounced and more abundant, and as the granulated
calcite is apparently the weakest portion of the mass, in this way to make the rock
which is rapidly deformed weaker, as it is shown to be by the tests. The fact that
the twinning and other structures above described are not developed in the cones
proves that they are not produced by statical pressure or cubic compression, but that
they are developed only when actual movement takes place in the mass,

In one experiment, of which a photograph is given in Plate 23, fig. 6, under the
pressure of the two pistons, the marble was deformed as above described, causing the
enclosing tube to bulge in a marked manner, and the pressure being continued, the
enclosed marble tore the wrought-iron tube apart, developing a ragged rent across the
fibres of the iron in a vertical direction, and commenced to fall out of the rent in the
form of a fine white powder. On removing the pressure and milling open the tube,
the remaining marble was found to be still firm and compact, except in the vicinity of
the rent, where it was pulverulent.
