O. FisHer very justly remarks that the more rapid contraction of the
internal than the external strata would cause a wrinkling of the surface, although he
does not admit that this can be the sole cause of geological distortion. The fact that
the region of maximum rate of cooling is so near to the surface recalls the interesting
series of experiments recently made by M. Favre (‘ Nature,’ vol. 19, p. 108), where
all the phenomena of geological contortion were reproduced in a layer of clay placed
on a stretched india-rubber membrane, which was afterwards allowed to contract. Does it not seem possible that Mr.
