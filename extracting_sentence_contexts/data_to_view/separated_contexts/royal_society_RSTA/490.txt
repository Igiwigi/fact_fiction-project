The fracture strength and elastic
modulus of transversal samples were found to be 95 + 7 MPa and 56 + 7 GPa, respectively. These

are significantly higher than the fracture strength (69 + 20 MPa) and elastic modulus (35 + 6 GPa)
obtained from the longitudinal samples. Bechtle [9] explained the superior mechanical properties

of transversal samples based on the fact that the inner enamel is involved in the fracture process

from the beginning so that some prisms and ipm layers are broken during the entire fracture

process. Comparing the strength and elastic modulus of bulk enamel with bulk HAP, the values

of the former are slightly lower, and this can be attributed to the presence of proteins in enamel. However, there is a one order of magnitude reduction in the fracture strength from the crystallite

level of approximately 1000 MPa to the bulk enamel of approximately 100 MPa.
