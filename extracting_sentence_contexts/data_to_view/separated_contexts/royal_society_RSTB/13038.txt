The last panel on the bottom right
summarizes the results using a larger vertical scale to reveal the increase and the ultimate saturation of the fraction of groups of size 22/2 = 11.

fraction of groups of size N/2 saturate is found to be essen- blue lines and symbols). Interestingly, most participants
tially independent of the density, and k,.Â¢ grows linearly probably had the intuition that ultimately regrouping in
with the number of pedestrians k,a:N/3 (figure 10). This two distinct groups would facilitate the colour separation
linear relation can be understood by the fact that for a process. Yet, it was only once they were specifically instruc-
given value of k, groups of size (k + 1)/2+1~k/2 are stabil- ted to do so, and hence when they knew that the other

separation), the smaller group is necessarily of size smaller able to exploit this strategy.
