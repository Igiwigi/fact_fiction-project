was documented that sleep is associated with a 60% increase
in the brain interstitial space allowing for convection of cere-
brospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid to clear neurotoxic
metabolites that presumably accumulated during waking
time [69]. This study is corroborated by a human sleep depri-
vation study of CSF levels of amyloid protein, revealing that
sleep-deprived normal subjects have higher levels of amyloid
protein in their CSF [70]. These observations collectively
account for an inverse relationship between body mass and

ments that have been performed to slow down metabolism = &
appear to provide some supportive evidence for a role of
metabolism in tumorigenesis. In fact, processes that curb
metabolism appear to prolong the lifespan of experimental
animals and diminish cancer incidence [72]. Caloric restric-
tion from yeast to mice has been clearly linked to
prolongation of lifespan and decreased tumorigenesis in cer-
tain cancer models [73]. Although the basis for the effects of
caloric restriction in cancer is complex, an effect on cellular
metabolism has been implicated. Inhibition of mTOR through
the use of rapamycin or genetic deletion is associated with
prolonged lifespan in mice [74,75]. It stands to reason that
since mTOR is essential for anabolic metabolism, diminished
mTOR signalling would decrease cellular energy expenditure
and tumorigenesis [75]. Indeed, genetic knockout of
