Porncars was so kind as to allow me to detain his manuscript on its way to the
. z Royal Society tor two or three days, and I devoted that time almost entirely to
s understanding the method of his attack on the key of the position—namely, the
E method of double layers, expounded in my own language in § 9 below. Being thus
Le furnished with the means, I was able to resume my attempt under favourable
& conditions, and this paper is the result.

= The substance of the analysis of this paper is, of course, essentially the same as his,
s but the arrangement and notation are so different that the two present but little
é superficial resemblance. This difference arises, partly from the fact that I desired to
a use my own notation for the ellipsoidal harmonics, and partly because during the time
ie that I was working at the analysis his paper was still unprinted and therefore
3 inaccessible to me. But it is, perhaps, well that the two investigations of so
3 complicated a subject should be nearly independent of one another. GE Tt is rather unfortunate that I did not feel myself sufficiently expert in the use of
B the methods of Wrrmrstrass and ScHwnrz to evaluate the elliptic integrals after the

methods suggested by M.
