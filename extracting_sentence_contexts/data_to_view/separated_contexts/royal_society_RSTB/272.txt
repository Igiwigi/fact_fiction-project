and if any part of it is overlapped by the basals, the underbasals are overlapped by
them too (fig. 45); moreover they are developed at a much deeper level than the
basals, and one at least of them is radial. Perhaps it will be well before proceeding further to give reasons for regarding the
three plates which I have described as underbasals, and not as parts of the centro-
dorsal, as GÃ©rre has done. Of course, if there had been five plates instead of three,
7 and these plates had all been radial, there could be no question about the propriety of
this nomenclature ; and the facts above related are strongly in favour of regarding
these three plates as representatives of five radial plates. But it is not on this alone
hat I have relied. Some of the dicyclic Palxocrinoids (e.g., the Ichthyocrinidx) have

pthroughout life three instead of five underbasals, one of which is smaller than the
| gothers, and in some forms it is situated anteriorly, opposite to the anal interradius ;
80 that these three plates have precisely the same symmetry as those in Antedon.
