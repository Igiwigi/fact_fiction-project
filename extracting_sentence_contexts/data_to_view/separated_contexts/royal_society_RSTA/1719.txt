When @ is nearly equal to z, the calculation on the present lines becomes more
difficult,* and we shall accordingly obtain the corresponding approximation by a
different process in the next section (§ 7). It appears that for the special value «a = 10, the formule (6°7) do give the forces
with a fair degree of accuracy up to an angle @ = 37; the approximation in fact
appears to be better than might have been expected. [See p. 176 above.]
