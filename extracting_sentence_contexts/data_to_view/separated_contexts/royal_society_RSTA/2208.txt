Such a requirement of unique specification is, on the
Copenhagen approach, unacceptable in physics as it would thereby be rendered subjective in
that the specific observer or specific tools involved in measurement become entirely inextricable
from what it is that is measured, while objective physics is about the physical world alone and
not its observation. Thus, although measurement requires the full specification of experimental
circumstances, an experimental context is only an equivalence class of physical arrangements
corresponding to successful measurements of a given set of sharp observables {O;} such that
the statistics of measurement of each of its observables is unchanged by the measurement of
its others.

4. Complementarity and contextuality

Perhaps the greatest significance of quantum contextuality on the Copenhagen approach is to
be found in the fact that if the experimental context is changed, the statistics of some of its
measurement outcomes become different. In particular, any attempt to provide an analysis in
which the object of measurement is measured more comprehensively than in a complete set of
compatible sharp measurements by the measurement of other physical magnitudes will involve
such a change of context and hence of outcome statistics. The incompatibility of quantum observables corresponding to different measurement contexts
is, on the Copenhagen view, ultimately an expression of complementarity.
