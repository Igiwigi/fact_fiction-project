Analogous arguments can be found for the other vertices. The observation that such extremal points of the polytope cannot be reached, provides us
with a way of writing down temporal inequalities able to discriminate between qubit and qutrit


machines. In fact, for each vertex we can write an expression in terms of probabilities that reaches
its algebraic maximum precisely on it. Namely, we can write

By := p(00|00) + p(00|11) + p(01|01) + p(01)10),
By := p(01|00) + p(01|11) + p(00|01) + p(00)10),

(5.15)
B3 := p(01|00) + p(00|11) + p(01\01) + p(01|10)
and Bg := p(01|00) + p(01/11) + p(01|01) + p(00|10). One can, then, derive bounds for such expression in the case of qubit machines
Bi <3, Bo <3, B3 53.186 and By <3.186. (5.16)

So far, no general method has been developed for calculating such bounds and the methods
presented in [16] to calculate them seem hardly generalizable.
