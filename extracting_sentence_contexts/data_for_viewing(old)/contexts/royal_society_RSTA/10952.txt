that it is extremely difficult with the complex system of factors influencing living
forms to reduce our conditions to that theoretically perfect state in which we shall
measure solely the factor we are investigating. If the intensity of homotyposis were
exactly 45, I should be inclined to distrust any long series of results, one and all of
which gave the answer *45 exactly. ‘There are so many other disturbing factors which
only those who have endeavoured to collect series of this kind will fully appreciate.
In the first place, the theoretical conception of undifferentiated like organs is very
hard to realise practically ; position of the organ on the branch or of the branch on a
plant, however careful be the collector, may really have introduced differentiation, and
so weakened the apparent homotyposis. Secondly, the environmental factor comes
into play. It is difficult to obtain a hundred individuals with like environment ; soil,
position with regard to other growths, sunlight, insect life, &c., may differ in a manner
that the collector cannot appreciate. Unlike environment may produce a fictitious
likeness in the organs of the same individual when we pass from one individual to a
second. The fact that half our series grew in one field, the other half in another,
that part came from one side of a road, part from another, may introduce an unper-
ceived heterogeneity which increases the apparent homotyposis. Thirdly, the
difficulty of ensuring that all individuals are of the same age or in the same stage
of development, is very great. The leaves of an old tree may have a fictitious
likeness when compared with those of a young tree ; we may gather organs from one
individual when it is in a stage of development, which would only be reached in
another individual some days or weeks later. These and other factors may perhaps
be to some extent eliminated—far better of course by the trained botanist than by
