They are not set by the differential equations themselves. These conditions restrain the solutions that are possible. In fact, beyond a certain
evel of complexity, the more interesting question becomes the explanation of
hat restraining set of conditions, not just the behaviour of the system, since
he restraints may completely change the behaviour of the system. A restraint,
herefore, is not necessarily a feedback. Restraints can be simply the background
set of conditions within which the system operates, i.e. its environment.
