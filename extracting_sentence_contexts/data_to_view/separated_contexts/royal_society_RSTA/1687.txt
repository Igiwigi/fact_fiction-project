Then by lemma 5.5 the operator A? is similar to

Az (* ) , DA:= {(/ ) € D(A) x D(N): Aaf + LaN€ Xo} 6.7)
and the claim follows from [10, Thm. 3.3]. If B|x, € £(X0,0X), the assertion follows from
lemma A.4. a

Remark 5.9. The previous result can also be interpreted as follows: if the operator R(f) in (5.5)
remains norm bounded for t | 0, then the (coupled) problem (aP2) is well-posed if and only if the
(independent) Cauchy problems for Agg on Xp and N on 0X are.


(ii) B bounded on ker(Am)

We now study the case where B|ker(4,,) is bounded which, for Ag-bounded B, is equivalent to
the fact that the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator N = BLo gets bounded on aX. More precisely, our
starting point are the following additional hypotheses complementing our general setting 2.1. For
the definition of the operator Go see (5.3).
