Wheeler in 1926 [3,4]. The concept has been invoked
by emergentist philosophers such as Samuel Alexander and Charlie Dunbar Broad in contrast to
reductionism in the 1920s, although a more formal approach was developed by the pioneers of
cybernetics in the 1940s. In fact, cybernetics deals with systems and their causal feedback loops:
among its founders there were Norbert Wiener and John von Neumann, the latter being the
first to propose cellular automata and a universal constructor, both concepts strictly related to
emergence. Ludwig von Bertalanffy, in particular, was among the founders of general systems
theory, providing the first mathematical ground to describe the complexity observed in biological
and social systems [5,6]. It was during the 1970s that the Nobel Laureate Phil Anderson warned against the perils of
reductionism.
