already pointed out, they must have been evolved. Coleus elongatus must have
evolved on the summit of Ritigala, where it exists as about a dozen individuals, and
cannot ever have been much more numerous. The most numerous group of the
Ceylon endemics are these Very Rares, and the numbers decrease steadily up to
Very Common. They must obviously have begun at one or other end of the scale.
They could not begin at Very Rare (on the theory of natural selection), because the
numbers are insufficient. But if they began at Very Common, and were developed
to suit the local conditions, it is a very remarkable thing that they increase steadily
in number down to Very Rare, and are therefore, so far as one can see, in process of
dying out.

Yet another argument against natural selection, though it is not a very strong one,
may be derived from the fact that the families with many endemics, 7.e., the families
which on the theory of natural selection one would suppose very well suited to local
conditions, have their endemies rarer than they are in families that possess only few.
If we arrange the families in the order of the number of endemics contained in them,
as in Table VI above, and add them up in approximately equal groups, we get the
result indicated in Table XVI.

There is thus quite a perceptible difference in the degree of rarity between families
that have many, and families that have few, endemic species, and the figures progress
arithmetically, without a break.

These conclusions can be further confirmed by looking at the endemic genera. If
local species had been evolved to suit local conditions, one would, at any rate, expect
