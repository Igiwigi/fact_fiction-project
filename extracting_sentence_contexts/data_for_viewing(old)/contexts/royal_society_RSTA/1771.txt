Figure 5. CBET power transfer relating the transmitted power of beam 2 to its incident power as a function of the incident
beam intensity for the cases of RPPs (black curve) and SSD with 35 = 6 (blue) as well as 18 (red) and with Vmoa = 17 GHz as
well as Vmoq = 50 GHz (green curve). All solid curves correspond to a single colour cycle N.. = 1. The dashed blue line shows
the single case with two SSD colour cycles (Ncc = 2), otherwise for the same parameters as the 35 = 6 and Vmoq = 17 GHz
case. The dashed curve in orange corresponds to the analytic model for power transfer, 7(G) as explained in ยง2c. (Online version

with respect to RPPs. This is emphasized by the fact that for lower intensities up to Ip/Ip ~
0.75, in absence of nonlinear processes, the lower bandwidth SSD case reproduces the RPP
case values. The same is seen when inspecting density perturbations comparing the RPP and
the SSD cases, see figure 6: the RPP case shows the strongest nonlinear structures due to the
presence of speckles, which still are present for the SSD case with 17GHz, 35 =6 SSD. The
higher bandwidth cases for SSD, 17 GHz with 36 = 18 and 50GHz with 35 = 6, seen in the red
and green curves of figure 5, respectively, clearly diminish the CBET net transfer with respect
to RPPs. This holds already for the lower intensity range in which nonlinear effects due to self-
interaction in the beams do not arise. The latter is a clear signature that the incoherence of the
average beams 1 and 2 induces, smaller density perturbations at the wavelength Ag/(2 sin 7/2) (i.e.
approx. 1 1m for the case discussed here) as expected from the coupling via the VUcross term in
equation (2.5b), ~ a,a2. The amplification of beam 2 via CBET is hence reduced in time average
due to temporarily incoherent coupling between the beams [34]. The SSD cases at high effective
