206 MISS M. G. SYKES ON THE ANATOMY AND MORPHOLOGY OF THE

B. Comparison of the Male and Female Inflorescences.

The facts bearing on the comparative morphology of the inflorescences, cones and
flowers have been summarised by Pearson,* and in his latest papert he tabulates the
various views of other observers.

From his recent detailed description of the inflorescences and from the shorter
account given in this paper, it would at first sight appear that as the inflorescences
bearing the male and female cones are dichasial cymes of essentially similar structure,
both they and the cones of the two sexes are strictly comparable.

The remarkable discovery of megaspores in the axis of the female cone has,
however, led Prarsont to consider the possibility of regarding it as morphologically
different from the male cone. He suggests that the female dichasium is derived by
proliferation from the cone, and that the lateral cones directly replace flowers, so that
