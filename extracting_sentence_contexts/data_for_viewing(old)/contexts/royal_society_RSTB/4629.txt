the internal jugular under the cucullaris muscle from which it receives a
branch (B. IX. a). It takes up a position near the root of the tenth
cranial nerve, and with it enters the skull through the jugular foramen.
The distribution of this vein and its relations to other vessels within the
cranium, where it receives a large posterior factor, the vena spinalis, has

been dealt with fully by Denpy (22).

This last author proposes to call this vessel the vena cephalica posterior, following
Verstuys (77), on the grounds that cerebralis is undesirable, as it has “nothing to
do with the cerebrum proper” (/oc. cit., p. 413). I think on the whole it is better to
retain the original terminology of Grosser and Brezina for several reasons, As a
matter of fact, the adjective cerebral is usually employed in comparative anatomy
to indicate a structure related to the brain as a whole, e.g., cerebral carotid, while the
term cephalic is used for a vessel related to the head. ‘Thus, to extend the same
nomenclature to the second of the transverse brain vessels, the vena cerebralis media
of Grosser and Brezia, would lead to confusion, for median cephalic vein is a much
closer translation of the vena capitis medialis of these authors, which is a totally
distinct vessel. In the second place, Verstuys used the term vena cephalica
posterior in error, probably misreading the lettering in the figures of the original
authors, for he says (/oc. cit., p. 349): “Die andere kommt durch das Foramen
magnum, dann zwischen Schiidel und Atlasbogen hindurch aus der Schiidelhéhle ;
Grosser u. Brezina haben sie ‘ Vena cephalica posterior’ genannt.” These investi-
gators, however, nowhere use the term cephalica, but call the vessel in question the
v. cerebralis posterior. Lastly, several subsequent writers, including Grosser himself,
