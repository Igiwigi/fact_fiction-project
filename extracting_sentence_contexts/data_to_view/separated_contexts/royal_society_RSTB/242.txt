So singular is
its relation to the bones behind that it is more like a post-cranial ossification than a
constituent element of the base of the skull, abutting against the concave surface of
the bones behind by a well-marked suture, which is posterior in position to the hinder
limit of the skull, while it overlaps those bones laterally and inferiorly, where it is
limited by a deep and characteristic infra-condylar depression. There is a doubtful
indication of a vertical suture or groove dividing the bones against which the basi-
occipital abuts. The fact that the superior margins of these bones appear to rise and
form the lateral boundaries of the foramen magnum leads me to identify them as the
ex-occipital bones. There is nothing unusual in the inferior median union of the
