riments, 0zone destroys instantaneously hyponitric acid, hydrate of nitric acid being
formed. Phosphorus does not shine in atmospheric air containing the smallest
quantity of hyponitric acid, whilst phosphorus exhibits a very lively disengagement
of light when placed in atmospheric air, being ever s0 strongly charged with ozone.
Blue litmus paper being suspended in air of the latter description is not in the least
reddened, but simply and rapidly bleached ; whilst the same paper placed in atmo-
spheric air, which is only slightly charged with hyponitric acid, assumes a perceptibly
red colour. Ozonized air being charged with yapour of ammonia or carbonate of
ammonia 80 strongly as to bring back instantly the blue colour of reddened litmus
paper, enjoys the property of decomposing iodide of potassium (i. e. colouring blue
the parts of starch mixed with that iodide), transforming the yellow prussiate into
the red salt, colouring blue the resin of guaiacum, destroying all organic colouring
matters, changing snlphuret of lead into a sulphate, &c. : the facts stated are suffi-
cient to prove satisfactorily that ozone is not identical with hyponitric acids. TI have,
however, some other facts to mention which will demonstrate in the most direct
manner, that ozone has nothing to do with the acid mentioned.

Ozone is abundantly produced (by means of phosphorus) in moist mixture of per-
fectly pure oxygen and hydrogen, or oxygen and carbonic acid. Ozone is generated
by electrical sparks out of the purest oxygen obtainable, provided that principle con-
tain s0me moisture. Ozone makes its appearance round the positive electrode, if
a current, passes through acidulated water containing no trace of nitrogen or any
azotic compound, We are therefore allowed to consider it as a settled matter, that
ozone is different both from nitrous and hyponitric acids.
