metals and solid conductors, though only an assumption, is still essential to the con-
tact theory of the voltaic pile (1810. 1861.)*; nor to prove that the electrolyte is no
otherwise like the metals than in having no contact electromotive force whatever.
But believing that this will be very evident shortly, I will go on with the experi-
mental results, and resume these points hereafter (1859. 1889.).

1836. The experiment was now repeated with the substitution of a bar of nickel
for that of iron, fig. 2 (1824.), all other things remaining the same4. The circuit
was again found to be a good conductor of a feeble thermo current, but utterly
inefficient as a voltaic circuit when all was at the same temperature, and due pre-
cautions taken (2051.). The introduction of metals at the contact x was as ineffec-
tive as before (1834.); the introduction of chemical action at z was as striking in
its influence as in the former case (1831.) ; all the results were, in fact, parallel to

* See Fxcnxxr's words. Philosophical Magazine, 1838, xiii. 377.

+ There is another form of this experiment which I sometimes adopted, in which the cup E, fig. 2, with its
contents, was dismissed, and the platinum plates in it connected together. The arrangement may then be con-
sidered as presenting three contacts of iron and platinum, two acting in one direction, and one in the other,
The arrangement and the results are virtually the same as those already given. A till simpler but equally

conelusive arrangement for many of the arguments, is to dismiss the iron between @ and 6 altogether, and s0
have but one contact, that at x, to consider.
