We also recently evaluated the NeverWet coating in a fully developed turbulent channel
flow (figure 7f [57]). Turbulent drag reduction has not been reported above a height-based
Reynolds number of 10000, and we also found no discernible difference in skin friction between
a NeverWet-coated sample and a smooth base plate. In fact, at the higher Reynolds numbers
tested, a slight increase in friction was observed, indicating a transitionally rough surface. Our
lack of observed drag reduction matches that of SH-2 measured by Aljallis et al. [40], whose
measurements of the NeverWet coating also matched the friction coefficient of an uncoated
baseline sample at higher Reynolds numbers. The resulting drag reduction of the four independent studies on NeverWet are presented as a
function of Re, in figure 7g.
