LTCPs and slow sleep oscillation 3825

— localized electrical stimulation close to the recording site or in layer 2/3
blocks existing UP states in layer 4/5 neurons in vitro, and is unable to
evoke new ones except at low stimulation intensities [50};

— while cortical stimulation at low intensity enhances the ability of thalamic
stimuli to evoke UP states, it reduces it at high intensity [45];

— whereas the slow oscillation recorded in vitro from TC neurons shows a
characteristic increase in frequency (i.e. from 0.03 to 1 Hz) [2,36,37] that
closely matches that observed during both the natural progression from
light to deep NREM sleep and the deepening of anaesthesia [14], modelling
studies of isolated cortical networks appear to show opposite results
[30,31]; and

— the consistency of the K-complex and slow sleep rhythm EEG waveform
across oscillation cycles during the progression of natural sleep and
the deepening of anaesthesia matches more closely the uniformity of the
corresponding DOWN to UP state transition and the duration of
the DOWN state in TC than in cortical neurons [2]. In summary, therefore, although complex interactions among localized
intracortical neuronal ensembles (e.g. the neocortical slice) allow the existence of
the slow oscillation in cortical territories separated from the thalamus, thalamic
inputs in vitro and in vivo appear as efficient and reliable a way of triggering
UP and DOWN state dynamics in cortical networks as intracortical stimulation. On the basis of these findings and in view of the fact that both single TC
and NRT neurons can produce the slow oscillation working as ‘conditional
oscillators’ [2], we have recently proposed (i) that the full expression of the
slow sleep rhythm in the EEG is generated by the balanced interplay of cortical
and thalamic pacemakers (figure 3) and (ii) that the LT'CP-mediated burst of
action potentials that is invariably present at the start of each TC neuron
UP state represents a major trigger for new UP states in the somatotopically
linked cortical territory [2]. Indeed, preliminary in vivo evidence (supported by
modelling studies) has conclusively shown that temporary inactivation of the
thalamus results in the majority of cortical neurons being unable to exhibit the
slow oscillation, while the others only express occasional non-synchronized UP
states [55-57].

1A slow oscillation with characteristics identical to those observed in vivo is observed in vitro
under control conditions in a small number (5%) of TC and NRT neurons [52,53], and in almost
all mouse, rat and cat TC and NRT neurons when the function of the metabotropic glutamate
receptors (mGluRs) that are located postsynaptically to their cortical afferents (i.e. mGluR 1a)
{54] is re-instated either pharmacologically (by exogenous application of an mGluR1a agonist)
or physiologically (by the glutamate released following electrical stimulation of the corticofugal
afferents that are present in the thalamic slice) [36-38]. Thus, a cortical slow oscillation drive is not
necessary for the expression of the slow oscillation in either TC or NRT neurons.
