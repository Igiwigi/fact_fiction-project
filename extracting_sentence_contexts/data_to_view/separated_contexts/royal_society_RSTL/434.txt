Since that time, the affinity 'of the earths has been
received among chemists as an undoubted fact; and, at the end
of Mr. Kirwan's Essay on the Analysis of mineral Waters, we
find a list of earthy salts which produce a reaction upon one
another, 's$upposed to be caused by an affinity that tends to
unite their 'bases, in the form of a- precipitate, insoluble in the
acids. 'Some other detached observations are to be found, in the
Fournal de Physique, and in the Annales de Chimie. The fact
is certainly one of the most important in the docimastic art,
and merits all the attention of the skilful in that branch.

* He has taken no notice of any of the experiments contained in my paper.


340 Mr. CueNEvix's Analysis of Corundum, and of

Darracg has published a paper, intended as a refutation of the
conclusions drawn by GuyTon. I had myself repeated the greater
part of the experiments of the latter; and the results I ob-
tained were exactly similar to those of Darracg.
