The value at each
pixel in this figure is constructed by taking the time-average (horizontal direction in figure 2) of
the period-time wavelet diagram in each of the three-period bands. Here, we note that CP and
intensity do not share a similar spatial distribution of their oscillatory power. The intensity at all
bands show, in fact, a peculiar circular pattern of fluctuations with long-period oscillations (i.e. 5
and 15 min period) dominating the penumbra and 3 min oscillations concentrated in the umbra. On the other hand, CP oscillations are mainly localized in a C-shaped region, and this is the case for
all bands. However, from the wavelet diagrams in figure 2, the highest power of the oscillations
is mainly concentrated in the 3 min band.
