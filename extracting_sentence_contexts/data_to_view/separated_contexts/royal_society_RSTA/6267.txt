Here, we recall that t represents the time period between
the removal of even-numbered vertical links in the medium (see (2.3)). Additionally, G solves (2.6)
with Q(t) replaced by 8(t)5m,0, where 4(t) is the delta function in time and 5,9 is the Kronecker
delta

émn = 3.3,
™" |0 otherwise. 3)

One can then apply the Fourier transform with respect to n, denoted by a superscript F,
to representations (3.1) and (3.2). Using the fact they involve convolution-type integrals and
summation operations, they can decomposed into a product of transforms with respect to t and
m. As such, via appropriate changes of variable one obtains that the transformed functions have
the forms

UF (k) = QF (K)Geven(k) and VF(k) = Q*(K)Goaa(h)- (3.4)

Here, the transformed functions are defined as

(uF(, VE(k), OF) = | {U(n), Vin), Qn} e"* dn,

and we have

Geven(k) 2 (0 — ik)? + 2c?(@ +1)
even pw [(0 — ik)? + 2c2(a + 1)]2 — 4c# cos2(tk)
and

Goaa(l) c 2cos(tk)

we [(O — ik)? + 2c2(@ + 1)]2 — 4c4 cos2(tk)’

with c = //M. Note that G'*(—rk, k) = Geven(k) + Goaa(k), where Fin and F; denote the discrete
and continuous Fourier transforms with m and t, respectively.
