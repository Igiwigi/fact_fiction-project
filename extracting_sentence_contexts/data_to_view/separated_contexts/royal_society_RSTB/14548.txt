Moreover, group structure allows

migration, density-dependent survival and all other life-
for competition among groups for resources and the possi- cycle events. The projection matrix and fitness function are
bility of selection among groups favouring more prosocial then related through the expression for the total number of
groups given sufficient group integrity [131-135]. In fact, class sâ€™ offspring produced by mutant individuals in a

model [20,137-141]. Thus, we should expect that predicting
an ESS for prosocial behaviour in a group structured popu-
lation by calculating invasion fitness will capture the effects
of both kin and group selection. To see this, we will outline
the invasion fitness analysis of this scenario performed by
Lehmann and colleagues [53,54].
