The first case
gives a comparable dataset to that studied in [13], which demonstrated regional variations in the
scaling exponent, b, of the GR Law, or magnitude-frequency distribution, of earthquakes there. It
is worth mentioning that these data also contain the magnitude 9.1 event on 26 December 2004. In fact, the 15 largest earthquakes occurring in the dataset all show a lowering of the b-value, as
reported in [13]. As earthquake magnitude is reported in terms of energy, we note that b = 2B/3
(see footnote 1, and [4]). Similar studies have been performed on different scales and across the
globe, including around the Lâ€™Aquila fault in Italy [10], in California [12] and in the northwestern
Himalayas [11].
