Since dp,/dx, = dp,/da,, dq./da, = dq,/dx,, we find by eliminating the deriva-
tives of p,, 1, Pas Ya, that

Je), Ps Ms V2) + PSY; Pr Gi a) + DI(Z: Ps Ur V2) + I (2; Pos Ms W)
aS ps (ys 2 > q2) ta Qo) (2, Px» VW qo) = 0,

and I(x, 1; Py P2) + PSY, MW Pr P2) + VI (% Qs Pr» Ps) + Is Io Prs Po)
+ pI(Ys Is Pr Pr) + GS, Io Pry P2) = 0

where J(_) denotes the Jacobian of any four of the functions f, fi, fy,f,,ff4 with
respect to the variables specified in the bracket. Of these equations there are thirty,
but since they are given by the elimination of six quantities from twelve equations
only six of the thirty can be independent.

$15. One pair of these auxiliary equations will contain Jacobians of f, fi, fy Ay
and will in fact express the conditions that the equations

dy = pda, + prday
dz = qda, + qn

shall be integrable without restriction when p,, P2, qj, q2 have the values given by
the equations f, = 0 = fi, fg = %, fy = dy

Thus, if a pair of functions fj, f, can be found satisfying these two auxiliary
equations, the solution can be completed by solving a pair of simultaneous ordinary
equations. (See Mayer’s method, Forsytn, ‘ Theory of Differential Equations,’ pp.
59-62.)

The two auxiliary equations that f,, f, must satisfy are linear and homogeneous in
their Jacobians, the coefficients of the Jacobians not involving the functions f;, /,;
the number of independent variables is apparently eight, but it may be taken as six,
since two of the eight variables 2,, x2, y, 2, P|, Ps Vis J ave given as functions of the
other six by the relations f, = 0, 4, = 0, and may be supposed eliminated from /;, f,,
if that is desirable. The columns of the matrix formed as at §11 are the rows of the following array :—

Ua:;; 25), - 0, 0,
d(x,y), 0 0,
d(z,,2z), 9, 0,
