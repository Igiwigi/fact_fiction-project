The explanation of this zone of confusion is easy, since the representation of
the elbow—the movements of which occur in only one plane—admits necessarily of
closely limited localisation. (See Table 3 and fig, 3.)

Wrist.—In tabulating the movements of this joint, it was obviously necessary to
separate its two distinct functions, viz., pronation and supination, on the one hand,
and flexion and extension on the other. We will first discuss the latter function, as
by far the more important. On Table 3 it is seen how extremely constant is the
movement of extension, and a moment’s consideration will show that it is of funda-
mental importance, for it is clear that the delicate movements of the fingers could not
possibly be performed with any degree of accuracy and force unless the wrist be
previously fixed in moderate extension, and consideration of this fact also explains why
the wrist is especially provided with powerful extensor muscles which act with con-
siderable independence. (See fig. 4.)

In returning to the first-mentioned movements of the wrist, viz., pronation and
supination, we have only to add that, as might be expected, supination is most
marked in the lower two-thirds of the area, since it is here that we have also flexion
of the elbow, ie., bicipital action. The converse equally holds, viz., that pronation is
associated with extension of the elbow. This association is clearly the outcome of the
two great classes of action in animal life, viz., that of defence and that of feeding.
