This will be
defined in § 2. No account of recent work on Saint-Venant’s flexure problem would be com-
plete which did not pay tribute also to the work of Seth (1933) who first published a
solution for the cross-section which is an isosceles right-angled triangle. This, in the
writer’s opinion, is incomplete in so far as he does not relate all the constants of his
solution to the external force system; he does not in fact evaluate the associated flexural
torsion. The revision, completion, correction and correlation of the conflicting results made
apparent by collecting these solutions together has been very much simplified by the
writer’s discovery that Saint-Venant’s flexure problem is reducible to boundary
problems of the same canonical simplicity as the torsion problem, involving six ‘‘ canoni-
cal flexure functions” of which one is the torsion function for the cross-section. Young, Elderton and Pearson remark (1918, p. 3) that “the problem of complete
asymmetry still awaits investigation’’.
