this occurs, the residue is washed with water containing a few drops of acetic acid to the
pint, and then syringed out of the filter into an evaporating-basin and dried at a gentle
heat. The dry pigment is next to be washed with a mixture of alcohol and ether, and
once more dried. It.is now perfectly pure and yet unchanged, so far as I have examined it.

Properties of Turacin.â€”Prepared as above described, turacin occurs in scales which
have a deep violet-purple colour by reflected light, and showing a crimson tint when
seen in small fragments by transmitted light. Its powder is of a dull crimson tint. It
has not been obtained in a crystalline form. It is very slightly soluble in pure water,
giving a pale rose-pink solution. The presence of acids and salts renders water inca-
pable of dissolving it. Tt is not 8oluble in pure alcohol or ether. In alkaline liquids it
immediately dissolves, forming solutions which show a bluer tint than the original pig-
ment. In fact turacin is a very delicate test for the alkalies. For example, perfectly
pure barium hydrate in slution does not dissolve turacin ; but let a minute trace of s0da
exist, as it often does, in the baryta-s0lution, and then the liquid will become readily
tinted if shaken up with a fragment of turacin. Very strong solutions of the caustic
alkalies dissolve the pigment, but at the same time it suffers a partial decomposition,
evidenced by an odour resembling that of certain bases of the pyridine series, which it
then evolyes. Fuming nitric acid dissolves it with a deep brown tint, destroying it; in
oil of vitriol it is 8oluble, but in all probability with partial alteration. Turacin seems
to have lightly acid properties; though it dissolves very freely in carbonated alkalies,
