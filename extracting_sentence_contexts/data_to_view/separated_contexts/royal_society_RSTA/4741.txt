It is based on the notion that the dynamics in the full-state
space can be reconstructed from measurements of just a single component of the state space [13]:
the Takens Embedding theorem. The method is based on time delays. This fact has important
conceptual implications discussed later. We apply these concepts to fundamental physics through the Cosmological Invariant Set
Postulate [11]: states of physical reality lie precisely on a fractal attracting invariant set Ij
of measure zero in the state space of the universe U, considered as a dynamical system. A
crucial question to ask is: what fundamental physical process could account for the attraction
of neighbouring state-space trajectories onto I?
