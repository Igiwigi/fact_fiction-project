The failure to find a correlation between lymphocytes and immature pyronin
cells in the grafts at 12 days, though present at 8 days, argues against the interpretation
that the immature pyronin cells are merely staining artifacts, i.e. that a certain proportion
of the lymphocytes happen for some accidental reason, such as nearness to the surface of
the section, to stain with pyronin. Results from the second-set experiments likewise
showed no correlation between lymphocytes and immature pyronin cells in the same
graft. The fact that no correlation was found between the concentration of mature plasma
cells at 12 days and that of immature pyronin cells at 8 days does not argue against the
transformation of the latter into the former; the period of transformation may be con-
siderably less (or more) than 4 days, and other factors could prevent such a correlation. In the same way the absence of a correlation between lymphocytes at 8 days and immature
pyronin cells at 12 days would not be evidence against the transformation of the former
into the latter within the grafts.

t test. A t test showed that the average percentage of pyronin cells did not change
significantly between 8 and 12 days.
