This has led to novel kinetic and Fokker—Planck-type equations in domains of opinions [8,9].
A recent trend is to incorporate the heterogeneity of groups into models, in particular the existence
of certain opinion leaders that are trusted more than others. Besides the fact that now systems
have to be considered instead of single kinetic equations, the interactions naturally become
asymmetric, which complicates the mathematical analysis (e.g. [10]). In this issue, Albi et al. [11]
deal with such a problem, considering Boltzmann-type interactions with leaders also at the

microscopic level, and explaining how they can control opinion from the arising macroscopic 73
models. : 2

In the last few decades, motion of socially interacting individuals has received a lot of attention. : a
This ranges from animals (insect swarms, fish schools and bird flocks) to human crowds. Various a
interesting mathematical models and questions arise from the fact that those animals adapt their [4
spatial motion due to some consensus reached with other individuals locally around them, e.g. : N
birds adapt their velocity to follow the flock without explicitly knowing a determined group : S
velocity. Hence, this is a natural paradigm of self-organized formation of macroscopic patterns [8

from microscopic interactions. The mathematical analysis of flocking has become popular after
Cucker & Smale [12] introduced a simple model that is accessible to rigorous arguments. In the
macroscopic setting, flocking means that—at least in some spatial region—the density looks like a
Dirac delta distribution in velocity space, hence analysis of flocking is naturally linked to blow-up
phenomena for PDEs (e.g. [13,14]).

In the last few years, a variety of novel techniques have been developed to treat more
realistic models (e.g. [15,16]) and better understand phase transitions, i.e. critical values of certain
