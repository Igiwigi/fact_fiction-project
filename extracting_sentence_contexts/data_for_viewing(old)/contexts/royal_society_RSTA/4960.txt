The validation of the incompressible MHD analytical solution for the nonlinear evolution of
Alfvén wave collisions with a kinetic numerical simulation has two important implications. First,
the properties of the incompressible MHD solution persist even under the weakly collisional
plasma conditions relevant to realistic space and astrophysical plasmas. Second, the dynamical
behaviour of the turbulent cascade in the MHD regime, k, pj <1, in particular the nonlinear
energy transfer, is adequately described by the simplified framework of incompressible MHD.
This second point highlights that, even in a kinetic plasma, the nonlinear energy transfer is
essentially fluid in nature, and can be modelled as a nonlinear wave—wave interaction. On the
other hand, the physical mechanisms responsible for damping of the turbulent fluctuations under
weakly collisional plasma conditions, as will be argued below, must be essentially kinetic in
nature, dominated by wave-particle interactions.

Talso note that the physics of Alfvén wave collisions highlights the fact that plasma turbulence
is inherently three dimensional [9,17,61]. The linear term in (2.1) governs the propagation of
the Alfvén waves along the equilibrium magnetic field and is non-zero only when the parallel
wavenumber ky 40, requiring the inclusion of the field-parallel dimension. And the vector
