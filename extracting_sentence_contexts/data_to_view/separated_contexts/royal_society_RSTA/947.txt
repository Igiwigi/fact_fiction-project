Summarizing, on each stratum of the bifurcation complex, we have a pair of action variables
Iy,I, and Iy,,I,,, (the latter for the swallow-tail stratum). Each of these functions can be treated as
a real-analytic function of H and F. In fact, we have already considered the actions I, and I,,, in
the previous ยง5, where they were denoted by I(H, F) and I,(H, F). We keep this notation here, i.e.
we set I, =I, I,,, =1,. The remaining action is denoted by I, so that we have three action variables
II, and I,,.
