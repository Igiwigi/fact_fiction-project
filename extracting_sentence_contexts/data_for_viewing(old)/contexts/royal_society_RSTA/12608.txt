the long box almost universally employed hitherto. Several advantages follow from
this. In the first place, if the beam is hung centrally, neither the gravitational
attraction of the tube nor any minute difference of potential between the tube and the
beam and its accessories, produce any effect. In the second place, the attracting balls
may be carried round outside the tube through a complete circle, and yet be placed
but little further from the attracted balls than would be necessary if no intervening
tube existed. For this purpose they are conveniently supported by a common
metallic structure, symmetrical in form, about the axis of the tube, and able to rotate
about this axis also. If, following the usual arrangement, all four balls are on one
level, there are obviously two planes, one containing and one normal to the beam, in
which the centres of the attracting balls may be placed so as to produce no deflection.
At some intermediate position the deflection will be a maximum, The use of this
position has the obvious advantage that, besides the fact that this gives the greatest
effect, the accuracy with which the angle of azimuth is measured is of little conse-

quence, the geometrical measurements of real importance being the distance between

the centres of the large balls, the corresponding distance between the centres of the

small balls, and the angle of deflection. This is all the more important since it would

be extremely difficult to make a really accurate determination of the azimuth,
