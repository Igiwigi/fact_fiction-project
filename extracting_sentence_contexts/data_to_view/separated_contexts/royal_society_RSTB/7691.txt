There are many who are either
strong supporters or firm opponents of GM crops, and each camp may be tempted to see
support for their views in the findings reported here. Others may wish to consider this evi-
dence more dispassionately and see it as another contribution to the important debate
regarding the desirability or otherwise of introducing GM crops into mainstream agriculture
in the UK. However, any reading of the evidence presented here should take into account
the fact that these studies had a well-defined aim, namely to examine the effects of the
management of selected GM crops on specified species within distinct geographical confines
and time limits. Any conclusions drawn must acknowledge these limitations. We are aware that, because the papers published here describe the results of government-
sponsored research, we might be exposing ourselves to criticism from one source or another.
