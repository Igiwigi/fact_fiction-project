It is remarkable that we have never been able to keep the pure-bred urchins ot
Â£. acutus alive for more than a few months after metamorphosis. This is, moreover,
singular, from the fact that the cross #. esculentus 3 x E. acutus $ grows very well
under laboratory conditions. We have had to rely, therefore, in our description of
E. acutus, on material obtained from the trawl, the exact age of which is unknown.
