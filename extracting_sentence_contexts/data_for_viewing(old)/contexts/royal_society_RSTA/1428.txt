Figure 4. Strong scalability of IFS and ICON models in global high-resolution simulations. : a

core, radiation and physics components, but excluding I/O. The performance difference between a
the models can be explained by mainly three (partly multiplicative) factors: IFS makes use of :S
the hydrostatic model formulation instead of the non-hydrostatic model option, which in the IFS :
approximately halves the performance at the moment (approx. 2x), IFS runs at single-precision
(approx. 1.6x) [30] and most importantly employs a significantly longer time step due to its semi-
implicit time integration (IFS/ICON: 240 s/45 s=5x in the 5km case). All these accumulate to
a factor 16 and the figure implies about a factor 10, which is likely due to the fact that in ICON,
there are different time steps used in the coupling to the physics compared to the dynamics part
(the same in IFS).

Figure 4 suggests that a throughput of 1 SYPD is achievable on todayâ€™s supercomputers for
a 5km resolution case (IFS, single-precision, hydrostatic, 960 nodes). Referring to the double-
precision, non-hydrostatic, full I/O performance of the DYAMOND 5km run using ICON
and restricting considerations to atmosphere-only simulations, a throughput of ca 0.17 SYPD
is reached on 900 compute nodes. A straight-forward extrapolation of the performance of the
DYAMOND 5km runs to the 1km case corresponds to multiplicative factors in compute time of
25 in terms of horizontal resolution, 2 in vertical resolution to target for 180 vertical levels (the
exact number of levels will in the end also depend on the application and adjustments of the
model top) and 5 in terms of required time steps, resulting in a shortfall of 1500 to reach the target
