The sporangium of Gleichenia dichotoma is of much more elongated form, the stalk
is thinner, and has no central group of cells (fig. 9). The annulus rises more obliquely
from the surface of the leaf; not only are the central and peripheral faces of the
sporangium much smaller than in Gi. cireinata, but the curvatures of them differ ;
the peripheral face, which in the latter is often almost flat, is in Gl. dichotoma
strongly convex, while the central face, which is convex in Gl. circinata, is flatter in

Gl. dichotoma, Thus, in actual size, in thickness of stalk, in position of the annulus,
in convexity of the surface, in fact, in all the dimensions, there is considerable differ-
ence between these two “types. GJ. dichotoma stands aloof from most species of
Gleichenia ; Gl. flabellata, which has been the subject of observations to be detailed
below, holds a middle position as regards size and shape of the sporangium, though as
regards numbers of spores produced, it will be found to be an extreme type. With these facts before us we pass to the study of development.
