lines of force in the neighbourhood of the rod. [April 14, 1909.]

was very often subjected to this trouble, and many records of the potential gradient
were lost in consequence. The only means which could be devised to diminish the
difficulty was to take every opportunity of visiting the instruments and sweeping
away the webs.

After the instruments had been set up, the question had to be decided how
sensitive to make the electrometer. In view of the fact that the work was being
undertaken mainly with a view to the investigation of thunderstorms, it seemed
desirable that the sensitiveness should be so arranged that the deflection should
never be greater in two minutes than would bring the boom of the electrometer to
the edge of the paper on which the record was being made. This necessitated a
somewhat low sensitiveness, and, as a consequence, the electricity of rain with very
low charges could not be measured. There was the possibility of altering the
sensitiveness of the instrument according to the kind of rain which was expected,
but this was considered impracticable in view of the fact that the instrument could
not be watched continually, but had to be left to itself to take the records entirely
automatically. In reality, this difficulty was not serious. The conditions during
thunderstorms are entirely different from those during gentle rain, aud to investigate
the two cases is really a matter of two distinct researches. The present research
