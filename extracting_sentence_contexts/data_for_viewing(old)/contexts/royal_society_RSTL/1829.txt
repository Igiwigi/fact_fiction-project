tive electricity is developed at the zinc end, and negative at the copper end,
But the electricity developed in the dry pile has not one character in common
with voltaic.” It makes gold-leaves diyerge ;—voltaic does not. It is most
energetic with an imperfect conductor between the plates ;—yoltaic on the
contrary increases with the conducting power of the fluid interposed. "This
electricity will not decompose water ;—a slight development of yoltaic does 80,
energetically. This pile is only in action when the poles are not connected ;—
voltaic action does not exist unless the poles be connected. The experiment
of Dr. WoLLasToN in which he decomposed water by common electricity might
seem at variance with this reasoning. But this decomposition is totally unlike
that produced by yoltaic electricity; for, as Dr. WoLLasToxN remarks, a mixture
of oxygen and hydrogen rose from each of the fine metallic points, a fact which
shows that the decomposition was produced in a manner essentially different.
The decompoxsition in this experiment seems to have been effected by the me-
chanical agency of the electric fluid. The fine electric dart shooting out from
the invisible gold points may have actually cleayed a molecule of water which
happened to be fayourably situated, and thus its oxygen and hydrogen were
disengaged at the point where the mechanical cleavage took place #,

5. It does not appear to me at all necessary that zinc and copper should be
thrown into opposite electric states to produce yoltaic action, I shall make
no suppositions with regard to those states, but ground my views of yoltaic
action on well established facts.. Zinc has a much more powerful attraction
for oxygen than copper; and yet copper has also a decided attraction for it,
