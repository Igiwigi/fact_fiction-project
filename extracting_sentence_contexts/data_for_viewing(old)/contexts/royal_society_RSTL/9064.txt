A only introducing the infusions into the chambers upstairs, but of boiling them there.
P It had been noticed that when the test-tubes were withdrawn from the oil-bath, and
= the discharge of steam into the chambers ceased, a somewhat violent entrance of the
= air into the cooling-chamber was the consequence. To sift such air of its germs, both
= the funnel of the pipette and the open ends of the bent tubes were carefully stopped
=D with cotton-wool, The wool was never removed from the funnel, and it was not
5 removed from the bent tubes until the chamber had thoroughly cooled. The same
= vegetables were operated on, viz. cucumber, beetroot, turnip, and parsnep. On the 25th
= of November four chambers were charged with the infusions. On the 30th they were
'S one and all coyered with a layer of deeply pitted and corrugated fatty seum. Thus
S far, then, I was defeated in my efforts to escape contamination.

'S During these experiments a fact was observed which repeated itself afterwards in
Z other instances. Samples of the different infusions were always exposed to the common
2 air beside their respective chambers, and in general these outside samples became
Ez turbid and covered with scum a day or 80 before the interior tubes gave notice of
Â£5 breaking down; but here, in the case of the turnip, the outside tube continued pellucid
5 and free from life for 8ome time after the inside ones had become turbid with organisms.
pl How could this be? 'The case of my two trays placed one above the other last year *
I suggested itself to my memory. In point of life-development it was then found that
8 the lower tray was always in adyance of the upper one. As pointed out at the time,
S the absence of agitation which permitted the germs to sink into its tubes was the

assignable in the present instance. By 8ome means or other germs had insinuated
