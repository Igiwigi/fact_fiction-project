the red than by the violet; but this is contrary to experience. The effect of absorp-
tion upon the index of refraction must therefore be regarded as antagonistic to the
chromatic dispersion.

33. M. Cavcuy has, I consider, given a satisfactory theory of chromatic dispersion,
which is perfectly consistent with every thing which has been advanced in the pre-
sent theory. But I claim for the latter that it gives a satisfactory account of the
phenomena of absorption and the spectral spaces discovered by FRAUNHoFER, and com-
monly known by the name of Frauxnorr's lines, especially when taken in connexion
with the consideration of {luminous resonance, to which subject, I think, the attention
of scientific men is here directed for the first time.

In fact, according to the laws of resonance, those rays will act most forcibly on
the medium, which find amongst the particles of the latter s0me capable of vibrating
in unison, or in harmonic consonance less perfect than unison, with themselves, the
unison of course giving rise to by far the most energetic action, but the other cons0-
nances producing effects more decided as the coincidences of phase are more frequent ;

we ee therefore in general why particular rays should be selected for absorption, with-
out any insensible gradation, and why some lines of absorption, those corresponding
to nnizon for example, should be more strongly marked than others ; and these pre-
liminaries being conceived, then comes the equation
