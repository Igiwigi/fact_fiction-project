If we are looking for an explanation of these results in the
responses of neurons tuned to binocular disparity recorded
from the visual cortex, then there is a striking discrepancy
between the perceptual reports and the responses of neurons
in primary visual cortex. In awake, behaving monkeys, Cum-
ming & Parker [85] found that the disparity selectivity of V1
neurons was inverted when they were tested with dynamic
anti-correlated random-dot stimuli. Crucially, like humans,
the monkeys could not discriminate the depth within these pat-
terns, notwithstanding the fact that the same figures created a
disparity-specific response in V1 neurons. This certainly does
not fit with the idea of a direct correspondence between
responses in a network of V1 neurons and a fully formed
stereoscopic percept. Rather it underlines the point that V1 con-
tains a module of neurons specialized for the processing of
fine-scale binocular pattern matching, based on similarity
between the luminance profiles of features in the left and
right eyes.
