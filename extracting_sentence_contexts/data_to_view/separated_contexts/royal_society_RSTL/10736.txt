In the tabular
representation of either the unified columns will represent the units of the other. Further, S and X are independent systems, no special relation except that of
similarity of form exists between them. Each aspect of S is arrived at by con-
8idering a correspondence of S and X ; it may in fact be regarded as such a corre-
8pondence, 80 that a unified aspect is a unified correspondence, and the whole system
of unified aspects of S represent a system of unified correspondences of two systems
of the same form, in which we are restricted to such correspondences as those referred
to in 8ec. 163. 168.
