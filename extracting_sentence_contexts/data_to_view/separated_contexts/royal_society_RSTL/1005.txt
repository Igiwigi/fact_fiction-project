And in an
experiment that I made on a combination of copper, iron, and
hydroguretted sulphurets of potash, in 1802, I found that the
poxitive energy of the hydroguretted sulphurets with regard
to the copper was sufficient to overpower that of the iron ; 80
that the electricity did not circulate from the copper to the
iron, and from the iron to the fluid, as in common cases, but
from the copper to the hydroguretted sulphuret, and from
the hydroguretted sulphuret to the iron. All these details afford the strongest confirmation of the

principle. It may be considered almost as a mere arrangement
of facts; and with some extensions jt'8eems capable of being
generally applied. Bodies possessing opposite electrical energies with regard
to one and the same body, we might fairly conclude would
likewise possess them with regard to eachother. This I have
found by experiment is the case with lime and oxalic acid.
