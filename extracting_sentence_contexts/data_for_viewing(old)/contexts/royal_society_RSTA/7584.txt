In the case of transitions involving a reversal of electron spin the Oppenheimer approximation
must be used. Unfortunately, it proves to be very unsatisfactory. Thus for non-hydrogenic systems
it may give very different results according to whether a prior or a post interaction is adopted. It
leads to frequent violations of the conservation theorem and cannot be relied upon even to give the
detailed shape of cross-section against energy curves.

By generalizing from the evidence collected, an attempt is made to specify the conditions under

which the Born and Oppenheimer approximations are most reliable; on this basis, proposals for
systemization are made.

Attention is drawn to the fact that some (but by no means all) of the observed excitation functions
possess an extremely sharp peak just beyond the critical potential. The theory seems unable to
reproduce this peculiar feature. It does not appear in the observed ionization functions.

INTRODUCTION

In numerous geophysical and astrophysical problems it is important to have quantitative
information on the cross-sections associated with excitation and ionization by electrons.
Thus, data of this kind are required before the significance of the observed spectral character-
istics of aurorae may be properly understood (Bates, Massey & Pearse 1948). They are also
wanted in connexion with investigations on the chemical composition of the solar corona
(Hoyle 1949) and of the gaseous nebulae (Aller & Menzel 1945). An accurate knowledge
of these inelastic cross-sections, besides being necessary for the development of a detailed
