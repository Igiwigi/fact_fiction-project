Tools and techniques developed in these endeavours
can be appropriated into ecological modelling, but it will also be necessary to develop the science
of ecoinformatics along with approaches specific to ecological problems. The impetus for
this effort should come from the demand coming from society to understand the effects of
environmental change on the world and what might be performed to mitigate or adapt to them. Keywords: ecological modelling; prediction; climate change; evolution; systems biology;
