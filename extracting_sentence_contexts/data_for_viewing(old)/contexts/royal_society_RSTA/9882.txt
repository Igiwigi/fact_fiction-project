AND ITS RELATION TO SOLAR SPECTRA. 57

some of the Wolf-Rayet stars, where the less refrangible lines of hydrogen are bright
and the more refrangible ones dark.*

A general comparison of the unenhanced lines with the spot spectrum ghows that
all the more prominent lines are considerably strengthened in passing from the sun to
the spot. Seeing that the spot spectrum is far more crowded with lines and flutings
than the solar spectrum, it is not surprising that there are several apparent coin-
cidences of spot lines with the fainter lines of scandium, but, with our present
knowledge, it would be unphilosophical to regard such occasional coincidences as
significant. The only scandium lines which can confidently be regarded as intensified
in the spot spectrum are, in fact, those which are brightest in the are-flame spectrum
previously described. The strongest line of all is 6305-88, and other prominent lines
are 6210째90, 5700-40, 5687째05, and 5672째05; in the blue end, the strengthening of
are-flame lines, like the weakening of enhanced lines, is less marked in the photographs
at present available.

The principal lines of the arc-flame spectrum, including all the unenhanced lines of
intensity 6 or more from Table I, are brought together in Table IV. and compared
with the sun and sunspots. There is a certain amount of confusion with lines of other
elements in spots, but it ntay be reasonably concluded that the intensities of the lines
in spots correspond closely with their intensities in the arc-flame. The line 5514째44
does not appear in the spot spectrum as might have been expected, but it is at the
lower limit of intensity, and it would be unwise to conclude from the behaviour of a
