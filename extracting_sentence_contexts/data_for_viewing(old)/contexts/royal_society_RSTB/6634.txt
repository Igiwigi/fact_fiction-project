(6) The tribasal pectoral fin of Macropetalichthys with its short radials is directly
comparable, except for the absence of a spine, with that of Acanthodes or Ischnacanthus.
I have already shown that such a fin is not found in the earliest Elasmobranchs and
that its occurrence in a Lower Devonian fish is on the whole evidence against Elasmo-
branch affinities. The very remarkable pelvic fin of Macropetalichthys is of course
comparable with a primitive Elasmobranch like Cladoselache, but it is equally similar
to the primitive pelvic fins found in Sturgeons and in Saurichthys and Palaconiscids.

There remain only two of STENsIoâ€™s comparisons.

(10) The non-articulation of the palato-quadrate with the ethmoidal region. Even
if true this fact would provide no evidence of Elasmobranch affinities; the palato-
quadrates of Acanthodians always end in a free anterior border which lies behind the
ethmoidal region.

(1) The general shape of the neuro-cranium with its widened ventral surface was
by far the most Elasmobranch-like of all the structures of the fish. This resemblance
becomes much less striking when critically considered. The very long occipital region
is unparalleled in Elasmobranchs, where indeed it is always exceptionally short. The
postero-lateral process arising from the occipital region behind the foramen for the
vagus and the distance of that opening from the middle line are unparalleled in
Elasmobranchs. The presence of a wide suborbital shelf is very shark like, but is
obviously to be associated with the general platybasy and with the small dorsally
directed eyes of this bottom-living fish. The very Elasmobranch ethmoidal region has
