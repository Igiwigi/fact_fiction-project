resembling some representative of Dujardin’s genus Heteromita. This agrees with
Penard’s account of the sessile form when leaving the house as a biflagellate monad.
Kent’s observation of loricae containing spore-like bodies has not been repeated.
It was frequently observed that the house contains a little detritus passively displaced
by the movements of the animal (see figure 14), but there was never any indication
of spore formation.

The observations recorded here also accord with Stein’s figures of fission in Bicoeca
lacustris, although the apparent loss of the anterior part of the house which he figures
in one case was not observed. -

Both Senn (1900) and Lemmermann (1914) question the occurrence of transverse
fission, and it is conceivable that division is in fact longitudinal (parallel to the
antero-posterior axis), rotation in the house giving the appearance of transverse
fission.

4, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FORMS @ AND /

In the light of the observations on the forms a and } recorded here, it is suggested
that James-Clark originally confused two species; the one, B. lacustris, corresponding
to type a, the other corresponding to type b. The alternative to this assumption is that
the two forms are indeed younger and older stages of the same organism, and that
development involves not only a change in the shape of the house and the length of
the pedicel, but also a change in the conformation of the peristomial process and its
relationship to the flagellum. It must be supposed that this is converted from being
