Marcer's experiments and researches, &c. 449

in sea salt :* and I saw s0on after in the © Annales du Musee,
Vol. VIE a paper by the celebrated chemist ProvsrT, who, in
a great measure, confirmed that statement, by announcing
that he had found traces of mercury in all the specimens of
marine acid which he had examined. Improbable as the fact appeared, I thought it worth while
to repeat the experiment, and to take that opportunity of
making some collateral researches upon other substances,
much more likely than mercury to be discovered in sea
water. For this purpose I availed myself of the kindness of my
friend Mr. Joann Baxmy,F who happened to be in the vicinity
of Portsmouth, to supply me with specimens of sea-water,
carefully concentrated upon the spot, in vessels of Wedgwood
ware, and with scrupulous attention to cleanliness in the pro-
cess. ' Accordingly he was 80 obliging, as not only to send
me a quantity of brine evaporated under his own eye, in the
manner just mentioned, but he also collected for me a valu-
able series of specimens from the salt works near Portsmouth,
from all the stages of the process, s0 as to afford me an
opportunity of investigating with accuracy, all the chemical
circumstances of this interesting branch of national ceconomy.
