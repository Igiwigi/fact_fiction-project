modified residue, hypusine, that is positioned proximal to
the CCA-end of the peptidyl-tRNA [58]. Lacking the domain
in EFP that resembles the anticodon stem, however, eIF5A
mimics only the acceptor stem of tRNA. eIF5A was found to
be stably bound to translating ribosomes when cells were trea-
ted with cycloheximide, destabilizing the binding of E-site
tRNA [58]. Given that both EFP and eIF5A must enter the ribo-
some through the E site, the dissociation of E-site tRNAs may
serve as a signal of slow translation that requires intervention.
Importantly, while EFP is non-essential in many bacteria,
elF5A (and the enzymes that catalyse its modification) is essen-
tial in yeast and higher eukaryotes. This requirement may be
due to the fact that a far higher percentage of eukaryotic pro-
teins have polyproline motifs (10%) or because it functions
more generally.

In a ribosome profiling study of E. coli cells lacking EFP,
we observed strong pauses (more than 10-fold above the
average ribosome density) at roughly half of the Pro—Pro
motifs [59]. These pauses were also observed in bacteria
lacking EpmA and EpmB, the enzymes responsible for
post-translational modification of the conserved lysine resi-
due. Levels of pausing at Pro—Pro motifs varied 100-fold
depending on the subsequent codon: for example, PPW,
PPN, PPD and PPP induced very strong pauses while PPI,
