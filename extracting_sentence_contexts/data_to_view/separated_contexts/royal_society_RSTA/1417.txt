Section I.â€”Notes on Calibration of Scales. A. Notation. ,

1. m,n, p, q, ete., are integral numbers representing the theoretical distances of certain
graduations from the zero of the scale in appropriate units. They are, in fact, the labels
of these graduations. 2. m/n means the actual distance between the graduations marked m and n. For
convenience m is taken as the smaller number of the pair.
