Evaluating the time derivative in (3.10) using the Leibniz rule and (3.7) for x;(t), itis readily shown
that

RQ)= “Co. (3.11)

The spatially integrated reaction rate R(t) is time invariant because in a semi-infinite system (in
both x and z), the entire influx of reactive species mass is consumed within the domain at all times
(after a short initial time as discussed below in the next section). In fact, the constant value of R()
is simply equal to the reactive power of the inflow solution, where the factor n/m denotes the
number of moles of W required to react with one mole of C. For a fracture with finite length (L),
it is readily shown that R(t) is given by (3.11) before the reaction front reaches the end of the
fracture, i.e. t < t,, where ty, is the time taken by the reaction front to reach the end of the fracture,

For t > t,, R(t) decreases as the inverse square root of time, according to
