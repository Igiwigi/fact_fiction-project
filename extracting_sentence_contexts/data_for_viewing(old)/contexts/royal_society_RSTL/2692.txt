I have only one more general remark at present to offer, and it seems important
as to the theory of mineralization of these springs. A common opinion prevails that
the quantity of the hydrosulphurets contained in these springs is in proportion to
their temperature, and I have even heard the existence of cold suIphureous springs
in the Pyrenees denied altogether. Yet not only are such to be found, but even within
not many yards of others having a high temperature, and almost an identical mineral
composition. Of this I have met with two examples in very different parts of the
chain, one at the Eaux Bonnes (south of Pau), where a perfectly cold spring rises
within two hundred yards of the principal hot spring of the place, has similar me-
dicinal properties, and is. even more strongly impregnated with suIphur, as I saw
proved by direct experiment. The other example occurs at Las Escaldas, on the
southern declivity of the Eastern Pyrenees, where a most efficacious cold sulphureous
spring rises within about one hundred yards of a hot one. When to these facts we
add others scarcely less curious, of springs of totally different mineral composition
issuing from nearly the same spot, and with temperatures from 160? to 180? Fanr.,
as we sce at Ax and at Thuez, we are forced to conclude that the sonrce of minerali-
zation must be independent to a great extent of that of high temperature, and that
the arguments as to the origin of thermal springs founded upon their chemical com-
position must be to a certain degree fallaciousFÃž.

+ A very singular circumstance was mentioned to me by M. Arzaco relative to the hot springs of Aix in
Provence, A perforation having been made by an individual in their vicinity, though it yielded only cold water,
