It is true that, at present, we
know of no facts placing them earlier than some epoch preceding the deposition
of the Red Crag. At the same time, we do not at present know of anything
which precludes their having occupied the Icenian land-surface in late Miocene
times. Whilst the facts as to the characteristics of the worked tabular flints of the Kent
plateau, and as to those of the worked tabular chert of the Upper Miocene of
Aurillac, are so little known (since of neither series has there yet been any adequate
publication and illustration), it seems unwise to say more as to the connection of the
Kent plateau industry with that of Aurillac than that there is a good deal of
evidence, leading one to entertain—at any rate, as a hypothesis to be further
tested—the possibility of a community of origin of the Icenian, the Ighthamian,
and the Aurillacian industries. 334 SIR RAY LANKESTER ON THE DISCOVERY OF A NOVEL TYPE OF FLINT
