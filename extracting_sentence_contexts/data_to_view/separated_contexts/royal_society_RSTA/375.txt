But the lessons of the recent past teach us that
he difficulty of implementing many of these options in SSA should not be
underestimated: massive investment and increases in agricultural productivity
will be necessary if economic development is to succeed in Africa in the coming
decades [88]. Second, we need to go ‘back to basics’ in collecting data and information. Difficult though it may be for many people to accept in the second decade of the
twenty-first century, the fact is that land-based observation and data collection
systems in SSA have been in decline for decades. This affects the most basic
data: weather data, land-use data, and crop and livestock distribution data, for
example. For instance, estimates of the cropland extent in Africa range from about
1 to more than 6 millionkm?, the value depending on choice of satellite-derived
product [89].
