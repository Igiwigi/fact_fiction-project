MAxweE t's general stress has the apparent advantage of simplicity. It merely
requires an alteration in the tension parallel to R, from R® to RB, whilst the lateral
pressure remains }R°, when we pass from unmagnetised to magnetised matter. The

force to which it gives rise is also apparently simple, being merely the sum of two
forces, one the electromagnetic, VJB, the other a force on magnetised matter whose i
component is (I + M)V,R, both per unit volume, the latter being accompanied (in
cease of eolotropy) by a torque. Now I is the intrinsic and M the induced magueti-
sation, so the force is made irrespective of the proportion in which the magnetisation
exists as intrinsic or induced. In fact, MaxweEtw’s “ magnetisation” is the sum of
the two without reservation or distinction. But to unite them is against the whole
behaviour of induced and intrinsic magnetisation in the electromagnetic scheme of
_MaxweLt, as I interpret it. Intrinsic magnetisation (using Sir W. THomson’s term)
Should be regarded as impressed (I = phy, where hy is the equivalent impressed
nagnetic force); on the other hand, “induced” magnetisation depends on the force
f the field {M =(y»—1)R}. Intrinsic magnetisation keeps up a field of force.
aes magnetisation is kept up by the field. In the circuital law I and M
ctherefore behave differently. There may be absolutely no difference whatever
~between the magnetisation of a molecule of iron in the two cases of being in a
Sermanent ora temporary magnet. That, however, is not in question. We have no
Boncern with molecules in a theory which ignores molecules, and whose element of
volume must be large enough to contain so many molecules as to swamp the charac-
