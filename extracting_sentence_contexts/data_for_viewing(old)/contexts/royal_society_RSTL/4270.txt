cell (a) of a somewhat pyriform shape, as distinct from the space (b, b) which sur-
rounds it. The meaning of this feature is at once made apparent, by reference to
the disposition of the sarcode which occupies the cavity of the nucleus; for we then
see (Plate IV. fig. 5) that the large central pear-shaped cell is occupied by a mass (a)
of corresponding shape, from the small extremity of which a peduncular process
extends, that dilates again into a till larger mass (6, b) completely surrounding that
from which it springs; the former may be conveniently designated as the * central,”
the latter as the © cireumambient ' segment. In a vertical section of the disk, passing
through the centre, such as that seen in Plate V. fig. 4, the nucleus seems to present
three chambers ; but this is simply due to the fact that snch a section will traverse
the circumambient cell twice, that is, will cut it through on both Sides of the central
cell. In the section represented in Plate V. fig. 9, there are but 400 central cham-
bers; in this case the plane of division seems to have traversed the nucleus just where
the neck of the central cell touches its margin, s0 that the circumambient cell is only
on one side of it. If, on the other hand, the plane of division should happen not to
pass through the central cell at all, s0 as to traverse the circumambient cell alone, a
single broad cavity will present itself in the vertical section, as shown in Plate V.
fig. 7. Frequently, however, it happens that the cirenmambient segment is partially
snbdiyided on one side by an interposed partition (Plate VII. fig. 4) ; and then a ver-
tical section will show four chambers, as is seen in Plate V. fig. 10, the central seg-
ment having a single portion of the cireumambient segment on one Side of it, and a
double portion on the other. Some remarkable varieties in the size of the nucleus,
