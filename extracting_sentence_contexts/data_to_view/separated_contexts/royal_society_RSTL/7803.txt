The measurements in the zone [1 0 0, 11 0] are of a very uncertain character, it being
difficult to determine accurately the angle which the plane 10 0 makes with even the

reflecting plane 110 on the crystal C. In fact the faces of the form (110), though
parallel to what appears to be a somewhat difficult cleavage, neyer present a good even
reflecting surface, being generally more or less conchoidal when cleavage-surfaces, and
dull when natural faces. 'The cleavage-plane 0 01 has a vitreous lustre; the lustre on the planes of the forms
100 and 101, as also of the rounded surface in the zone with them, is usually of a
resinous character, strongly recalling that of opal. It has already been observed that the faces of the octaid forms are almost invariably
rounded.
