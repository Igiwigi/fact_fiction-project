and aggregation depends upon the feeble circulating and variable currents which are most : Ss
favourable to the development and continuance of a thick fog, and upon the tendency of 7k

condensed vapour and all small particles to aggregate in defined patches wherever there is
sufficient movement.

Post Ruskin, Oscar Wilde in The Decay Of Lying (1889) [42] satirized Ruskin by suggesting that the
fault of the altered climate in London was art itself

VIVIAN. ... All that I desire to point out is the general principle that Life imitates Art far
more than Art imitates Life, and I feel sure that if you think seriously about it you will
find that it is true. Life holds the mirror up to Art, and either reproduces some strange
type imagined by painter or sculptor, or realizes in fact what has been dreamed in fiction.
Scientifically speaking, the basis of life—the energy of life, as Aristotle would call it—is
simply the desire for expression, and Art is always presenting various forms through which
this expression can be attained. Life seizes on them and uses them, even if they be to her
own hurt. Young men have committed suicide because Rolla did so, have died by their
own hand because by his own hand Werther died. Think of what we owe to the imitation
of Christ, of what we owe to the imitation of Caesar.

CYRIL. The theory is certainly a very curious one, but to make it complete you must show
that Nature, no less than Life, is an imitation of Art. Are you prepared to prove that?

VIVIAN. My dear fellow, Iam prepared to prove anything.
CYRIL. Nature follows the landscape painter, then, and takes her effects from him?
