The fact that there are no terms containing z in these equations shows that the
normal modes of disturbance are simple harmonic with respect to z, the wave-length
being 27/4. o is a quantity which determines the rate of increase in a normal
disturbance. If o is positive the disturbance increases and the motion is unstable. If o is negative the disturbance decreases and the motion is stable.
