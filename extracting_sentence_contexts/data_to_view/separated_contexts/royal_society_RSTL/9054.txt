I think
we should expect the wave bc to continue on its course to D, after having been streng-
thened at C, and a reflex wave a'P' to start from A (owing to the discharge at A) which
would reach B at the same time as a similar refex wave cv starting from C (owing to the
discharge at C); 80 that by the time the original wave Þ ed had reached D, the point B
would be the seat of a collision between the two reflex waves a & and & 4. And, not to
push the supposcd case further, it is evident that if such reflex waves were to occur,
the reulting confusion would very s00n require to end in tetanus. As a matter of fact,
these reflex wayes do not occur; and the question is, why do they not? Why is it that
a wave is only reinforced in the direction in which it happens to be travelling—so that
if, for instance, it happens to start from A in the aboye series, it is snccessively propa-
gated by BC'in the direction A BCD, aud in that direction only, whereas, if it
happens to start from D, it is propagated by the same lithocysts in the opposite direc-
tion, D CBA, and in that direction only ?—the wave in the one case terminating at the
