used rods 80 long that the influence of the ends became negligible. With closed
rings, as he has remarked, we can do no more than observe s8udden changes in
magnetism by using an induction coil, wound on the ring, in circuib with a ballistie
galvanometer. With rods, on the other hand, we can examine the actual magnetic
state at any instant, either ballistically, by drawing off a short induction coil from the
middle portion of the length, or by direct magnetometric measurement. My own obser-
vations show tha it is only when the length of the rod (if of iron) is about 300 or 400
times its diameter that the effect of length becomes insensible. The principal draws
back to the use of very long rods is the difficulty of forming them (when the section
is ab all considerable) s0 as to be of sufficient length and at the same time homogeneous
and uniform in section. By using a ballistic galvanometer whose needle, although
sufficiently heavy to act ballistically, was comparatively light, I have been able to
obtain good results with rods of very mall section—wires in fact—which by the
operation of drawing are scarcely less uniform in section than turned rods, and are in
