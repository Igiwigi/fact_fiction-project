'= the structure of the glacier and the stratification of its n6v6 I ascended the Col du
 Geant, and afterwards inspected the magnificent ice-sections exhibited in the dislocations
of the Grand Platean and other portions of Mont Blanc.
> During this investigation my convictions were by no means fixed; cases strongly

bf again other cases appeared which suggested, with almost equal force, the influence of
F atratification, 'The result, however, of the observations on the Mer de Glace was a

E But I could not help feeling that the facts and arguments which I was in a position
£ to bring forward would till leave the question an open one. 'They might influence the
SE opinions of others, as they had influenced mine ; but I had nothing to advance on which
S the mind could rest with perfect certainty. In short, neither the Mer de Glace nor its
: tributaries furnished facts capable of completely deciding the question. The snbject
& being one on which a great deal had been written and retracted, I was unwilling to
Swell the bulk of the literature connected with it, while a possibility remained- that
what I had to say upon the 8ubject might also require withdrawal. IT therefore thought
it better to wait another year; to extend the range of my observations, to visit glaciers
in which the mechanical conditions of strain and pressure were different from those of
the Mer de Glace. Thus by varying the circumstances, and observing Nature at work
under different conditions, T hoped to confer upon the investigation the character and
precision of an experimental i inquiry.
The course of the inquiry in 1858 was as follows:—T first examined the glaciers of
Grindehyald ; crossing the Strahleck, I ascended the lower glacier of the Aar to the
