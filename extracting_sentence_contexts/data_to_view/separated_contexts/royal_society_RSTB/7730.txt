T. mesentericum is said to differ from 7. aestivum by its slightly larger spores, the smaller
size of the fruit-body, with a basal hollow, the absence of fine wrinkles on the peridial
warts and the more numerous veins and darker gleba* (Hesse 1894; Fischer 1897; Malengon
1938; Knapp 1950). Massee (1909), however, in describing British material claims that the
spores are smaller than those of 7. aestivum and that the dissepiments are less tortuous. An
examination of British herbarium material attributed to T. mesentericum suggests that these
specimens are in fact young fruit-bodies of T. aestivum on which Masseeâ€™s description was
based (figure 18/). It is thus unlikely that the records of British specimens of T. mesentericum
are correct.

* Since this account was completed two specimens have been found buried deeply in soil excavated by
a fox. The glebas of these were unusually dark and tinged with purple.
