In STuRGroN's © Annals of Electricity,” vol. 1. p. 124, is a paper by Mr. Hexwoop © On
S the Electric Currents observed in some Metalliferous Veins,” a discovery which the
E author rightly attributes to Mr. Fox*. In the © Annual Reports of the Royal Poly-
= technic Society of Cornwall for 1836, 1841, and 1842, are reports * On Mineral Veins,”
Y by Ropgre WErg Fox, and © On the Electricity of Mineral Veins,” by Roptkr Huxt
S and Professor PHILLIPs. It is more than probable that the electric currents which were
= found by these gentlemen to be traversing the metallic veins in the mines of Cornwall,
A were in many instances portions of great floods of electricity, drifting along the district
in which the mines were placed, forming in fact a portion of larger disturbances attend-
ing on magnetic storms. The derived currents which were collected by their galvano-
meters gave the same contradictory results as to direction that come out from any of
our own cases, looked at individually; but in the papers before me I have no sufficient
data from which to make groups of observations, in order to arrive at probable directions,
nor do I gather whether changes of direction were noted. My impression is that I have
heard of the value of currents being different, collected at different times at the same
Places.
