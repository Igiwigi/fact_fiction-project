An interesting case is furnished by the line \ 3514°10. At eleven-atmospheres
pressure this line appears as a very narrow reversal superimposed upon a broad bright

line (see Plate 7, fig. 2c). Under the microscope the reversal shows a pronounced
displacement towards the violet, amounting to 0°023 A.U. at eleven atmospheres and
0°035 A.U. at six atmospheres. As this was the only violet shift observed, further
investigation seemed desirable. It was found that the spark line showed a displace-
ment of 0°035 A.U. towards the red with respect to the corresponding line in the are
(Plate 7, fig. 1). This fact, and the anomalous behaviour under pressure, may be
co-ordinated if we suppose that in the spark spectrum the line is really a doublet
consisting of the are line \ 351410 together with an enhanced line, the mean wave-
length of the doublet being 3514710 plus 0°035. Under pressure, we should expect the
are line to reverse and the enhanced line to broaden without reversal, a conclusion in
entire agreement with the appearance actually observed. Moreover if the pressure
displacement of the arc line was less than 0°035 A.U,, the reversal should exhibit a
violet displacement with respect to the normal spark line. On this theory the are
line behav: es in a perfectly normal fashion, giving a red displacement of 0°035—"023,
ie., 0°012 A.U. at eleven atmospheres.
