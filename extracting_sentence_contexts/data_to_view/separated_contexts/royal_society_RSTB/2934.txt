Around the cushion is a gap bridged at places by the shreds
of looser tissue, whilst peripherally the seed is closed in by the hypoderm and
palisade layer. The multi-seriate appearance of the last-named is an obvious
consequence of the almost tangential plane in which the testa is cut. The eccentricity of the several zones in both these sections depends, of course, on
the fact that the plane of section is not truly transverse (cf. text-fig. 1). In this
part of the seed even very slight changes in the angle of cutting lead to marked
alterations in the distribution of the various zones.
