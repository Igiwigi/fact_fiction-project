There are
12 stars shown against 5, and the images though far from perfect are probably superior
to the Principe images. The multiplicity of plates is less important, since it is mainly
a question of systematic error. Against this must be set the fact that the five stars shown
on Plates W and X include all the most essential stars; stars 3 and 5 give the extreme
range of deflection, and there is no great gain in including extra stars which play a
passive part. Further, the gain of nearly two extra magnitudes at Sobral must have
meant over-exposure for the brighter stars, which happen to be the really important
ones ; and this would tend to accentuate systematic errors, whilst rendering the defects
of the images less easily recognised by the measurer. Perhaps, therefore, the cloud
was not so unkind to us after all.
