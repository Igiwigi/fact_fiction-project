mass, that bears a close resemblance to the Siderolite of Breitenbach, was almost con-
Stemporaneously found. A little way to the west of the centre of the line joining Rit-
Stersgriin and Breitenbach lies Steinbach, a village in the environs of Johanngeorgenstadt,
&mear Schwartzenberg ; and here in 1751 was also found a mixed meteoric mass in which,
Sas in the two already mentioned, iron, sponge-like in its structure, encloses siliceous mi-
Snerals that do not present a familiar aspect. The three meteorites are, in fact, 80 similar
0 one another and $0 dissimilar to any others in European collections, that there can be
-Slittle doubt they belonged originally to the same meteoric fall.
3 STROMEYER® in the year 1825 examined a siderolite in which he found as much as
S61-88 per cent. of silica. This remarkable result, together with the numbers of his
Sanalysis, he interpreted as indicating the presence of a magnesian trisilicate, probably
Smeaning thereby a sesquisilicate (magnesium epideutosilicate), 'The specimen which he
<analyzed he described as coming from Grimma, in Saxony. This specimen was, in fact,
Sa portion of a mass preserved in the collection of the Duke of Gotha, and doubtless
= believed by STROMEYER to be a portion of a stone which was known to have fallen in
Sthe middle of the sixteenth century in a wood near Naunhof in the neighbourhood of
2 Grimma, CnLapxif, however, held this view to be untenable, grounding his opinion
Zon the completeness of the meteorite preserved at Gotha, both as regards its form and its
Qerust, while he adds that the Naunhof mass must have been far too great to allowof its being
transported, and, indeed, that it had never been rediscovered. It is in every way probable
that the material STROMEYER really had to work upon was from a Saxon locality, and in
fact a specimen from a fall, to which the Rittersgriin and Breitenbach siderolites belong.
Brermgavert believes the fall in question to have been the © Eisenregen” which occurred
at Whitsuntide, 1164, in Saxony, when a mass of iron fell in the town of Meissen $.
An inspection of a polished surface of either of these masses reveals the iron in patches
