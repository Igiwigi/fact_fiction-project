ON THE STUDY OF THE ACTION OF SEA-SNAKE VENOMS. 255

but by the next morning it had practically recovered. Doses of ‘0001 and of
‘00009 gramme per kilo, failed to kill, As the stock of pure venom at our disposal
had now become exhausted, we were unable to continue farther, but it is evident
that 0002 gramme per kilo. might with every probability of accuracy be put down as
the M.L.D. for the cat.

It will be observed that our estimations of the M.L.D.’s of Hnhydrina valakadien
venom agree fairly well with those of Rogers for rats, and with his fragmentary
estimates for rabbits. In both cases his dose is lower than ours. Both he and
we find the dose for the rabbit lower than that for the rat. As to the latter fact, it
is partly explainable by the difficulty of getting the rabbit weighed food-free, and
this, obviously, would raise its apparent weight and so lower the apparent M.L.D.
This difficulty is not so great with the rat, whose real weight can be got fairly nearly
after 24 hours’ starvation, especially as this animal always micturates when handled.

Rogers collected his venom by getting the snakes to bite through indiarubber
sheeting ; ours was obtained by expression from the dissected glands. Whilst our
method facilitates the procuring of a perfectly aseptic product, it appears to yield a
venom diluted with mucus, and consequently of a lower toxicity. We have observed
a similar difference in specimens of Cobra venom obtained by these two methods.

It is of interest to compare the lethality of Cobra venom with that of the
