The adhesion of this
material to the cord is probably more direct in practice than it might seem to be from
the above account. All the contents of the gut are very sticky, and the least contact
will cause adhesion. It may be supposed that the actual condition in the living animal
comprises not so much a central main cord and a steady stream of material along the
rest of the wall, as a main cord which collects all the other material through the medium
of many irregular threads from the other parts of the wall, this collection representing,
in fact, another function of the rotation. This can be confirmed by observation: If an
animal is opened in the usual way, five or six threads will probably be seen extending
from various parts of the lateral ciliated tract to the central cord, and if they are
removed with a needle, they will rapidly reform. It has been seen that the wall of the mid-gut is predominantly secretory.
