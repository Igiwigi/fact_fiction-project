Proof. As in the previous proofs, we assume without loss of generality that ; > 0 and a; = 1.
Using the fact that w; solves the transport equation (2.5), and using the explicit formula (3.4) for
the velocity of the centres, we compute via an integration by parts that

=h +h.

To simplify the notation slightly, upon a shift in the spatial variables, we will assume that X; =0
in what follows.
