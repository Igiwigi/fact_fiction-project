Figure 18. Graphic showing, as a greyscale (colour) plot, how ultimate load-bearing capacity varied with location of subpanel
on the global GFRP blast panel as viewed from rear. (Online version in colour.)

figure 16 and 3L in figure 17 for various compressive loading stages labelled with reference to the
full load-displacement plots given in figure 14.

Clearly visible from these images are residual cracks that were in place in the front glass
sheet from blast testing. Also visible in these DIC images is the fact that wrinkling has
taken place in the front skin, mainly due to discontinuity across the facesheet as a result
of the skin cracking. This is an interesting feature, as it shows that the two facesheets still
maintain some connection through the foam, so not all out-of-plane displacement is away from
the centreline.

Figure 19 shows a summary of the load—displacement plots for the subpanels of CA1 tested.
Figures 20 and 21 show the DIC for out-of-plane displacement in the CA1 subpanels 1R and 4R,
respectively. The point during each test where the plots have been extracted are marked in terms
of compressive displacement relating to the plots in figure 19. Similar to those figures produced
for the GFRP subpanels, each compressive stage shows DIC images to illustrate the variation of
out-of-plane motion and ¢, along the height of the panel front. The carbon skins suffered minimal
damage during blast testing, which can be seen from the even displacements in the DIC images.
