Tt is not within the scope of the present paper to review the conflicting theories
which have been propounded in recent years as to the significance of the nucleolus.
The theory which most closely approaches the one I have adopted above is that of
Hacker (1893 and 1895), by which the nucleolar substance is regarded as a
by-product of chromatin activity, a waste product in so far as the nucleus is
concerned. Within the nucleolus this substance is assumed to undergo further
. changes, producing on the one hand the firmer peripheral layer, and on the other
the substance of the vacuoles, these latter being either periodically or finally
discharged. It will be noticed that in this theory HAcker regards the firm crust
of the nucleolus as one of the by-products of the nucleolar activity, whereas
I interpret it as the most recently deposited, and as yet unaltered, nucleolar
substance. A more important difference, however, between HickeEnr’s conception
and my own lies in the fact that Hicker recognises only one souree—the chromatin
—for the nucleolar material. As a result of this difference HAckER associates
cessation of nucleolar activity with commencing concentration of the chromatin, and
not with the cessation of cytoplasmic activity. He, therefore, interprets the
decreased staining capacity of the later-formed nucleolar material as indicating a
gradual change in the chemical nature of the waste products of the chromatin
during its period of waning activity.

Hicker (1893, p. 291) describes for the living Echinus ovum the appearance
of the nucleolar material as weakly basophile spherules which, after circling round
the nucleolus, fuse with it. That Hicker thus makes the nucleolar substance unite
with the nucleolus in the form of spherules does not constitute a very important
difference from the condition I have described for Antedon, for the manner in which
