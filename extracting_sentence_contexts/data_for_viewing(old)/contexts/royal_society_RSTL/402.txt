190 Farther observations on the current that often

however, it is probable he was, although in deep water.*
Accordingly, one may conceive that his position, at the end of
the calm, might have been about the meridian of Cape Clear,
or somewhat to the eastward of it. It must be recollected,
that in running towards the channel, after the calm, he had
$till to encounter the same adverse current : and that, pos-
sibly, to within thirty or forty miles of his seeing the Lizard.

But, whether his position, during the time that he was
under the influence of the current, be a degree more or less,
to the eastward, the fact bears the same on the main ques-
tion ;- since a ship, in crossing the stream, wheresoever it may
be situated, must have been carried out of her reckoning ; and
thereby placed in danger; in the event of thick weather hap-
pening subsequently, and preventing their setting themselves
right, by an observation of latitude.

His idea of the eastern edge of the stream,'is worth remark-

that in about the parallel of 49%, it approached to the meridian
of Ushant. And with respect to the direction of the stream,
