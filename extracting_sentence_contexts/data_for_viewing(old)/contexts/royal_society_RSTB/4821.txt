certain meshworks of arteries and veins that formed localised plexuses or retia of fine
anastomosing vessels. These retia are found upon vessels supplying many different
regions of the body, and occur somewhat haphazard, in genera belonging to practically
all the leading groups of Vertebrates. A good summary of their distribution will be
found in Minne Epwarps’ ‘ Legons sur la Physiologie,’ vol. 3, 1858; it is sufficient
here to point out that their structure and composition is far from being similar in all
cases (MiitneR, 17, p. 275); and that, although there is noticeable a tendency to
their formation in aquatic air-breathing animals, both birds and mammals, their
occurrence depends neither on blood relationship nor on a universal similarity of habit,
for they are to be found in creatures of such different mode of life as fish, birds, ungulates,
cetacea, edentates and lemurs.

Tt is a remarkable fact that in spite of the curiosity that these structures originally
aroused, little attention appears to have been bestowed upon them for the last fifty
or sixty years. This lapse of interest may no doubt be attributed to the predominant
importance assumed in more recent times by purely morphological anatomy, although

when looked at from a physiological standpoint, there is no question that these vascular
adaptations are of very considerable interest and deserve more study than they have
hitherto received.
