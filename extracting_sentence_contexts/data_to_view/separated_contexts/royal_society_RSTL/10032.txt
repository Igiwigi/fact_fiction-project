Z The external features of the dise have been fully dealt with by AGass1z, and he
Balso explained its function by observations on the habits of the larva. We have
Zulready quoted (p. 371) a pasxage from AGass1z' memoir showing how the young
'BFishes use the disc to attach themselves firmly to any convenient object, The discs
appear in fact to be highly efficient organs of attachment, in that the young Fish
Sean remain 8uspended by them to the sides of the jar, even after the water has
Zbeen lowered below the level at which they are attached. EZ The dise is formed two or three days before hatching, and from Acass1z' state-
Ements, it appears bo come into use immediately the young Fish is liberated from the
HSegs membranes.
