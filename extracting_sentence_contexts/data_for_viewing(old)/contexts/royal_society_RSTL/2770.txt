The expression for the heights also agrees very nearly with observation, as I shall
show, but for this purpose we must 8uppose « = IB, L2 = sin 232 30.

The agreement in these cases is the more remarkable, on account of the want, of
symmetry in the functions which thus occur. The curve, the ordinate of which re-
presents the time of high water (reckoned from the moon's transit), is not symme-
trical with regard to its maximum ordinates. The curye, the ordinate of which
represents the height of high water, is not symmetrical with regard to its mean line
of abscissas. Yet in both these cases the theoretical and obseryed curve agree within
a minute and an inch during their whole course, It is impossible to doubt, under
these cireumstances, that the theoretical formula truly represents the obseryed facts.

4. But this agreement belongs to the mean of all the obseryations ; and we have
further to seek for the alteration in the formula, which is requisite in order to repre-
sent the effect of changes in the parallax and declination of the sun and moon. In
these respects also we find a near agreement of the theory and observation. By the
equilibrium-theory, the height /' of the lunar tide ought to be proportional to the
cube of the moon's parallax; it is exactly or nearly s0: by the same theory the
height 4 ought to diminish when the moon's declination increases, and by a quantity
proportional to the square of the sine of the declination. It is found to do £0 with
great, precision.

5. But the equilibrium-theory, since it does not point out the existence of the quan-
