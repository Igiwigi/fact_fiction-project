where JT := Tale; e341, and a~,«+ €R" are vectors of price thresholds. We are interested in
the event Y = Y(«~,a+) of anomalous price fluctuations (or price spikes) defined as

Y(a~,a*) ={& ¢ E:LMP(é) ¢] [lo;,o7*T} (2.9)

which, in view of equation (2.8) and the regime ¢ — 0, is a rare event. Without loss of generality,
we only consider thresholds «~,a+ such that the event Y(w~,a+) has a non-empty interior in R".
Otherwise, the fact that zg is non degenerate would imply P(Y(a~,*)) =0.

We observe that the above formulation of a price spike event is quite general, and can cover
different application scenarios, as we now outline. For example, if « = ait =—a; >0 for alli, then
the price spike event becomes

Y(a) ={€ € E: ||LMP||o = max |LMP;| >a},
i=l)...
and models the occurrence of a price spike larger than a prescribed value a. On the other hand, if
we define a =LMP(n) — B and at= LMP(ug) + B, for B € R'_, the spike event
