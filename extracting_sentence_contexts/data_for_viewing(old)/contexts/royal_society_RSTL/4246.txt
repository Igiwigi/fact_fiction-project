placed in the central cellular organization, and supposes that its fibres are also de-
creasing in size and are inflected by being filled with gas or oxygen endosmose.
The incurvation of this tissue always takes place inwards, and that of the cellular
system outwards. According to DuTrocner, the influence of light has a tendency to
diminish the filling up of the cells and impair their power of incuryation, and, on the
contrary, to increase the production of oxygen gas that creates a bending in the op-
posite direction in the fibrous tissue. He has grounded this theory on some curious
experiments. For instance, by cutting in a longitudinal direction a stem of Medicago
sativa bent towards the light, he saw that the part of the stem which had been in
the light increased its curvature, while the other, on the contrary, became first
straight and then bent in an opposite direction. There was then, according to him,
an antagonism between the two slips, and this fact was sufficient to overthrow
DecanpoiLt's theory, in which, as the exterior slip is supposed to be the only active
one, its incuryation ought to have been preserved or even increased in the primitive
direction. I have repeated the same experiment with the same result on many stems
or footstalks, among others on the footstalk of the leaf of Calla wthiopica. But in
trying to repeat the sections in all directions, I observed that the bending of the
slips was always towards the bark, or outwards, and that the position of the stem
with regard to the light had nothing at all to do with it. This phenomenon is due
to the contraction or the resistance to any elongation of the exterior cuticle.

Thas, when a seginent of stem or footstalk is immersed in water with its cuticle
entire, the liquid, penetrating into the cells, fills the cellular tissne, renders it turgid,
and there results an elongation of the central parts; but as the fibres of the cuticle
