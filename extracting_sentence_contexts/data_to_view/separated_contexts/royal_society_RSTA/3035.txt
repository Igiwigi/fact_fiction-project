But the weighting of the molecule, besides
diminishing the number of the vapour bands, causes the general absorption to extend
further towards the rays of longer wave-length. At constant pressure the effect of
rise of temperature might be expected to cause an increased number of molecules to
cross the path of the rays, which is the same in effect as increasing the quantity
of substance, or lengthening the column of vapour; reduction of pressure would
therefore be expected to have an opposite effect, by reducing their number and
increasing the mean path of the molecules—the absorption bands, if caused by
vibrations within the molecule, would as a consequence become more distinct. This
is, in fact, what is actually seen in the least refrangible groups, between AA 2750 and
2500, particularly when benzene vapour is maintained at 100°C. and the pressure is
gradually reduced to 4mm. (See fig.
