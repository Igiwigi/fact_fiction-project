The close commissural connexion between the hypoglossal nucleus (J', fig.

31, Plate X.) and the vagal nucleus (IH, 1') has been already pointed out. And lastly,
Â®we have scen that the lower end of the column of cells constituting the nucleus of the
Smotor root of the trigeminus is imbedded in the columns which ascend from the olivary
Sbody. But whether the olivary bodies really act through the channels jus: mentioned,
Sand thus coordinate the moyements of articulation, is not proved by the anatomical facts
alone. On the other hand, amongst birds, in which scarcely any traces of olivary bodies
are to be found, the Parrot-tribe have the power of distinctly articulating particular
words; while in the Porpoise, which emits only a kind of moaning sound, the olivary bodies
are enormously developed*. Experiment throws no light whatever on this subject, 80
