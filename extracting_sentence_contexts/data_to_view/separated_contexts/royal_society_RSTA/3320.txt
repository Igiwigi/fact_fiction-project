If certain lines are increased in brilliancy by the
introduction of self-induction, as in the case of the spectra of metals of the iron
group, we may conclude, with Dr. Hemsaxecn, that here the effect of the oscillations
is to raise the temperature of the vapour already formed between the electrodes by

less than it would be in the case of the non-oscillatory discharge, the vapour will be

the initial discharge.t Since the amount of heat liberated in this initial discharge is
in a state of less advanced dissociation ; but if the amount of heat liberated in the
succeeding discharges is more than sufficient to compensate for the loss by radiation,
which must be considerable on account of the high temperature of the vapour, then
the temperature of the vapour will be increased and consequently also the intensity
of some of the lines. It seems to me that a satisfactory explanation of the phenomena I have observed
may be obtained by considering them as the results simply of variations of tempe-
rature, Of course, it cannot be denied that spectra may be formed by other means
than a pure and simple elevation of temperature, but these methods ultimately
reduce themselves to chemical transformations and thermal changes. This tempe-
rature hypothesis, which accounts in the simplest way for the production of the
spectra, finds considerable support in the fact that the stars give spectra which are
similar in their constitution to those obtained in the laboratory by electrical methods. It is difficult to imagine any other but a purely thermal cause for the luminosity of
stars. Tn conelusion, I wish to express my best thanks to Professor Scrrusrer for his
