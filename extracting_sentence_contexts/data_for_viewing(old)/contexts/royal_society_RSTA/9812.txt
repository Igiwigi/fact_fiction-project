(+6 or +54,) Dy, (10).

The order (4) of the first line is so large that the error limits are too wide for absolute
certainty. In fact better agreement on the whole for the satellites would be
obtained by taking the difference as 564,, i.¢., 40,,, 6, being specially associated with
this group (see p. 331). The line 6269'28 is separated from 6266°36 by 6°44, and is
therefore possibly the lateral (+28) D,, (5).

The table shows of course the known essential difference between the behaviour of
the elements of Group 2 and that of Groups 1, 3, 6, signified by the signs of « in the
formula. It consists in the fact that in Group 2 the orders are formed in succession
by the addition of multiples, whilst in the others it is by subtraction, with the
exception that Cu and Ag of Group 1 are additive. But there are certain other
features which appear between the different sub-groups when higher orders are
looked at. The alkalies all show a gradually decreasing decrement with a sudden
dive. Na then shows a sudden rise continued for several lines, and Cs has a similar
indication. Cu and Ag with only a few lines observed show decreasing increments.
The alkaline earths show decreasing increments and a sudden dive (Mg excepted).
The Zn sub-group shows decreasing increments and then a sudden ascent. The Al
Sub-group 3 show decreasing decrements (Sc decreasing increments). O with 8 and
Se show decreasing increments. In fact, were it not for the very clear behaviour of
Zn, Cd, and Hg, the evidence would rather point to the conclusion that in each
group, the low melting-point sub-group show subtraction (« positive) and the high
