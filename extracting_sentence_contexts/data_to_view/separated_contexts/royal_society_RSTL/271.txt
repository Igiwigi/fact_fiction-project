Thus I
procured an infusion of bark, which I poured on the second part
of the bark, and this strengthened infusion again on the third
part, and $0 on, to the fifth. But, as a certain portion of the
infusion will remain attached to the wood of the bark, after the
infusion is poured or drawn off, I added a third pound of water
to the first part, and then followed up the infusion on the several
parts, till the three pounds of water, or 80-much of them as could
be separated from the bark, were united in the fifth vessel;
from which I generally obtained about one pint of strong infu-
son of bark:*

"To a certain quantity of this infusion, I added a given mea-
sure of the s0lution of glue; which formed an immediate preci-
pitate,that may be separated from the infusion by filtering paper. When dried, it is a substance formed by the chemical union of
the matter of skin with the tanning principle, and is, in fact, a
powder of leather. By saturating the infusion with the solution
of glue, the whole of the tanning principle may be separated
by precipitation. Â®*
