The calculated mean values of k are 1.80 + 0.42 for n=4, or 1.70 £0.38 for n=5. This value of k is
independent of rock fraction and strain-rate and can be treated as an independent constant in the

flow law: n .

The calculated flow laws for D2O (figure 5) do not fit the measured data as well as the H2O
data. The observed differences may be due to relatively large errors on the calculated value of
k, the scarcity of DO data points, and the fact that the D2O experiments were carried out on
two different experimental set-ups. Again, we can suggest that a GSS deformation mechanism
is present at the lowest strain-rate for the 10vol.% data. Unfortunately, there are currently
insufficient data to confirm this, or to deduce whether any change in deformation mechanism
occurs in D2O samples at similar strain-rates to those found in H20.

The predicted flow law at 233 K for D2O ice + 10 vol.% rock overestimates the measured stress
of the single data point at these conditions. Previously, we drew the conclusion that, for a 50 vol.%
rock sample, an underestimation of the stress was due to the lower ice fraction present. However,
with a low rock fraction, we would expect a much closer relationship to that of the pure ice. It
is, of course, difficult to draw conclusions from one datum, but we suggest that the conditions
for this deformation run may have been within a low-temperature deformation regime, as seen
previously in pure H2O-ice samples [11]. It may be the case, as mentioned above, that our higher-
