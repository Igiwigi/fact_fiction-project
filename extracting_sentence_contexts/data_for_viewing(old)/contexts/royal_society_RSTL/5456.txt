Art, (b.) It ought to be observed that the preceding reasoning depends essentially
upon the circumstance of beiug left arbitrary.., If z were, given the proposition would
no longer be true. In fact, on that supposition, then roots, reducingito # distinet/ roots
would imply the existence of x—7 conditions between the 2 roots; and consequently
n—i independent equations would subsist between the 7 coefficients, and functions
could be formed of 7 only of the coefficients, which would satisfy the prescribed con-
dition of vanishing when the roots. resolved. themselves into i, groups of distinct
identities.
