C. LLOYD ON THE CHOICE OF HOSTS AND

parasitism in the given population is between 80 and 95Â°%,. The cause of this failure
cannot be the fact that the females were deterred from attacking these unparasitized
hosts, because of some inhibitory odour left on them by other females (as occurs in
Trichogramma evanescens) for only one female was confined with every twenty-five hosts. The reason appears to lie in the frequency of contact with the hosts which had been
parasitized by the female in the 24 hr. of the experiment. Naturally, these hosts
contain eggs of Ovencyrtus, and it has been conclusively demonstrated above that the
female needs but slight provocation to superparasitize them.
