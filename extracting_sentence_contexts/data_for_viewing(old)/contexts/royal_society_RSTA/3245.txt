and decrease when the IR brane is pushed to large y and o — 0. Since smaller bulk masses
make the wave functions grow faster towards the IR, this leads to fermions which become
increasingly IR-localized when the IR brane is pushed to infinity. The wave function overlap
with the Higgs near the IR brane then grows. As a result, the four-dimensional effective Yukawa
coupling increases when the IR brane is sent to infinity [3], as shown in figure 5. Such behaviour
can be understood from equation (6.2) by using o-dependent values of cL, cg which decrease
when o — 0. This mechanism can be relevant for CP violation for all quarks and enables a large
variation of the Yukawa couplings, from values of order 1 to today’s small values of the light
quarks.

A particularly interesting spin-off in this construction is that modified fermion wave functions
give suppression of CP-violating processes which are on the other hand very constraining in usual
RS. In fact, the overlap between the wave functions of the KK gluon and the light fermions is now
reduced in the vicinity of the IR brane, while remaining the same on the IR brane itself—where the
Higgs is localized—in order to lead to the same four-dimensional Yukawas. The decreased overall
overlap causes the four-dimensional effective coupling of light quarks to KK gluons to become
suppressed, which eases constraints in K — K mixing as illustrated in figure 6. The resulting bound
on the KK scale is weakened by a factor of 3, significantly ameliorating the little hierarchy problem
in RS [3].


Another realization mentioned in [3] to induce varying Yukawas is to add an operator on the
IR brane that effectively changes the value of the Yukawa coupling as the position of the IR brane
changes. This mechanism enables variations of order 1 for the Yukawas and can be relevant for
CP violation if applied to the top quark.
