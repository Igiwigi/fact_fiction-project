entropy production a, external fluxes and the structure of the system. Increase of o leads to the
increase of entropy outgoing fluxes. This increase decreases the temperature of outgoing fluxes
or increases the leaving flux of heat for the prescribed temperature. In every case, this effect leads
to the reduction of the mechanical work yield or to an increase of the separation work.

Consider, for example, a thermal machine, i.e. the unit which transforms into work the heat
received from an ‘upper’ or hot reservoir, i.e. the reservoir of high temperature T , (heat source).
The state of the circulating working body is changing cyclically; the working body delivers a part
of its energy to the ‘lower’ or cool reservoir, i.e. the reservoir of low temperature T_(heat sink).

We shall designate averaged intensity of heat flux transferred from hot source by q,; the
corresponding averaged intensity of heat flux transferred to cold source is designated by q.
The efficiency index, which is, in fact, the first law efficiency, n =p/q4, is defined as the ratio
of work produced and driving heat q+.

Let us consider the effect of o on n. The balance equations for energy and entropy are

q+ —q-—p=0 (G1)

and
