<V "To a point of the first tigure there corresponds in the second figure a point, to a line a

corresponding with the line or point which is the locus in guo of the range or pencil in
the other figure. And generally, to any curve 'of any order and class in the first figure,
and to its incunts and tangents, there correspond in the second figure a curve of the swme
order and class, and the ineunts and tangents of such curve.

195. It is to be remarked, that it is not by any means necessary that the word or the
words plane, point, and line, or consequently the words order and class, should have the
same significations as regards the two figures respectively. The theory of homography.
as above explained, in fact comprises what is commonly termed the theory of homo-
graphy and also the theory of reciprocity.

class, have also the ordinary significations as regards the two figures Toapoctinily; we
have here the ordinary theory of homography, in which, to any. range of Points or
pencil of lines in the first figure, there corresponds a homographic range of Points or
