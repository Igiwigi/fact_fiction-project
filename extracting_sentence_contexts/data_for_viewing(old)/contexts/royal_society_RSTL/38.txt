veracity of the great Borichius, who declares to the
World, that he made his Oyl of Turpentine and Spirit
of Nitre to take Fire and Flame ; yet for my part, aſter
ſo many unſucceſsful Experiments made with: the great-
eſt Accuracy I could, I muſt ſtill own my incapacity
to-perform it : But if you add ſome drops of Balſam
of Sulphur to that Oyl of Turpentine, the Effe& will
then very certainly ſucceed, and your Mixture advance
_ to anaQual Flame. However it may prove as to this

laſt mentioned Mixture, the great variety of other Li-
quids that are made to kindle and produce flames, will
now put the Matter of Fact out of Queſtion, which I
am-told has been by many Experimentors doubted of.
