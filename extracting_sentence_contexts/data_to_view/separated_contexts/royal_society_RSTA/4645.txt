The regions such as 92g also exist in various Mach reflection—diffraction
configurations. Theorem 5.1 applies to such regions whenever the solution (U, V,p, p) is C°? and
the gradient of the tangential component of (U,V) is continuous. In fact, theorem 5.1 indicates
that, for the solution g of (2.5) with (2.6), the Cll regularity of g and the continuity of the
tangential component of the velocity field (U, V) = V¢ are optimal across the sonic are Ionic. Remark 5.3. The importance of the potential flow equation (1.1) with (1.2) in the time-
dependent Euler flows even through weak discontinuities was also observed by Hadamard [51]
through a different argument.
