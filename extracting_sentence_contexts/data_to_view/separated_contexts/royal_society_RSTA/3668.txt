131 but if we put in these values and then proceed to make @ infinite, certain parts of
the expressions for U and V do not give finite integrals in the limit. This is due to the fact that the conditions of rigid equilibrium require shears
Lb/2a at the two ends (fig. viii.). Fig. viii

These shears Lb/2a will produce a deflection due to bending alone, which,
calculated from the Euler-Bernoulli formula, comes to
