If so, then when the animal is actively casting, a valve would occur diverting the blood from
the blood pump into the peduncular vessel. I merely describe this as something which
looks possible from the structure, and even probable, but I have no direct evidence for it. If a specimen were obtained which had been fixed instantaneously with the body cast out
of the mantle, then the arrangement of the parenchymatous sheets would show whether
they did in fact close the opening into the prosoma and act as a barrier. Unfortunately
however, in all well-fixed specimens the body is withdrawn into the mantle. The histological constitution of these sheets is interesting.
