_ Evidently a is transcendental over H, and G = H(u). The ring & is now defined to be that
_ yaluation ring of G over H in which w has positive value. © is a rank 1 discrete valuation
_ ring; consequently the same is true of § = Fn G. The maximal ideals of 6 and § are re-
spectively Q = uG and P = 1%, so Q = PG. Because the pth power of every element of
G belongs to F, G is integrally dependent on § (and hence © is the only valuation ring of
G lying over %).
The degree of Q over & is 1; that is to say, every element of G is congruent mod Q to an

element of %. In fact, any element of © is obviously congruent mod Q to an element of H;

Sand hence the assertion follows without difficulty from the relations
