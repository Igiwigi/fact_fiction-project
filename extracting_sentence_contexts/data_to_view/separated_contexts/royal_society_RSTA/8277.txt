Advantage is taken of this to obtain
a solution by successive approximations. The first step, given on the right of the
initial determinant, consists in the elimination of each By between each pair of equations
Na and Ng. On account of the fact that one such pair of equations is redundant (see
Section I E), equations 6x and 68 are omitted. Since the B’s are only of the order of
1/30 of the A’s, the coefficients of B,, B,, etc., have all been divided by 100, so that the
unknowns are 100 B,, 100 B,, ete. In order to see what terms are negligible com-
pared with others, it is only necessary to multiply the coefficients of 100 B,, ete., by 3
and to compare these figures with the coefficients of A,, etc.
