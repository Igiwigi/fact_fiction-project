Our work with SR X-ray beams in straightforward breast imaging using clinical detectors
also proved fruitful. This supported the hypothesis that a reduced dose with equivalent clinical
information could be gained by using monochromatic X-ray illumination [10].

4. SR X-ray phase-contrast imaging

In 1997, our colleagues in the United States were working on scatter rejection techniques for
SR imaging. Their idea was to make an extremely fine anti-scatter slit using diffraction X-ray
optics. If the illumination is monochromatic, even slightly scattered photons from the sample
can be removed using Bragg diffraction from a suitable crystal placed after the sample. The
Darwin width of the reflectivity curve at the particular wavelength acts as a fine angular
filter. This idea proved remarkably successful. In fact, by changing the reflection angle of the
analyser crystal, rays with a narrow range of scatter angles could be used to create images;
providing useful alternative image information other than simple attenuation. The sensitivity
of this technique to sample density changes turned out to be exquisite [11]. The technique
