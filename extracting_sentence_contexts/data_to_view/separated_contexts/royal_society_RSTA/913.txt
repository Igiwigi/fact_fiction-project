The links also
become stronger, because they become shorter and the mean orientating couple on the
water molecules increases. In consequence, the cohesion of the clay particles, 1.e., the
hardness of the crumbs, increases. The hypothesis involves two assumptions, which have not yet been directly tested,
though there is some indirect evidence in their favour :â€”

(1) that a system of the type postulated is in fact mechanically stable ;
(2) that the number of cations dissociating from a clay particle in a system that is
losing water decreases less rapidly than the number of water molecules. The hypothesis accounts for the formation of crumbs by other polar liquids as well as
water, and for their non-formation by non-polar liquids. It also explains the necessity
for the clays to possess dissociating cations, i.e., base exchange capacity.
