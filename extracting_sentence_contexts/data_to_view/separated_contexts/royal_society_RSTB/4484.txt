Both from the structural and from the historical side, the balance of evidence is at
present decidedly in favour of the Araucarinee being the more primitive group, and
the resemblances which the latter group shows to the Cordaitales (BURLINGAME, 1915)
are in accord with the view that they are more primitive than the Abietinem. | However, the facts at our disposal do not appear definitely to indicate that the one
group is necessarily derived from the other. An independent origin from a common,
source is, at any rate, a safe hypothesis. (b) Fossil Podocurpinee.—Unfortunately, the fossil history of the Podocarpineex—
the family with which we are here more intimately concerned—is very imperfectly
known.
