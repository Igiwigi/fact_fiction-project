This theme issue pursues an exploration of the potential of taking into account the environmental
sensitivity of development to explaining the evolution of metazoan life cycles, with special focus on
complex life cycles and the role of developmental plasticity. The evolution of switches between
alternative phenotypes as a response to different environmental cues and the evolution of the control
of the temporal expression of alternative phenotypes within an organism’s life cycle are here treated
together as different dimensions of the complex relationships between genotype and phenotype, fos-
tering the emergence of a more general and comprehensive picture of phenotypic evolution through
a quite diverse sample of case studies.
