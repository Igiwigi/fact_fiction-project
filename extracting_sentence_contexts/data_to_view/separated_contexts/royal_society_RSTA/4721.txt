But, at least for the case that V is a W*-algebra with no summand of type Iz, we know that
such an assignment of values to all physical quantities, preserving functional relations between
them, does not exist. This is exactly the content of the famous Kochen-Specker theorem [33]
and its generalization to von Neumann algebras [34]. Hence, the Kochen-Specker theorem is
equivalent to the fact that the spectral presheaf, our quantum state space, has no points. This
was first observed by Isham & Butterfield [5] and, for the case of the von Neumann algebra B(H),
by Isham et al. [6]. Mathematically, the fact that Â© has no points is an expression of its character as a non-
commutative space.
