[54]. In fact, even alleles that are recessive lethal to the diploid
organism can increase in frequency if their effects are suffi-
ciently beneficial for within-ejaculate competition [55].
However, because these alleles are recessive lethal, they
cannot go to fixation and a stable polymorphism prevents
the population from reaching its fitness maximum [56].

Figure 2. Biological mechanisms facilitating versus suppressing within-

condensation in developing sperm would largely silence gene
expression (e.g. [31]), and that cytoplasmic bridges between
spermatids would essentially homogenize any potential
remaining differences [32]. The very fact that sperm are so
small may be related to avoiding selfish genetic (cytoplasmic)
elements acting in sperm [33], and the evolution of other
aspects of spermatogenesis may have been fuelled
by intragenomic conflict with selfish genetic elements [34].
Nevertheless, there is now ample evidence for post-meiotic
transcription [7,32,35,36] and many transcripts are not equally
shared via cytoplasmic bridges [37-40]. Ways for males to con-
