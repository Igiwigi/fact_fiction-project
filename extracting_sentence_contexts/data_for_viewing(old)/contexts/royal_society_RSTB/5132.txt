50 R. H. BURNE: ANATOMY OF

carry nutrient matter from the digestive organs to the periphery ; but, on the other
hand, its wide distribution upon the mucous membrane of the mouth, pharynx and
gills—where, as JouRDAIN points out, its terminal factors would be in as’ close
association with the water as are the branchial respiratory vessels—suggests that
possibly its contents may here take up some constituent of the water and convey
it to the walls of the blood-vessels and lymph sinuses, and to the skin. This suggestion
is possibly supported by the fact that a complete two-way circulation of lymph is,
so far as known, peculiar to fishes, and does not occur in land Vertebrates, the flow in
them being in one direction only—from the periphery to the heart.

It will be obvious that the above suggestions are very tentative, and that many
anatomical points remain obscure. It is not, for instance, certain how red blood
corpuscles, in excess of those found in the ordinary lymphatics, gain access to these
vessels ; exact information with regard to the connections between this system and the
lymphatics is still very imperfect ; and it is not clear how the propulsion of the lymph
is brought about, though with regard to this latter point the probable sucking action due
to the respiratory movements of the pharynx acting upon the valved lymph sinus
within the thyroid, should not be overlooked (p. 26).
