83. Before discussing these equations in detail, it will be shown how in the theory
of reversibility certain very important restrictions must be imposed on the generality
of @ as a function of 6, V, and H, in order that known experimental facts shall not be
contradicted. These restrictions seem, for the most part, to depend on the particular
form of theory adopted in this paper; but as the particular features of the theory
which are thus involved are held by many physicists, it is of interest to notice exactly
what part of our fundamental assumptions causes the restrictions. The direct cause
of the trouble is the equation B = 47gV/. Now, it will be remembered (§ 16 above)
that this equation flows from the assumptions (1) that / contains H and not B
explicitly, and (2) that 470 = VVH. If, then, it can be proved experimentally that
the consequences of the restrictions developed below (the chief of which is that
thermomagnetic phenomena involve dissipation of energy, and that a part of the
thermoelectric phenomena do the same), are contrary to fact; one or both of these
assumptions must be relinquished. Thus, perhaps, in this unexpected quarter, will be
found a practical test of the truth of Maxwett’s fundamental assumption 47€ = VVH.
The consequences of relinquishing either of the above assumptions would probably be
much the same, since it would lead to the physicist being compelled to recognise with

Professor J. J. Tomson [‘Applications,’ § 17 (4)] magnetic coordinates independently
of electric coordinates. It is interesting to note in this connection that Professor
J. J. Tomson (ibid., § 59) working on somewhat different lines from this paper, has
also found that thermomagnetic phenomena have a distinct bearing on the equation
