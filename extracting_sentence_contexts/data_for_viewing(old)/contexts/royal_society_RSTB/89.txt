hitherto discovered which had any claim to that position.}

Seventeen years elapsed before further traces of this fruit were discovered. But a
few weeks ago Mr. James Lomax, of Ratcliffe, one of that small band of auxiliaries to
whose diligence as collectors I have long been indebted for many of the materials upon
which my researches have been carried on, brought me some new sections made from
a nodule given to him by another of my assistants, Isaac EaRnsHAWw, of Oldham.
To my delight I found in these sections several specimens of the long-wished-for
strobilus. What remained of the nodule was subsequently cut in such directions as
promised to afford the best results. We have now not only much additional
knowledge respecting the structure of the strobilus, but the clearest proofs that I was
not mistaken in 1869 when I expressed my strong conviction that it was the true
fruit of Calamites. The most absolute of these proofs is seen in the fact that each
of three of these newly-discovered strobili had its basal peduncle attached to it ; and
that these peduncles are ordinary Calamitean twigs of the type to which our French
friends have long assigned the generic name of Arthropitus, and which they have,
until recently, regarded as a Gymnospermous genus,

The sections represented in the plates have been made in as many directions as our
specimens admitted of; the only way in which their complicated structures could be
resolved.

Like the Calamites, each strobilus has a fistular medulla. The fistular cavity, marked
a in each figure displaying it, is surrounded by a thin medulla, 6. In the transverse
