Based on
their observations, Monismith et al. [48] hypothesize the existence of (rotational) Gerstner waves
in wave tank experiments, a hypothesis further discussed in Weber [49]. Although the prospect of
Gestner waves is theoretically appealing, resolution of this debate will more probably be found in
careful consideration of the time-varying nature of any mean flow field, noting that even if stable,
the convection solution of Longuet-Higgins [66] will take a very long time to establish, and the
boundary conditions imposed at both ends. In fact, Paprota et al. [71], who take their measurements after a relatively short wave train of

periodic waves in a relatively long flume, find good agreement with the irrotational theory of : =
Stokes [1], supplemented by a uniform return flow reflecting volume conservation in a closed : S
domain. For waves of intermediate water depth (kh = O(1)) and very large steepness, Grue & : 2
Kolaas [72] find good agreement with nonlinear irrotational theory in the interior of the fluid : &
in a set of very high-quality experiments. Their experiments are stopped long before the first 22
waves reach the end of the flume, but the length of their wave train remains long relative to [4
the water depth.
