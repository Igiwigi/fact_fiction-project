DR. D. FERRIER ON THE BRAIN OF MONKEYS. 481

The lungs were normal, of pinkish colour. The heart was dilated, and its cavities full.
The stomach contained a few coagula of milk which it had swallowed. The other vis-
cera presented no abnormal appearance.

There was therefore nothing to account for death in the animal except the prostration
consequent on the operation in an animal of weakly constitution.

The only facts, therefore, which can be relied on as proved by this experiment are the
negative results as regards the individual senses and the powers of motion. 'The
abolition of appetite was not absolute, but nearly 80. 'The occipital lobes were not
entirely removed, as will be seen by the figures.
