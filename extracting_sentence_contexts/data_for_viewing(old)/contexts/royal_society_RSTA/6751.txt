OF MAGNETIC HYSTERESIS IN HETEROGENEOUS ALLOYS 641

more ferromagnetic segregates is rendered possible by the excess of the less ferromagnetic
phase, so that high coercivity can be developed; at the same time the main phase is suffi-
ciently ferromagnetic to contribute significantly to the remanence of the alloy. It should
be mentioned that Bradleyâ€™s scheme of the constitution of the alloy is not accepted in detail
by all other workers in the field (e.g. Snoek 1939), though the single domain particle inter-
pretation of the magnetic properties seems equally compatible with the alternative scheme.
Few conclusions seem to have been drawn from microphotographic studies of this alloy,
though some of the photographs given by Kiuti (1941) appear to indicate the occurrence,
under some conditions, of precipitate particles in the form of ellipsoids.

The preceding paragraph illustrates the fact that it is not possible to discuss adequately
even one alloy with brevity; each alloy raises its own complex of problems. It is felt that it
is better to leave the theoretical treatment of this paper to be taken into consideration in
future studies of the magnetic properties of alloys, rather than to give here what would
necessarily be an inadequate discussion of a large number of particular examples. It is,
however, proper to state that there are a considerable number of alloys for which coercivities
much higher than 600 have been reported, as in the systems Fe-Pt (1750), Co-Pt (3650),
Fe-Nd (4300), Fe-Ag (5000), Ag-Al-Mn (5000) ; it seems very difficult to explain such high
values along lines other than those suggested here.

There is, finally, one remarkable effect which should be mentioned in relation to the
present treatment, namely the effect of cooling in a magnetic field on alloys of the alcomax
or ticonal types. Demagnetization curves and some particulars of composition and treatment
