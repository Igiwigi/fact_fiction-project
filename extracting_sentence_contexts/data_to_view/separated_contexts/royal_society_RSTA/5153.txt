We should however expe
an actual magnetic field like the Earth’s to affect very slightly both the velocity of
propagation and the law of reflexion. ;
76. The second view is, as we have stated, the one formulated by Fresnet, and '
would be strongly confirmed if the velocity of light-waves were quite unaffected by
passing near a moving body, so shaped that it would on the other hypothesis cause
current in the perfectly fluid sther; but it is sometimes held (see however § 80) to
against the evidence of the null result of MrcHEtson’s experiments on the effect of
the Earth’s motion on the velocity of transmission of light through air. There is also the fact noticed by Lorentz that an irrotational disturbance of
surrounding zether, caused by the motion of an impermeable body through it, would
necessarily involve slip along the surface, which could not exist in our fluid medium;
this would at first sight compel us to recognize that the surrounding ether, instead of
flowing round a moving body, must be taken to flow through it, or rather into it,

outside it irrotational, without discontinuity at the surface. Tt has been shown however by W. M. Hicks that a solitary hollow vortex in an
ordinary liquid carries along with it a dise-shaped mass of fluid and not a ring-sha
mass, unless its section is very minute; thus it is possible that the vortex-aggreg
constituting a moving solid may completely shed off the surrounding fluid without
allowing any permeation through its substance, and without any such discontinuity
the surface as would be produced by the motion of an ordinary solid through liquid. How far the electric charges on the vortex atoms, or their combination into molecules,
would negative such a hypothesis seems a difficult inquiry.
