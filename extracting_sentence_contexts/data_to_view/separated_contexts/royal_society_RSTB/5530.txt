Throughout the three
transverse regions, the medial area is the most homogeneous, that is, there are fewer
cells other than the pyramidal type. On the other hand, the ventral region of the
\ pyriform cortex shows greater variation in cellular types in the pyriformis anterior, and
the pyriformis posterior contains in its lateral transverse cortical layers many poly-
morphous cells. If these cellular shapes in the Bielschowsky preparations are a reliable criterion
of the type of cells, and if the type bespeaks a function, as is generally conceded, then
the facts presented might hint that the medial and ventral regions of the anterior and
middle pyriform lobes are the areas for the reception of impulses. The lateral region
in all three transverse regions may then be interpreted as the cortex of motor discharge. It is possible that the medial area of the posterior pyriform is similar in function, for
certainly this material shows no evidence of a direct connection with primary or secondary
olfactory centres.
