stage. That it does not do so in the first stage depends upon the fact, ascertained by
inspection of records, that the establishment of positive and negative state presents
no such difference of speed as their subsidence. ‘The negative state is indeed
established more rapidly than the positive state, but the difference is not sufficient
to affect a galvanometer that shows quite distinctly the difference in their rate of
subsidence. If, however—and the case presents itself frequently in the second stage
—a sufficiently well-marked difference should exist, then we shall have a short
negative swing preceding the main positive effect. The relations just considered are
represented in the diagram (fig. 18), in which the time relations of positive and
