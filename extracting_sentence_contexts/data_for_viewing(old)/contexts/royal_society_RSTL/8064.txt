We deduce from these numbers, in the first instance, the fact of the variability of the
length of the whole period

Thus we have from first to second minimum . . . . . 981 years.
from second to third ,, . . . . . . 12:98 years.
from third. to fourth _ ,, . . .- . . .. 10'S1 years.

Mean of the three periods. . . 1107 years.

Secondly, we see that in all of the three cases the time from a minimum to the next
maximum is less than that from a maximum to the next minimum,â€”a fact which has,
we think, been previously noticed by Sir J. HersoneL, Thus the time from the first
minimum to the next maximum is 3-06 years, and from the firs: maximum to the second
minimum 6:75 years. In like manner that from the second minimum to the next maxi-
mum is 4-14 years, and from the second maximum to the third minimum $:44 years,
Finally, the time from the third minimum to the third maximum is 3:37 years, and from
the third maximum to the fourth minimum 7:44 years. We see again that the second
curve, which was longer in period as a whole than either of the other two, manifests this
excess in each of its branches, that is to say, its left or ascending branch is larger as a
whole than the same branch of the other two curves, and the same takes place for the
Second or descending branch. On the other hand, the maximum of this curve is not 80
