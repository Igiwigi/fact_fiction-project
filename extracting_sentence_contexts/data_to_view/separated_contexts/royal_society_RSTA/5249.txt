Although this rule has a number of exceptions, it is sufficiently
Bpneral to render it probable that there may be some relation between the passage of
ight and of heat through a crystal. The recent determinations of the refractive
igdices of metals by Kunpr have shown that they stand in the same order as con-
Eactors of heat, and as to the velocity of propagation of light through them, and this
Bet brings again into prominence the old determinations with respect to crystals. That

e comparison which Kunpr has made for the metals cannot be carried to other

dies is at once seen from the fact that the index of refraction of iron differs little
from those of glass and several commoner crystals, the conductivities of which are
shown to be very small compared to that of iron. A comparison may, however, be
possible among transparent bodies themselves, and the following experiments were
made with the object of furnishing data for this comparison, the results given by
previous observers differing greatly from each other. They have, however, been
extended to embrace non-transparent bodies commonly in use in a physical laboratory,
and about the conductivity of which we have had a very meagre or absolutely no
knowledge.
