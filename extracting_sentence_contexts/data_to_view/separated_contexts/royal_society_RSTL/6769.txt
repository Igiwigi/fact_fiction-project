Marquis obſerves (1) the regularity of the illneſs, the
critical days, on the ſeventh and ninth, and particu-
larly that all ſach as recovered had more or fewer
puſtules broke out in different parts of the body ;,
yet (2) he will not allow of Rammazzini's opinion,
of the analogy between this diſtemper and the ſmall-
pox, nor that it is an eruptive fever ; but ranks it
as a plague,

But the Marquis goes ftill farther. He poſitively
fay, (3) * That in the preceding years, in the pro-
« vinces of Brefſe, Maconnois, and Bugey, ſome pri-
« vate perſons had ſuffered by buying cattle reco-
« yered from the diſtemper, which had, at that time,,
« the puſtules remaining on them : which cattle had
« the diſtemper afterwards.” Nay, he adds that
« even after recovering twice, a third infeftion has.
« ſeized and killed many.”

No wonder, my Lord, that ſuch poſitive aflertions
ſhould ſtagger, and cauſe the praftice of inoculation
not to be received, till the nature of the diſcaſe be
abſolutely determined, and facts prove. the contrary
of what has been aſſerted. In a matter of ſo great importance to every nation,
it were to be wiſhed, that the Marquis de Courtivron
had produced atteſted obſervations of theſe ſecond
and third infections: for tho' a nobleman of his rank,
character, and great abilities, would not willingly
impoſe upon the world ; yet it may happen, that he
may have received wrong informations. As to the nature, riſe, progreſs, and fatality, of
this diſtemper at Iflurtille, it appears to be the ſame
diſeaſe as raged in theſe kingdoms.
