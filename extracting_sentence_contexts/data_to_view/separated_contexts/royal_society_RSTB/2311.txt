By reason of this fact the after-
currents observed were very generally diphasic, first negative, then positive, duration
of current being favourable to the manifestation of the negative factor, strength ot
current to that of the positive factor. Thus, on muscle, pu Bots-Reymonp obtained,
e.g., negative maximum after 10 minutes closure of the current from 1 Grove cell,
and positive maximum after 0:075 second closure of the current from 20 Grove cells. He incidentally mentions the fact that he obtained pure positive effects by sufficiently
strong break induction shocks both upon muscle and upon nerve. The case of the electrical organ is perhaps of greatest interest in connection with
the present investigation. In Malapterurus the natural discharge of the electrical
organ is directed from head to tail.
