The table below shows the approximate ranges of values which some of these variables
take in the case of the propagation of a whistler through the ionosphere:

variable range of values
i 0-5 to LO ke/s
i 0 to 10 Mc/s
fu 1:5 to 0-1 Me/s
x 0 to 4x« 108
? 10 to 8000
x[p 0 to 10,

It will be noted that the last three variables attain values much larger than those normally
met with in ionospheric work. This fact will shortly enable us to make a number of simplifying
approximations in the formulae for the refractive index. Now according to our theory most of the path of a whistler is at very great heights where
collisions are so rare that their effect on the refractive indices can be neglected. They are
only of importance below a height of about 80 km, and although this part of the ionosphere
doubtless produces considerable attenuation of the whistlers during the daytime, it makes
no appreciable contribution to their dispersion.
