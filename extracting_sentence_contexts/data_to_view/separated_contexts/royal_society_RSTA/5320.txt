In meteorology, Q 4 0 would be 4D-VAR with a weak constraint
[9,10]. ‘Weak’ here indicates that the drift model is not treated as correct. In this case, we have to proceed in an explicitly Bayesian fashion, because (2.12) is effectively a
highly structured prior on X, and the posterior distribution will be a conjunction of the constraints
in the likelihood and the prior,

r(x | 2°PS) oc w(x, 295) = L(x) (x | x0) 1 (X0)- (3.5) : a)

This is a generalization of the Q = 0 case in the sense that as Q > 0, so x becomes a deterministic : a
function of xg, and (x | x9) becomes a Dirac 5-function. : 2
It is easy to see that the problem becomes harder when we allow for structural uncertainty, 8

in situations where there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions and an attractor (now a : &
random attractor). This is implicit in the fact that this case is a generalization of the previous case, 1S
but with many more uncertain quantities. 3
For ease of comparison, continue to focus on learning Xo, using the integrated likelihood : =

K(xo) =| Le m(x |X) dx. (3.6a)

In the simplest treatment, this integral can be approximated with a finite sample of size m,

m . K(xo) © K(xo) = m7! > Lae?), x ig m(x| Xo). (3.6b)
j=l

For each xo, each candidate trajectory x” will typically approach the attractor, which also contains
the measurements. Therefore, each candidate will run into some of the measurements by chance,
exactly as before (with the problem being more acute if not all components of the state vector
are measured).
