In any case there would be no
justification for preferring Type IV to Type VII, since the former would make little
difference in the range where there seems to be a possible departure from the latter.

5. The fitting of Pearson curves of Types 1, II, IV, and VII. Most of the difficulty of
fitting Pearson curves by the method of maximum likelihood appears to arise from the
fact that in their usual form they are stated in terms of parameters whose errors are not
independent, We have seen that if the scale of a law of Type II or VII is to remain of
the same order of magnitude for all values of m, a factor of order m must be associated
with 0. But if this factor is simply m, the effect of increasing ¢ is to lower the curve at
small deviations and raise it at large ones (the outside factor being adjusted to make the
area unity), But the effect of reducing m for Type I, or increasing it for Type VII,
is qualitatively just the same;
The determination of m requires that th

the departure only changes sign at a different deviation.
two effects, which are strongly correlated,
must be separated, and consequently a large number of figures must be kept in the
computations. Solution would be expected to become much more expeditious if we
could state the laws in such a way that the effects of small variations in the unknowns

are nearly orthogonal.
