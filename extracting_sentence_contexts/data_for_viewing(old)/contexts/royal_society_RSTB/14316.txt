But transposition of these elements also results in frequent
pseudogenization of useful genes. How frequently the gains
in evolvability provided by MGEs compensate the costs of
these elements is poorly known. These indirect selective
effects (i.e. higher-order selection) are hard to measure in the
laboratory because they depend on the genetic diversity of
communities and the frequencies and types of ecological chal-
lenges faced by Bacteria and Archaea. Further work will be
needed to disentangle how and when such elements contrib-
ute, or not, to host adaptation. Such studies should account
for the fact that recipient cells have little control over the rates
of HGT and that MGEs have their own evolutionary interests,
meaning that it is difficult to interpret changes in the rates of
HGT in the light of selection for microbial evolvability.

The availability of low-cost sequencing and the current
focus on the worrisome spread of antibiotic resistance genes
by MGEs may provide crucial data to quantify how rates of
HGT depend on the type of MGE and its mechanisms of hori-
zontal transmission. For example, phages encode many
toxins, but few antibiotic resistance genes [125]. The latter
are much more frequent in conjugative elements, especially
in plasmids [75]. The genetic plasticity, range of interactions
