These have every appearance of being serially homo-
logous with the cervical ribs, and they must be interpreted as vestigial cranial ribs
belonging to the vertebrae which have been absorbed
in this region, fig. 10; figs. 71-75, er. 6-9, Plate 52. A small quantity of blue-stained intercellular sub-
stance is visible in the posterior two pairs, fig. 31,
Plate 46; the remaining ribs are much more reduced,
as would be expected from the fact that their ver-
tebree have no longer an individual existence. With regard to the dorsal elements of the basal
plate, a study of a whole preparation of the chon-
drocranium of a seven-day duck reveals four pairs
of arches arising, each forming the posterior border
of a future ventral nerve-root foramen. The arches
soon become connected dorsally with the members
of their own side, and the foramina are thus com-
pleted.
