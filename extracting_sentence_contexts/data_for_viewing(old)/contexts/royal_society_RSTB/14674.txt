Human cooperation demonstrates at least some of the
features that characterize major evolutionary transitions in
individuality. It has a complex and novel communication
system (cumulative culture and language) and widespread fit-
ness interdependence (in the form of collective resource
acquisition, risk pooling, cooperative breeding and role special-
ization). However, intragroup competition and conflict are far
from negligible in large-scale cooperative human societies,
despite the fact that they have mechanisms for suppressing
‘cheating’ (e.g. culturally mediated social norms and insti-
tutions) [207], and despite the fact that large cooperative
groups can be formidable competitors.

The social and political organization of cooperative human
groups can vary enormously—from the most egalitarian,
where resource and reproductive competition is more effec-
tively suppressed, to societies with growing economic
inequality and private property rights. The social norms that
govern human cooperation are also highly variable. Norms
are socially constructed by people with a large body of
shared cultural information, and they are therefore responsive
to differing social environments. While the most egalitarian
hunter-gatherer societies have social norms that compel exten-
