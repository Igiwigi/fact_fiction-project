The conditions will, however, be approximately satisfied, when the variations of
u, v, wof the first order are approximately constant over the space 8.

In such case the right-hand members of equations (8A), (8B), are neglected, and it
appears that the closeness of the approximations will be measured by the relative
magnitude of such terms as

a Pu/de®, &e., 7 d?u/dt? as compared with du/dx, du/dt, &e.

Since frequent reference must be made to these relative values, and, as in periodic
motion, the relative values of such terms are measured by the period (in space or time)
as compared with a, b, ¢ and 7, which are, ina sense, the periods of w’, vo’, w’, I shall
use the term period in this sense, taking note of the fact that when the mean-motion
is constant in the direction of motion, or varies uniformly in respect of time, it is not
periodic, 7.¢,, its periods are infinite.

9. It is thus seen that the closeness of the approximation with which the motion of
any system can be expressed as a varying mean-motion together with a relative-
motion, which, when integrated over a space of which the dimensions are a, b, c, has
no momentum, increases as the magnitude of the periods of u, v, w in comparison with

the periods of uw’, v, w’, and is measured by the ratio of the relative orders of magni-
tudes to which these periods belong.
