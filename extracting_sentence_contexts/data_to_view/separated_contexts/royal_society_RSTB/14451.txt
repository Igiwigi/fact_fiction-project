On the other end, the efficiency of online correc-
tions depends on how early corrections start to be operated
along the reaching path. Therefore, the privileged processing
of visual information presented in the region of the body mid-
line [22,23] should in principle facilitate early corrections—thus
increasing the redirection efficiency—in our reaching actions
redirected away from the midline. In these cases, in fact, the
initial part of the virtual hand trajectory—the one providing

(c) Proprioceptive recalibration

A blind reach task, in which participants had to reach a visu-
alized target without visual feedback from the moving hand
[57], was adopted as an implicit measure of embodiment of
the virtual hands [58], with the aim of controlling for the
possible impact of different degrees of embodiment on the
efficiency of online corrections. Results are fully presented
in the electronic supplementary material as they support a
control. In summary, a progressive increase of the propriocep-
tive recalibration with the redirection offset was found, which
corresponds to the increased displacement between the real
and the virtual hands at the end of the redirected reaching.
