An inspection of the above formula for potassium propionate shows that propionic
acid 38 incapable of isomerism from any change of radicals; and, inasmuch as ethyl is
simply methylated methyl, it follows that methacetic acid, when Woke. by the substi-
tution of one atom of hydrogen in acetic acid by one of methyl, must be identical with
propionie acid, which, with acetic acid, can have no isomer depending on a difference of

acid is capable of two, and only two isomeric modifications, viz.,

Both these acids have now been synthetically produced, and the first must be identical
with butyric acid, since they both contain ethylated methyl as their basylous radical—a
conclusion which is in perfect harmony with experimented facts, for we have shown above
that butyric acid and ethacetic acid are undistinguishable from each other, whilst meth-
acetic acid differs in odour and in the crystalline form of its silver-salt. Ascending now to caproic acid, the number of possible isomers is augmented to eight,
this being in fact the number of possible metameric modifications of the basylous radical
of caproic acid—amyl, viz. —
