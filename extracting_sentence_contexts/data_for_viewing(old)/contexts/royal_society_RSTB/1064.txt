of the details of cell division in the present case, for the Nauplii vary proportionately
much less ; every one of the numerous, simple, or compound bristles or spines of the
Nauplius has its definite character and position, which are maintained with surprising
constancy throughout, although they must have been produced by epiblast cells
having very different modes of origin and arrangement.

a (B.) Drrrerentriation or THE GerminaL Layers.

g With respect to the origin of the mesoblast and hypoblast of the Nauplius, the
Girripedes oceupy an isolated position among Crustacea.
a They differ from Cetochilus (35) among Copepods, Moina (65) among Phyllopods,
d from Astacus (73), and most other Decapods, as well as from Ligia among Isopods
@ in the fact that the hypoblast and mesoblast do not arise as multicellular areas
srming a specially differentiated and separate portion of the blastoderm, but from a
@mmon source, the single yolk cell, the nucleus of which is derived from the last,
possibly, in rare cases, from one of the last formed cells completing the blastoderm
Sd filling the blastopore.
e The mode in which the mesoblast and hypoblast are differentiated, presents most
‘semblance among Decapods to that found in Palemon and Eriphia, where the
Besoblast arises from the invaginated portion of the blastoderm, which also forms the
Biid-gut (and hind-gut). In Oniscus and Cuma, too, a simple blastodermic proliferation
es rise to both mesoblast and hypoblast, and the same appears to be true of
os (81). The case of Cyclops may also be mentioned in this connection. Here
£he endoderm is stated to be derived by invagination (64), or from a single cell (67),
hich also possibly gives rise to the mesoderm; the mesenchyme cells, however,
