In recent years, technological progress has allowed the development of new analytical tools that : =
enhance the effectiveness and the application field of scientific research. In the field of cultural : =
heritage conservation, the practical experience of restorers is increasingly supported by the 3
information provided by analytical studies, which allows restorers to identify the characteristics : =
of objects [1], to describe the degradation problems affecting them [2], and above all to quantify -R
the magnitude of any damage [3]. : S

In this sense, one of the most useful improvements in recent decades consists in the 3
development and the widespread use of portable analytical instruments [4,5]. In fact, nowadays, : S
many instruments are applied to the in situ study of archaeometallurgic heritage. For example, : S
metallic objects need to be conserved in a controlled environment with constant values of &

temperature and humidity because they are extremely sensitive to changes in climatic conditions.
Transport of such objects to research laboratories would result in a significant disruption of this
environmental balance that can involve the reactivation of degradation phenomena [6,7]. For this
reason, the development of portable instrumentation allows in situ analysis to be carried out,
avoiding any physical, chemical or mechanical stresses that are related to the transportation of
the items.

For elemental analysis, a key role is played by portable and hand-held energy-dispersive
X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) equipment [8,9], which enables non-destructive analysis to be
