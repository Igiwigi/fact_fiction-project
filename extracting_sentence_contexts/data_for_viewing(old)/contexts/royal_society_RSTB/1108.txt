Functional Activity of the Efferent Paths.

The graphic method only permits of a limited analysis of paths, 2.Â¢., fibres, inasmuch
as there is of necessity included the bulbo-spinal system of centres for the purpose of
giving the muscular contractions used for record. Hence no result by the graphic
method can be regarded as pure; moreover, it only furnishes information upon the
functions of efferent paths.

In fact, there is no direct evidence forthcoming from any method of observation,
except that of the galvanometer, to prove that the paths themselves in the cord
are excitable. Indeed, it has long been held by many physiologists that all effects
obtained from stimulation of the spinal cord are due to primary and progressive

excitation of reflex centres (ScHirF, CHAUVEAU). Consequently, it must be under-
stood that the following enumeration of facts is written and arranged in the light of
our experimental results, set forth in the present paper.
