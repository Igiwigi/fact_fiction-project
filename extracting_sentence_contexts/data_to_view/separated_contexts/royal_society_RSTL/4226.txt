Mr, Scuuncx's hypothesis is, however, much
weakened from the fact that we possess no means of reproducing lecanoric acid
from the s0-called lecanoric ether, for when any of these ethers are acted on by an
alkali, the organic acid they contain undergoes decomposition as well as the com-
pound itself. Besides, it appears somewhat gratuitous to infer merely from the per
cent. composition of these ethers that they all contain lecanoric acid, and are in
fact lecanoric ether, as any person may casily convince himself, by a few trials, that
considerable alterations may be made on the formulze of these acids without mate-
riaily affecting the per cent. composition of their ethers. Brom-orcine.
