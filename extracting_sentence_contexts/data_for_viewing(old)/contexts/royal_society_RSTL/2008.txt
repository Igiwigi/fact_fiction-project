fact in plain proſe, and endeavour to convey to you, $IR, -
as clearly and as diſtin&tly as I am able, what I ſaw my-

8 ag rumbling noiſes and exploſions within the bowels
S of the volcano, a quantity of ſmoke ifſuing with force
= from its crater, accompanied at times with an emiſſion
Þ of red-hot /coriz and aſhes, were manifeſt, more or leſs,
Z during the whole month of July; and towards the end
= of. the month, thoſe ſymptoms were increaſed to ſuch a
S degree as to-exhibit in the night-time the moſt beautiful
2 fire-works that can be imagined.
