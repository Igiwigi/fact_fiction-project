My own opinion is, that we have a
series from the simple trachev found in Peripatus up to the complete lungs of Spiders,
which is incapable of explanation in the present state of our knowledge, except
as representing the stages of development of trachew into the pulmonary organ of
Spiders. I consider that the results I have obtained confirm Leuck art's views (8) as
to the way in which the development took place. Let us now consider what bearing the facts recorded in this paper have on
Lankester’s views. His theory, as already stated, is that the appendages of a
common ancestor of Limulus and Scorpio have developed into the gills of Limulus on
the one hand, and the lungs of Scorpio on the other. Of course it is possible that the
Scorpion’s lung may have a different origin from that of the Spiders.
