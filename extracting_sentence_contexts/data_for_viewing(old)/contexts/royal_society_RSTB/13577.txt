of antibiotics originating from the soil are listed in table 4.
However, even more compounds remain to be discovered.
It was estimated that several thousand antibiotic substances
exist in soil and that only a small proportion of less than
5% has been characterized [257,258]. Approximately 800
compounds have been reported from Bacillus species, and a
similar number from pseudomonads, while more than 7000
different secondary metabolites, including numerous anti-
biotics, were found in Streptomyces isolates [29,51,259,260].
By contrast, efforts to explore soils for structurally novel anti-
biotics with new modes of action have significantly decreased
over the past two decades [29], because it is a time-consum-
ing and costly task. This reflects the fact that most
antibiotics are not always present in the soil but are formed
only when required in certain niches or microhabitats of
soil, thus varying in time and space [261]. Furthermore, anti-
biotics may exert quite different functions. On the one hand,
antibiotics directly suppress competitors and thus provide a
survival advantage to the producing microorganism in the
highly resource-limited soil environment [240,262]. On the
other hand, at low concentration, they may rather have a sig-
nalling function, e.g. at subinhibitory concentrations they can
induce changes in transcription, virulence, motility and bio-
film formation of microorganisms [29,263]. Antibiotics may
also have roles in more complex interactions, including viru-
