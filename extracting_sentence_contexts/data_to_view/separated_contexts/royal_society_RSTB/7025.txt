It is thus difficult to set exact limits to the state to which the term diapause should be
applied. There is, too, a wide variety of.factors which tend to induce this condition—cold,
heat, desiccation, excess humidity, deficient nutrition, excess nutrition (Baumberger 1914),
asphyxiation, etc. In fact, any wide departure from the optimum conditions for a particular
stage of a given species may induce diapause at that time, or, more usually, at a later period
in development. The possibility has been pointed out by Cousin (1932) that abnormal conditions acting
on the parent may be an underlying cause of diapause in the progeny, weakly parents

producing weakly offspring more sensitive to an unfavourable environment, with higher
than average mortality, and with a greater proportion of individuals going into diapause. This she has shown for Lucilia, and it has also been seen to occur with the single generation
a year and two generations a year strains of Pyrausta nubilalis Hbn. (Babcock 1927).
