obtained by using as a factor the ratio of actual correlated pairs of individuals to the

é (7.) Proposition VI.—To obtain a measure of the spurious correlation apparently

existing between two organs, when a mixture is made of heterogeneous materials.

£ Let and a’ be measures of the two organs, and let there be N pairs of organs

-g formed by 7 pt Saas groups containing 7, 7%, 2;... pairs with means m, m’,,

 i,; m',, m3, m’,..., &c., standard deviations 01, 01, ov, o'2, 03, 07;..., &e, and
correlations 7, %, 73... , &¢c. Let M, M’ be the means of the whole heterogeneous

Roommunity, >, »’ the standard deviations, and R the correlation. Then:
R=3'N = S (noo’r) + S {n (m — M)(m’ — M)},

where S denotes a summation with regard to all ¢ groups.
