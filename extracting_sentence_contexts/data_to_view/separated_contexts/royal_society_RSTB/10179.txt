As a result, the
dragonfly invariably reorients itself early in the predatory

flight, regardless of the interception strategy. Through analysing
hundreds of independent prey capture events, it was concluded
that the interception trajectories could resemble proportional
navigation just as well as many other guidance strategies such
as parallel navigation. In fact, the dragonfly appears simply to
align its body to the prey flight direction and keep the target
within an approximately 50Â° cone directly overhead [96]. This
interception strategy simplifies the task to two-dimensional
tracking in the zenith direction and the dragonfly must only
increase its altitude to achieve interception. Prior to prey pursuits, Plathemus lydia dragonflies often per-
form a rapid head movement to centre the target in its dorsal
fovea [103].
