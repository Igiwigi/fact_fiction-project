Such differentiation of the Miillerian ducts as the male monkey may show is as
readily understandable on the basis of this hypothesis as it is on the basis of that
advanced by Wirscut. A corollary of WresNERâ€™s theory, which at the same time is one
of its central supports, is the belief that oestrin cannot act on imperfectly differentiated
structures derived from the Miillerian ducts. This belief is, however, contrary to the
facts presented in this paper,* unless one assumes that the hydatids of Morgagni are
fully differentiated structures.

Oestrone stimulates both fibro-muscular and epithelial growth in the hydatids.
The response of the fibro-muscular tissue can be regarded as part of a general sensi-
tivity to oestrogenic substances of mesodermal structures derived from the urogenital
ridge and genital cord. Such a view makes it possible to relate the fact that the fibro-
muscular tissue of apparently the entire genital tract is responsive to oestrone (ZUCKER-
MAN 1936c). Similarly, the proliferation of the epithelium of the hydatid can be
related to the growth which occurs under similar conditions in the uterus masculinus.
This response was first demonstrated in monkeys (PARKES and ZUCKERMAN 1935;
Courrier and Gros 1935; VAN WAGENEN 1935), but,it has since been shown to occur in
the dog (pE Joncu and Kok 1935), and in the guinea-pig (VAN DER WOERD 1936;
Courrier and CouEN-SOLAL 1936). In general it may be said that both the cranial and
caudal parts of the primordial female reproductive tract which survive in the male
mammal react to oestrone. A similar response has been shown to occur in the fowl;
thus Junn and Gustavson (1932) found that the occasional vestigial remains of the
Miillerian duct in the male bird also respond to oestrin. The oestrogenic sensitivity of
the uterus masculinus and the hydatids of Morgagni may perhaps also be related to
