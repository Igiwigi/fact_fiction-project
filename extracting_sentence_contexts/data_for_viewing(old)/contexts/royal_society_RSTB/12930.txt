pair-bonded fathers [5], unrelated alloparents [6] and post-menopausal grand-
mothers [7] . This stands in contrast to our closest primate relatives. There is
even fossil evidence for changes in life history during hominin evolution [8,9].
Yet, until recently, few psychologists talked about ‘life history’. Evolutionary
approaches to psychology typically focused on the adaptive advantages of
features of adult human minds. They talked about adult cognition, communi-
cation, culture and cooperation and emphasized adult activities such as
hunting, warfare and building [10]. The distinctively long human childhood
received less attention and was even treated as epiphenomenal, a side-effect
of narrow pelvises and large brains, rather than a phenomenon with potential
adaptive significance itself (see [11]). A few psychologists pointed, in a general
way, to the fact that a long childhood allows a long period of learning [12-14].
