This view now given accords with
the experiments of Mr. WATT, alluded to in the beginning
of this memoir. He found that © the latent heat of steam is
less when it is produced under a greater pressure or in a
more dense state ; and greater when it is produced under a
less pressure or in a less dense state.” *

BERTHOLLET thinks this fact 80 unaccountable, that he has
been willing to discard it altogether. Whether the view
which I have just opened, of the relation subsisting between
the elastic force, density, and latent heat of different vapours,
harmonize with chemical phenomena in general, I leave to
others to determine. It certainly agrees with that unaccount-
able fact.
