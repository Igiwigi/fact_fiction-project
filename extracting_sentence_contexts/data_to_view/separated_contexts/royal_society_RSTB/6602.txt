YOUNG ON FUSED NEURONS AND SYNAPTIC

In the best preparations the surfaces of the fibres appear to be pressed closely against
each other, with no visible space between (fig. 43a, Plate 46 and figs. 48-50, Plate 47). In many cases, however, a narrow shrinkage space appears (fig. 47, Plate 47), and the
separation of the two fibres in this way shows most clearly that they remain distinct,
and do not mingle with each other at their place of contact. The fact that there is not complete mingling between the substances of the two
members of the synapse is also most strikingly shown by the difference in their staining
capacities. The axoplasm of the outgoing, third-order, axon is deeply basophil, and
after fixation with a protein precipitant, such as picric acid, contains a great number
of small granules (figs. 47-50, 55, Plates 47, 48). The substance of the incoming fibre,
however, hardly takes basic stains at all, and even after precipitation of the proteins
contains only a few relatively large granules.
