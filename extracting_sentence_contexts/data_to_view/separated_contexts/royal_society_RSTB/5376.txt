Still further back, in the same line prolonged, is the
apertura medialis of the recessus scales tympani. ‘his is a part of the fissura metotica,
and consequently there is no doubt that it marks the medial boundary of the auditory
capsule. The result of this inquiry is to show that Gaupp’s theory would fit the facts provided
that a satisfactory explanation could be found for the basicochlear fissure in those
forms which possess it. ‘The presence of the basicochlear fissure might be regarded
as a developmental adaptation to a condition which is shared by all the higher mammals,
viz., the great increase in the size of the brain, for expansion of the cranial cavity in
the hinder region of the skull can only be obtained by pushing out the auditory capsule. Since the ductus cochlearis is an integral part of the membranous labyrinth, it is con-
ceivable that when the latter together with its capsule were displaced to the side, the
cartilaginous envelope of the ductus cochlearis accompanied it, and became separated
from the rest of the basal plate.
