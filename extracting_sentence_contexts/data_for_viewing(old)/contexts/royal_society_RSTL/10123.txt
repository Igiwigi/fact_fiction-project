VELOCITY OF WHITE AND OF COLOURED LIGHT. 285

mean of these is 2:03 per cent., giving a result which confirms in a satisfactory
r the resnlts arrived at by the other methods.
April 26 and 27.—After an absence of a month from Kelly we again tested the
colour effect on April 26 and 27. We used wheels with 250 teeth and with 400
teeth, bright and s8moked, upright and inclined. We ascertained the fact that blue
light required the greater velocity of rotation to produce equality ; but we did not
make any actual measurements. We were unable to detect the snccessive phases of
colour which were observed on February 11.
* By collecting results of all the observations on the effect of colour on velocity we
Mall be able to judge of the general effect :—

February 11.—The star which was increasing with increase of speed was red ; the
r which was waning with increase of speed was blue.

SThe percentage difference of red and white light, two observations, 0:90 and 0:32.

S February 21.—Ruby-red glass and blue copper solution. Speed diminished
