decreases to approach the value predicted by (3.11) over a duration of about 100 days. This early
time behaviour corresponds to the duration before a well-defined reaction front forms and is
further described by Arshadi & Rajaram [18].

5. Concluding remarks

We have proposed a similarity solution for reaction front propagation in fracture—matrix systems.
Although we developed our solution by considering a bimolecular reaction between a reacting
species and a mineral, the exact form of the reaction kinetics does not influence the behaviour,
and the analytical solutions ((3.1a,b), with (3.4); or (3.8a-c)) are expected to be valid for a broad


class of transport problems involving fracture—matrix interactions. In fact, our similarity approach
reproduces the simplified forms of the Laplace-transform solutions [1-3,19] for non-reactive
solute transport or heat transport, when diffusion/dispersion in the fracture are neglected.
This may be readily verified by setting zs—> oo in (3.4) or (3.8b,c). Our similarity solution
also reproduces the behaviour of the reaction front observed in numerical simulations of a
multi-component reactive transport problem with mineral interactions [4]. In particular, the
quantity q/(¢De) is a type of Peclet number that serves as a scaling factor relating reaction front
propagation along the fracture to that in the matrix (equation (3.7)). As noted in [4], the overall
nature of reaction front propagation in the fracture is thus diffusive in character. Our composite
similarity variable and similarity solution naturally capture this scaling. We believe that the
similarity variable employed here is a general tool that can facilitate solutions to multi-component
transport and coupled alteration processes in fracture-matrix systems. The main limitation of
