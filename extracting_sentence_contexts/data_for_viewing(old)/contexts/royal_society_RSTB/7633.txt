organisms, however, has no such symmetry In the first place, for instance, men are more
often found standing on their feet than their heads. This may be corrected by taking gravity
into account in the laws, together with an appropriate change of definition of the two kinds
of symmetry. But it will be more convenient if, for the sake of argument, it is imagined that
some species has been reared in the absence of gravity, and that the resulting distribution of
mature organisms is found to be P-symmetrical but to yield more right-handed specimens
than left-handed and so not to have F-symmetry. It remains therefore to explain this
absence of #-symmetry.

Evidently one or other of the assumptions (i) to (iii) must be wrong, i.e. in a correct
theory one of them would not apply. In the morphogen theory already described these
three assumptions do all apply, and it must therefore be regarded as defective to some
extent. The theory may be corrected by taking into account the fact that the morphogens
do not always have an equal number of left- and right-handed molecules. According to
oneâ€™s point of view one may regard this as invalidating either (i), (ii) or even (iii). Simplest
perhaps is to say that the totality of zygotes just is not F-symmetrical, and that this could be
seen if one looked at the molecules. This is, however, not very satisfactory from the point
of view of this paper, as it would not be consistent with describing states in terms of con-
centrations only. It would be preferable if it was found possible to find more accurate laws
concerning reactions and diffusion. For the purpose of accounting for unequal numbers
of left- and right-handed organisms it is unnecessary to do more than show that there are
corrections which would not be F-symmetrical when there are laevo- or dextrorotatory
