The full cell showed a specific energy of 32Whkg~! and a specific
power of 400 W kg~! in PVA-KOH gel electrolyte at 8mA cm~? within a working potential range
of greater than 1.6 V [53]. The utilization of faidherbia albida fruit shell (biomass) as a carbon
source made the synthesis approach (green synthesis) environmentally friendly and sustainable. Recently, green synthesis of composite materials has received immense attention in the area
of science and technology, particularly in the design of energy storage system due to the
fact that they are environmentally benign, commercially feasible and low-cost [43]. Different
composite materials such as bacterial cellulose (BC) /MnOp [54], wheat flour (WF) /PANI [55] and
iron complex/egg yolk [56] have been synthesized using a green synthesis approach. In green
synthesis, biomasses as renewable sources have been adopted as a template or precursors for the
composite preparation.
