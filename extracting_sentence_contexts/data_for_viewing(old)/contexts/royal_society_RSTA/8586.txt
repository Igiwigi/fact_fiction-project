Measurements at Higher Stresses—The spring balance used to measure the
moderate loads in the above observations had a maximum capacity of 200 lbs., but for
the higher stresses required, a balance recording up to 500 lbs. was necessary,
the observations being made in a similar manner with readings on the magnified
scale up to 400 Ibs. load, and after this coarser readings were taken with the
telescope. A maximum load of 476 lbs. (6000 Ib./in.*) was reached, but as the
extension then increased very rapidly it was not possible to keep the load at this
maximum value, moreover, as the stressing frame was of rather limited capacity for
large strains, the test could not be carried to fracture, although a total extension of
1'211 inches was obtained. The observations also showed that the permanent
extension was very uniform from section to section.

The condition of the material has in fact some resemblance to that of a mild steel
which has been overstrained and allowed to rest. This is shown by a subsequent
experiment in which the loading was repeated and the stress-strain properties examined
anew. It was then found that the elastic limit of the material was still approximately
at 150 lbs. load, corresponding to a stress of 1900 Ibs. per sq. inch, but the modulus E
had now risen to 502,000, measured in pound and inch units, as a result of the
overstrain. The relations of load to extension for both conditions are shown in the
accompanying fig. 2, but as the scales of load and extension are the same for both
experiments the curve for overstrained material lies below that for unstrained material.
It may be observed that the material possesses, in a marked degree, the property of
contraction when the load is removed even when very much overstrained, and in this
case when the full load of 300 lbs. was removed the semi-permanent extension was only
0°006 inch, and half of this disappeared with a few minutes rest.
