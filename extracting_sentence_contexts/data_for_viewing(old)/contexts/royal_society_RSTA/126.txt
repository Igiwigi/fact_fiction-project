publication, this design algorithm has been used to discover Turing patterns and other interesting
spatio-temporal phenomena in reaction-diffusion systems such as the iodate-sulfite-thiosulfate
reaction [86], the bromate-sulfite-ferrocyanide reaction [92] and others [93,94].

(b) Belousov—Zhabotinsky reaction reverse microemulsion systems

(i) Development

There are few nonlinear chemical systems studied as thoroughly as the Belousov—Zhabotinsky
(BZ) reaction [95]. The BZ reaction in a spatially extended system shows interesting dynamics,
such as concentric waves [95], spiral waves [96], scroll waves [97] and chemomechanical
oscillations when coupled to an active gel [98]. However, the generation of BZ Turing patterns
was hindered by the fact that the activator (bromous acid) and inhibitor (bromine) diffuse at
similar rates in the aqueous phase, and no complexing agent has been found that can separate
them [99].

In the early 2000s, Vanag and Epstein used a water-in-oil aerosol OT (AOT) microemulsion to
isolate the BZ reaction into the water droplets (BZ-AOT system), and showed that the inhibitor,
bromine, diffused two to three orders of magnitude faster than the activator, bromous radical,
in the oil phase [87]. This was sufficient separation of the diffusion rates, and Turing patterns
were able to form for up to one hour in the closed system (due to the BZ reaction’s long-lived


oscillatory behaviour) [87,99]. It is not ideal to use the BZ-AOT in an open CFUR system as the
classical BZ reaction produces carbon dioxide, which forms bubbles that may interfere with the
