phenomena observed on Pike’s Peak. It will be seen from Tables ITV. and fig. 6
that on ascending Pike’s Peak the alveolar oxygen pressure fell from about 100 mm.
at sea-level to about 50mm. At this alveolar oxygen pressure want of oxygen plays,
under ordinary circumstances, a part in exciting the respiratory centre in most
persons; and it is only what might be expected, in view of the investigations of
Doveras and HALDANE on artificially produced periodic breathing, that a tendency
to periodic breathing would be produced ; for with any pause in the breathing the
alveolar oxygen pressure would fall sufficiently to lower the exciting threshold value
of the alveolar CO, pressure, and so produce a sudden excessive excitation of the
respiratory centre; and this excitation would disappear with equal suddenness when
the excessive breathing raised the alveolar oxygen pressure above the existing
normal, Conditions similar to those existing after forced breathing at sea-level would,
in fact, exist permanently in the lungs. In the case of the after-effect of forced
breathing the abnormal condition is brought about by temporary deficiency in the
carbon dioxide discharge ; while at high altitudes deficiency in the oxygen pressure of
the inspired air brings about a similar abnormal relation between the pressures of
oxygen and CO, in the alveolar air.

Even when the breathing was quite regular on Pike’s Peak, periodic breathing was
easily started either by holding the breath for a few seconds or by deep inspirations
(figs. 10 and 12). Mosso has already published tracings showing that a single deep
inspiration will initiate periodic breathing at high altitudes.

The tendency to disappearance of periodic breathing when acclimatisation was
established is also intelligible, as the rise in arterial oxygen pressure would make it
