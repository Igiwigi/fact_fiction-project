Possible compromise of the BBB has been cited as a potential reason for the accumulation
observed in these early reports. The common occurrence of hyperintensity in the dentate nucleus
and globus pallidus (GP) on unenhanced T,-weighted MR images was previously associated
with patients who had undergone brain irradiation, or who had multiple sclerosis and other
diseases, and it was assumed this was an artefact of disease-related BBB permeability; thus, a
causal relationship with contrast enhancement was not immediately suspected [9].

(b) Clinical retrospective studies of past images: linear GBCAs correlate with hyperintensity
in T; images in patients with normal renal function, but multiple GBCA injections

In the last few years a cluster of high-profile reports have elevated public concern by concluding
that the accumulation of gadolinium in the brain, revealed as MRI hyperintensity in the dentate
nucleus (DN) and GP, was correlated with multiple GBCA injections, even in patients with normal
renal function [9]. In fact, a linear correlation was found between progressive hyperintensity in
the DN-to-pons signal intensity ratio in unenhanced T;-weighted images and the number of
gadodiamide-enhanced MR imaging studies performed [11]. In one, perhaps extreme, example,
for a survey of 179121 contrast-enhanced MRI studies over 15 years, the authors found 33 brain
tumour patients who had received 35 or more GBCA administrations, representing 550 different
imaging studies [14]. Measuring images after 6, 12, 24 and the final GBCA administration, the
authors found increasing T, signal intensity in the dentate nucleus, GP and red nucleus after six
