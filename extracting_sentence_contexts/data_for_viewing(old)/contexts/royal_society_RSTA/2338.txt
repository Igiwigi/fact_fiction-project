University.) To obtain an analytical solution seemed like a hopeless task; however, even not
too perceptive imagination combined with perseverance sometimes turns out to be fruitful: the
complete analytical description of a solitary wave in the helix was finally found [13]. Then, the
problem mainly went to Slava Krylov (in the past, my PhD student, now Professor and Head
of the School of Mechanical Engineering, Tel Aviv University), who found periodic nonlinear
waves propagating in the helical fibre [14]. Also, an analytical solution for the solitary wave in an
arbitrary extensible helical fibre was obtained [15]. It was shown that the extensibility manifests
itself when the energy of the wave is high.

(b) Binary wave

Meanwhile, a question arose as to how the helix would respond to a suddenly applied axial
tension force. The peculiarity of the situation was the fact that under this load, the helix, due
to its geometry, should rotate about the longitudinal axis, but at the same time, there was no
axial moment applied. This contradiction was resolved by the formation of a binary wave arising
in the helix, where one part of it rotates in one direction, while the other switches in the other
direction, so that the total angular momentum remains at zero [16]. Another type of binary wave
was discovered much later [17], ยง8e.

(c) Binary crack

Dynamic lattice fracture and phase transition exhibit some surprising phenomena. For instance,
another binary object, the binary crack was found in the case of an unbounded triangular lattice
and in a lattice strip. It is a consequence of the irregular stress distribution found on the crack
continuation in mode II: the strain of the crack-front bond is lower than that of the next bond [18].
