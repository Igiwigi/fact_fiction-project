Fig. 19, Plate XXXIV. represents one of these gemmules with a portion of the
skeleton fasciculus on which it is produced, under a linear power of 50. Propagation by Sarcodous Division. "The fact of the resolution of the sarcode of the interstitial tissnes of Spongilla into
small masses of unequal size and variable form has long been known to naturalists, and
that when separated from the parent body each becomes capable of locomotion, and of
ultimately becoming developed into a perfect sponge. CaRTER, in his valuable paper
published in the Journal of the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, No. 12,
1849, has given a minute account of their structure and motions when separated from
the species which form the subjects of his paper, and his descriptions are in perfect
accordance with the similar bodies separated from our European species S. fluviatilis,
which I have had frequent opportunities of observing, and of confirming the history
given by him of their locomotive powers and continual inherent motions. The author
designates these bodies © sponge-cells,” and treats of them as if they had a well-defined
cell-wall, while their eccentric changes of form are perfectly inconsistent with such a
