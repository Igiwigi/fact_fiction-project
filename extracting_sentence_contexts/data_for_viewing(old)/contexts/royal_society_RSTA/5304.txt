In this paper, we have predicted the existence of different kinds of dissipative spatial solitons in a
semiconductor laser with saturable absorber where the field intensity displays strong oscillations
in time.

When the carrier lifetimes in the amplifier and in the absorber are comparable, an
Andronov-Hopf instability of the stationary solitons leads to the appearance of what we called
passively Q-switched solitons, which present features very similar to those of passive Q-switching
extensively studied in the time domain.

The fact that passive Q-switching is localized in space allows studying the interaction of
different oscillating solitons which coexist in the same laser. In a 2 x 2 array, we have shown
that in the long-term evolution the four solitons synchronize their intensity pulses and lock their
phases in such a way that two solitons in the same row or column have a phase difference of z,
whereas two solitons on the diagonal have the same phase. The four solitons also experience a
repulsive force which makes them move apart one from the other.

If the carriers in the absorber are much slower than in the amplifier a different instability
causes the soliton to drift along straight lines in a stop and go manner, so that while it moves its
peak intensity decreases until it reaches a minimum, then it stops until it recovers the maximum
intensity, and then it moves again along the same line.

Chaotic solitons appear when radiative recombination is included in the model equations and
