The results may be considered in three groups, characterised by definite conditions
with regard to anoxeemia and the severity of the ‘“‘soroche” experienced by the
subject.

In these two individuals (Table X XXIII) it is clear that there is no significant
change in the size of the heart, even at the time of their arrival at Oroya, when both
were extremely ill with soroche, being confined to their beds, in one case for several

not evident from the measurements, is indicated by the fact that on the morning
after his arrival at Oroya a bruit could be distinetly heard which was not present
when he was at sea-level.

The measurements of Table XXXIII show that the heart of the subject was
essentially of the same size on arrival at Oroya as it was at Edinburgh several
months after his return from the Andes. After eleven or eighteen days of acclimati-
sation at Cerro de Pasco it had become distinctly smaller (see fig. 28). A difference
is also clearly suggested between the two days of observation at the latter place.
The differences in the measurements are obviously greater than can be accounted for
by the inaccuracy of the method of observation.

On arrival at Oroya this subject was suffering from asevere headache and shortness
