thorax, and gives no branches until arriving at the diaphragm
(Fig. 2.G), it sends out numerous diverging branches, which
are lost in the substance of that muscle.

It has been long known that irritation of this nerve con-

that muscle. These facts, with the consideration of its course,
prove it to. be a respiratory nerve, and such has been the uni-
versal opinion.

But to what purpose should a distinct nerve be sent to the
diaphragm, if the other muscles, seated externally, and which
are ass0ciated in action with the diaphragm, and as important
to respiration, were left without a similar tie to unite them
with each other, and with the organs of the voice ?

The external respiratory nerve of the thorax (5 Fig. Il.) is a
counterpart of the internal or phrenic nerve. It comes out
from the 4th and zth cervical nerves, and often it is connected
