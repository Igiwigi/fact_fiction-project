(iii) Task allocation in ant colonies as a parallel distributed

process
In the previous example, we considered a set of agents
described as binary variables, thus ignoring the combinatorial
complexity that should be expected from an insect equipped
with a brain. Moreover, it is clear that the active/inactive
dichotomy hides a repertoire of potential activities that can
be carried out by individuals, associated with the set of tasks
needed to maintain the colony. DOL is in fact one of the
most important and widespread phenomenon in nature, and
very common in social groups [68]. It has been shown that
the dynamics of subsets of individuals performing specific
tasks within colonies is an emergent phenomenon [10]. In
this scenario, a colony that needs to perform a given set of
tasks under given environmental conditions (and respond to
changes in flexible ways) must be capable of sensing its internal
state using some kind of distributed information processing.

Inspired by the dynamics of harvester ants, Gordon
et al. [69] proposed a neural network model of task alloca-
tion where individual ants are represented by a sequence of
