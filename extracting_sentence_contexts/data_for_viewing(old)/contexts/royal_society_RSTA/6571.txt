1. The broad facts of rotation as observed by M. THore are abundantly confirmed.

2. The numerous experiments in which the face and hot water are tested under the
same circumstances, and especially Experiments 46 and 47, prove that the action is
due to radiation alone.

3. Blackening the cylinder increases the action. This is especially shown in
Experiments 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

4. The action is slightly increased by blackening both cylinder and pillar.

5. The remarkable fact observed by M. Tuore that a fine fibre of silk brought
near the suspended cylinder produces rotation has been verified in Experiments 27
and 28, and with other fine fibres in Experiments 19 to 26.

6. That the rotation is produced by a reaction between the cylinder and pillar, and
not between the cylinder and the source of radiation, is shown in Experiments 54 to 75.

7. The hypothesis that the rotations are produced by air-currents is disproved
partially by the experiments in which the effect of an ascending current of air is
shown to be almost without action, and it is entirely disproved by Experiments 66 to
75, and 86 to 96, in which the movements become more energetic in proportion as the
space in which they occur is exhausted of air.
