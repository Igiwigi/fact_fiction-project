The global
mRNA decay is induced by TUT4/7-mediated uridylation
and executed by DIS3L2 3â€™-5' exoribonuclease [189]. Simul-
taneously, pre-mRNA splicing and RNA nuclear export are
inhibited, which prevents the production of stress-responsive
factors [191] and precedes phosphatidylserine externalization
and DNA fragmentation. In fact, knock-down of TUTases or
DIS3L2 leads to anti-apoptotic effects and increases survival
of cells exposed to apoptotic stimuli [180,189]. Recent evidence identifies another crucial role of TUTases most likely represent degradation intermediates, thus strongly | 9 |
