sea walls) benefit from improved knowledge of how the climate is evolving. Crucially, this benefit
accrues irrespective of whether the signal is for a better or a worse outcome than is currently
expected. As a consequence, policy-makers should prioritize investing now in the fundamental
science that will better inform us about the extent of future climate change. This is true even
if this better information leads to no mitigative action, and hence to no reduction in the final
level of climate change damages. Better information allows us to improve our preparation for the
eventual outcome, whether that be good or bad, and Freeman et al. [26] assess the value that this
provides to society.

3. The dragons of uncertainty: human behaviour and the effects of uncertainty

The articles discussed thus far converge on the fairly compelling conclusion that scientific and
policy uncertainty need not be a barrier to action—on the contrary, the articles underscore the fact
that when the implications of uncertainty are formally analysed, they provide an added impetus
for concern and hence for climate mitigation.

We noted at the outset that appeals to uncertainty are often cited as reasons to delay
action in political discourse and public debate. The article by Oreskes [39] contributes another
historical case study of how uncertainty might lead to inaction. The key point of her article
is that uncertainty need not be ‘manufactured’, as other scholars have claimed in connection
with attempts of industry to forestall regulatory action when their products turned out to be
harmful, but that scientific uncertainty is unavoidable in most situations. Thus, uncertainty is
not manufactured but is exploited to create doubt and thereby undermine knowledge claims
that might otherwise compel policy-makers into regulatory action. As Oreskes notes, the key
insight of the tobacco industry was that you ‘could use normal scientific uncertainty to undermine
