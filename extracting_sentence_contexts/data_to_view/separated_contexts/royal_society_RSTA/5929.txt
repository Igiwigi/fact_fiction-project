In our main results,
we claim that there exists a time T that is independent of ¢ up to which solutions to the Euler
equations are close to those of the point vortex system. Here, we make this choice more precise. In
fact, we choose T as the time at which the distance between the vortex components has decreased
by a factor of two

Because the fluid velocity u is continuous, it is clear that the vortex components cannot collide
instantaneously, thus, T > 0. We will see later that this time is bounded from below uniformly in
e, that is, T 21. Without loss of generality, we may restrict our attention to time intervals such that
