The identity in composition and properties of this acid, and the substance formed
by the action of alkalies on rubian, leave no doubt of their being the same. Rubiadine—This substance, which has not hitherto been observed among the
products derived from madder, bears a close resemblance in its appearance and many
of its properties to rubianine, the place of which it in fact occupies in the series of
substances produced by the action of alkalies on rubian. Besides its composition,
however, there are several properties belonging to it s0 characteristic, that it cannot
be confounded with rubianine or any of the substances previously described. When
crystallized from alcohol, it is obtained in the shape of small yellow or orange-coloured
needles.
