clear that the concept of a frequency curve includes that of a hypothetical infinite
population, distributed according to a mathematical law, represented by the curve.
This law is specified by assigning to each element of the abscissa the corresponding
element of probability. Thus, in the case of the normal distribution, the probability
of an observation falling in the range dz, is

in which expression « is the value of the variate, while m, the mean, and o, the standard
deviation, are the two parameters by which the hypothetical population is specified.
If a sample of be taken from such a population, the data comprise ” independent facts.
The statistical process of the reduction of these data is designed to extract from them
all relevant information respecting the values of m and «, and to reject all other
information as irrelevant.

It should be noted that there is no falsehood in interpreting any set of independent
measurements as a random sample from an infinite population; for any such set of
numbers are a random sample from the totality of numbers produced by the same
matrix of causal conditions: the hypothetical population which we are studying is an
aspect of the totality of the effects of these conditions, of whatever nature they may be.
