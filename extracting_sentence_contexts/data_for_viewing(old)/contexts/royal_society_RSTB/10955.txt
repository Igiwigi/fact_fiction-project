Erk could potentially account for all observed X-dosage-
dependent effects [8]. It is, however, likely that a combination
of different X-linked genes shapes the X-dosage phenotype.

The fact that X-dosage affects pluripotency and differen-
tiation has so far only been shown in mice since they are the
prime model system for mammalian development. In addition,
delayed in vivo development has been observed for female
embryos in several other species such as cows, rats and
humans [1]. For more detailed mechanistic studies, embryonic
stem cells from these species will be valuable model systems.
The use of human ESCs for studying X-dosage-dependent
effects has so far been hampered by the fact that most cell lines
adopt a state where one X-chromosome is at least partially
silenced [54]. A recent study has characterized the X-inactivation
status and the differentiation potential of a series of female
human ESC lines in detail [55]. The finding that lines with two
active X-chromosomes maintain this state during differentiation,
shows that double X-dosage in human ESCs does not comple-
tely block differentiation. However, the study also showed that
the extent of X-inactivation correlates with differentiation
propensity of the cells line, such that XCI appears to facilitate
differentiation also in human ESCs.
