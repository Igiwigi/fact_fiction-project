BOWMAN ON THE MINUTE STRUCTURE AND

approximation of the bead-like enlargement can neither be demonstrated nor proved
not to take place, but he seems inclined to think such a conjecture not improbable,
because the beads of the fibrillze are not necessary to the contraction of the fasciculus
into belly-like portions, or to their zigzag inflexion ; and also because the striz are not
always at the same distance on contiguous fasciculi. *'This,” he adds, *is all that
can be said in support of the hypothesis of the approximation of the globular enlarge-
ments of the primitive fibrillee*,”

I was endeavouring eighteen months ago to inspect, under the microscope, a fasci-
culus of a Frog, excited by galvanism, and had induced contractions in the specimen
80 often that it seemed no longer to obey the stimulus applied to it. Continuing to
regard it, however, I was surprised to perceive a spontaneous and slow movement,
which consisted of an approximation of the transverse striz, with a corresponding
shortening and thickening of the fasciculus. What I have now to offer is chiefly
embodied in this simple fact, though somewhat amplified by subsequent researches. From these I am enabled to say with confidence, that in that form of contraction
which takes place as the last act of vitality, the transverse strize, that is, the discs of
the fasciculus, approach each other, become thinner, and expand in circumference; in
other words, the contractility of muscle is independent of any inflexions of its fas-
ciculi, and resides in the individual s8egments of which these are composed. I have
taken from the animal, immediately after death, a minute piece of some muscle, ge-
nerally of the extremities, and laid it upon glass, then quickly tearing it into many
fragments with needles, s0 as to separate the fasciculi as much as possible from one
another, have moistened it with water, and covered it with a lamina of mica: a mag-
nifying power of 300 or 400 diameters has then been employed.
