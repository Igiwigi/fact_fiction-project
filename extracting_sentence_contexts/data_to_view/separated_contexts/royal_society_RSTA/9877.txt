The lapilli, however, are not highly pumiceous and the
splinters do not have those are-shaped, concave outlines which are found in shattered
pumiceous glasses (e.g., those emitted by Krakatoa in 1883).f

In the first part of this report we have stated our belief that the magma of the
Soufriére, though in large part crystallised, was not entirely solid at the moment
when it was shattered into dust and the great black cloud emerged from the crater. Professor Lacroix} has found that the later nuées ardentes or Peléean clouds of
Montagne Pelée were produced hy the disruption of a solidified magma. But the
facts of the eruption of May 7th in St. Vincent, as given by us in the first part of this
report, are sufficient to prove that the magma was a semiliquid mass as it ascended
in the crater. The crater lake was at its usual level at 11 a.m. on Tuesday (May 7th) ;
at midday on Wednesday the lake was discharged by overflowing the southern
lip of the crater.
