This should be sufficient to justify the ‘beyond’ in the title of this collection of papers. I also
need, however, to comment on the ‘and probability’ part of the title. On the one hand, this
serves to emphasize the fact that contextuality analysis in quantum physics and in many non-
physical applications is fundamentally probabilistic. For instance, in my favourite approach to
contextuality, called Contextuality-by-Default, theory of contextuality is essentially coextensive
with the theory of random variables. On the other hand, the title says ‘contextuality and
probability’ rather than ‘probabilistic contextuality’.
