efiect it shows the variation along the plate AB of [ C(«’)da’, the integral of the vorticity

(a quantity denoted by — 7,/U in the paper cited).*

In the paper cited it was concluded (pp. 410, 411) that the vorticity (v.e., the gradient
of the curve in fig, 10) attains infinite values at the ends of the plate. The assumption
of a polynomial form for « («) excludes the possibility of realizing this conclusion in
our solution, and it may be that our relatively large errors in the neighbourhood of the
leading edge are attributable to this fact. We are not, however, convinced that the
conclusion is correct,—both on physical grounds and because the arguments for it

given in the paper (which are based on analytical considerations) seem to us to be open
to criticism. We think it more probable that the vorticity, although it varies rapidly
near the ends of the plate, is finite at all points in the field.
