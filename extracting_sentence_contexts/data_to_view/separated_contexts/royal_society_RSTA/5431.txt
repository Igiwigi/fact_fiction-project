The
presence of SK~'@ in this term, however, serves to show that probably this is not
the true explanation of the Hatt effect. The Hatt effect may be explained by saying that there is an electromotive force
hVKH, where h may be called the coefficient of the Hatt effect. It has been found
experimentally that this coefficient is by no means independent of THâ€”that, in fact,
in certain cases it changes sign when a definite strength of magnetic field is reached. The above work indicates how, on the present theory, we may seek to explain such
an effect. For this purpose it must be remembered that equations (30) and (31) are
only true if g is the only term in # which involves H.
