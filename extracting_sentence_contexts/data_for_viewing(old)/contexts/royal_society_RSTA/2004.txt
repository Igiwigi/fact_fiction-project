June Barrow-Green 1. Introduction

e-mail: june.barrow-green@open.ac.uk By the time Stokes set off for Bristol College in 1835,

his aptitude for mathematics was already in evidence.
At an early age, he had been tutored by the local
parish clerk in Skreen in Ireland who taught him
mathematics using Voster’s Arithmetic, a popular text
‘adapted to the Commerce of Ireland’ [ ].1 The clerk
had been delighted by the fact that the young Stokes
had quickly worked out ‘new ways of doing sums’
far better than those given by Voster [2, p 5]. In 1832,
aged 13, he was sent to Dublin where he lived with
his uncle, John Stokes, and attended the famous school
of Dr Wall. Here again he was noticed for his facility
with mathematics, although this time it was his ability
to solve geometrical problems that attracted attention.

1further details of Stokes’s early life and education can be found in
the ‘Notes and recollections’ by Stokes’ daughter, Isabella Humphry,
[2, p 3-5], and in [3] from which this article is adapted.
