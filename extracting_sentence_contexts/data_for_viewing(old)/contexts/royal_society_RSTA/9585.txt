PROF. A. FOWLER ON SERIES LINES IN SPARK SPECTRA. 257

The astrophysical and experimental data have as yet given no proof of the existence
of the lines adjacent to those of hydrogen, but there is no evidence against the
supposition that they exist.

The assignment of these lines to proto-helium is supported by the observations of
magnesium, which have shown analogous series associated with the “ 4481”
series. The series A of magnesium, given by the combination 3d—m/, would become
4D—mF in proto-helium—the numeration being slightly different in the two cases*—
and this would be identical with the formula for the extended Pickering series.
Series B of magnesium, given by 3f—mf, would similarly become 4F—mF and would
also coalesce into the Pickering series. -Alternate lines of series B are in fact not far
removed from the Balmer lines, while intermediate lines are near the observed
Pickering lines, as will be seen by comparing Tables XIIT. and XV.; lines near these
positions might also be derived from the F series of other elements in which mF
approximates to 4N/m*. The relative weakness of the Pickering series of proto-helium,
as compared with 4686, is matched in magnesium by the relatively low intensities of
the analogous combination series A and B.

The close relations between the lines of hydrogen (real and hypothetical) and some
of those of proto-helium are simply accounted for by Bour’s theory of the origin of

these spectra. The general formule, in which p and m can only take integral values,
may be written
