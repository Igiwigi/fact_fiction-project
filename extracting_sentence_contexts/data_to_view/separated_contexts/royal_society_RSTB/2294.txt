is nearly constant if the gases have no chemical action on each other. This law is in
harmony with the kinetic theory, from which in fact it is deducible. k was also found by Loscumrpr to vary inversely as the pressure p of the inter-
diffusing gases, and directly as the square of the absolute temperature, so that

where k° represents the diffusivity at 0° C. and 760 millims. bar, ; and T° and T the
temperatures on the absolute scale.
