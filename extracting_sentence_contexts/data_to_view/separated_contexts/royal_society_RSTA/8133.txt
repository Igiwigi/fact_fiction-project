(14) The method of the electrical tank depends on the fact that the stream-lines for
an inviscid flow and the equi-potential lines in an electrical field are identical when the
boundary conditions correspond. Apart from minor modifications introduced to improve
the accuracy of measurement, the general scheme followed in the present experiments
was the same as that described in the paper by L. W.
