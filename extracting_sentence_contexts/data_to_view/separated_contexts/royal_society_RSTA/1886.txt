As to the validity or otherwise of this last assumption there was no
prior evidence, but the experiments show that it is at least approximately satisfied and
that small accelerating electric fields have little or no effect in increasing the electron
emission. Subject to the validity of the assumptions referred to, the currents in any
accelerating field should be constant, whilst their values in any retarding field will be
a measure of the number of electrons whose kinetic energy when emitted exceeds the
equivalent applied retarding potential difference. It should, in fact, be equal to the
number of such electrons divided by the electronic charge. A characteristic curve
satisfying such conditions for the case of the concentric spherical electrodes will there-
fore solve the problem so far as the total kinetic energy is concerned. Stated in this
way the matter appears very simple, but it has been found in practice to be fraught
with very serious difficulties which have taken a long time to overcome.
