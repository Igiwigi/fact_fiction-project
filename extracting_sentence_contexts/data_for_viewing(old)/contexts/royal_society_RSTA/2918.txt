about the data and the methods used. Fifth, a sustained dialogue about different mining
methods should enrich doctrinal debates. I would add a sixth recommendation that requires
legal theory and legal and political philosophy to engage with the implications of the
not-reading of legal texts. Instead of deferring to data scientists or resisting any kind of
automation, there is an urgent need for research into the epistemological, practical and
political implications of different types of mining methods.

This would entail, for example, developing a sensitivity analysis, modulating facts, legal
precepts, claims; it should be a playground for well-designed experimentation, for developing
new insights, argumentation patterns, for testing alternative approaches, for detecting missing
information (facts, legal arguments), helping to improve the outcome of cases. If developed in :

Algorithmic regulation as a concept is deeply indebted to cybernetic or regulatory theory. It refers aes
to the idea of controlling a population by means of feedback mechanisms, based on the threefold .
requirement of standard-setting, monitoring and behaviour modification. As such it is grounded
in a behaviourist perspective on human intercourse and displays an external perspective on
