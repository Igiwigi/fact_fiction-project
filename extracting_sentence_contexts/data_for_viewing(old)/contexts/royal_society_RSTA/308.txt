Learning from earlier SI redefinitions 4091

regarding its stability (which may be only marginally so), it does not match
our objectives of having an international system of physical references which
could be independently realized by any nation. Of course, it is natural to look
to atomic physics, as that field has so amply supplied metrology specialists
with atomic frequency, and two quantum relationships concerning electrical
quantities [2]. Collectively, one can thus arrive at a reliable reference for
time (for 40+ years the Cs hyperfine transition), and for electrical resistance
(von Klitzing’s effect) and electrical potential (Josephson’s effect). These two
latter quantum effects, in fact, are the basis for modern electrical standards,
with reproducibility approximately two orders better than their connection
with SI units, which is provided in the 3E-8 domain by the ‘watt balance’
experiments. So, in addition to the kg issue, the coming task of reworking the
SI still also requires to fully rationalize the situation between the electrical
units as maintained, and the existing SI. Also, as we will see, there are new
inputs from time to time which may be directly of interest and utility with
regard to reworking the SI. One example is the experimental measurement of
the Avogadro number, which has recently been reported by an international
collaboration. There are also auxiliary measurements such as the Rydberg
and the fine structure constant, a, which may provide constraints, as their
theoretical interconnections are believed to be secure. Modern miniaturization
of semiconductor components also provides us with a single electron turnstile
