particular metric; it also provides dimensionality reduction and robustness to noise [8]. One of the : >
most important techniques in TDA is the method of persistent homology [9] for clustering and :s
data analysis, which makes use of homology groups of data manifolds to provide information 8
about the underlying dynamical system. For example, in the forced Duffing system [10], a phase Ss
transition due to a small change in the dissipation parameter may cause a bifurcation [11], which 18

is associated with the collapse of three homology groups to a single homology group in the data
manifold of the phase space, as explained later in the current paper.

The fundamental groups of topological spaces, introduced by Poincar√© [12], are the first
and simplest homotopy groups [13], and are algebraic invariants that are critically important
for characterization and classification of topological spaces [14]. Interestingly, fundamental
groups also provide information about the respective covering spaces; in fact, subgroups of the
fundamental groups can be used to classify the covering spaces [15]. Furthermore, fundamental
groups of a base space can be used to construct covering spaces by using the Lifting theorem
[15]. One may think of a base space as the space generated by measurements from m sensors,
and a covering space as the space generated by the measurements from these m sensors in
combination with additional n sensors. Then, the Lifting theorem can be gainfully used to describe
features in the data manifold of the (7+) sensors by applying the concept of fundamental
groups to analyse the data manifold that is generated by the m sensors only. This is important
for dimensionality reduction [16], data compression [17] and estimation of dynamical systems
with malfunctioning sensor(s) [18].

While TDA techniques, like the persistent homology method, can be efficiently used for
characterizing topological invariants by capturing spatial patterns in the data manifolds, these
