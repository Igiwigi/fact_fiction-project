Posteriorly, it is more or less continuous with the
peripheral portion of the central cellular tissue of the knot above described, with
which also the vesicular ectoderm is continuous, whilst, ventrally, it is more
definitely limited off from the rest of the knot-tissue. Anteriorly, this cell-plug
is seen to be extended forwards as a thin and free tongue-like process, overlapping
the junction of the vesicular ectoderm with the cellular tissue of the knot. This
latter region must be the homologue of the anterior lip of the blastopore, and it is, in
fact, very slightly undermined by a space (z.s.), that may possibly represent the Â©
commencement of true archenteric invagination. If the above interpretation be correct, then the cell-plug in question must belong

morphologically to the posterior lip of the blastopore, and the posterior segment of
the floor of the future archenteric canal. It would thus be in part represented, in
