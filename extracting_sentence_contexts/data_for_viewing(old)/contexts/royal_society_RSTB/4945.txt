differences of temperature between the hanging thermometers each day, and the full
line e the difference between the average losses of weight of 10 “ corresponding ” eggs
in each tray, in grammes per egg per 24 hours.

From the data given below Curves V. and VI. the average temperature change which
will account for a can now be calculated. ‘The mean percentage change in loss of weight

. ina is 0-018 x 100/0-41 = 4-4 per cent., and in e 0-030 x 100/0-45 = 6-7 per cent.
Hence, the temperature change required is

1-31 X 0-81 x 4°4/6-7 = 0°-70 F.

The agreement between this and the 0°-65 for Curve b is very close—closer, in fact,
than there was reason to expect, because the two values are for different incubators.

Curve c is also for different incubators to a ; and there is besides a correction necessary,
as ¢ is for the top temperature only of the eggs, and it is the average temperature over
the whole shell that is required.

The temperature at the top of an egg varies far less than that of its lower surface
when heat is generated in the egg, because the top is so much nearer the hanging ther-
mometer where the temperature is constant. The change of temperature ratio for the
