258 DR. HERMANN KOPP ON THE RELATION BETWEEN BOILING-POINT

and that the isomeric compound ethers differed from one another in their boiling-points. An extensive series of boiling-point determinations* which I made of these isomeric
ethers, proved that the latter assumption is not founded on facts. The exertions made by
ScnroDeR, GERHARDT, Low and others, in the hope of recognizing the influence of the
constituent elements on the boiling-point of a compound, have also essentially remained
without result f.

In France the existence of the relations between composition and boiling-point which
I had observed, has been contested by I. Pierre}, who determined the boiling-points of
many organic compounds, while engaged in an inquiry regarding their expansion. In
England, lastly, W. A. MiLLERS has likewise called attention to the discrepancies
between the boiling-points observed by PrERRE and those calculated on the supposed
existence of the relations which I had indicated.
