A somewhat generalized point of view of continuum mechanics is offered by the Eulerian
formulation. The Eulerian formulation dispenses with the assumptions regarding the existence
of body points and a body manifold. Instead, one considers a particular extensive property in the
n-dimensional space manifold .7, such as the electric charge or the mass of a particular constituent
of a mixture. A flux field w of that extensive property, an (n — 1)-form, assumes the role of a
generalized velocity field. It is observed that, if the density of the extensive property is given by
an n-form 6 which does not vanish where w does not vanish, there is a unique vector field w
satisfying the condition # = w. 6. Evidently, the vector field w may be interpreted as a velocity
field and its integral lines may be interpreted as body points. In fact, even if no specific volume
element 6 is given, the flux form w determines a family of one-dimensional submanifolds which
one may interpret as body points [16].

Rather than restricting ourselves to sections of A" TY, as suggested by the discussion
above, we consider for now a general vector bundle z : W — .Y. In accordance with the Eulerian
point of view, we model a force functional F as a continuous, linear functional on the space ch)
of differentiable sections of W having compact supports. Using notions from the theory of de
Rham currents [18,26] and section distributions [19], [35, pp. 236-239], [36, pp. 339-341], we find
it useful to introduce vector-valued currents as a means for setting up a theory of global Eulerian
continuum mechanics that allows for stresses that are as irregular as measures.
