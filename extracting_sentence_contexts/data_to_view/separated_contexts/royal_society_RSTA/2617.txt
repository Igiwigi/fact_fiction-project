Anti-microbial properties of oil-infused surfaces were reported [30]. Topography of micro-rough surfaces impregnated with ferro-fluids may be effectively controlled
by magnetic fields [33].

9. Electrowetting of lubricated surfaces

Electrowetting of lubricated surfaces is of special interest to engineers, due to the fact that it allows
diminishing of the voltage U necessary for actuating a droplet [69-71]. Indeed, when a droplet
is placed on an impregnated (infused) solid surface, the triple line is de-pinned (as discussed
in §§5 and 6), which facilitates its displacement under applied voltage. Consider the wetting
regime depicted in figure 2a where oil completely coats a water droplet.
