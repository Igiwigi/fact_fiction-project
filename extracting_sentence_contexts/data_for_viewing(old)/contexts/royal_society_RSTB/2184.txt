tion arouses in the retina two opposite effects—positive and negative, and that the
former dies out more rapidly than the latter.

This view is confirmed by the closer consideration (1) of the terminal positive
deflection at break of light, and (2) of the time lost between illumination and
response at make of light.

(1.) The positive movement at break of light might be due to the sudden
increase of a plus state, or to the sudden decrease of a minus state. Or if two
opposite states cease simultaneously but with unequal rapidity, it might be due to the
greater sharpness of cessation of the negative state. The careful inspection of a
large number of photographic records has led me to adopt this last explanation, by
reason of the fact that I find the return from positive to normal to be always less
rapid than the return from negative to normal.

This reflection led me to examine more closely into the state of matters at the
make of light. If, namely, two opposite states are simultaneously aroused, but with
