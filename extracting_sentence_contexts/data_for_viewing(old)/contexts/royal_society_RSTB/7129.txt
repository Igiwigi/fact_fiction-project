3. A CLASSIFICATION OF LITHOLOGICAL TYPES FOUND ABOVE
THE Sort Bep AND Bassy MINE COALs

In the fifteen complete or partial sections seen by the writer between the Bassy and
Lower Foot Mines in Lancashire and between the Soft Bed and Middle Band Coals in
Yorkshire, a fairly definite succession has been recognized of a number of characteristic
lithological types, between which there is perfect transition. This is repeated three times
in rhythmic manner with comparatively little modification. Thus, although the character
of a sediment in a general way depends on a number of independent variables, it is possible
in this case* to establish a rough linear series of lithological grades which are recognizable
in the field. The grades are determined macroscopically by grain size and approximate
composition, utilizing also weathering characteristics, degree and nature of lamination and
colour. Emphasis is laid on their essentially macroscopic characters, on the fact that several
are arbitrarily selected types and that all are chosen with a view to demonstrating graphically
a certain type of continuous change or sedimentary rhythm. Nevertheless, in view of the
fact that macroscopic characters are largely qualitative, in the case of the shale and mudstone
types very short notes on distinctive features and figures roughly defining grain size are
added from an examination of thin slices under the microscope.

Grade 1. Black or dark grey fine-grained well-laminated shale, rich in small nodules
or blebs of pyrite. The shale weathers sulphurously and is typically soft and papery after
exposure, having characteristic flaky lamination surfaces. Gypsum crystals are not un-
common. Variations include a stronger shale with smoother lamination surfaces after

* The writer has seen some of these shale types in the upper part of the Millstone Grit and at other horizons
