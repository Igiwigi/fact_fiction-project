where the trend has even reversed, many inequalities persist [7].

To explain the remainder of such gaps, economists have advanced the idea
that women are less competitively inclined than men [8,9]. In both the laboratory
and the field, experimental data suggest that women are less competitive, more
averse to risk, and less ambitious than men in laboratory games and field settings
[2,10]. By shying away from competitive environments, women might self-select
into activities that have lower but more predictable returns—with significant
implications for their economic wellbeing—including career choice, performance
in competitive workplaces, and negotiations of salaries and promotions [11,12]. In
fact, some recent evidence shows that competitiveness is associated with positive
economic gains for the individual [13]. Yet, other disciplines are turning up
increasing evidence of the crucial benefits that women would gain for themselves
and their offspring by securing resources and reaching high status, giving rise to
the puzzle of why women do not show competitiveness [14-19].

Here, we propose that such a puzzle could be explained by focusing on the
social features that a contest possesses and the costs, not just the benefits, that
winning may bring to the individual. If one important way to understand
