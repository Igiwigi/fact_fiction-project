measured at large distances from the interface. In fact,
the local water structure dominates ion distributions [3,
4], double-layer capacitance [5,6], electrokinetic mobility
and surface conductivity [7-10]. The changing structure
and dynamics of the water close to the interface manifest
themselves primarily in the form of two quantities: the
viscosity profile and the dielectric profile. In their seminal
work, Lyklema & Overbeek [8] consider a decrease
in the interfacial dielectric constant and an increase
in the interfacial viscosity due to the strong electric
field in the interfacial layer. They argue that, although
electric field effects on the dielectric constant may be
