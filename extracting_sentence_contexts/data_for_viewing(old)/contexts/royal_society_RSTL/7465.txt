The equation of the curve is thus obtained in the form V=0

be equiyalent to the before-mentioned equation U=

paring with the second of the two expressions of U, it appears that we in fact have
V=2TU.

9. Taking as parameter tan 4 6, or if we please cos 9+4x/ —1 sin 6, the foregoing values
of (x,y) in terms of 6 give (x,y, 1) proportional to rational and integral functions of the
parameter of the degree 6; 80 that not only the curve is a sextic curve, but it is a uni-
cursal sextic, or curve of the order 6 with the maximum number, =10, of nodes and
cusps; that is, if $ be the number of nodes and # the number of cusps, we have 3+x=10.
Moreover, introducing the same parameter into the equation of the tangent, this equation
is 8een to be of the degree 4 in the parameter ; that is, the class of the curve is =4: this
implies 23+3z=26, and we have therefore 3=4, z=6. To verify these numbers, it is

X to be remarked that it appears by the equation of the curye that there is at each of the
