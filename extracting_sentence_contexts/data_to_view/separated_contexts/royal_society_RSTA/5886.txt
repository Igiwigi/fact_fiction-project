Finally, we will also provide some details about
numerical approximations.

(a) Solution of Problem 4.1

For a given value of £9, a local maximizer tig, of Problem 4.1 can be found as tig, = limn—oo ul?
using the following iterative procedure representing a discretization of a gradient flow projected
on Se,

ug y= Pse, (a? + mVR(us))

ul) =w, (Al)

where ul is an approximation of the maximizer obtained at the n-th iteration, u® is the initial

guess and t, is the length of the step in the direction of the gradient VR(uo?). Projection onto the
constraint manifold Sg, is performed using the composite operator Ps,,. :H?(Q) > Se, defined as

Ps, (u) = Ps,(Mo(u)), where (A 2a)

Eo

TIo(u) =u — V[A7(V - u)] (A2b)


and Pe,(u) = a (A 2c) 0 |

in which (A 2b) and (A 2c) represent, respectively, enforcement of the incompressibility condition : <
and normalization related to the enstrophy constraint. : 3
A key step in procedure (A 1) is evaluation of the gradient VR(u) of the objective functional :2

R(u), cf. (1.9b), representing its (infinite-dimensional) sensitivity to perturbations of the velocity
field u, and it is essential that the gradient be characterized by the required regularity, namely,
VR(u) € H?(2). This is, in fact, guaranteed by the Riesz representation theorem [81] applicable
because the Gateaux differential R’(u;.): H?(2) > R, defined as R’(u; w’) :=lim,_,j €~![R(u+
eu’) — R(u)] for some perturbation u’ € H?(Q), is a bounded linear functional on H?(2). The
Gateaux differential can be computed directly to give

from which, by the Riesz representation theorem, we obtain

Ri(u;w) = (VR(w), uw evo) = (v R(u), w )evey (A4)

with the Riesz representers VR(u) and vER(u) being the gradients computed with respect to
the H? and L* topology, respectively. We remark that, while the H? gradient is used exclusively
in the actual computations, cf. (A 1), the L? gradient is computed first as an intermediate step. :
Identifying the Gateaux differential (A3) with the L? inner product and performing integration [8
by parts yields 8
