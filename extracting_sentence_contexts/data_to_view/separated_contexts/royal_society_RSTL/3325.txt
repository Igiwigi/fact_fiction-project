Im-
portant as these parts must be in the ceconomy, there are no facts to countenance
the belief, that they are directly connected with the functions of motion and sen-
Sibility. Indeed the posterior column of the spinal marrow has been found softened
to a degree, which we must suppose inconsistent with the continuance of its func-
tions; and yet sensibility has been entire. But let not this fact militate against our
conelusions. The column in the spinal marrow which gives rise to the sensitive roots,
is posterior to that from which the motor roots arise ; but is not the posterior portion
of the spinal marrow. Some have imagined, from finding the posterior column of
the spinal marrow softened, in cases where sensibility was entire during the life of
the patient, that they had found an argument unfavourable to our general conclu-
Si0ns.
