Here 'T is the time from focus to epicentre, d, and d, are the thicknesses of the upper
layers and w, and wz, are the velocities in them, ws is the velocity at the top of the ultra-
basic layer and 0 is its rate of increase with depth (assumed linear). The estimates of
H obtained in this manner are 352 km. (0-055R) from the P time of 44 sec. and 365 km.
(0-057 R) from the S time of .80 sec. If the granitic layer is entirely absent, these
estimates would be increased by 1-5 per cent., while if the granitic and intermediate
layers are double the thickness that we have assumed the estimates would be diminished
by 3 percent. The correct values of b are not likely to differ from those we have assumed
by more than 50 per cent., but even a difference as large as this would only affect our
results by 3 percent. We may regard the mean of the two estimates, 360 km. (0-056 R)
as accurate to within about 5 per cent.

The fact that this mean value of the depth below the surface is not very different from
the mean estimate of the depth below normal makes it quite certain that normal earth-
quakes must originate within a few tens of kilometres below the surface.

The depth of the focus in relation to the magnitudes of the surface and upper crustal
features may be visualised from fig. 6. This is a rough scale drawing of a section of the
upper layers of the earth across the Sea of Japan in the region of the earthquake ; the
depths of the granitic and intermediate layers are assumed to be about the same as the
estimates obtained for continental areas. The focus of the disturbance is seen to be well
down in the ultra-basic layer and the depth is comparable with the width of the Sea of
Japan. According to the International Seismological Summary about 30 earthquakes
of abnormal focal depth occurred in the Japanese zone during the ten years 1918-27 ;
about 70 per cent. of these originated at about the same focal depth as the disturbance
