The celebrated discovery made by MaLvus, of the polarisa-
tion of light by oblique reflection, is perhaps the most impor-
tant that optics has received since the discovery of the principle
of the achromatic telescope ; but though it developed a new
set of phenomena, analogous to those produced by doubly
refracting crystals, yet as the polarisation of one of the images,
at least, formed by these crystals, was effected by refraction,
and not by reflection, it did not furnish us with any information
respecting the manner in which they polarised the transmitted
light. The discovery, however, of the polarisation of light by
oblique refraction, forms the connecting link between these
two classes of facts, and holds out the prospect of obtaining a
direct explanation of the leading phenomena of double re-
fraction,

* In estimating the quantity of light absorbed, Boucuss (Traite f'Optique 5ur
la gradation de la Lumzere, p. 156â€”160,) compared the quantity transmitted by
four pieces ot glass with the quantity transmitted by one piece having the same thick-
ness with all the four, The pencil of light was incident at an angle of 15%, and hence

the 177th part of the light transmitted by each plate was polarised, and therefore
not altogether subject to the general law of reflection.
