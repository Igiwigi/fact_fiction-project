This peak shift is an indication of the Co incorporation into the Pt fcc structure, which causes
a decrease in the lattice constant of Pt-Co alloy (2.19 A) compared with the pure Pt (2.25 A). Therefore, the substitution of Co into Pt lattice leads to the contraction of the unit cell [9,53,54]. It
is interesting to see that there are no peaks of Co in the Pt-Co/SiOz XRD patterns, which can be
attributed to the fact that most of the Co is located in the proximity of Pt, forming the alloy. Additionally, it is probable that Co might be present in the amorphous form and thus is not
detected. These postulates are in agreement with the study done by Dohade ef al. [52] related
to the Pt-Co alloy formation.
