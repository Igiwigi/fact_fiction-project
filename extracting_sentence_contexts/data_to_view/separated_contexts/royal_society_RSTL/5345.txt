for fx with 7,,_,.z must contain the same number of }'s ; but the difference will be;
that if 0h,.9h4...9h,, is positive an þ will occupy the first place in each scale; or the
Second place in each scale;. but if negative,/then in one. scale an-(4) will occupy the:
first place, and in the other scale the second place. Art. (52.). The same process of common measure or residues which serves to furnish
a rhizoristic series for f(x) or a synrhizoristic series for fx and pz, will serye also to
furnish superior and inferior limits to the real roots of any proposed equation: Thus
suppose fi to he any rational integral function of (@),of the degree, (n) and @(z) any
other function of x, which I shall begin with snpposing to. be,of the degree;(n—1),
and let the successive quotients resulting from the: process. of, finding the greatest
common measure of fr, px continued until the last remainder is not a constant but zero,
be supposed to be (as they may generally be taken, but subject to cases of exception,
which will hereafter be alluded to) x linear functions q, qz+-+4,z then we. shall have
