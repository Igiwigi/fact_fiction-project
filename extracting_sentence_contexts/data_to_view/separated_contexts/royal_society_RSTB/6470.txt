Fic. 13—Diagram of vessel-parenchyma pit-pair with wide aperture extending as far as the
border. a, tangential section; b, cross-section; c, radial section. In a study of large pit-pairs between vessels and parenchyma cells recently made at
this Institute, Ross (1936) has attempted to estimate their significance. From his work,
as well as from this investigation, one fact emerges clearly, that large vessel-parenchyma
pit-pairs do not occur unless the intervascular pitting is large. Ross states that they
only occur in ‘‘those woods whose intervascular pits are round, alternately arranged
and have a diameter greater than about six microns”’. In the Sterculiaceae, too, they
only occur where the pit-pairs are large, but even then they are not universal in all
genera.
