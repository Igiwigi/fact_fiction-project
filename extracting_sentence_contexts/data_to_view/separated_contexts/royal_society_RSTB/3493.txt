The medullary fold ends posteriorly in a tolerably
abrupt fashion, whilst the small basal trigeminal ganglionic thickening behind it is
really continued, not into the medullary rim, but in a forward and outward direction
alongside of the medullary rim, and even partially overlapped by the free margin of
the latter, as may be recognised in fig. 86,

It has been stated previously that in the slightly older Specimen M the specialised
thickening in the anterior part of the basal region of the Trigeminus lobe is no longer
apparent (cf. fig. 75). In consequence of this fact, the boundaries of the transverse
encephalic constriction are in this specimen more clearly evident. The medial
marginal part of the anterior extension of the trigeminal plate still shows somewhat
greater opacity than the body of the plate. Fig.
