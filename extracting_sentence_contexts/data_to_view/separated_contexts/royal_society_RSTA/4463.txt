Lieutenant W. H. B. Law, R.N. :—- For 20 minutes before totality the sky
darkened appreciably. The clouds to the south took an ashy grey colour, the land
also took a dark grey tint, and looked, if possible, even more desolate and barren
than before. In fact, the whole appearance of land and sky to the south looked as
if a heavy thunderstorm was imminent. “About 4 seconds before the signal for totality was given, a rift in the clouds
allowed the sun to be seen. The moon had covered all except a thin crescent at the
left hand bottom corner ; the inner edge of the crescent through binoculars appeared
somewhat rough ; then the clouds came over again.
