By contrast, when mobility is low,
individuals are unlikely to change their rank in the distribution over time, or the changes may
happen slowly. As a means to study the drivers of economic mobility in srGBM, we consider two
standard measures: Spearman’s rank correlation and the earnings elasticity (EE). In fact, both the
rank correlation and the EE are measures of immobility, and to consider them as measures of
mobility one has to consider their complement or their inverse.

(i) Spearman’s rank correlation

Spearman’s rank correlation p;,is defined on a joint distribution of income at two points in time,
t and t + A. Mathematically, it reads

_ 6Lilrgxi(t)) — rgai(t + AYP
N(N2 — 1) ,

pra=i (3.5)

where rg(x) is the rank transformation of x. This measure is bounded between —1 and 1. pz,4 =1
suggests perfect immobility, a state in which there is no change in income ranks between the two
points in time.
