the diagram to be moved towards the right hand, the third to be moyed further to
the right, &c., and taking the sum of the ordinates of the various curves which are
then placed vertically one below the other; it is clear that the large ordinates of one
curve will be added to the small ones of another, so as to produce in every part an
approximate mean value. If we perform the same operation numerically, combining
the last number of the first column in the Table with the last but three in the second
column, the last but six in the third column, and s0 on, to the twelfth column (observing
that the numbers in the columns recur after the sixth, or that they may be supposed
to recur before the first), and if we remark that by adding the numbers from twelve
columns we do in fact combine the intensities from all the diffused images that are
in any degree superposed ; and if we then divide by twelve, we find the following
numbers to represent the intensities :
6884, 6882, 6881, 6879, 6875, 6872, 6870, 6868, 6867, 6868, &c.,

the greatest number being 6884 and the Jeast 6868. It is plain that no bands will be
visible here.

2. Let the violet end of the external spectrum be on the same side as the retarding
plate. The same algebraic expression holds as in the other case, but there js this im-
portant difference in the interpretation, that R (which increases towards the violet
end of the spectrum) is greatest in the spectrum on the retina on that side on which
