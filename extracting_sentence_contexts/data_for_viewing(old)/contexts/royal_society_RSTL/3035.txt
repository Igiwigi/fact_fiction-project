body. The one has been left in the state in which it was
handed down to us by the Egyptian embalmers, dark, tanned,
contracted, and impregnated with the mummifying ingre-
dients ; the other, on the contrary, has been deprived, in
toto, by my process, of those ingredients, (the principal of
which is bees wax, as will be seen from the quantity which
I collected); s0 as to appear like the same part in a recent
subject, soft, elastic, of a yellowish white, with the cutaneous
pores very distinct, and with its muscles, adipose substance,
and blood vessels perfectly striking.

The 5:zth, and last fact to be noticed, is the presence of
several moderately sized lumps of an earthy matter, mixed
with pieces of resin, found loose in the cavity of the abdomen.
That these were thrown into that cavity for the double pur-

periments made to ascertain the nature of the earthy substance
in question, tend to prove the latter part of these conjectural
propositions. It was found to consist of the same saline com-
pounds, noticed on the surface of the mummy, mixed with
