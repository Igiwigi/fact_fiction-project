These observations, however, led me
into a more extended inquiry than I at first contemplated, the results of which I now
venture to lay before the Royal Society. It is needless to point out the difficulties which attend, not only the minute investi-
gation, but a clear and connected description, of a structure s0 intricate and delicate
as that of the spinal chord. It may be proper however to state, with regard to the
contents of this paper, that those facts only which were verified by cautious and re-
peated examination have been brought forward with confidence ; while in cases where
the results of my observations were less satisfactory, I have expressed myself with
corresponding reserve. Yet, no labour has been spared in order to arrive at correct
conclusions. My observations were made, by means of one of Mr. Ross's finest
microscopes, on many thousand preparations of the spinal chord of Man, of the Calf,
Sheep, Pig, Dog, Cat, Rabbit, Guinea Pig and Frog, and occupied a period of more
than two years.
