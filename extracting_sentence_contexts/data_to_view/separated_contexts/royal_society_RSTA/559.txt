The MH precipitation differences with modern conditions are
located to the north of the present-day ITCZ [50]. Model biases in the modern location of the ITCZ
are therefore also a factor that partly impacts the MH vegetation feedback.

4. Model biases and vegetation feedback in Africa

The fact that land-surface albedo feedbacks are affected by model biases in the PI simulations
makes it difficult to fully disentangle the part of the results that is purely because of model
dynamical and physical representations of climate from the part that results from model tuning,
initial state and implementation of the experimental protocol. To further illustrate this point

we consider MH simulations run with two different versions of the IPSL climate model [33]: : =
IPSL_CM5A_LR and IPSL_CM5B_LR. These two versions share the same ocean, sea-ice and land- : yy
surface models.
