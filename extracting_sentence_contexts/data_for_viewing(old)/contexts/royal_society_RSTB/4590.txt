and inner linings, this layer was relatively thin, having a thickness of less than
one-tenth of that of the striated zone already referred to. In another specimen
which had not recently undergone ecdysis this layer exceeded in thickness that of
the striated zone as is seen in fig. 38. Both the matrix layer and the chitinous
lining are thrown into a series of folds and sulci on the lumen side of the gut wall.
A well-developed muscle coat is present, the inner layer being composed of circular
fibres, and the outer layer arranged longitudinally. Between the muscle coats and
the matrix layer there are frequently spaces occupied by numerous small tracheal
branches and capillaries (t7h.), the rectum being exceptionally well supplied in this
respect. A small amount of connective tissue is also present. Groups of powerful
radial muscles are very prominent and pass outwards to be attached to the neigh-
bouring body-wall (fig. 62). When filled with waste material, the rectum is capable
of a large amount of distension, which is due to the fact that, at definite locations,
there are deep folds in its walls. The latter are much thinner and more flexible at
these positions than elsewhere, and allow either for the rectum to be distended when
full, or to remain in a flattened or collapsed condition, when empty. Around the
anus the structure of the rectal wall undergoes alteration. The matrix layer becomes
much thinner, the prominent striated zone is no longer in evidence, and only slight
indications of foldings are present. Both radial and circular muscles are to be dis-
tinguished, the latter forming a definite sphincter ani.

(e) Histology of the Organs Associated with the Digestive System.â€”The salivary
glands (fig. 31) consist of a variable number of lobules, each of which is composed of
an aggregation of secretory cells which discharge their products into the duct of the
lobule. The latter opens into the main salivary duct of its side; in some cases it
