are enhanced lines or not. If these are omitted, all the titanium lines abnormally
strong in the flash, and all the iron lines excepting the three at \\ 3856°5, 4325-9, and
4404°8, are enhanced lines. ,

If all the enhanced lines in the above-mentioned lists are considered, it is found
that all the more strongly enhanced lines of iron and titanium coincide with strong
lines in the flash (11 Fe lines and 21 Ti lines). But since many of these lines are of
compound origin in the flash, it is not possible to say whether they are all of abnormal
intensity, ¢.g., 4351°9, 4549°6, 45561, 4629°6, and others. The quartette of enhanced
iron lines at 4508°5, 4515°5, 4520-4 and 4522°7 are all abnormally strong in the flash
considered as Fe lines only, but according to Rowxanp three of these are of
compound origin, one including Ti. However, it seems probable that the abnormal
intensity of this group is chiefly due to the fact that the lines are enhanced lines,

There can be little doubt from this inquiry that the enhanced lines do play a
significant part in the flash spectrum, and the abnormal intensities of these lines are
not due to errors in the assignment of origin in RowLanp’s tables or to over-estimates
of intensity in the flash.

Of the abnormally weak lines a considerable number are probably the result of
under-estimates due to the close proximity of very strong lines of other elements.
There remain a few, however, which cannot be thus explained ; among these
particular attention may be called to the titanium lines at dd 3753-00, 3924°67,
4171°21, and 4306-08, all of intensity 4 in the solar spectrum, and the chromium line
at 4 4626°36. No satisfactory reason can at present be given for the weakness or
