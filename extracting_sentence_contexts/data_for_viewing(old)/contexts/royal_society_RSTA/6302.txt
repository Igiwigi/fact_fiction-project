Glob indices, but is particularly clear for the fAMV_BM where there is warming across the entire
North Pacific. However, in contrast, the simulated iAMV is dominated by SST anomalies which
reside largely in the North Atlantic consistently across models for both indices, and the global
teleconnections are also weak across models.

In summary, we find that conclusions on the relative contribution of [AMV to the total AMV
depend significantly on the AMV index used. In particular, the temporal correlation between


simulated fAMV and observed AMV drops substantially when making the North Atlantic relative
to global changes (i.e. using AMV-Glob rather than AMV_BM) as does the impact of forcings on
the total variance of the AMV and the time scale of AMV (i.e. the autocorrelation). This appears
to be due to the fact that the fAMV is strongly related to hemispheric externally forced signals
in the models, but the changes in the North Atlantic basin are relatively more important in
the observations (and for iAMV). Furthermore, the simulated fAMV is particularly large in the
strong in models, which is consistent with the stronger externally forced interhemispheric signals
in these models that also appears to be unrealistic [79]. Therefore, due to the sensitivity of the
AMV_BM index to hemispherically forced signals, and for brevity, in the rest of this article, we
will focus on results from the AMV-Glob. However, the general conclusions on the processes
responsible for fAMV and iAMV are not overly sensitive to the index used (see supplementary
figures, electronic supplementary material).

(c) Surface-flux drivers of externally forced AMV

We now turn our attention to the drivers of the simulated fAMV. Consistent with previous studies
