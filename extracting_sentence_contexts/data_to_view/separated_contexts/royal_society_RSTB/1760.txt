He therefore undertakes to correct the figures in an approximate
way. Thus, he obtains the following corrected probabilities: 15-19, 41°3 (instead of 264) ; 20-24,
, 51-9 (43°) ; 25-29, 43° (39°7); 30-34, 36° (349); 35-39, 30° (29°6); 40-44, 18:1 (179); 45-49,
: 33 (32). Mr. Kiser mentions in his letter that, in consequence of an error in method, the
probabilities grew somewhat too high, but that this is counterbalanced in some way by the fact that
13 per cent. of the births are wanting. We have further to mention that the author calculated the
probabilities only for those quinquennial groups in which he could observe at least 2000 families.
