as € | 0. In sharp contrast with the Vlasov—Poisson system, for which the IVP is well-posed,
the limit equations are not well-posed in the usual sense [10], although there is a set of initial
conditions, defined by a suitable ‘Penrose—Rayleigh’ type condition around, which the IVP is
presumably well-posed [11]. As a matter of fact, the study of the limiting process is very delicate
and is an active field of research, for which we refer, as a very recent reference, to [12]. The Vlasov—
Poisson system itself admits a ‘multi-stream formulation’ that has been used for a while, for
instance by Grenier in [13] and recently by Baradat [12] (at least in the framework of Plasma
Physics for which ¢ is negative). The corresponding ‘multi-stream’ (pressure-less) Euler—Poisson
system (MEPS) reads

ac+V-q=0, c=c(t,x,a)>0, q=4q(t,x,a)e RY, (1.10)
