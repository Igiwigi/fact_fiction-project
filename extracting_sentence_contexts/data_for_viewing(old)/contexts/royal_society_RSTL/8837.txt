BETWEEN THE STOMACH AND INTESTINE.

In the following Chapter the anatomical continuity of BruxNER's glands with the
coiled tubes of the stomach will be described. But before proceeding to the relation
of the facts a short account of the history of the subject will be given.

Bzven (104), 1849, spoke of racemose or acinous glands of the pylorus, which pass
into the acinous glands of the duodenum (BruNNER's glands).

EckgR (105), 1852, said that the racemose glands of the portio pylorica form an
obvious transition to BRUNNER's glands.

This fact was either overlooked or denied until

CoBELLI (106), 1864, found, in the pyloric end of the stomach of man, branched
mucous glands and acinous glands. 'The acinous glands are arranged in rows or little
heaps radiating from the pylorus. At the commencement of the intestine the glands
of BRUNNER were found in the submucosa and in the mucosa ; the muscularis mucose
at this point is very incomplete ; further down the intestine there is a definite muscu-
laris mucosz, and the glands of BRUNNER are only found in the 8ubmucosa. From these
observations the acinous glands of the portio pylorica may be © considered as a conti-
nuation ” of BruxXER's glands. In the rabbit and dog only mucous glands were found
in the pyloric end of the stomach. In the cat and in the Mustela putorius acinous
glands occur in the pyloric end of the stomach. In all animals there exists a short
tract where the glands of TarBERKEnN are wanting, and where BRUNNER'S glands are
