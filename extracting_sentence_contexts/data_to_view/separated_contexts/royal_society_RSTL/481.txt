It may be observed also, that the elastic force of the vapour of alcohol of
su!phur was stated by Mr. BexzeLi1vs and myself, in our joint paper, to be only
7-36 inches, instead of 10,75 ; but this difference is accounted for from the circum-
stance of the temperature, which in that instance was 535%, instead of 669; a differ-
ence which is very nearly that which might have been expected from a comparison
with the force of ether at the same temperature as given in Mr. DaLTon's tables. * Mercury may also be fiozen by a similar process, by means of ether, as I have

the effects just related,” The fact is, that all these attempts
have hitherto failed, and the simplest mode of performing the
experiment has uniformly yielded the best results. Indeed, I
am now inclined to believe, that unless a substance were found
which should exert an attraction upon the sulphureous liquors
without being itself evaporable, (as is the case with the sul-
phuric acid, in Mr. LesLit's mode of freezing water), I have
nearly reached the limit of cold that can be produced in this
manner. It may be proper to add, that the presence of sul-
phuric acid in this experiment would have no immediate effect,
as it exerts no attraction upon the volatilized liquor ; yet by
drying the rarefied atmosphere which surrounds the bulb, it
might perhaps assist a little in promoting the process of eva-
poration.
