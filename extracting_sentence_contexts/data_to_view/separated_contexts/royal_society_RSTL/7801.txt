Every line in the preceding figure being thus measured on the average about five
times, 80 as to reduce errors as far as possible, the means of the measurements were
taken; and of those lines for which a sufficient number of measurements existed, 80 as
to trace their behaviour across the field with some degree of certainty, these measure-
ments were represented in the form shown in Plate I. (A), where, however, only six lines
are thus shown, although in reality for the behaviour in the direction W W' ten distinct
lines, and for that in the direction R R' eight lines gave extensive data for our purpose,
and therefore eighteen lines were finally employed for our mean results. The mean radius of the disk produced by the whole light falling upon the plates was
found to be 3267 inches; and this length was subdiyided into seven spaces, giving 0-267
inch to the central portion, and drawing concentric circles at distances of half an inch
from each other; the central portion, having a radius of 0'267 inch, was considered as
the centre; and, from the means of the measurements as above indicated, the behaviour
of every line was determined at the centre and at each intersection of these concentric
circles with the two radii W W', RR'. These means are given in the following two
Tables, which contain also the behaviour of each separate line, which we have called
1, 2, 8, &c., each of these numbers representing in fact a different object. Behaviour of eighteen lines, photographed at different distances from the centre of the
field in the Kew Photoheliograph. A.
