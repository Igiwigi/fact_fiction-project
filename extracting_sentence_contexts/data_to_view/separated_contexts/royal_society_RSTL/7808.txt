This first ridge is followed by a series of other wave-ridges, at distances
apart depending on the period and virtual depth of the original disturbance, and di-
verging at an angle depending on the ratio borne by the speed of the waves to the speed
of the ship. Mr. FRouDE remarks, as an observed fact, that the second wave-ridge of the series is
that which appears to carry away the most energy. This wave-ridge is in contact with
the side of the vessel at a point which we may call B, at a distance astern of A depending
on the dimensions and position of the waves. Suppose, now, that the surface of the
vessel is 80 shaped that the disturbance impressed by it on the water has a tendency to
produce a wave-trough at B; this disturbance will, to a certain extent, neutralize, by
interference, the disturbance originating at A; that is, to use Mr.
