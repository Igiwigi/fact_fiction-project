her colleague Klim Ivanovich Chuyumov on an expedition to Alma-Ata in 1969.

In these, and other space missions, women, although still always in the minority, have played
recognized roles within the project teams. On the Rosetta spacecraft, for example, two out of the 11
scientific experiments included have been led by women. One of these, Giada (the Grain Impact
Analyser and Dust Accumulator), was led by Alessandra Rotundi from Naples. The other, Rosina
(the comet pressure sensor) was led by Kathrin Altwegg of Bern.

Caroline and her comet discoveries form part of the first wave of this long history of comet
research. Like a number of her contemporaries she was interested in sweeping the sky, searching
out new comets to add to existing lists. Her discovery served as one small part of this steady
accumulation of data that would in time yield our current understanding of what comets are and
how they behave. It is the fact that the comet discussed in Caroline’s paper was discovered by a

woman that makes this discovery stand out among those of her contemporaries. : =

The history of women in science is a field that has developed considerably over the last century. : yy
With each new generation, there has been a subtly different understanding of Caroline Herschel’s 2
significance and the importance of this and her other comet discovery announcements. In terms of aes
modern scholarship, Caroline’s paper is informative in highlighting some of the rules governing 22
female engagement within the scientific community in the late eighteenth century. : Ss
