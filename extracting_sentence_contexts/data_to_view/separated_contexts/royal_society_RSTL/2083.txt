I have taken-many hundreds of the animals from

their holes, and kept them in confinement till they died, but

never saw. one of them attempt to change its place. It is evident that the Saxicava does not bore like the Pholas,
by a rotatory motion, for; the hole is not quite round, and
its smallest diameter is not equal to the depth of the Saxicava,
from the' hinge to. the ventral margin. - The animal there-
fore has not room to. turn itself; and its attachment by a
short byssus imposes an additional restraint upon it : indeed,
an examination of its muscles is sufficient to show that they
cannot effect a rotatory motion. The only: boring motion
which can be supposed to be given to the shell is that effected
by the action of the muscles of the foot ; that, in fact, by
which a Bivalvye buries itself in the sand ; but this, although
s0 well adapted for travelling over a smooth surface, or for
burrowing into a substance penetrable by the foot, would be
ineffectual here, because the animal being already in contact
with the rock, the foot cannot be projected to form a fixed
point beyond the $hell. Even were it otherwise, the texture
of the hell is 80 soft, that it could make no impression upon
the stone without being itself acted on ; and the effect of this
would be permanent, because superficial injuries of the shell
are never repaired. | But nothing} of this kind'is met with. I have even found a Saxicava fixed between two others, which
was 80 compressed that it was quite flat, and little more than


and boring marine animals. 363

a third. of its proper. thickness ; yet neither of the three
showed the slightest mark of friction, and the cuticle of the
sides in contact was as perfect as usual.
