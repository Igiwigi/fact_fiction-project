It was not considered necessary to correct for the volume of liquid
above the bottom of the meniscus as the error appertains to both the determination of
capacities and of the density. One uncertainty remains, in that when making up the
solution, the neck above the level has been wetted and an unknown, and possibly
variable, quantity of liquid is left adhering. There is no means of correction for this,
but the fact that the densities of slightly differing solutions generally follow the
weight concentration indicates that this source of error is of no great importance. Tn the following table all the results on the densities of the solutions are given. The first column gives the weight concentration, i.e., the number of grammes of
anhydrous salt in 100 gr. water, and the second gives the density.
