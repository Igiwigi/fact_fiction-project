The lumination of the archenteron is upon the whole, however, more
complete and pronounced than in the earlier stage represented by Specimens P and E. This is evident on comparison of the text-figs. 10-12. We are inclined to attribute
this fact to mere diminution in quantity of the cellular material of the archenteron in
the later stage, so that compression of the lumen is to a large extent absent. Obliteration of the lumen, or reduction from an actual to a virtual lumen indicated
only by a line, is a common accompaniment of the more massive cellular development
of the walls of the intact archenteron in the earlier epoch. It is easy to understand
how a cessation of active cellular proliferation at a later period might result in an
opening up or reopening and widening of the narrower actual or potential lumen
occurring in the antecedent period.
