FROM THE CARBONIFEROUS ROCKS OF AUSTRALIA. 27

General Observations.

(i) Comparison with Tempskya and other “ False Stems.’’—The Cretaceous fern
Tempskya* affords perhaps the nearest analogy with the condition seen in C. australis,
although there are important points of difference in the structure. In both, the false
stem consists of relatively weak repeatedly forked leaf-bearing axes embedded in a
matrix of adventitious roots. But whereas in Clepsydropsis the numerous persistent
petioles form a considerable part of the transverse section, in Tempskya by far the
greater part of the section is occupied by the transversely cut roots. A significant
point of agreement between the two types is the small number of root-origins observed
—a fact which indicates that the roots were of great length. In Clepsydropsis the only
root-origins seen are in the central part of the false stem, whence they appear to have
grown out towards the peripheral zone before they turned downwards.

Another feature in common between the two genera is the presence of numerous
roots invading other organs of the plant to which they themselves belong. In C.
australis, so far as observed, the invading roots are confined to the petioles; but in
Tempskya Knowltoni, as Prof. Sewarv has shown,} even the stems are not free from
them. In both plants the indications are that the organs were invaded after decay
had set in, and the suggestion that the burrowing roots drew nourishment from the
disorganised tissues would apply equally to the two ferns. Indeed, it would be no
surprise to find that in the later stages of growth the proximal (oldest) parts of false stems
like those of Tempskya and C. australis consisted chiefly or even entirely of decayed
