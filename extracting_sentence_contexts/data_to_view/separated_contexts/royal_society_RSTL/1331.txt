Admitting now the limb of an animal 'to be in-such an
experiment completely insulated, and that the metal actually
becomes electrical from the friction it undergoes, surely a very
few applications can only be required to place them both in
the same tate with respect to the electric fluid ; and when this
happens, all motions depending on the transflux of that fluid
must necessarily cease. 'T haye found, however, that a piece
of metal which has been rubbed will excite contractions, after
it has been many times applied to' the limb. In one instance,
vigorous contractions were occasioned by the 200th applica-
tion ; and if I had chosen to push the experiment further, I
might certainly have produced many more. I may mention

also, as connected with this fact, that" I have frequently ob-
served a piece of metal-to excite motions,-an entire day after it
Had been rubbed. What I have said will, probably, be thought more than suf-
ficient to prove; that'metals, after being rubbed,.do.not produce


which incites the Muscles of Animals to contract. 259

muscular contractions by means of any disengaged-electricity
they contain... If my opinion were now asked, respecting the
mode in which friction - communicates such a power to them,
I should say, that the part which has been rubbed is so far
altered; in -S5ome condition. or property, as to. be affected dif-
ferently, by the fluid 'exciters, from a part which has not been
S rubbed ; in short, that the rubbed part becomes, as it were, a
o difterent -metal.
