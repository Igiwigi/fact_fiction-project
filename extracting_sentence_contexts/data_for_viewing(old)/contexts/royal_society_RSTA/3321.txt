another. Docking of this structure onto the structure of the catalytic domain derived from SAXS
finds that the best-fit models place the base of the P-CR near the opening to the catalytic site [33],
a position that is not easy to reconcile with that proposed for the AtCESA1Cat trimer [32]. These
apparent differences in structures predicted from rice CESA8 and Arabidopsis CESA1 may reflect
a real difference in the structure of the central catalytic domain between these two different CESA
proteins. However, given the sequence similarities and that they are both likely to be associated
into complexes that exhibit the same rosette structures, an entirely different organization
seems unlikely.

CESA1 association into a trimer [32] may easily be reconciled with a CSC containing 18
CESA proteins in which the lobes of the CSC are composed of homotrimers of three different
CESA proteins (figure 3a). As the authors point out, however, the homotrimers generated may
be a consequence of the fact that only one CESA subunit is being used and may not reflect the
situation in vivo where three different CESA isoforms that may form heterotrimers are being co-
expressed (figure 3a). The same criticism also applies to the study on OsCESA8Cat, which appears
to associate to form a dimer [35]. This would suggest that there is sufficient uncertainty and
contradictory data that, by itself, this work does not provide an unambiguous answer regarding
CESA organization. It is likely that these issues will only be resolved with the availability of
higher-resolution structures of either a complete CESA protein or the entire CSC.

microscopy

The large size of the CSC should make it directly visible using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). However, to date, there are no such reports despite the fact that these complexes are
