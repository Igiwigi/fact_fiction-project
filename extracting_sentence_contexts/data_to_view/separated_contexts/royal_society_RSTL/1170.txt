to the
magnetic meridian, the same law prevailed ; for instance,
when the positive wire was east, and a body was moved round
the circle from the north to the south poles of the same wire ;
its motion (beginning with the lower part of the circle) was
from north to south, or with the upper part from south
to north; and when the needles were arranged round a cy-
linder of paste-board 80 as tocross the wire, and a pencil
mark drawn. in the direction of the poles, it formed a spiral. 16 - Sir Humynry Davy on the

It was perfectly evident from these experiments, that as
many polar arrangements may be formed' as chords can be
drawn in circles surrounding the wire ; and 80 far these phe-
nomena agree with your idea of revolving magnetism ; but
I shall quit this subject, which I hope you will yourself elu-
cidate for the information of the Society, to mention some
other circumstances and facts belonging to the enquiry. Supposing powerful electricity to be passed through two,
three, four, or more wires, forming part of the same circuit
parallel to each other in the same plane, or in different
planes, it could hardly be doubted that each wire, and the
space around it, would become magnetic in the same manner
as a 8ingle wire, though in a less degree; and this I found
was actually the case. When four wires of fine platinum
were made to complete a powerful voltaic circuit, each wire
exhibited its magnetism in the same manner, and stcel filings
on the sides of the wires opposite attracted each other.
