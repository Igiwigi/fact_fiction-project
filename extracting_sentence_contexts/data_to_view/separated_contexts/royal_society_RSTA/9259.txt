The latter,
I regret to say, are wrong owing to an error in arithmetic made in calculating ¢.
which appears as a in the table just referred to when ¢(n — 2) =a M. The paraffins being symmetrical give the value of ¢, that is the decrement due to
each carbon atom, when it is undisturbed by a difference between the end groups: we

The figures in the left hand column give the effect of lengthening the chain by one
carbon atom, and those in the right hand column reflect the change in the internal
polarisation of the molecule due to the substitution of one — CH, group by — COH,
— C,H, CH (OH), or — COOH. The parameter d may be taken to refer not to the internal polarisation of the molecule
but to the influence of the end group upon the field of the solids, The fact that d = 0
for acids might be taken to mean that the molecules are attached to the metal by the
CH, group because the metal is electro-positive and the COOH group also positive
owing to its replaceable hydrogen, but this suggestion is not applicable to glass. Why should the effect of a carbon atom in the chain be independent of the length
of the chain? There is at least one parallel case.
