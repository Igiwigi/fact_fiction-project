group 3), the direction of the genetic spiral was reversed. Two examples are shown in
figs. 5 and 6, Nos. 235 and 377. It can be seen that I, lies on the opposite side of the
apex from that on which it would normally have arisen (compare the drawings of a
section of a normal apex inserted in figs. 5 and 6, on which are indicated the positions
of the cuts in these experiments). From this point onwards the direction of the genetic
spiral was reversed. Measurements of the subsequent divergence angles are given
in Table V, group 3. After a certain number of leaves had been laid down, the
divergence angles approached again the normal value of 136°-3. The first few
angles after the angle between I, and I, generally oscillated above and below the
normal, as can be seen from the Table, but the oscillations were not always
regular.

The fact that I, arose on the opposite side of the apex from the normal when the
angle I,-I, exceeded 180° supports the theory, mentioned in the introduction, that each
primordium arises in the largest gap between the previous primordia. For I, occupied
the larger gap between I, and I;, on whichever side of the apex it lay. Moreover, it is in
accordance with this theory, that when I, arose on the opposite side of the apex from
that on which it would normally have arisen, the genetic spiral continued in the reverse
direction from then onwards. For in normal Fibonacci phyllotaxis, such as that of the
Lupin, since three primordia make up a cycle, the gap in which each subsequent
primordium falls is the gap between the next older primordium but one, and the next
older but two, as can readily be seen from fig. 5, A. And within this gap, the new
primordium falls rather closer to the older of the two primordia on each side—a fact of
which the explanation will become clear below. Normally, therefore, I, would have
fallen in the gap between I, and I;, and on the opposite side of the apex from I, (see
