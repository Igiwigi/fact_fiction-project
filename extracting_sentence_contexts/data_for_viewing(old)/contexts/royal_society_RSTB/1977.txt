220 MR. W. H. LANG ON APOGAMY AND THE DEVELOPMENT

This series may be considered to be a natural one, not in the sense that the steps
have been passed through to arrive at the condition of matters seen in Pteris cretica,
for instance, but as placing the different cases of apogamy in a relation to one another,
which admits of the corresponding parts being recognised. There is, in fact, a
difference between them, depending on the more or less immediate assumption of —
sporophytie characters by the new growth.

From a slightly different point of view, a distinction can be drawn between two
forms of apogamy. These may be termed induced apogamy and direct apogamy. As —
induced apogamy, all those cases may be classed in which the prothalli, under normal —
circumstances, become fertilised, but in which prolonged cultivation and other
alterations in the conditions call forth a more or less complete assumption of the
characters of the sporophyte by the prothallus or outgrowths from it. All the cases
described in this paper, with the exception of a few of the varieties of Nephrodium
Filiz-mas, would come under this head. As direct apogamy, on the other hand, those
cases may be grouped together, in which the prothallus at once produces a bud
