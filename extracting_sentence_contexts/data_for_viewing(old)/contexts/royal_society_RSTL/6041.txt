imagine therefore that he does see them, and may give his description accordingly.

And this source of error is very much enhanced by the fact that it is not an easy
matter always to refer different tones of any one colour to the same colour-sensation ; $0

that a modification of tone, if considerable, may be easily supposed to be a different
colour. The sensations excited by the higher, the middle, and the lower divisions of
any one of the © gammes chromatiques” are s0 different from each other, that it requires
no small degree of reflection and judgment to be able to identify the difference as due
to black or white only, independent of any other colouring agent.

1 believe this difficulty is also felt by the normal-eyed, and the popular nomencla-
ture of colours furnishes illustrations of the fact, different tones of the same colour
having often different names, and being treated as separate colours. Pink and crimson,
lilac and violet, are well-acknowledged examples of this; and a dark shade of orange is
called brown, which generally passes for a separate colour. Persons not well yersed
the principles of colour, are often reluctant to admit that these variations of tone are
really the same hue. Hence we may easily see what a great probability there is that
the colour-blind may acquire the habit of attaching the names of different colours to
what are in reality only varieties of the same sensation ; and as this habit dates from
