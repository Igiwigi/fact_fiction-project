Now, if repeating the same quinquennial calculation for Budapest, we
find that, even at this case, the parity-distance of 5 years is maintained, the following —
probabilities being reached :

44-40 per cent, by the female at 15-19 years, by the male

39-35 ue 20-24 > i 25-29, distance =5 years.

Now the question is, what is the difference of ages at marriage in Norway? If
there also, this difference should coincide with the parity-distance, that is, should
amount to + 24 years, this would furnish a new instance against supposing the
influence of a physiological law. }

Undertaking (on the base of M, Kragr’s Table 25, ‘ Anniversaire,’ p, 112) this
calculation for Norway, by the same method as for Budapest, I found

138,609 older husbands representing a plus of 1,200,008 years
89,168 equi-aged _,,
61,777 younger __,, rf minus 472,785 ,,

289,554 husbands 7 plus of 727,223 ,, = 2°51 years

in the average. Thus the probability is against the supposition of a physiological law,
and the fact that at Budapest the males reach the same natality five years later than
females may be regarded only as a mechanical effect of the social causes which rule
the age combinations of the marrying couples.

7. Difference between the Actual and the Physiological Natality. As mentioned before, the legitim&te natality is to be regarded as the resultant of
two distinct forees: the physiological and the moral moment.
