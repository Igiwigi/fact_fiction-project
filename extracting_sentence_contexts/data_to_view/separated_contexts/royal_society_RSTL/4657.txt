At Madras hourly observations were recorded from the years 1842 to 1845,
both inclusive, and for ten months in 1841, of which I shall not take any account, as
the year is incomplete. The mean monthly fall of the barometer from 9" 41” a.m. to
3b 41” p.m. daily, was respectively 0:124, 0-120, 0'122 and 0-121, exhibiting a singular
uniformity, the differences being only in the thousandths of an inch of pressure. This
uniformity is equally marked in the successive months of the several years, and I have
gone through the labour of working out the details to show it, the Madras printed
observations being a record of facts only without deductions or comment,

310 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL

At Madras the mean daily oscillation would appear to have been least when the
barometer was highest in November, December, or January; and the reverse of
this was the case when the barometer was lowest in May, June and July. The mean
of the four years, at Madras, in the months of highest pressure, December and
January, is 0'111, and the mean of the four years in the months of least pressure
0-122. The mean daily oscillation therefore was greatest when the pressure of the
atmosphere was least.
