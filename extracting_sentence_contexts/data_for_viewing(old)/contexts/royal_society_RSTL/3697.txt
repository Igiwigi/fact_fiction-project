280 DR. KANE ON THE CHEMICAL HISTORY

Chlorides of Palladium.

The properties of the ordinary protochloride of palladium have been for the most part
80 fully described by those chemists that have previously occupied themselves with the
study of this metal, that I shall notice it but briefly. From a strong s0lution, it cry-
stallizes in prismatic needles which are very deliquescent. These crystals were found
to contain two atoms of water of crystallization, which they lose by a gentle heat.

The action of a high temperature on protochloride of palladium developes some
facts of considerable interest, It is not 80 reduced to the metallic state unless by
very violent ignition, but just at a red heat it melts and begins to eyolye chlorine,
which continues until it has parted with one-half of that which it contains. The
liquefied mass which remains is a true subchloride, which is not further acted upon,
unless the heat be very much increased.

The following numerical results will render this decomposition evident :â€”

A. 29'881 grains of the crystallized protochloride being carefully dried as long as
they gave off any traces of watery vapour were found to have lost 5247 grains, or
17:56 per cent.

The dried mass was heated until it had completely fused. It was then dull red.
