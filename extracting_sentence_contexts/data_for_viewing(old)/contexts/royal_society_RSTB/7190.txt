It has been shown that the shape of experimentally induced solenosteles, as seen in
transverse section, follows the contour of the incisions. Further evidence of this fact has
been obtained during the present investigations. Figure 58, plate 27, shows the vascular
system differentiated below an apical meristem which had been isolated on a rectangular
panel of tissue; the solenostele is approximately rectangular in cross-section.

Solenostelic buds were common in the experimental materials under consideration. In
the classical works on stelar morphology in ferns, the view has been advanced that the
solenostele is a stage in the progressive elaboration of the protostele (Bower 1923). That this
is so in the normal development is not in doubt. It is also held that the solenostele marks
an evolutionary advance on the prior, more primitive, protostelic condition, this being
borne out by the facts of ontogeny in solenostelic and dictyostelic ferns. A point of some
interest which has emerged from the present investigation is that in some of the large,
rapidly growing, induced buds, there is no protostelic stage, the vascular system being
solenostelic from the outset.

6. EFFECT OF PUNCTURING THE APICAL CELL

As long as the fern shoot apex is in an actively growing condition, lateral buds are not
formed, or, if they are already present, they do not develop further. But if the apex is
injured, or if its growth is arrested, lateral buds soon appear at specific positions on the
shoot, these positions being occupied by detached meristems or bud rudiments (Wardlaw
19434, b). If, now, an apical cell is punctured so that a minimal amount of necrosis of
the adjacent meristem ensues, it should be possible to observe (i) if the existing leaf primordia
