Theoretical Considerations.

(a) Affinities of Asterochlenopsis.—From the foregoing description the affinities of the
Siberian Zygopterid with Asterochlana on the one hand and with the Australian Zygop-
terid on the other will have become apparent. But in spite of the clear resemblances with
both these plants, it is evident, in view of the new facts brought to light, that it is
generically distinct from either of them. The affinity with Asterochlena is on the whole
closer than with the Australian plant, in spite of the form of the petiolar bundle.
Asterochlenopsis thus seems to be an appropriate name for the new genus.

In his memoir on Asterochlena lara, Prof. PAu BERTRAND showed that the leaf-trace
before assuming its definitive form passes through an uncurved clepsydroid stage. Even
during this stage, however, the vascular strands for the appendages of the primary
rachis (pinnee or aphlebixe) come off not from the extreme edge of the trace but from
points somewhat abaxially placed. This transitory phase is therefore really more like
the definitive form in Asterochlenopsis than like that in “ Olepsydropsis”’ australis
(text-fig. 4). In its earlier phases too the development of the leaf-trace in Asterochlena
runs parallel to that of the Siberian genus. But if we compare the parallel series of
