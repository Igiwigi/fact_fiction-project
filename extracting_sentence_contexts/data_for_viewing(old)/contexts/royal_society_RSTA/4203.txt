The sort of explanations for the evolution of the physical states of individual systems, since the [o
introduction of Newtonian mechanics (except, until Einstein, those given by Newton’s theory of [3B
gravitation), were almost always causal. The associated demand can be traced back in large part ,
to principles of the sort exemplified by the principle of sufficient reason, advocated by Leibniz
and Spinoza, namely:

Sufficient reason. ‘For every fact F, there must be an explanation why F is the case’.

In Hume’s view, the relation of causation is necessary for allowing us to make predictions, that
is, to infer from observations (matters of fact) to (presently) unobserved matters of fact [19]. He
offered a minimalist set of properties a cause should possess in relation to an effect, namely:
(i) ‘Continguity in time and place is a requisite circumstance to the operation of all causes’.
(ii) ‘Priority in time is another requisite circumstance in every case’. (iii) ‘A third circumstance
[is] constant conjunction betwixt the cause and the effect...’ In addition, he noted that ‘Beyond
these three circumstances, I can discover nothing in this cause’ [19]. Thus, for Hume, they are
equivalent to causation.

Most famously, Laplace set the following standard of causation as applied in physics,
