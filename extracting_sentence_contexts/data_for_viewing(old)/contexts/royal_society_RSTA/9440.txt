The theoretical importance of such a comparison is enhanced by the fact that it
provides not only a basis for the discussion of the question whether or not the known
rates of flame propagation through explosive mixtures of different combustible gases
are governed by their relative affinities for oxygen, but also affords decisive evidence
as to the mode of combustion of hydrogen in explosions.
