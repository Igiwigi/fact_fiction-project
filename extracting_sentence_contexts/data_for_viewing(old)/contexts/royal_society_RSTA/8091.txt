such as samarium or other rare earths. It is known that diamonds contain traces of
mineral matter, but the differences found in the two types of diamonds cannot be
referred to traces of foreign substances for the reason that Type 1 diamonds of widely
different geographical occurrence all have the same band about 8 uw, with the same
structure and similar high intensity. Furthermore, all these diamonds exhibit the
same bands and the same sharp cut off at the same place in the ultra-violet region of the
spectrum. If impurities (other than “ structural impurities”) are to be invoked it
will be necessary to assume that diamonds found in different countries all have exactly
the same impurity to the same degree of concentration. Such diamonds should also
exhibit enhanced photo-electric effects due to the action of impurities in liberating
electrons or producing ionic centres from any metal ion. In fact, Type 1 diamonds
show much less photo-electric effect, so that on this view alone the assumption of
impurities must fail to account for the observations. On the other hand, if Type 2
diamonds are assumed to owe their properties to impurities of rare earth character,
we would have to suppose that the impurities have conferred transparency on the
diamonds in infra-red and ultra-violet regions of the spectrum. Such a view cannot,
of course, be reconciled with the known effect of impurities in causing absorption of
radiation in all other cases. The possibility is not excluded, however, that a trace
of a foreign substance may have a marked influence on the ease of liberation or move-
ment of electrons in the lattice of the diamond, thus helping to produce fluorescence or
phosphorescence. In this limited sense alone can the effect of foreign substances be
considered as having any influence on the physical properties here recorded. It should
however be noted that in very few of the diamonds described was there any marked
