Bearing in mind that great accuracy of position is not pretended, and that though
much care was bestowed on the general appearance, thickness, and definition of the lines. ©
the shortness of the time available was entirely inadequate to procuring a good drawing,
and that several of the diagrams should be employed together in deducing a result—
we may proceed to the examination. Comparing the eleven Teneriffe spectrums of the
Sun with FRaUnnoPER's, we can only assume identity in place of the lines A, a. B, C,
D, E., and 6: everything else appears differently. Of this difference the prevailing
feature appears to be, that whereas FRAUNHOPER's spectrum stretches to beyond A,
which is seen by him as a clear and distinct line, —he gives none of the numerous broad
bands and groups of lines between A and «@, and « and B, that were visible on the
mountain and below, wheneyer A was quite or nearly visible.

From the fact of FRauxnopeR's spectrum including A, we might be entitled to expect
from the Teneriffe observations, that it represents the sunset appearance (see No. 10);
but then how can the omission of the broad bands of lines between A and B, and ©
and D, and especially those beyond D, be explained ? If, on the contrary, the absence of
those marked bands is to be regarded as a proof that a high spectrum was intended,
Nos. 1, 2, and 3 indicate that A should not be seen in such a position. Again, while
the spaces between Aa and 4B are blank in FRAaUNnoFER, and well filled in Tene-
riffe, he has some lines between B and C, a compartment always remarkably empty
with us.

Comparing the 'Teneriffe observations inter $6, we may as8ume 2 and 3 as giving ®
near approach to a zenith solar spectrum, and 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 as giving the effects *
