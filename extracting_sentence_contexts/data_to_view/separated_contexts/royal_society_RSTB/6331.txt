Ac-
cording to him, they develop, in the manner first described by Minatkovics (1885),
as small excrescences of the funnel-like opening of the duct. Their development is
intimately linked with that of the sessile hydatid, which in turn is derived from the
funnel-like opening itself. Totpr’s view, which is accepted by Esertu (1904), is well
supported by the following facts. There are numerous “intermediate” forms between
typical sessile and typical pedunculated hydatids. Indeed on the basis of their in-
vestigation of fifty-three testes, WRIGHT and Brown (1912) declare that the histological
structure of even typical specimens of the two classes of hydatid is identical.
