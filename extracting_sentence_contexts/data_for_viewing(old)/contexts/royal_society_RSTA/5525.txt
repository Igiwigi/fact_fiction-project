Here we review the classical Turing analysis of reaction-diffusion systems, essentially following :$
the ideas in [4] which have become standard. We then show how, subject to some assumptions,
these ideas readily generalize to reaction-transport systems. By reaction-transport systems, we
mean a generalization of reaction-diffusion systems with the Laplacian replaced by a general
local transport operator, such as convection-diffusion, chemotaxis, or a graph Laplacian.

We first note that the restriction to systems of reaction-diffusion equations is important for
the kind of pattern formation in which we are interested. While some scalar reaction-diffusion
equations can admit non-constant equilibrium solutions, these do not arise as a direct interaction
of nonlinear reactions and diffusion alone, but require other ingredients. Classic results show
that scalar quasi-linear reaction-diffusion equations with homogeneous Neumann boundary
conditions in convex domains do not admit non-constant stable equilibria, even if temporally
forced [13-15]. In fact, such non-existence of patterns has been shown for a large class of
competitive and cooperative systems in convex domains [16]. Bistable equations in non-convex
domains have been shown to exhibit stable non-constant solutions [17], as have bistable equations
with Dirichlet or inhomogeneous boundary conditions [4,18]. Such solutions do not have the
same qualitative features as patterned states in reaction-diffusion systems, or scalar equations
with more general transport operators, which we focus on for the rest of this review.
