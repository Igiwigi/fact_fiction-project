Eriksson saw no hyphe in the cells con-
taining the vibrio-like bodies : he noticed also that the latter are not always simple
rod-like bodies, but oftener forked, &c. He left it open whether any connection
exists between the hyphee and the vibrio-like bodies. In 1878 Kwyy asserted* that the tubercular swellings on the roots of Leguminosze
do not appear on plants cultivated in nutritive fluids, and expressed the opinion that
this was because some parasite which causes the tubercles is absent from the fluidsâ€”
in fact, is evidence in favour of the parasitic nature of the swellings. Kwny also
stated that he found a plasmodium in the dividing cells of the tubercles, especially in
Cicer: he states that the parasitic plasmodium can be followed from cell to cell in the
form of delicate, sparsely branched strands. Where they traverse the dividing
cellulose-walls the plasmodial strands are slightly thickened (Joc. cit., p. 55).
