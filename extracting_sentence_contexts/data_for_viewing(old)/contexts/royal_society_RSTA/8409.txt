test as to the direction of slip, it may be pointed out that the direction of the line of
intersection of the two octahedral planes concerned was nearly parallel to the axis of

the specimen, and a longitudinal direction of shear is indicated in photomicrograph
No. 14. :

The two remaining series of slip-bands mentioned in the description of the test agree
fairly closely with the two remaining octahedral planes, but their appearance suggested
that the part played by these planes in the test must have been insignificant. This
view is confirmed by the fact that they did not reappear in the final stage of the test.

Tensile Impact Tests on Specimens Nos. BLL11a and BLL11b.â€”These specimens,
of the form shown in fig. 1, were machined from a long crystal supplied specially by
Miss Exam. The specimen had previously been X-rayed and the original reference
marks on the surface of the bar were preserved on the enlarged ends of the test-pieces,
so that no further analysis was necessary before test. The spherical co-ordinates of
the four octahedral planes are given in Table XVI.
