A ranriouLar investigation which I undertook to make, of
the immense variety of forms presented to us by the carbonate
of lime, (many of which have never yet been described,) having
led me to observe more accurately some specimens I had before
examined, my attention was forcibly attracted by a group of
hexaedral pyramidal crystals, which are in Mr. GREVILLE's
noble collection. As the exterior appearance of these crystals
was different from that which is peculiar to carbonate of lime,
I was desirous to ascertain their nature, and therefore endea-
voured to bring them, by splitting, into the primitive rhom-
boidal form of this substance ; but, upon making the attempt, I
perceived, to my great astonishment, not only that I was not
able to obtain any fracture that could possibly belong to the
planes of the primitive rhomboid, but also, that the substance
strongly resisted every attempt I made to procure a fracture in
any other direction. In fact, every fracture I could obtain was
irregular, and possessed more or less of that vitreous appearance
which is peculiar to. the greater number of hard stones. So
remarkable was the hardness of this $ubstance, that, although

the points of the crystals were very thin, and consequently might
