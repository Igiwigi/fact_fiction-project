MR. A. CAYLEY'S MEMOIR ON CURVES OF THE THIRD ORDER. 429
To show this we may take
«U+6ÞHU=a"+/*+=0
as the equation of the syzygetic cubic satisfying the prescribed condition, for this value

in fact gives
H(zU+68HU)=—ayz=0,

a system of three lines. We find, moreover,
P(#U+68HU)=P(a*+3*+2)=—Ent

P{6H(«U+6BHU)}=P(—6a2yz)=—4Ent,
the latter equation being obtained by first neglecting all but the highest power of 7 in
=yY expression of PU, and then writing {/=—1: we have als T(4U+6ÞHU)=1. Vbstituting the above values, the curve of the sixth class is

Ext{—4T.PU+P(6HU)}=0
Z throwing out the factor £7, we have the curve of the third Meds

and

Z —4T.PU+P(6HU)=0.
