Ey was first observed by Hirzie,* later by Ferrier,t ALBertoni,{ and Munk,§ and
equently by Franck and Prrres,|| that powerful excitation of one hemisphere in
ip Carnivora produced movement not only of the corresponding or opposite side of
Te body, but also of the same side as that stimulated. Franck and Pirres|| showed further that when the muscles of the same side were
ilown into action they contracted ‘01 second later than those of the opposite side, a
mdst important observation. UBNOFF and HempENHAIN,1 CARVILLE and Duret,1 confirmed these facts. J Antoxe** observed that while in dogs bilateral representation of the facial muscles
igs very constant, in the limbs on the contrary, unilaterality was the rule, but that
this there were exceptions. His views were confirmed by UNVERRICHT.
