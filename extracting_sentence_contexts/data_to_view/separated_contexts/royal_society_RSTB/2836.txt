Something of this nature is actually the
case in the young Leptosporangiate Fern, where the stem is protostelic at first, and
only becomes phylosiphonic at a later stage. *

If such changes did take place during descent, the distinction of Dr, Jerrrey
would not rank as defining phylogenetically distinct races, but rather as a register of
such leaf development in the mature plants as differentiated them from some common
source. This is the view of the facts which I adopt, and consequently the Pteropsida
and Lycopsida are, in my view, not to be regarded as without any phylogenetic
relation, but two phases of development of a strobiloid type, separated at a very early
period on the ground of external form, and consequent anatomical difference. * See GWYNNE VAUGHAN, /.e. THE MORPHOLOGY OF SPORE-PRODUCING MEMBERS.
