inherently less susceptible to quantum noise in the first place. One of these ideas is elucidated : we
here: the speed meter [23]. [om
In a Michelson interferometer the standard quantum limit stems from the fact that a
measurements of the position x for different times do not commute: [x(t),x(t’)] 40. However, :S
in systems with momentum conservation one can, in principle, measure the momentum p of an id
ensemble of mirrors continuously with arbitrary precision because the momenta commute for
different times: [p(t), p(t’)] = 0 [24]—for a free particle the velocity x is a quantum non-demolition
(QND) variable! In a speed meter interferometer the velocity of the test mass is measured instead
of its position, hence a speed meter is a QND interferometer [23].
