not be furnished by the decomposition of the volatile alkali iiself, Potassium in its first
degree of oxygenation, may have an affinity for nitrogene, or potassium may expel a
portion of hydrogene at the moment of its combination with ammonium; and as the
whole of the ammonia cannot be. regenerated without the presence of water; hydro-
gene and a little oxygene may be furnished to the remaining elements of the ammonia,
from the water, and oxygene to the potassium.

Even before the conclusion was formed, that a metallic 5ubstance is decomposed in
this experiment, it 5hould have been proved that the nitrogene had not been altered,

That mere potash, combined with hydrogene, eannot form potassium, is I think
Shewn by an experiment which [ tried, in coasequence of the important fact lately
ascertained by M. M. Gay Lussac, and THExaRD, of the deoxydation of potash by
iron. J
An ounce of potash was kept in ignition for some time in an iron tube, ground
into a gun barrel in which one ounce anda half of iron turnings were ignited to white-
ness;z a communication was opened, by withdrawing a wire which closed the tube
containing the potash, between that alkali and the metal.

As the potash came in contact with the iron, gaseous matter was developed, which
was received in a proper apparatus, and though some of it waslost by passing through
the potash into the atmosphere, yet nearly half a cubic foot was preserved, which
proyed to be hydrogene. In the tube were found two products, one in the quantity
of a few grains, containing potassium, combined with a small quantity of iron, and
