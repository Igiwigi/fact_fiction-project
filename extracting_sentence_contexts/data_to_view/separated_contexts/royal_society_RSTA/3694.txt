Dissociation events were indeed
observed over this energy range, which shows that (for a small number of trajectories) surface
dissociation can occur prior to energy dissipation. In general, the number of dissociation events
increases with the internal energy introduced via the non-equilibrium impulse applied to the C-H
stretch. Despite the fact that these dissociation events are rare, there were enough events to count,
which allowed us to derive approximate Poisson error estimates. The low probability of -CH3
dissociation arises from the fact that the excess energy in the C-H stretch is quickly dissipated into
the bulk of the diamond slab (a point which is discussed in further detail below, with a typical
time-dependent plot shown as electronic supplementary material, figure S1). When dissociation
did take place, it necessarily occurred prior to dissipation of the initial C-H stretch energy to the
bulk, and was therefore an extremely rapid processâ€”i.e. within 100-200 fs.

(b) Free energy sampling and thermal dissociation rate coefficient

The results in table 4 give the fraction of prompt dissociation events observed when the system
has an energy which is initially in excess of the -CH3 BDE, and therefore provide insight into the
relative rate of C-H energy dissipation versus CH3 dissociation.
