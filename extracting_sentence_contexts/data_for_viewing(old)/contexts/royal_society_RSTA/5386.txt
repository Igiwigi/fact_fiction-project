The factors affecting RF from water flooding (and gas flooding) can be understood by
considering the following approximate relationship [23]:

RF = Eps x Es x Ep x Ec, (2.1)

where (i) RF is the recovery factor which is defined as the volume of oil recovered over the volume
of oil initially in place (OIP), both measured at surface conditions. (ii) Eps is the microscopic
displacement efficiency. This describes the fraction of oil displaced from the pores by the injected
water, in those pores which are contacted by the water. (iii) Es is the macroscopic sweep
efficiency—the proportion of the connected reservoir volume that is swept by the injected fluid(s).
This is principally affected by heterogeneity in rock permeability and by gravitational segregation
of the fluids. (iv) Ep is the connected volume factor—the proportion of the total reservoir volume
connected to wells. This represents the fact that sealing faults or other low-permeability barriers
may result in compartments of oil that are not in pressure communication with the rest of the
reservoir. (v) Ec is the economic efficiency factor, representing the physical and commercial
constraints on field life such as facilities life, capacity to deal with produced gas and water,
reservoir energy (the reservoir pressure may become so low that fluids cannot be produced).


It can even be seen that if each of the efficiency factors is a very respectable 80% then the
overall RF is only 41%. Increasing RF therefore requires each of these factors to be increased to
close to 100%.

EOR methods are targeted at increasing Eps and Es while IOR methods also aim to increase Ep
and to some extent Es. Improving Ec is mainly the role of the production and facilities engineers
