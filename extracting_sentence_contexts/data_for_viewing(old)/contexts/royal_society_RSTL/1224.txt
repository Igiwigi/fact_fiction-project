contained no more moisture than might well be conceived
to exist in the oxygene gas absorbed ; and their weights
considerably exceeded those of the combustible matters
consumed.

The processes on which these conclusions are founded
will be fully described hereafter, when the minute details
which are necessary will be explained, and the proportions
of oxygene, and of the respective inflammable substances
which enter into union to form the fixed alkalies, will be
given.

It appears then, that in these facts there is the same evidence
for the decomposition of potash and soda into oxygene and
two peculiar substances, as there is for the decomposition of
sulphuric and phosphoric acids and the metallic oxides into
oxygene and their respective combustible bases.

In the analytical experiments, no substances capable of
decomposition are present but the alkalies and a minute
