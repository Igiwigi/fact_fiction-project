pidodendroid twigs, 80 abundant in the Laggan Bay deposit, consists of a solid
Wscular bundle having a diameter of 012. The similar s0lid axis of the new 77alonia,
Slonging to a branch of larger size, has a diameter of '14. I have recently obtained
[= the same locality an ordinary Lepidodendroid branch of about the same dimen-
ons as the Zalonia, of which the axial bundle is also a s0lid one, with a diameter of
A4. This is the largest example I have met with having a so/id bundle. On the
other hand, the smallest of the many Lepidodendroid branches and stems from Arran
which my cabinet contains, possessing a hollow cylindrical vascular axis, is that
figured in my memoir, Part X., figs. 3 and 4. In that specimen the vascular zone
surrounding the central medulla has a diameter of *2, from which figure all these
cylinders increase steadily in diameter, in the number of their component vessels, and
in the dimensions of the cellular medulla which they enclose, until we reach the largest
axial bundles of the arborescent stems.* The fact that all the specimens hitherto
found below a certain diameter have the 80lid vascular bundle whilst all above that
* This increase seems to be partly explained by what I have said on p. 466 about fig. 20.

differences are merely due to age : a conelusion strengthened by the fact, that 8011;
axial bundles are equally absenb from every specimen of considerable 8ize that we
have as yeb obtained from any British locality. At the same time it is possible that
