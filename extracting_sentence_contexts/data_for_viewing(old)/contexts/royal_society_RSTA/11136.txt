views of Nurnst, and the method may be further employed to test directly the
potential differences between equally concentrated salts of the same metal. It will
be shown below that there are apparently cases in which the method can still be
applied even when the metals of the solutions are different.

The agreement for the half-normal solutions is less complete than for the more
dilute solutions. This may be partly due to the fact that the observed E.M.F. of the
cell was more uncertain in this case than in the others ; but a much more probable
explanation lies in the fact that the difference between the coefficients of ionization
for KI and KCl respectively becomes appreciable when the solutions are not dilute.
Before examining the effect of such a difference further, I will give the results ot
experiments upon some of the other solutions mentioned by NERNST.

The tables which follow give the results of experiments conducted in a similar way
to those already described.
