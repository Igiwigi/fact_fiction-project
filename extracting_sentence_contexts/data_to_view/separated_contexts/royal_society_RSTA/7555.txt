We may consider separately the compressional and distortional parts
of the initial disturbance. The solution of the wave equation for ¢ which varies as e and
represents a compressional disturbance travelling out cylindrically from the line source is

¢o = mi Hiy(ax,,) ei, (3-2)

where Ky, = w/a, (3-3)
(similarly we shall define k,,, Kx.» Kj.)

wo? = x*+ (k—z)?’, (3-4)

and Hi, is the Hankel function of the second type and zero order (Jeflreys & Jeffreys, 1946,
p- 544). When | o«,, | is large,

Hig(o,,) ~ [= exp {—ivk,,}, (3-5)
a

and it is seen that ¢, does in fact represent a wave travelling out from the source with
velocity a. Also Hi)(ax,,) +0 as | 7x,,|—>00, providing %(a«,,) <0, consistent with our
definition of w on the Q contour. The factor i is introduced for algebraic convenience.
