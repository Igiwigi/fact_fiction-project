Clearly (1.3) may be recast in the form : 8
W(I1, 12) = Ci — 3) + Co(I2 — 3), (1.3) : Ss

where Ip = tea — tr C*]/2 is the second principal strain invariant. It is worth noting that Mooney ae
never mentioned the term ‘invariants’. In fact, it was Rivlin who used the principal invariants in a systematic and consistent way, with
a series of papers published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society beginning in 1948,
see [4] for an historical overview of these works. The strain energy density function (1.4) is now
referred to as the Mooney-Rivlin model. Starting with Rivlin, the use of the full methodological
apparatus of linear algebra became fundamental to the development of the modern theory
of nonlinear continuum mechanics, as is attested, for example, by the ubiquitous role of the
Hamilton-Cayley theorem in constitutive modelling.
