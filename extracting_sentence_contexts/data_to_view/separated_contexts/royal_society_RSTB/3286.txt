Puarr, the Manager,
’ who had supplied Mr. Strawan with information, and who volunteered all the
additional help he could give, specimens were obtained. With these specimens, the
facts Mr. Piarr could affirm, and the use of the original slides and hand specimens
kindly lent to us by the Geological Survey, it became clear that in the Wirral mine
a process had taken place which is almost identical in essence with that which formed
the “coal balls,” but that owing to local conditions it appears superficially very
different. According to the manager of the mine, the first unusual character observed in the
coal was the appearance of a number of “ pea-” or “shot-” like balls of stone.
