Class II.—The solute element lowers the freezing point by an amount which in dilute solution
is a simple multiple or fraction of that to be expected from its normal valency.

Since the general form of all these freezing point curves is the same, it is not surprising
that they can be made to fit the standard equivalent composition curves of figs. 3 and 4
by means of an arbitrary factor. It is, however, most significant that some of the
factors are simple whole numbers or fractions, In other words, as regards their effects
upon the freezing points, some elements act as though they had, so to speak, fictitious
valencies which were whole numbers. Since the cause of this remains unknown, we
propose to call these fictitious valencies ** liquidus factors,” and by the “ adjusted
equivalent composition ” we mean the atomic per cent. of the solute element multiplied
by the liquidus factor. In considering these results we have, of course, to realize fully
the possible errors in the experimental data. In the following systems the agreement
seems so close over such a wide range that it can hardly be a coincidence :—
