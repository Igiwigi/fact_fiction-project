STABILITY OF A GRAVITATING PLANET. 179

It is easy to see that enormous stresses would be set up in the interior of the earth
after consolidation. An equilibrium configuration depends in general upon the
compressibility of the material, and a configuration which was one of equilibrium for
the compressibility which obtained at the moment of solidification would not remain
so after the incompressibility and rigidity of the material had increased by cooling.
If we suppose the earth to cool in an unsymmetrical configuration the stresses set up
will soon become very great. In fact, Professor Darwin has shown that the stresses
which would be produced by the weights of our continents in an earth initially
homogeneous (7.Â¢., by an irregularity of less than a thousandth part of the radius)
would be so great that the material would be near the breaking point.*

We must therefore suppose that as the earth cools and the elastic constants change
there will be a series of ruptures resulting from the stresses set up in the interior.
The configuration will become approximately spherical (spheroidal if rotation is taken
into account) as soon as the point of bifurcation is passed.

The fact that the ultimate configuration is reached only as the result of a long
succession of ruptures puts the whole question outside the range of exact mathe-
matical treatment. We can, however, see that the final configuration (disregarding
