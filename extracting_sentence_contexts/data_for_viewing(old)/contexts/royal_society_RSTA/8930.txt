plane exceeds 56°. From the time curves this would be about 4000 km., but
Gauitzin’s direct observations of @ would make the distance over 7000 km.

These Wechselwellen must be made up of two parts : (1) transversal waves starting
from the origin and reaching the station as longitudinal; (2) longitudinal waves
starting from the origin and reaching the station as transversal. We should
naturally seek to compare the first with the S waves and the second: with the
P waves, while there is no necessary connexion between the two except that they
arrive together, and the vibration should be in the azimuth plane. It must, of
course, be understood that in making any such comparisons we assume what is not
at all likely to be the case, viz., that waves starting from the origin are symmetrical

about the origin. We are, in fact, simply estimating the changes due to reflexion

without considering the other circumstances that may lead to differences in the
relative magnitude of P and § and their reflexions.

We may best illustrate the possibilities by taking the theoretical case 8500 km.,
which corresponds closely to fig. 5. The theoretical angle of impingence is 67°, and
we find that the PS or SP wave divides the are so that the longitudinal waves
correspond to 2000 km. angle e = 87° and the transversal to 6500 km. angle e = 64”,
