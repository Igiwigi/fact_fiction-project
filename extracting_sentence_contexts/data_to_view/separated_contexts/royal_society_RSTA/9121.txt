Determinations by other methods were made by Kén1c and Drererici* and by
Asney.t

Certain modifications in Kén1e’s data were made by Ivest to obtain better agreement
with luminosity relationships; and Weraver§ analysed the results of Kénie and
Drererict and ABNEY, reduced them to a common denominator, and obtained a set
of values based on them which was recommended for general use by the Colorimetry
Committee of the Optical Society of America in 1922 ; but, as far as the writer is aware,
no attempt has been made, since those of K6n1c and ABney, to obtain further experi-
mental information on the chromatic functions until quite recently. The tendency to elaborate and correct the meagre data of the earlier investigations,
rather than to initiate fresh experimental work on the subject under modern experi-
mental conditions, has no doubt been due to difficulties, supposed to be inherent in
such investigations, which have only been removed by the progress made on the
theoretical side of the subject during the last ten or fifteen years. Ivus{ || first
directed attention to the simple relations existing between the different modes of
presentation of the facts of colour mixture, and in particular pointed out that if the
trichromatie coefficients of the spectrum (coordinates of the spectrum locus on the
colour triangle) were known for any one set of primaries they were, in fact, known
for any other possible set ; and similarly for the spectral mixture curves. Following on the work of Ives, the present writer{ simplified some of the trans-
formations involved and, in particular, showed that the trichromatic coefficients of the
spectrum could be measured on any trichromatic colorimeter, and the results converted
to any desired set of standard spectral primaries by a transformation requiring no
additional experimental work. Towards the end of 1926, in the course of the work on colorimetric standardisation
