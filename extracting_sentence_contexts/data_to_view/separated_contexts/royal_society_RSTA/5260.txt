Methodological innovation of the three-dimensional modelling approach

The novelty of the three-dimensional model lies in developing a novel membrane submodel as
well as in new approaches of coupling submodels of biological processes at three spatial scales
(figure 1) which are crucial to early blood clot formation. At the subcellular scale (nanoscale), a
kinetics-based stochastic dynamic adhesion submodel (DAM) is used to simulate VWF-GPIba
binding and GPIba—vWF-GPlba binding, in which individual vWF and GPIba molecules are
represented as elastic springs (table 1). This is justified by the fact that these receptor—ligand
bindings are probabilistic in nature [1]. Moreover, individual filaments in the cytoskeleton
network of the platelet membrane are treated as coarse-grained harmonic springs. At the cellular
scale, a novel continuum description of the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane is used.
