50 J. L. SYNGE ON THE GEOMETRY OF DYNAMICS. This result is really intuitively obvious from Theorem VI, since f sin ¢ is the component
of the acceleration vector in the direction of the principal normal. We verify at once the well-known fact that a natural trajectory under no forces is a
geodesic.t or, if there is no force, the acceleration is zero and therefore by (3.45) the
curvature is zero, which is a sufficient condition for a geodesic in the case of a positive
definite line-element. § 3.5. Curvature relative to a natural trajectory.
