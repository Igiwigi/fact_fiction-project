At the point where a mesodermal strand ends distally it is usually fixed to the hypoderm
through some myoblastic tissue, which is clearly distinct from that of the rest of the meso-
dermal strand. This fact has not been realized by many authors, who have described the
mesodermal strands as extending posteriorly further than they really do go. This has led
to the description of terminal ampullae, which are, in fact, hypodermal rudiments of the
secondary reproductive system. The myoblastic tissue does not merely run between the
distal ends of the mesodermal strands and the hypoderm, but it also covers the growing
rudiments of the ectodermal organs. It is transformed later into the muscular tissue of the
hypopygium.
