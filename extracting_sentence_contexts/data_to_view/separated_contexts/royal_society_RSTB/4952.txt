In considering these hypotheses, the difference between physiological conditions in
the wood and the bast are pertinent, since the relative availability of food supply might
reasonably be thought to exert a corresponding influence on the production of resin
canals in these two regions. Thus, one might expect the stimulus to the formation of
the canals, which acts on the cambium,{ to produce greater results on the side
where the food supply is ordinarily conceded to be greatest, that is, in the bast. The
facts, however, are the reverse. The stimulus produces a result only in the ray cells
of the bast, the sieve tube initials and other bast elements proper not being affected,
