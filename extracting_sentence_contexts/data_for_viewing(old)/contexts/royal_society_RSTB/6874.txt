found in his published works. The actual amount of supercontraction in any particular case depends

to some extent on the treatment, though the maximum possible is a constant and the same for all three
proteins. Collagen differs from the other two in being normally in the # or fully extended state.

visible length of the chromosome at strepsitene* (see Tables I and II, pp. 203, 205).
When it is realized that there are reasons for believing that the highest value obtained
(50%, cf. p. 203) is the most reliable and that the maximum contraction of keratin and
myosin is also 50Â°% of the normal (or a) length, the coincidence becomes very
impressive. It is, in fact, so striking that it appears to be as near to proof of the correct-
ness of the analogy made as can be expected to arise in the absence of direct molecular
analysis.

Discussion

The principal conclusions which have emerged from this necessarily somewhat
intricate mass of reasoning and data are the following. In the first place, it has been
shown that a chromosome is fundamentally a contorted structure, which will neither
become straight nor untwist except under special circumstances. Secondly, it has been
fhown that contortions of two orders of size are involved, the one a visible spiral of
microscopic dimensions, the other a submicroscopic convolution, } possibly of molecular
dimensions, since it admits of a very fruitful analogy with keratin. These are the essential
