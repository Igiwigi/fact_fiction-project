Thus, the UVCS results helped to drive a resurgence of interest in this mechanism in the
fast wind (e.g. [94-97]).

2. UVCS line profile measurements in coronal holes also led to the conclusion that the fast
solar wind is accelerated closer to the Sun than was believed in prior decades. This kind of
determination is made possible by the fact that resonantly excited lines undergo ‘Doppler
dimming’, i.e. they are sensitive to motions transverse to the line of sight and thus mostly
parallel to the off-limb magnetic field. Strachan et al. [98] used sounding rocket data to
infer a supersonic speed (v ¥ 200 km s~! at r*2 Ro) for protons in a coronal hole. UVCS
then made it possible to determine that the outflow velocity for O* ions grows even

faster than the outflow velocity for protons.
