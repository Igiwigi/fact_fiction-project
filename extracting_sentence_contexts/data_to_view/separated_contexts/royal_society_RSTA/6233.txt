Thus, mesoscopy is a generic feature of those materials, manifesting itself in phenomena unique to
them: a tendency to form clusters of grains, non-local character of macroscopic properties, history
effects, scale dependence of stress, long-length correlations associated with force networks,
arches of grains, etc. It is not surprising that those effects are amplified in strongly polydisperse
materials, in which a wide size span of grains additionally blurs the boundary between micro- and
macro-scales: when the grain-size distributions are heavy-tailed, contact and force networks tend
to be fractal (see, e.g., [8,54,56,57], and references there). Another feature, closely related to the
fractal, ‘openwork’ character of force networks, is the fact that the forces are carried primarily by
asmall subset of the largest grains. Those grains build a skeleton of the force network and stay ina
semi-permanent contact with each other, while smaller grains in regions not participating in force
transmission constantly rearrange their positions and take part in relatively short-lived collisions
(as analysed in detail in [8]). Therefore, there is no clear boundary between the ‘collisional regime’
and ‘permanent-contact regime’.
