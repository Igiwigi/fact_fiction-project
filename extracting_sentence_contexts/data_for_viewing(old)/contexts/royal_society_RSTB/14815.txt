adaptive dynamics approach provides an answer. The main
assumption behind this approach is that mutations are rare, so
that a population monomorphic for z has time to reach its eco- h(z*) <0. (2.6)
logical equilibrium i1(z) before a mutant appears. Assuming
further that mutations have weak unbiased phenotypic effects
(ie. following the continuum of allele model [53-56] with
€ = Zm —Z small), invasion fitness can be Taylor expanded in
Zm around Zim =Z as

In this case, the population is locally uninvadable and selec-
tion on the trait is stabilizing for z* (figure 1a; [7,64]). By
contrast, any mutant can invade when h(z*)>0. In fact,
when h(z*)>0 and the singular strategy z* is convergence
