interlocking of low ridges into open grooves, and the attachment was in all
probability muscular. A; and A, are short vertebrae, they do not show the difference
in length between their dorsal and ventral portions which is so characteristic of the
typical vertebree of the arm; A; is also somewhat shorter than its suecessors, but
from A, onwards the vertebree attain the typical proportions,

Within the circle of jaws are skeletal remains of diatoms, presumably some of the
contents of the stomach.

No trace of a madreporite has been recognised.

Our knowledge of the structure of Onychaster having become more definite
through the study of sections we may naturally ask whether the new facts throw any
new light on the systematic position of this genus and whether its vertebra are
comparable in details with those of modern forms. And in seeking a starting point
for this inquiry we should naturally choose the most primitive of modern forms, for
Onychaster, which occurs in the Carboniferous Limestone, is the oldest known type of
Ophiurid in which the ambulacral ossicles are fused together to form vertebrae having
a considerable vertical thickness. Now the group of living forms termed by Betz

Streptophiuree is regarded by zoologists as including the most primitive of living
Ophiurids, and investigation has shown (2) that the Triassic brittle-stars, that is to
