Note that the seeding IN did not affect
mixed-phase clouds in the simulations. No seeding is introduced in regions where the sun is directly overhead at noon, because in
these regions the reduction in sunlight reflected due to cirrus thinning exceeds the increased
longwave radiation escaping to space, yielding a net warming effect. The fact that the optically
thickest tropical cirrus clouds may have a cooling effect as measured at the TOA has previously
been reported for radiative transfer calculations [17]. The climate responses to the cirrus seeding
were obtained by comparing the equilibrated seeded simulations with the control simulation,
designed to be slightly warmer than the present and to have a nearly ice-free summer Arctic. An
ice-free summer Arctic has been characterized as an event that would be perceived as alarming
enough for CEMs to be seriously considered [18].
