For instance, a specimen of Sarsia which in 81c-
cexsive minutes gave the following numbers of pulsations—16, 26, 0, 0, 26, gave 60 pul-
sations during the next minute, while a spirit-lamp was held under the water in which
the Medusa was swimming. If hot water be added to that in which Sqrs/@ are contained
until the whole is about milk-warm, their swimming-motions become frantic. If the

A 8ame experiment be performed after the margins of the Sars/@ have been removed,
Y the paralyzed bells remain quite passive, while the severed margins exhibit the frantic
E motions just alluded to.
by In the case of Aurelia aurita the characteristic effects of temperature on rhythm may

SB this connexion, made more observations on Aurelia than on Sarsia. The following,
