“ovuliferous,” and, though not exactly co-ordinate with “‘staminate,” may be retained as
the most generally convenient expression (Coutrer and CHAMBERLAIN, ‘ Morphology
of Gymnosperms,’ 1911).

As the theoretical interpretation of the flower ranges from (1) an axillary ovule
with two integuments (SyKEs, 1910) to (2) a syncarpous ovary of four carpels with a
single erect basal orthotropous ovule, invested by a perianth of one if not two or more
whorls (a total of five whorls of a decussate system, P, (2+2); A, 2; G, (242)
(Lienter and Tison, 1912)), a simple statement of the facts is necessary.

Considering a single flower in further detail :—

1. The subtending bracts are simple scale-leaf members, about 15 mm. by 15-12 mm.,
curved as they follow the contour of the cone, and closely resembling in form and
thickness a finger-nail. By the pressure of the ovule in growth, a thin area is
produced in the median line, so that in a region corresponding in area to the nucellus
the scale becomes translucent, and a translucent median line is even left corresponding
to the pressure of the style-tube. By this detail the fertile scales can be distinguished
when detached from the sterile lower leaves of the cone.

These scales present several features of extreme interest, and though the parts
