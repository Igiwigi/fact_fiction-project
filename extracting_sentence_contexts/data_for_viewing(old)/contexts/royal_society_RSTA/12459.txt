not in equilibrium, This couple can only result from a couple stress, Veo, which
produces a couple, 2e, per unit volume ; and this is quite independent of the potential
energy of strain, and therefore of the Lagranyian function. Thus, 2e ++ VI'H’ = 0.
Tf now, in addition to the stress vw we take account of the reactionary stress Vew,
we simply get the pure stress {¢’}o. We shall then merely compare the stress (pure)
which flows from the present theory with {¢’}.

68. It is well-known that Maxwetr’s stress can only be looked on as a normal

type of atress. It by no means explains all the known facts. It does explain
satisfactorily such known mechanical actions of real conductors—conveying currents
and bearing charges—and magnets on one another as are of the nature of apparent
actions at a distance. It does not at all explain the many known mechanical actions
of one part of a conductor or magnet on another part which can be tested only by
observing the (small) strains resulting. In other words, conductors and magnets are
found to behave mechanically, as they would if Maxwett’s supposed stress acted
outside them, but not as if this stress existed internally. It need not therefore be
matter for surprise if, on the present theory, what would appear as the most suitable
stress to regard as normal should differ from Maxwett’s. It is only necessary that
just outside conductors and magnets it should be identical with Maxwetr’s.

To see what on the present theory should be regarded as a normal type we must
