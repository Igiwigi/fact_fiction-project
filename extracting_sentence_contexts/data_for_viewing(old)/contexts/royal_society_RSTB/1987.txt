tion of generations in the Archegoniate. This will now be considered. Although it
is not the purpose of this paper to enter into a full discussion of the problem of
alternation, it is impossible to avoid its general consideration in any attempt to
estimate the weight to be attached to the evidence afforded by deviations from the
normal life-history, such as the phenomena of apogamy and apospory. The different
assumptions which have been made in discussing the question necessitate this: the
general problem will however be dealt with only so far as to define the author's
position on some points on which a clear understanding is necessary, although in the
present state of our knowledge they must be regarded as working assumptions

â€œmerely. The views entertained with regard to some of these questions profoundly
affect the value to be attached to some phenomena, among which those discussed in
this paper are included. It may be as well to state at the outset that only the facts
of alternation seen in Archegoniates and some of the Green Algze will be considered.
The gain in clearness justifies the limitation of comparisons to organisms, some of
which may be presuined to represent more or less accurately steps through which
the ancestors of Bryophyta and Pteridophyta may have passed.

The nature of the problem may be thus stated. The sexual generation of the
Bryophyta and Pteridophyta may reasonably be assumed to have been derived by
direct descent, with modification, from algal forms, something like those presented
by the Gdogonium or Coleochwte thallus* at the present day. Two main views
of the origin of the sporophyte are however possible.

(1.) That the sporophyte is also to be traced back to, originally, independent
