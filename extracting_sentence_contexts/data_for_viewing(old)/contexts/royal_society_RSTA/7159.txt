& Although grit-sensitiveness appears to be simply explained in terms of local heating

z around the particles of grit, in various other mechanical tests on sensitiveness there does

= appear to be some evidence of ‘tribo-chemical’ activation, defined as a transfer of mechanical

g into activation energy, without prior Maxwellian degradation into heat. Particularly in the case

& of initiators, the order of sensitiveness in various mechanical tests, and the behaviour of

3 initiators partly sensitized to heat, suggests that ‘trigger-actions’ other than the formation

g of local hot-spots may contribute to the sensitiveness. A notable fact is that the temperature

i coefficient of sensitiveness, e.g. to friction, is very small (part ITI (2)).

Co-OPERATIVE BUILD-UP OF DETONATION

The following theory of co-operative build-up of detonation by mass-flow was put forward
in a report first issued by the Armaments Research Department on 26 November 1943. The
essential feature is to provide a mechanism of critical change-over from local thermal
