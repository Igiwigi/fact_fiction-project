a possible explanation which would be satisfactory, whichever theory is correct,
it seems inadvisable to lay stress upon this phenomenon. This will be referred to in
the next section.

The possibility of accounting for apogamy and apospory on the hypothesis of
antithetic alternation must be dealt with more fully, since, at first sight at least,

they appear to be “facts which ought not to happen” if that theory is correct.
Apospory, as will be shown, presents no special difficulty. With apogamy the case
is different, and, so far as I am aware, no satisfactory explanation has been given.
Any explanation must take into account not merely the production of a sporophyte
in the position which a normal embryo occupies, but the occurrence of ramenta,
sporangia, &e., on regions of the prothallus, which in form and structure appear to
he intermediate between gametophyte and sporophyte. Apart from the cytological
bearings of the subject the most suggestive view of a possible explanation on the
lines of the antithetic theory is that the capabilities of development of the succeeding
generation must be present in the intermediate one in order to appear in its
Pproductive cells.* Whether the not infrequent association of apogamy with the
xual organs has any significance in this relation must be considered in attempts to
rive at the true explanation of the phenomenon. In the present state of our
