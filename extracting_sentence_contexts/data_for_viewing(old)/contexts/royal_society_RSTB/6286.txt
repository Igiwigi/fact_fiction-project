therefore, enquire first how it should have happened that crest and hernia have
been regarded by poultry geneticists for many years as due to independent factors,
if in reality they were caused by the same gene.


R. A. FISHER ON DOMINANCE IN POULTRY 207

Darwin (1868) gives an extensive description, with illustrations, of the domed
and perforated skulls of a number of crested breeds. That he associated the hernia
with crest cannot be doubted. It is important that he particularly emphasized
the great differences in the deformation of the skull to be found in different breeds.

â€œFrom the foregoing facts we see in how astonishing a manner some of the
bones of the skull vary in Crested fowls. The protuberance may certainly
be called in one sense a monstrosity, as being wholly unlike anything observed
in nature ; but as in ordinary cases it is not injurious to the bird, and as
it is strictly inherited, it can hardly in another sense be called a mon-
strosity. A series may be formed.commencing with the black-boned Silk
fowl, which has a very small crest with the skull beneath penetrated only
by a few minute orifices, but with no other change in its structure ; and from
this first stage we may proceed to fowls with a moderately large crest, which
rests, according to BEcHSTEIN, on a fleshy mass, but without any protuber-
ance in the skull... . Lastly, when we come to fowls with a largely
developed crest, the skull becomes largely protuberant and is perforated
by a multitude of irregular open spaces. The close relation between the
