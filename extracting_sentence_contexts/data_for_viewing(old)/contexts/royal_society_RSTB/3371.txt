accumulated plant remains ; noted the presence of so large a proportion of magnesium
carbonate in the coal balls as to necessitate a source of soluble magnesium salts :
indicated that in sea water there are the necessary calcium and magnesium sulphates
which are reducible by organic carbon: proved the important preservative properties
of sea water for plant tissues: and in short indicated that the sea water played the
principal part in the process of preserving and petrifying the plant remains now
found in coal balls.

Before going on to consider the general aspect of the facts contained in the fore-
going sections, and the picture they yield of the physiography of some of the areas
in the Coal Measures, we will turn to the comparison of the floras which are preserved
in the coal balls, shale impressions and roof nodules of the beds under discussion.
From this comparison, facts of importance are to be gleaned, which will be used in
the argument of the sixth section.

* No further change has yet taken place in these plants, although they have been immersed for
three years.—D, M. 8. W., July 6, 1908.
