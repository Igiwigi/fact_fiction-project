& 1t has already been shown that the molecular visvosities of the acids—which, like
Ayater, aré also supposed to contain molecular aggregates—are related to those of the
Ether liquids in practically the same way at the two slopes. These points are of the

Boleoular viscosity eaurespondiug with these temperabuves, will be affected hy the

Bromine and the Aleohets.
