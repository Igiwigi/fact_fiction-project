No 800ner are they
exposed to the air than they become opaque and warm, and assume the molecular
constitution of the 10-atom hydrate as well as its solubility. ence the conclusion is
that supersaturated solutions of the sodic sulphate are not really 80, since they hold a
salt of much greater s0lubility at common temperatures than the ordinary salt. It is
also stated that the solutions of the sodic carbonate and of the magnesic sulphate form
salts of a lower degree of hydration, and of greater solubility than the normal salts. Lowers general conclusion is that all cases of supersaturation are such in appearance
only, and not in fact. As to the function of nuclei and the inner sides of the flasks in
determining erystallization, he regards it as the effect of one of those mysterious contact
actions known as catalytic, of which science has not yet been able to give a satisfactory
explanation. Bodies that appear to be active in inducing crystallization are designated
catalytic or dynamic ; while bodies that are apparently inactive are termed non-catalytic
or adynamic. © It appears certain,” he says, * that but for the mysterious action
which the air and other bodies exert on supersaturated solutions, we should obtain swl-
phate of soda only in the modified state ; that is, crystallized with seven equivalents of
water, and possessing at, ordinary temperatures of the air a much greater solubility than
that of the ordinary 10-atom salt.”

Later inquirers have endeayoured to explain the action of nuclei.
