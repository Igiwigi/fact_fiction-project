Further, since differentiation precedes extension, the latter must be to some extent
pre-determined by the former, as in the example of a hyacinth bulb. In this
connection it might also be noticed that the fluctuations in the rate of differentia-
tion are probably the same as the fluctuations in rate of extension, at any
given time. Also, in the case of cotton, the time-interval relation is complicated as soon as
the second flower on each sympodium appears, owing to the fact that this second
flower follows the first one much more quickly than the first flower follows the first
appearance of the branch which bears it. In other words, the second (and later)
internodes of the sympodium develop more quickly than the first one, being much
shorter. We can ascertain what the actual intervals were in the case of the plant
which we have examined, by consulting fig.
