Tar the pulsations of the arteries correspond- in their fre-
quency with the contractions of the left ventricle of the heart,
is universally admitted; and those pulsations continuing in the
arteries after the limb to which they belong is rendered para-
lytic, has led to the belief, that all arterial action is independent
of nervous influence. The object of the present Paper is to shew that the nerves
which accompany the arteries regulate their actions, and it is
through their agency that the blood is distributed in different
proportions to the different parts of the body. The facts which have led me to conclude that this office is
performed by the nerves, I shall lay before the Society in the
order in which they occurred. An officer, who had been wounded by a musket ball in the
leg immediately below the knee, came under my care. With
a view to find the ball, a seton was passed in the course it had
taken, and brought through the skin just beyond the part in
which it was lodged; a caustic was then applied to the skin
just below the tuberosity of the tibia, to which the ligament
of the patella is attached: it produced great pain all round the
joint and through the leg, and what was very remarkable, the
matter in the canal surrounding the seton rose and: fell with

at the wrist, and to keep my finger upon it during the time this
effect upon the pus continued, which was several minutes, cor-
responding with the pulse at the wrist, which, howeyer, had
been in no degree disturbed.
