Overall, the diffusion process
by which we explain numerotopy is not unrelated to the self-
organizing Turing reaction—diffusion model [40], although in
our case, the large-scale topography of number regions only
obtains after smoothing of the selectivity map by a Gaussian
filter. We thus predict that higher-resolution imaging should
uncover a more intertwined topography of number preferences
(see electronic supplementary material, Note S8). The fact that
voxel-level properties such as numerotopy can be accounted
for by exactly the same model as single-cell effects would also
suggest that the approximate number system is self-similar
across scales. The above model is deliberately abstract and lives in a space
of dimension 1. In a second implementation of our theory, we
aimed to study whether the same properties would hold in a
more realistic model of neuronal dynamics, including a net-
work of excitatory and inhibitory units embedded within a
cortical plane, with sparse and local connectivity (figure 4).
