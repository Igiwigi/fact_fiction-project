The fiducial efficiency was estimated to be at maximum several times 10~+. This is a
competitive number that will allow us to substantially expand the discovery reach for the above
process at Run-3. A number of backgrounds need to be considered even though the MAPP detector is separated
from the IP by 60 interaction lengths The backgrounds from cosmic muons are highly suppressed
for a number of reasons, these are: the shielding provided by the approximately 100m rock
overburden; the fact that cosmics are out of time with respect to LHC collisions; and, the
‘verticality’ of the cosmic muons as opposed to the dominant ‘horizontal’ component of particles
from the IP. Once these factors are taken into account it is clear that muons from the IP are an
important background. In this case, muons directly incident on the detector would be ruled out by
the forward charged particle veto.
