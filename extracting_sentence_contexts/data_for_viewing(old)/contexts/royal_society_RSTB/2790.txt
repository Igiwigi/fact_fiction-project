(4) Enhydrina venom has apparently no direct action on the vaso-motor centre.
Rogers found that on the injection of a Viperine venom, or of the venom of the
Colubrine Banded Krait (Bungarus fasciatus) into an animal, a marked fall of blood
pressure occurred, which was of central origin. In collaboration with Drs. SmLaR
and CARMICHAEL (of the Materia Medica Laboratory, Edinburgh), one of us has
found that a similar and powerful action is exerted by the venom of the common
Krait (B. cwruleus).* The absence of any such action in the Sea-snake venoms with
which we are dealing is, therefore, worthy of note.

(5) The blood-pressure curve in Enhydrina poisoning is a remarkably heady one,
provided that moderate doses are given and that care is taken to avoid the injection
of large volumes of fluid into the blood-vessels. This is due to the fact that the

blood pressure is exposed neither to the influence of the rival forces which act on
the heart so strongly in cobraism, nor to the direct vaso-motor changes which we have
dealt with in the preceding paragraph.

(6) The respiratory mechanism appears to be that which is chiefly affected by
Enhydrina venom. If large lethal doses are employed, such as Rocrrs appears to
