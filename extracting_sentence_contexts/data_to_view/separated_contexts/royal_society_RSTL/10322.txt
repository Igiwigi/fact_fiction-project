There was also, with a tendency to the further reduction
in the number on plot 14 from one year to another, within the separation period, a
greater tendency to regain in number over the same period on plot 16 ; the numbers
found in the four separation-years being 34, 34, 36, and 41, respectively.

"There was a considerably s8maller average percentage of total Graminee with the
smaller than with the larger amount of nitrate (and mineral manures). There was
a much larger, and a greatly increasing, percentage of leguninous herbage, and a
considerably higher average, but a gradually diminishing, proportion of total Mis-
cellane. The herbage was, in fact, less exclusively gramineous, and, upon the whole,
considerably more mixed, with the smaller amount of nitrate, and the consequent less
luxuriance of the freer-growing species. Among the grasses, neither Poa trivialts nor Bromus mollis, which were 80 prominent
on plot 14, was 80 in any degree on plot 16. Poa trivialis, however, maintained its
position very much better than Bromus molltis, which yielded only a fraction of 1 per
cent. in the fourth separation-year.
