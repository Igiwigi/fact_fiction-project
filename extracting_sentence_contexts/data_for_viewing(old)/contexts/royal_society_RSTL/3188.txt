BurGn's scale. To obtain the alteration of rate corresponding to each degree
of FanrexnsIr from the data furnished by the experiments, we have the rate
with the weight below, observed on the 31st of January and 1st of February

at 30?, pp. 467 and 469, to compare with the rate at 57* which has been de-
duced as above from the experiments in the preceding August and September.
The position of the slider in the winter experiments was at 1.6; consequently
the result is strictly comparable with the mean of the two results H to M, and
W to EE, made in summer, in one of which series the slider was at 1.633, and
in the other at 1.566, the mean of which is 1.6. But in fact a small change
of position of the slider when the weight is below, has s0 little influence on
the rate, that had there been even a slight difference it might have been safely
disregarded for the purpose now in view.
