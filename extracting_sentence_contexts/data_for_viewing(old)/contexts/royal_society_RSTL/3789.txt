tion (as 1 suppose) of the rings into coils, an interlacement is almost a necessary con-
8equence of the alternate succession of the rings. I have also seen this interlacement
of spirals provided for, apparently, by the rings of several lines being linked together
while still rings (fig. 47 : 8ee als fig. 120).

24. Figure 48, from its exhibiting only one 8ide of the tube, represents but two rows
of rings. The number of rows, however, contained in the tube seemed four: which
of conrse would become connected in the above way, as easily as two; and give
origin to a corresponding number of interlacing spirals.

25. I cannot suppose that minuteness is any hindrance to the smallest filament
(* fibre”) having its origin by the same mode: and to this, the linear arrangement of
the discs within the blood-corpuscle seems to have especial reference}. Facts will be
hereafter mentioned, which seem to show a fasciculus of filaments to be thus produced
in a certain tis8ue (par. 42—44).

26. Within the windings of the spirals (fig. 57 «), nuclei are sometimes to be dis-
cerned. It appears to be from these nuclei that there proceeds the substance for
forming new filaments (fig. 22); which are very often seen within the winds of spirals
(figs. 131 Þ, 94, 58).

27. I have in some instances observed the filaments, when enlarging, to present a
remarkable change in the relative position of their spiral threads. If figs. 40, 41 be
referred to, it will be seen that « of fig. 40 passes into « of fig. 41, and the latter into
Þ of the same figure. The scheme fig. 60 may illustrate this transition. This scheme
