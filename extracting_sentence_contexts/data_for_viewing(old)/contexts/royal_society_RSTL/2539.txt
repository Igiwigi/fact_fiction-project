labours during 1830 to determine the limit hours of the tides, as I was obliged to
continue observing in each case until the tide had turned. Moreover, at different pe-
riods I devoted forty-nine nights to the investigation of the minimum a.v. tide.
Dr. Warker at Mahabuleshwar, at 4500 feet above the sea, bestowed eight months'
labour upon the tides ; and Mr. Daimanoy, on the Neelgherry mountains, was simi-
larly employed for four or five months. HumBoLpr in his narrative mentions the
determination of the extent of the diurnal oscillations, the duration of the stationary
state of the barometer at its maxima and minima, and the exact periods at which it
becomes stationary and is in action again, as desiderata. I shall take these snbjects
in order as I proceed.

The extreme oscillation of the barometer in the same day never amounted to two
tenths of an inch, in fact to *1950, with a difference of the attached thermometer
during this range of +7*6, and the hygrometer 15? from the point of saturation.
Wind light and variable. This took place on the 19th of April 1830. There were

great masses of clouds, and distant thunder and lightning ; a storm threatened, but
did not take place. The same appearances continued daily until the 21st, on which
day there was a hail storm, whilst the thermometer stood at 86*3. On the 23rd
there was another hail storm and thunder: this weather continued to the end of the
month, and the daily oscillations were $0 great as to make the mean exceed that of
any other month in the year. Here there could be little doubt of the oscillations
