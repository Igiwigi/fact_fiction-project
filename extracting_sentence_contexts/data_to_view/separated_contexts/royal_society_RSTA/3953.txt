§ 34. Inequalities in the thickness of the pulses will slightly modify the features
of the equivalent spectrum. Such inequalities will arise partly from the fact that
different pulses arrive in slightly different directions; they come from different parts
of the glass (an effect diminishing with distance). Furthermore, the particles are
not stopped at a single impact in the molecules of the glass. It also appears that, if Réntgen rays can be made powerful enough, they will
affect the eye as ordinary white light.
