2 SS attracted towards them. When, on the contrary, the motion was from larger to
S smaller numbers, it indicated that the poles NN' were attracted and the poles SS'
repelled. In the position fig. 1, therefore, of Tables III. and IV. the poles NN' were
repelled by the ends no of the bismuth cylinders, and the poles SS*' attracted, while in
the position fig. 3, the poles NN' were attracted by the ends mp, and the poles SS'
repelled ; the ends 2 and o, therefore, acted as two north poles, while the ends mz
and pacted as two south poles. Now the direction of the current in the experiments
recorded in the two tables referred to was that shown by the arrows in fig. 4. Stand-
ing in front of the instrument, the direction in the adjacent face of the spiral H'E' was
from right to left, while it was from left to right in HE. From this we may infer that
the polarity of the bismuth cylinders was the reverse of that which would be excited
in cylinders of iron under the same circumstances. The assertion however shall be
transferred from the domain of deduction to that of fact before we conclude.

Let us now urge against these experiments all that ever has been urged by the
opponents of diamagnetic polarity. The bismuth cylinders are metallic conductors,
and in moving them through the spirals induced currents more or less powerful may
be excited in these conductors. The motion observed may not, after all, be due to
diamagnetic polarity, but to the currents thus excited. I reply, that in all cases the

number set down marks the permanent position of rest of the magnets. Were the
action due to induced currents, these currents, being momentary, could only impart
