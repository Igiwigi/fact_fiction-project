Péclet numbers, Dy and Dc are the thermal and solutal diffusivities, n = 2 and n =3 in two- and
three-dimensional cases, respectively. Note that the vector x has two spatial coordinates x and y
in three dimensions, x = (x,y), and the integration area 2 extends from minus to plus infinity in
all its directions.

Expressions (2.1)-(2.3) are written in the dimensionless form which is used in the whole text
of the present work.

(a) The circular and globular tip shapes at small and large Péclet numbers

To determine the circular and globular tip shapes (figure 1c), we use the fact that the thermal
(i) and solutal (If) boundary integrals asymptotically vanish in two limiting cases of small
(Pr > 0 and Pc > 0) and large (Pr > oo and Pc > ov) Péclet numbers. Indeed, we have from
the boundary integral equation (2.1) in the steady-state crystallization regime (when the interface
function ¢ does not depend on time)

Now, expressions (2.2) and (2.4) determine the shape of a solid—liquid interface. Note that they can
be easily integrated in both two- and three-dimensional geometries under consideration. For the
sake of simplicity, we will not dwell on this point here and refer the reader to our previous review
article (see §7 in [28]). The main result following from these limiting cases is that the dendritic
