thick, and with a natural frequency in water of 120/sec.

(2) Rubber Diaphragm Receiver with Adjustable Natural Frequency—With this instru-
ment the object was to obtain a much lower natural frequency. The effect of the air-
cavity in giving an additional restoring force to the diaphragm, as already referred to
under “ Sounders,” has now to be taken into account. In this receiver the diaphragm
was made of very thin rubber, so that the restoring force was almost entirely due to
the enclosed air. Advantage was taken of this fact to make the instrument of adjustable
frequency by changing the volume of the air-cavity behind the diaphragm. The prin-
ciple of compensation for hydrostatic pressure described above was again applied.

The diaphragm, with the microphone attached at its centre, formed one end of a
brass tube 30 cm. long and 5 cm. in diameter, the opposite end being closed by a screwed
cap (fig. 11). Inside the brass tube was a solid brass plunger the position of which
