In heterotrophs, other influ-
ences such as multicellularity and tissue context may have generated different evolutionary constraints. In Rhodophyta (pink box) and Chlorophyta (green box),
mitochondria, plastids and the nucleus developed triangular signalling networks.


targeting when encoded in the nucleus [17]. In fact, it has Zz

been proposed that hydrophobic membrane proteins would g
be targeted to the ER instead of mitochondria [15]. s
Typical mitochondrial genomes of heterotrophs such as g
mammals are quite small (approx. 16 kb), while those of Â£

plants are less reduced (table 1). Chloroplast genomes of =
vascular plants are around 150 kb in size and are highly con- >

mitochondria and plastids contain thousands of different =

variable, depending not only on environmental conditions or Ss
tissue context, but also on the species [18-24].
