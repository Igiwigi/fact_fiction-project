Although many areas of science are extremely well
understood, a lot of the topics that have attracted public attention in recent
imes lie at or beyond the frontiers of the currently known: might GM crops
aybridize with other plants to create superweeds; how soon might stem cell
research lead to major medical benefits; to what extent might a generic H5N1
vaccine provide protection if and when avian flu becomes transmissible among
aumans; and much more. Much, perhaps most, of scientific advice to government policy makers is routine,
yased on well-explored areas of science. When this happens, public expectations
‘tell us the facts’—can be fulfilled. To the contrary, there are many topics of
concern, both currently and in the recent past, which lie in areas where there is
still significant scientific uncertainty. When this happens, it is essential that we
understand and acknowledge that science is as much a way of asking illuminating,
testable questions, as it is a collection of tidy and certain answers.
