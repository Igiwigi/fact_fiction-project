amine, far from being due to a successive replacement of the various equivalents of
hydrogen in ammonia, were rather to be considered as special instances of a far more
general tendency of carbon and hydrogen to accumulate in organic substances.


MOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE ORGANIC BASES. 361

The eagerness with which I submitted this question to the test of experiment may
be readily imagined. On adding potassa to a solution of the iodine-compound in
water, the liquid s0lidified at once into a crystalline mass, which IT took of course for
the base existing in the iodide; analysis however s00n showed that the substance
thus precipitated is nothing but the iodide itself, which is less s0luble in an alkaline
s0lution than in pure water. In fact, Analysis IV. was made with a specimen which
had thus been treated with potassxa. The iodide was now distilled with a very
concentrated solution of potassa for several hours ; but during this time nothing but
pure water passed over; the solution in the retort solidified on cooling to crystals of
the unchanged iodide. When the solution of the iodide in potassa had become very
concentrated, it separated into two layers, an aqueous one and an oily one, which
floated on the surface. But eyen now no decomposition had been induced, the oily
stratum solidifying on cooling into a crystalline cake of iodide perfectly unaltered.
It was only when the liquid was evaporated to dryness that a change took place; but
then the change was no longer due to the action of the potassa, but to the influence
of heat, and in no way differed from the decomposition which the crystals undergo
when heated alone.
