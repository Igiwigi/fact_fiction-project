As the irritability, on the other hand, is high,
certain stimuli, as galvanism, slightly elevated temperatures, &c. are speedily
fatal. The batrachia are promptly destroyed by immersion in water of a tem-
perature of 108* of Fanr., and some fish and crustacea perish in great numbers
under the influence of a thunder-storm. It is a singular fact, that the fish
alone, whose food is found amongst animals of a high irritability, should pos-
8es8 an electrical organ for the destruction of its prey. Having stated the law of the inverse ratio of the quantity of respiration, and
of the degree of irritability of the muscular fibre, especially in the heart, I
purpose to trace it, by a series of observations, through the zoological scale,
and in the different stages and states of animal existence. This inquiry will
be followed by an investigation into the quantity of respiration, in different
temperatures and seasons, in animals which retain, and animals which lose
their temperature ; it is obvious, A priori, that the former must have a lower
respiration in the elevated temperatures of summer than in winter, whilst the
irritability, and with it the power of supporting the privation of air, will ob-
serve an inverse ratio ; in the latter, it is probable that other laws prevail.
