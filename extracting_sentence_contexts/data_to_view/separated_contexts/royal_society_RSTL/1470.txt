M. Ritter has $tated, that of all the metallic substances he
tried for producing potassium by negative VoLTaic electricity,
tellurium was the'only one by which he could-not procure it. And he states the very curious fact, that when a circuit of
electricity is completed in water, by means of two surfaces of
tellurium, oxygene is given‚Äù off at the 'positive surface, no
hydrogene at the negative surface, but/abrown'powder which
he regards as ahydruret of tellurium, is formed and separates
from it ; and he conceives that the reason why tellurium pre-
vents the metallization of  potash is, that it has a stronger
attraction for hydrogene, than that alkali. These cireumstances of the action of tellurium upon water,
are $0 different from those presented by the action of other
metals, that they can hardly fail to arrest the attention of
chemical enquirers. I have made'some experiments on the
Subject, and on the action of tellurium on potassium, and I find
that instead of proving that potassium is a compound of potash
and hydrogene, they confirm the idea of its being as oy like
other metals undecompounded.
