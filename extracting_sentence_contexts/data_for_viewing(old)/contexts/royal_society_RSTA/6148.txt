time. Calculations here are harder, of course. In addition, in view of the limitations of the MS
scheme to provide a more physical renormalization of the VED, we shall adopt an alternative
scheme (a variant of the so-called adiabatic regularization and renormalization method [60,61]).
Furthermore, to make our task not exceedingly burdensome, we shall hereafter assume that there
is no SSB, hence no scalar field self-interactions (A =0). In this case, m? > 0 is the physical mass
squared of the field. The ZPE part in a curved background is already sufficiently demanding
even when the scalar field does not couple to itself. This means we shall focus on just the
one-loop piece of Vzpg in equation (2.2). Within this, more restricted, set-up we will tackle
the calculation of the energy density of the vacuum fluctuations of a quantized scalar field
in FLRW space-time. For the sake of completeness, we admit the presence of a non-minimal
coupling & of ¢ to gravity, despite it is not mandatory for renormalizability in this case. Since
there are no self couplings in our calculation, there are no ZPE loops beyond one, and hence
the one-loop contribution that we are addressing here, Vzpgp =f vy, is in fact the full ZPE
result. The calculation entails renormalization subtleties since we meet, of course, UV-divergent
integrals. As noted, conventional approaches such as e.g. the MS scheme, lead to the very
same conflictive terms ~m* as those previously met in Minkowski space. We shall therefore
eschew unsuccessful renormalization methods of this sort in the cosmological arena. We shall use
instead the adiabatic renormalization procedure (ARP) [60-62] to renormalize the VED, although
implemented off-shell via the approach defined in [57,58] and introduced for running couplings
in [107-109].
