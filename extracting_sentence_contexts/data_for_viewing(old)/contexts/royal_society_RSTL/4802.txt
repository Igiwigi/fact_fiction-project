become absorbed, the cavity being occupied by secondary cancelli, containing adi-
pose tissue. The rest of the bone has been of primary intra-membranous growth.

The premaxillary exhibits similar features. It contains a central oval rod of car-
tilage, around which are arranged the investing layers of membraniform bone. In
the latter portions there are some large cavities, which appear to have been formed,
not by absorption of the cartilage, but by inflections of the membranous lamellze
prior to their calcification. In the dental surface of this bone, as een in a transverse
vertical section, we observe a curious arrangement of the Haversian canals. Imme-
diately beneath the base of each tooth, there exists a group of small anastomosing
canals, scarcely distinguishable from those seen in the contiguous portion of the tooth
itself, and into which they open. Bearing in mind the intra-membranous origin of
this portion of the bone, the aboye fact has a significant bearing upon the origin of the
teeth. The central laminz of the premaxillary contain a remarkable series of very
minute parallel canals or tubes, which pass obliquely through them.

The presphenoid and vomer exhibit a peculiarity of stracture, which at first sight
appears to distinguish them from the other bones which I have examined ; but this
difference is more apparent than real. A thick cartilage intervenes between the
vomer and the nasal bone, and a prolongation of the same cartilage runs backwards
along the upper surface of the presphenoid. When vertical sections are made of the
latter of these bones, we find that it appears to be developed on the inferior surface
of the cartilage. The new lamellze, which are membraniform, are added partly to
the inferior surface of those pre-existing, but chiefly to their superior one, where a
thin space, apparently lined with membrane, separates the bone from the contiguous
