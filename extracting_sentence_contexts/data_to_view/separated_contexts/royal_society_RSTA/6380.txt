The resulting global backward transit time distributions represent the age of
the respired carbon at each time for the entire respiration flux of all terrestrial ecosystems. This
global backward transit time distribution can be characterized by its corresponding mean E,/(t),
median m)(t) and quantiles QO (t), where the subscript b represents backward transit time and a
is a percentile (i.e. mp(t) = QP (#)). To assess how the shape of this global backward transit time distribution changes over time,
we define the ratio h(t) as a measure of homogeneity of transit times

The motivation for this ratio comes from the fact that for an exponential distribution the
median is the product of In(2) and the expected value. If the transit time distribution would have a
shape close to an exponential distribution, then 1 ~ 1 and the transit times would have the higher
degree of homogeneity. To better understand the concept of homogeneity in transit times, recall
that for a one-pool system in equilibrium, mean age and mean transit time are equal, and both
are exponentially distributed [8,11].
