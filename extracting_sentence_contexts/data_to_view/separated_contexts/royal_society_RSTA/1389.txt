Average DJF maximum 3 h precipitation accumulation. (2) Maximum values calculated on the original 4 km polar
stereographic mesh and regridded to a 4km latitude-longitude mesh. (6) Maximum values obtained by first regridding
daily precipitation to a 25 km mesh. (c) Maximum values obtained by first regridding daily precipitation to a 100 km mesh.
(d) Maximum values obtained by regridding 4 km maxima to a 25 km mesh. (e) Maximum values obtained by regridding 4 km
maxima to a 100 km mesh. (Coloured areas over coastal ocean regions are an artefact of the plotting scheme and should be
ignored.) (Online version in colour.)

However, this order of operation is not always practical, especially for sub-daily extremes
due to the high computational cost of regridding and/or the availability of the high-frequency
observational data itself. For instance, high-frequency station data may not be made available
by the owners but block maxima or other extreme value indices are provided. In fact, this is the
case for the daily extrema contained in the HadEX3 global land dataset [31] where the stations’
extrema are gridded rather than the stations’ daily values themselves. In this paper, we refer
to such model evaluation results as the ‘non-native grid’ since the observational extremes are
not calculated on the models’ native grid but are calculated either at individual stations or on
a different grid. For precipitation, it is generally unlikely that the extrema at different locations
within the same grid cell occur at the same time.
