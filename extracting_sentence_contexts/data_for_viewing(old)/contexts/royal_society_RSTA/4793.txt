physical quantity a € Csa, A(a) is the value that a has in the state 4. Moreover, if C2 CC, then
Acie: =4c, = Pc), because we assume that p is a global element of Y. This implies that the value
Ac(a) assigned to a physical quantity a does not depend on the context C we are considering.
Furthermore, it is easy to see that the value assignment is compatible with taking (continuous)
functions of operators: if f(a) is another self-adjoint operator, then A(f(a)) =f(4(a)). As a simple
example, consider taking squares. The value assigned to a” is the square of the value assigned
toa.

But, at least for the case that V is a W*-algebra with no summand of type Iz, we know that
such an assignment of values to all physical quantities, preserving functional relations between
them, does not exist. This is exactly the content of the famous Kochen-Specker theorem [33]
and its generalization to von Neumann algebras [34]. Hence, the Kochen-Specker theorem is
equivalent to the fact that the spectral presheaf, our quantum state space, has no points. This
was first observed by Isham & Butterfield [5] and, for the case of the von Neumann algebra B(H),
by Isham et al. [6].

Mathematically, the fact that © has no points is an expression of its character as a non-
commutative space. Physically, we see that the lack of points is equivalent to one of the key
theorems in foundations of quantum theory, the Kochen-Specker theorem.

The interpretation of the spectral presheaf ¥ as a quantum state space is supported by a number
