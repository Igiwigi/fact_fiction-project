be correct, one- property operating under different modifica-
tions is the universal cause of their activity.

* In this process ammonia was rapidly given off fromthe $urface of the negative
cone, and nitrous acid from that of the positive cone, and a white yapour was pro-
duced by their combination in the atmosphere above the apparatus.

X. On some general llustrations and Applications of the fore-
going Facts and Principles, and Conclusion,

The general ideas advanced in the preceding pages are
evidently directly in contradiction to-the opinion advanced by
FasRoN1, and which, in the early stage of the investigation,
appeared extremely probable, namely, that chemical changes
are the primary causes of the phanomena of GaLvanism.

Before the experiments of M. VoLTa on the electricity
excited by the mere contact of metals were published, I had
to a certain extent adopted this opinion ; but the new facts
immediately proved that another power must necessarily be
concerned ; for it was not possible to refer the electricity
