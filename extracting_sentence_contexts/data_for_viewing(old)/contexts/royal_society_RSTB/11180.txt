advantage of the CV lies in the fact that, being a scale-
invariant parameter, it can capture meaningful differences
in a number of behavioural domains [32]. The second advan-
tage of this approach for the present study is that since the
comparison is conducted at the perceptual-motor level
only, it does not need to assume that prehistoric populations
had or did not have symbolic representations, nor consider
that modern subjects have them.

Application of this research philosophy to a notched
raven bone from a Late Mousterian context has recently
shown that the set of notches incised on this object falls
well within the range of variation of regularly spaced exper-
