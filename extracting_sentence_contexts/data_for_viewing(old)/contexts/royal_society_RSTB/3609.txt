The list of species given above shows that we are dealing with a mixed flora, whose
external features were probably not unlike those of the plants of to-day, even the
strangest and most exceptional among them in its internal organisation differing but
little from a common type of to-day in its external appearance. The mixture of
plants in the flora is roughly composed of one-third Angiosperms, one-third
Gymnosperms, and one-third lower plants, There is, of course, no petrified flora of
Mesozoic age with which this can be compared, but, even in the composition of the
various floras known from impressions, there is no parallel case.

In view of the fact that the Cretaceous flora is often spoken of as having a close
similarity to that of the present, it is interesting to note that Yezonia and
Yezostrobus have no external feature to indicate the fundamental differences in
their internal organisation. The small adpressed leaves of Yezonia are quite like

those of the Taxodinew, while in general appearance the cone of Yezostrobus must
have been very similar to Abietinean cones of to-day.

The two plants of which we have the greatest number of individuals are the new
Gymnosperm Yezonia and the Angiosperm Saliocaulis, Of most of the others only
