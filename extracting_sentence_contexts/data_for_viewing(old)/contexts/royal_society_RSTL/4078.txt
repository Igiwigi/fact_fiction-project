contraction whatever occurs.‚Äù I concluded from this experiment that the action of
the electric current, in weakening or destroying the excitability of the nerve, was not
the same whatever were its direction, and that the direct current acted with a much
greater energy than the inverse. This fact appeared to me to be of sufficient import-
ance to warrant further investigation, and I think that the results at which I have
arrived will serve to throw some light upon that difficult s8nbject, the physiological
action of the electric current. I felt convinced, in the first place, that it now behoved
me to employ means for the investigation of these phenomena far more exact than
those I had hitherto resorted to. Every natural philosopher who has ever s0 little
studied the contractions caused by the passage of the electric current upon the nerves
of a frog, prepared for the purpose, must certainly have perceived how very difficult
it is to arrive at satisfactory results, where the force of the contraction excited is to
be judged of by the eye. In this manner our knowledge is limited to the fact, that
when the excitability of the nerve is lessened, the direct current causes contractions
only at the very moment in which it begins to circulate, whilst the inverse current
produces contraction only at the moment of its ceasing to pass. In one word, we
can only judge of these phenomena by their presence or by their cessation. But in
what relation these effects vary, in what order, as regards intensity, the phenomena
of the first period of excitability of the nerve are transformed into those of the 8econd
period ; what relation the number of the contractions produced bears to the strength
of the current, to its duration, &c., are $0 many questions which we shall never be
able to solve without an apparatus by which to measure the contractions cansed by
