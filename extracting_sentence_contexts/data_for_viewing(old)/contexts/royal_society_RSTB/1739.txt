Specimens showing branches in connection with the principal axis have been
previously figured.* Additional specimens are represented in our photographs
10, 12, and 15. The ramification was evidently abundant. Thus, the specimen
shown in photograph 12 was giving off four branches, almost at the same level, two
of which are shown in approximately median section. The branches were always of
considerably smaller size than the main axis. They were evidently rootlets, borne on
a relatively main root. Two points of interest arise in connection with these
rootlets :—

1. Each rootlet is invariably placed exactly opposite one of the protoxylem-groups
of the main root which bears it (see photograph 12, fig. 20, and the figures above
cited). This fact is shown with special beauty in the longitudinal section repre-
sented in photograph 15. Here one of the rootlets is cut exactly in the median
plane, and its connection with the smallest peripheral xylem-elements of the main
root is clear. The tracheides of the rootlet bend at a right angle on joining those of
the main root. The bend was no doubt directed towards the organic base of the
latter.

2. The rootlets are evidently of endogenous origin. Although we cannot observe
their development, this is sufficiently proved by the fact that the rootlet always has a
cortex of its own, which can be traced through that of the parent root (see photo-
graphs 12 and 15, also Wiiuramson, Part XIII, Plate 24, fig. 27).

In every respect, then, the branching of these organs is that characteristic of roots. —
