tting «=0, B=1, gives
S P(GHU)=4T.PU—48.QU,

E what is the same thing,
—4T.PU+P(6HU)=—4S.QU;
Sa the curve of the third class is therefore the Quippian QU=0. It may be remarked,
t for a cubic U=0 the Hessian of which breaks up into three lines, the above
mvestigation shows that we have PU=—#Z, P(GHU)= —4Exz, and T=1, and conse-
Euently that —4T.PU+P(6HU) ought to vanish identically ; this in fact happens in
Trtue of the factor S on the right-hand side, the invariant $ of a cubic of the form in
Suestion being equal to zero; the appearance of the factor S on the right-hand side is
Kus accounted for & priore.

Article No 22.—Theorem relating to a line which meets three given conics in 8a points in
involution.
22. The envelope of a line which meets three given conics, the first or conic polars of
any three points with respect to the cubic, in six points in involution, is the Pippian.
It is readily seen that if the theorem is true with respect to the three conics,
