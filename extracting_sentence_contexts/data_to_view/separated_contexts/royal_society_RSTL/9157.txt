Both series of observations have led to the discovery of considerable deviation from
the theory, unless we assume errors in the experiments, especially in the determination
of the position of the planes of the prisms with reference to the axes of the crystals,
which are greatly in excess of the amounts we can reasonably expect. Tt will be noticed that the values taken for the constants p, and jy, in the two parts
of the paper differ by 0002 and 00017 respectively. This is due to the fact that the
two crystals used were different. RupBERG (PocaG. Annalen, vol. xvii., p. 1) found
differences of as much as 0004 in the values of p, deduced from two specimens of
arragonite.
