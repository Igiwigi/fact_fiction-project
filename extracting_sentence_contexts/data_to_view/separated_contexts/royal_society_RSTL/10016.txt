Sometimes it was negligible, sometimes
Bt produced a change of 4* or 5* in as many minutes. Tt is evident that the thickness
f the films, given by any particular experiment, would be greater or less than the true
-2value according as the motion of the zero was, or was not, in the same direction as that
Zproduced by the rupture of the films. The observed facts were in accordance with
Sthis, and the numbers obtained were generally larger or smaller than the mean
Saccording to the direction of the motion of the zero before the experiment. If there-
SÅ¿ore the motion remained constant during observations made on the two tubes, the
=results given by each would be oppositely affected, and the mean value would be
Scorrect. Kyen if, as was the case, it was impossible to ensure snch constaney, the
Zerror of the mean would probably be much less than that of the individual observa-
Stions.
