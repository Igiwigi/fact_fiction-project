V ln the first place, it may be argued that the excitability of the ventricular musele

5 to every two impulses. The possibility of such a causation for the production of the
A half-rhythm is shown by the fact that eurare or muscarin, when applied to the ventricle
alone, does ultimately cause that muscle to beat synchronously with every gecond
auricular beat, without any alteration of the rate of the auricular contractions.

It is, however, to be noticed that these poisons never produce this effect until they
have acted 80 powerfully upon the muscular tissue of the ventricle as markedly to lower
the strength of its contractions ; that, in fact, as one would expect, any method by
which the excitability of the muscle is lowered to such an extent that it is only able to
respond to every 8econd impulse, must at the same time greatly diminish the strength
of the contractions of that muscle.

This fact that a diminution of the contraction force accompanies the production of
