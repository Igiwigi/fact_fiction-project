W changes sign at the centre of the field.

When these results were first obtained, it seemed difficult to imagine any process
of continuous transition from the first type of disturbance to the second, and attention
was accordingly focussed on the nature of the normal disturbances implied by our
solutions. We pass now to a description of the processes by which these disturbances
were investigated.

Nature of the Normal Disturbances. Determination of Contours.

10. Equation (25) is derived from the boundary conditions (20) by elimination of the
arbitrary constants A, B, C, D,—i.e., of the three ratios B/A, C/A, D/A. Any three of
the boundary conditions will serve to determine these three ratios, and the fact that (25)
has been satisfied implies that the fourth boundary condition will be consistent with the
values so found. Thus it was a straightforward (although lengthy) matter to determine
the ratios appropriate to any point in the curves of fig. 6, and thence to determine the
appropriate forms of Vy and ‘Vy.

It was then possible to calculate the form of any contour of constant § according
to equation (6). When ¢ = 0, this expression for 4 may be thrown into the form

b= VEL + V2 sin fy (v/b) + tan (V,/Px)},

and hence, knowing ’y and ‘VY; for any value Z (= y y/b), and given the value of y
for the contour which is to be plotted, we can find the values of y %/b for the points at
