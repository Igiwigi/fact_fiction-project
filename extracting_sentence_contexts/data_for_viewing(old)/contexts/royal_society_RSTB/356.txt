The very characteristic emergences, h, of figs. 1-3 and 6, reappear in the petioles
hitherto described under the name of Rachiopteris aspera. In my Memoir VI. I
pointed out* the existence, on the periphery of these petioles, of numerous “ abortive
hairs” or “tubercles,” but I was not then aware of their full significance.

Fig. 7 represents a characteristic example of a transverse section of a young
Rachiopteris aspera, from the periphery of which a number of these emergences, hi, h,
are given off. The origin of the superficial layer and of the internal parenchyma of
each emergence is seen to be identical with that demonstrated in my description of
fig. 9, Fig. 8 represents a longitudinal section of a similar petiole, in which these
emergences are again seen at h, h, variously intersected.

The above facts combined make it clear that Rachiopteris aspera is merely a petiole
of Lyginodendron Oldhamium ; hence the former name must disappear from our lists.
It also follows that Lyginodendron Oldhamium is a true Fern, most probably belonging
to some Sphenopterid type. This determination carries along with it the further one
that the stems of some, at least, of the Ferns of the Carboniferous age developed their
xylem or vascular structures exogenously, through the instrumentality of a meri-
stemic zone of the innermost cortex, which practically must be regarded as a cambium
layer, But the history of this interesting plant is not yet ended.

In various preceding memoirs, but notably in Part XVI., I have provoked a strong
opposition amongst some botanists whose studies have been chiefly limited to living
forms of vegetation, by revealing the existence, amongst the Lycopodiaceous plants of
the Coal Measures, of a mode of development of a medulla which differs so widely from
