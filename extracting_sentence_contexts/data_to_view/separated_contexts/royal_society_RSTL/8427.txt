Blue lights are used in the Hooghly ;
but it is not stated at what distance they are visible in fog: their glare may be seen
further than their flame}. It might, however, be desirable to ascertain how far the
electric light or its flash can be traced. * Sound is the only known means really effective; but about it testimonies are con-
flicting, and there is scarcely one fact relating to its use as a signal which can be consi-
dered as established. Even the most important of all, the distance at which it ceases
to be heard, is undecided. Â« Up to the present time all signal-sounds haye been made in air, though this medium
has grave disadyantages: its own currents interfere with the sound-waves, s0 that a gun
or bell which is heard several miles down the wind is inaudible more than a few furlongs
up it.
