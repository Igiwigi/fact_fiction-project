or toa different gas with the same 7, is to translate the curve parallel to the log, / axis

reliable; but the absolute position of the curve on the pressure scale requires an estimation
of the ratio @/p for the gas and temperature under consideration. (The calculation of a
K/K,, table is not made superfluous by the previous comparison with Kassel’s theory; for
Kassel used his exact quantal or classical formulae, and calculated K/X,, afresh for the
characteristics s, A, Ey, T of each reaction he treated.)

A table of 7,(/) is given in (b) below, preceded in (a) by general estimates of @// for
various 7. It would be misleading to give the table first, since the increase of /,(7) with n
might suggest that A/K,, increases with n for fixed /; in fact, it tends to decrease owing to
changes in the //f ratio. This point is made clear in (c) below, by giving the ‘transition
pressures’ for specified values of K/K,,. In (d) a note is added on temperature effects.

The appraisal of these results is deferred until § 8.

(a) The relation of p to 0

The parameter 4 (60) is related to / through the collision frequency o. In the assumed
