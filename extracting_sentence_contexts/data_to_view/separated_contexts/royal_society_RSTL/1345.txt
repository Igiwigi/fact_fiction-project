Laxs, by the hands of Mr. CoxnsIDAN, and Major NEPEAN,
several preparations of the uterus in different states, and the
young kanguroo at a very early period after leaving the uterus.
'These, on examination, appear to compose a body of evidence
that elucidates several parts of the curious mode of generation
of this animal, and to contain the most material anatomical
facts that are necessary to direct our future inquiries. The preparations themselves I have deposited in the collec-
tion for which they were originally intended; and am desirous
to communicate the facts and observations to this learned So-
ciety, that they may prove useful to those gentlemen whose
residence in that country enables them to prosecute, and com-
plete, this interesting investigation. |

The only general circumstances I have been able to collect


Mode of Generation of the Kanguroo. 225

respecting the breeding of the kanguroo, from those who have
resided in New South Wales, are the following. That they
breed at all seasons; that the female has never been known to
have more than a single young one at a time, and is seldom
found without one. That the young remains in the false belly,
or goes into it occasionally, and sucks the mother a long time
after it appears capable of procuring its own food ; and yet if
the mother is closely pursued, in attending to her own safety,
she forces the young out of the false belly, if it has arrived at
a sufficient age to be covered with hair, although incapable of
making its escape.
