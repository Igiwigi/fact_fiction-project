Of these cases (2) leads to the approximate determination of the forces expressing
the mutual action between two solid ellipsoids or uniformly magnetized ellipsoids, and
(4) in certain cases to the forces between two currents in elliptic circuits, the particular
case of circular circuits being completely determinate. Similar results also hold for rectangular solids and circuits. The case (2) derives additional interest from the fact that it engaged the attention
of LAGRANGE, who obtained the expansion as far as the first four terms. The same
four terms have also been worked out in a very interesting paper on the potential of
an ellipsoid at an external point, by Colonel A. R.
