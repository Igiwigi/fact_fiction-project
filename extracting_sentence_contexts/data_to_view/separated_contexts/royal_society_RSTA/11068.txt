YOUNG ON THE GENERAL THEORY OF INTEGRATION. 245

content of a plane set containing the set E, and the latter the content of a plane set
contained in E, so that the common limit must be the content of E. In the case
when the function is sometimes positive and sometimes negative, the sum of the
positive terms of the first summation is the content of a set containing E,, and the
sum of the negative terms, taken with positive sign, is the content of a set contained
in E,; similarly the second summation is the content of a component of E, minus the
content of a set containing E,; thus the common limit must be the content of E,
minus that of E,. Thus the two definitions are identical.*

The second of Lesescur’s definitions enables us without difficulty to identify the
Lebesgue integral with the generalised integral which I defined in § 24, In fact,

comparing LeBEsGUE’s notation with that used by myself in § 21, it is clear that

that is, the generalised integral of § 24. Thus the Lebesgue integral is the same as the generalised integral of § 24, the
fundamental set being a finite segment.

§ 26. Contrasting the definition of § 24 (S being now a finite segment) with the
geometrical definition of Lesesaurn, we see that they stand to one another in the
same relation as the ordinary definition of integration of, say, a continuous function
to its definition as a certain area.
