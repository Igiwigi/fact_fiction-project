Hence, we have four different possibilities, to which, following Bagarello [19],
we associate four different and mutually orthogonal vectors in a four-dimensional Hilbert space
Hg. These vectors are 9,0, 1,0, 90,1 and Â¢,1. The first vector, go,9, describes the fact that, at t =0,
the two players have both chosen 0 (0102). Of course, such a choice can change during the time
evolution of the system. Analogously, gp,1 describes the fact that, at t=0, the first player has
chosen 0, while the second has chosen 1 (0:12).
