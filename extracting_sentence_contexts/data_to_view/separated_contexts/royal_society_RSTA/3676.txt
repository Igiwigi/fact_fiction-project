Its effects, at some distance inside the cylinder, will therefore be
small compared with the effects of the large and unbalanced lateral distribution
of shear. We notice that, for so short a bar, the lateral contraction is very much less than
the contraction we should expect according to the “uniform tension” theory. In
fact it never amounts to 60 per cent. of that contraction. For points deeper in the
material, the contraction is much smaller than this.
