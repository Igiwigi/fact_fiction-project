of these elements to form compounds containing 3 or 5 equiys. of other elements,
and it is in these proportions that their affinities are best satisfied ; thus in the ternal
group we have NO,, NH, NI,, NS,, PO,, PH.,, PCl,, SbO,, SbH,, SbCl,, AsO.,, AsH,,
AsC1,, &c.; and in the five-atom group NO;, NH,O, NH,I, PO;, PHI, &c. Without
offering any hypothesis regarding the cause of this symmetrical grouping of atoms, it
is sufficiently evident, from the examples just given, that such a tendency or law
prevails, and that, no matter what the character of the uniting atoms may be, the
combining power of the attracting element, if I may be allowed the term, is always
satisfied by the same number of these atoms. It was probably a glimpse of the ope-
ration of this law amongst the more complex organic groups, which led Laurent
and Dumas to the enunciation of the theory of types ; and had not those distinguished
chemists extended their views beyond the point to which they were well supported
by then existing facts, â€”had they not assumed, that the properties of an Organte
compound are dependent upon the position and not upon the nature of its single

* atoms, that theory would undoubtedly have contributed to the development of the
science to a till greater extent than it has already done; 8uch an assumption could
only have been made at a time when the data upon which it was founded were few
and imperfect, and, as the study of the phenomena of substitution progressed, it gra-
dually became untenable, and the fundamental principles of the electro-chemical
theory again assumed their 8way. The formation and examination of the organo-
metallic bodies promise to assist in effecting a fusion of the two theories which have
