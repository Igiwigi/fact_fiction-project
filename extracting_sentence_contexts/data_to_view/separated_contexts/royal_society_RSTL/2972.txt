Even the cause of the variations of the needle, mysterious as it has
hitherto appeared to be, may probably be referred to the relative energies of
the opposing electrical currents, which are perhaps subject to occasional modi-
fications ; and the appearance of earthquakes and volcanic action, from time
to time, seems to countenance the probability of such changes. Nor $hould it be overlooked in reference to this view of the subject, that the
oblique bearing which is generally obseryable in the strata and veins, with
respect to the equator, causes them, as it were, to cross at opposite sides of the
globe in the same parallels of latitude, so that their tendency, if any, must
necessarily be to produce more than one magnetic pole in each hemisphere. Thus, in this respect also, the hypothesis accords with the interesting fact
lately announced ;â€”of Professor Hansreen baving ascertained the existence of
a second magnetic pole within the arctic circle. The revolution of the earth
on its axis from west to east seems moreover to harmonize with the idea of
oblique electrical currents ; since rotation in the same direction may be pro-
duced by corresponding electro-magnetic arrangements. Before I conclude, I will briefly mention a few facts relative to the tempera-
ture of some of the mines in Cornwall.
