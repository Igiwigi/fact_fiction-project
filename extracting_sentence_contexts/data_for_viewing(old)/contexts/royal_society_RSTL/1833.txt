that produced by yoltaic electricity; for, as Dr. WoLLasToxN remarks, a mixture
of oxygen and hydrogen rose from each of the fine metallic points, a fact which
shows that the decomposition was produced in a manner essentially different.
The decompoxsition in this experiment seems to have been effected by the me-
chanical agency of the electric fluid. The fine electric dart shooting out from
the invisible gold points may have actually cleayed a molecule of water which
happened to be fayourably situated, and thus its oxygen and hydrogen were
disengaged at the point where the mechanical cleavage took place #,

5. It does not appear to me at all necessary that zinc and copper should be
thrown into opposite electric states to produce yoltaic action, I shall make
no suppositions with regard to those states, but ground my views of yoltaic
action on well established facts.. Zinc has a much more powerful attraction
for oxygen than copper; and yet copper has also a decided attraction for it,
otherwise there could be no salts of this metal, Let us now suppose, merely
for the sake of illustration, that a molecule of water is composed of an atom of
oxygen united to an atom of hydrogen. In the Plate VIII. (fig. 1.) let the oxy-
gen be represented by the white circle, and the hydrogen by the black. The
zinc plate z, having a greater attraction for the oxygen than for the hydrogen,
will turn round the molecule of water in contact with it, till its oxygen 8ide
be towards the zinc, and its opposite side towards the copper plate c, which is
connected with the zinc by the wire w. 'The same thing will take place with

* The same remarks apply to Mr. Barry's experiments on decompoxsition by atmospheric electricity.
Decompoxition was never effected by common electricity in which the component parts of the-sub-
