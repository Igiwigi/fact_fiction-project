scrapers throughout the Upper Palaeolithic [92,93]. In some
late Glacial and early Holocene lithic assemblages from sites
in the Pyrenees and Alps, it has been proposed that micro-
backed points and geometrics were made from scaled pieces
and/or bipolar cores [33,84,94]. Based on metrical criteria, it
is relevant to name pieces resulting from bipolar knapping
as ‘microliths’, although they are not retouched [95].

Although many spalls and fragments can be considered
as residuals derived from bipolar knapping, some of them
have been used for the manufacture of specialized tools
such as Gravettian and Azilian backed points [51]. Other
small artefacts may be equally functional; in fact, recognition
of evident macroscopic wear on some pieces indicates they
formed part of composite or hafted tools [33] (figure 5c),
and it is possible that some pieces may be identified through
microwear analysis [94,96,97].

Finally, we emphasize the importance of the study of
macrolithic tools. Pitted stones are diagnostic artefacts
of the bipolar knapping system and are accurate markers of
activity on a functional and spatial level [35]. As these tools
were very common in the northern Iberian Peninsula from
the beginning of the Holocene [43], we cannot dismiss the
possibility that the importance of bipolar knapping at Font
