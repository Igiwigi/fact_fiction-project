construct analytical solutions of the dynamical equations for the state evolution, even if in many
relevant cases this can be done (see §§3 and 4). Sometimes, however, numerical methods are really
what is needed. This is the case, for instance, of nonlinear models, which will not play any role in
this paper. Among the advantages of the QFT-inspired approach, we can point to the possibility
of describing dynamics in terms of solely pure states.

At the beginning of this paper, we mentioned the idea of ‘deep uncertainty’. From the quantum
information point of view [46] a pure state represents the maximally available information about
the context (in our case the context of DM). However, the availability of maximal information
does not mean the resolution of uncertainty. We say that the uncertainty can be very deep. The
pure state representation means that maximal information (about the context) is encoded in it.

The most tricky point of quantum information theory (and, in fact, quantum theory in general)
is that there exist states of compound systems, e.g. ‘agent+tenvironment’, which are pure. This
means they encode maximal information, but the states of subsystems, e.g. the state of the agent,

“This approach was used for a wide class of problems in DM, psychology, politics and biology [14-17,32,38].

5 Another complication is that it is impossible to represent the quantum adaptive dynamics as dynamics of pure states. The
impact of the environment can transfer a pure initial state into a mixed quantum state (represented by a density operator).

Such an environment contains both the complex internal mental representations of agents as well as, e.g. the market situation
or the current state of the political arena.
