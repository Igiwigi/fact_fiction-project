divisor were e degrees instead of being only one degree in » lower than the first,

Art. (4.). Strictly speaking; we have, not-yet fully-demonstrated that-the complete
allotrious factors are represented by the values above given for 2, but only that these
latter are contained as factors in the allotrious factors ; we must further prove that
there exist no other such factors.
