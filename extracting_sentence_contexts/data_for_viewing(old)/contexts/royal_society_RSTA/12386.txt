It is obvious that any curve having this equation can easily be recognised in either
of two ways. The tabular logarithms of a series of ordinates corresponding to equal
time-intervals, are in arithmetical progression. This method was used in verifying
the hypothesis as to the time-relations of the normal excursion. The second is a
graphic method depending on the fact that the subtangent NT (fig. 1) of a logarith-
mic curve, or intercept, upon the asymptote between the tangent and ordinate to any
point upon the curve, is of constant length. This property affords a means of finding
the position of the asymptote when only a portion of the excursion has been included
in the photograph. Two points are chosen some distance apart, and the tangent and
ordinate drawn to each. The level is then found by trial, at which the horizontal
distance between the one tangent and its ordinate is equal to that between the other
and its ordinate, or, in other words, the level is found at which the subtangents are
constant.

The possibility of doing this in the case of the normal curve suggested the method
of analyzing other curves propounded in my preliminary note. If, as my experiments
have indicated, the velocity of the meniscus at any moment is due solely to the
