The comparison shows that figure 7a
features a dramatic change in the way the different types of solutions are distributed across the
(c,T)-plane. In particular, the torus bifurcation curve appears to have split into two segments
around 7, =1.2. In fact, as we checked but do not show here, even for c > 40, the two curves
remain disconnected. This change of the bifurcation set is the result of a transition similar to the
interacting torus bifurcation curves in figure 5. Note in figure 7a how some resonance tongues
have become significantly wider and overlap to a greater extent, resulting in larger regions of
chaotic behaviour.
