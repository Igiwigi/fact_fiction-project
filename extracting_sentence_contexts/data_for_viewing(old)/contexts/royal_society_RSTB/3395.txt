much more in excess of that of the female, and native born white women are in
excess. The only countries from which an excess of female immigrants come are
Porto Rico, West Indies, and Mexico, the total excess being 326.

In the case of coloured people, the excess of females is not due to recent immigra-
tion. There is a small excess of coloured female immigrants from Porto Rico and
Mexico (83 excess females), but it is much more than balanced by excess of male
immigrants from all the other countries from which they come. Neither will the
death-rate, which is higher for coloured females than it is for males, account for the
excess of coloured females, while the birth-rate is almost exactly equal as regards
sex. And yet, as is the case for whites, the native born coloured women are in excess.

The fact that females are now in excess, both among white and coloured native
born, leads me to suggest that the war is responsible for this result. I can find no
evidence of any other cause which will explain it, and feel confident it cannot be
attributed to any of the causes which Ganron found sufficient to account for the
excess of females in the West Indies.

. Marriage.

Marriage has decreased since 1861, when 16°5 per cent. of the population were
married people, to 15°7 per cent. in 1899, and there has also been a decrease in the
number of children born; but it is of great interest to observe that in spite of the
relative increase of females the decrease of marriage is proportionately greater than
is the decrease in the production of children.
