by the mantle, But the exterior of the siphonated phragmocone of the Belemnite is
devoid of polish, and is in such close contact with the walls of the alveolus, that it is
very rarely the shell can be displayed entire as in the specimen, Plate XV, fig. 4.

If it be contended that upon physiological grounds the phragmocone of the
Belemnoteuthis must have been implanted in the alveolus of a guard or osselet, I
would reply that none of the species of Belemnites with which these chambered
cones are as80ciated in the Oxford Clay of Wiltshire, can have belonged to them, for
the reasons already assigned ; and a guard has till to be discovered that shall meet
the exigencies of the case. If, therefore, with our present scanty information, we
affirm that the Belemnite and the Belemnoteuthis belong to one and the same genus,
I respectfully submit that we are not only reasoning in advance of the data hitherto
obtained, but contrary to known facts.

From a tolerably extensive knowledge of the fossil Cephalopoda of the argillaceous
strata of the Oolite and Lias, I am led to conclude that the Oxford Clay of Wiltshire
