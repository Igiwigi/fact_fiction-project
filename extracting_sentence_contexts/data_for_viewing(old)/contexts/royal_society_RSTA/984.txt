and upper Jovian atmospheres can couple.

Ground-based observations in support of space missions have always been an important part
of ensuring maximum scientific return for investment in multi-billion-dollar space missions.
These can be preparatory observations, observations taken coincidentally with the missions
themselves, and follow-up observations to investigate questions that remain once the spacecraft
are no longer operating. Moving outwards in the Solar System, Stallard and co-workers provide
a detailed analysis of spectra and spectral images of Saturn taken with the Keck telescope to
coincide with the last orbits of the Cassini spacecraft in 2017 [40]. The properties of the auroral—
polar regions averaged across H} observations taken during the months of July and August show
clear ion wind flow patterns and temperature and density enhancements. But the individual
observations underlying these averages show up very detailed flows and arcs, and a changing
pattern of auroral activity. Comparison of these observations with models highlights the fact that
none so far available really matches the detailed observations, even if they can match the average
behaviour.

Uranus has always been a challenging planet to understand: it rotates about an axis that is
tilted so far that it is in the plane of the ecliptic, which means that for 21 years each rotational pole
points more or less continuously at the Sun; its magnetic dipole, on the other hand, is tilted at an
angle of 59° to the rotational axis and offset towards the south by about one-third of a planetary
radius, which makes its magnetic interaction with the solar wind extremely variable on a daily
and seasonal basis. Melin ef al.’s analysis of 27 years of ground-based observations of Uranus
[37] show that its average upper atmospheric temperature has cooled at a rate of just over 8K
per year from over 700 K when its Hy emission was first observed in 1992 [14] to closer to 500K
towards the end of 2018. But just why this is happening remains unresolved: given the number
