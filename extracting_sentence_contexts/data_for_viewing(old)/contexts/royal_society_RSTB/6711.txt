in various forms, in some cases it is extensive, in other cases small. The general direction of

. the folding of the striate cortex is horizontal. ‘The most marked cases are closely related
to those placed in group | ; others show a definite similarity with group 2.

The comparisons which I am making with the Chinese brains in order to obtain
some standard for morphological classification have made it necessary to subdivide
this group in the brains of the Southern and Northern Chinese into three sub-
groups. These sub-groups are arranged in accordance with the size of the sulcus
lunatus. In the Chinese, although the percentage of group 3 cases is as great as
in the Australian aboriginal, there is a definite preponderance of those specimens
in which the sulcus lunatus, although well defined, is small. These facts are tabu-
lated at the end of the description of the occipital region.

Within this group there is a great variety in the form of the sulcus lunatus, and
therefore it is necessary to describe many of the hemispheres in some detail. This

fails. ;
The type occurs in eleven cases :—
