their relative height and thickness present no good constant characters. One of the
best authorities, Professor HENSEL, in his memoir on /ipparion, printed in the Transac-
tions of the Berlin Academy for 1861, tells us that it is even impossible to distinguish
the fore and aft phalanges of living Ungulata in the case of several individuals being
mixed together. This may serve as an excuse for my not trying to do it among the
fossils; and T therefore intend to give only a general description, which will apply to
both the fore and hind limb.‚Äù


OSTEOLOGY OF THE HYOPOTAMIDE. 89.

The phalanges of Hyopotamus found at Puy, where the didactyle Diplopus is not
present, are, by this fact, already separated by nature. As seen in Plate XXXVII.
figs. 20 & 21, they strike us as being much longer than in most of the living genera,
and considerably longer than in Anoplotherium. In Xiphodon and Entelodon, however,
the first phalanges | are als yery long.

The upper, or proximal, *articular surface is not. symmetrical, as the inner side of the
first phalanx is considerably thicker than the outer, in correspondence with the same
inequality of the distal extremities- of the metacarpal and metatarsal bones. The 8ame
difference in the thickness of the inner side is also to be secn on the distal extremity.
The proximal surface is concave, and the groove for the articular ridge of the metacarpal
is limited to its posterior third only. This thickening of the inner side makes also the
inferior end not completely symmetrical ; and this want of symmetry is much greater in
the first phalanges of the didactyle Diplopus.
