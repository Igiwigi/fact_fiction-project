simple curve on the scroll. Taking at pleasure a point on the directrix line 1, and
making this the vertex of a cone standing on the curye m, this cone has an «-tuple line
(the line 1) and a P-tuple line (the line joining the vertex with the foot of the line 1');
the line 1' meets this cone in the foot of the line 1', counting | times, and besides in
m—Þ, =% points; the lines joining the vertex with the last-mentioned points respect
ively (or, what is the same thing, the lines, other than the B-tuple line, in which the
plane through the vertex and the line 1' meets the cone) are the « generating lines
through the assumed point on the line 1; and the line 1 is thus an «-tuple line of the
scroll. And in like manner, through an assumed point of the directrix line 1', we con-
struct 3 generating lines of the scroll; and the line 1' is a Þ-tuple line of the scroll.

10. The scroll $(1, 1, mz) now in question has not in general any multiple generating
line; in fact a multiple generating line would imply a corresponding multiple point on
the section m.; and this section, assumed to be a curve having an «-tuple point and a
Þ-tuple point, has not in general any other multiple point. But it may have other
multiple points; and if there is, for example, a y-tuple point, then the line from this
point which meets the two directrix lines counts y times, or it is a y-tuple generating
line; and s0 for all the multiple points of mz other than the «-tuple point and the
-tuple point which correspond to the directrix lines respectively. It is to be noticed
that the multiplicity y of any such multiple generating line is at most equal to the
smallest of the two numbers « and B; for suppose y >«, then, since «+=, we
Should have y+B3>m, and the line joining the y-tuple point and the P-tuple point
would meet the curye m in y+þÞ points, which is absurd. In the case of several
multiple lines, there are other conditions of inequality preventing self-contradictory
results *,
