indicate [100], and it is tempting to speculate that a proportion of the community are adapted
to maximize seasonal shifts in, for example, resource availability [101]. However, as has been
highlighted before [28], detection of the influence of environmental conditions on the structure
and function of benthic communities requires an overview of how functionally relevant infaunal
traits covary with changing abiotic and biotic circumstance [102], and how species interactions
and ecological roles vary with context [103].

Although the position of the polar front [104,105] and the conditions that influence it [20]
are still poorly defined, there is evidence that warming is leading to changes in its intensity
[20,106]. Atlantic surface waters are heating up at approximately 0.4°C decade™!, and Arctic
waters at approximately 0.6°C decade~ [22], weakening the temperature differential between
the opposing water masses and allowing a north-eastward intrusion of Atlantic waters into the
Barents Sea [107]. The fact that changes in species activity and behaviour that affect important
aspects of the ecosystem (nutrient concentrations) are maximized at the frontal edge, and that this
boundary represents a distinction (high south-low north) in faunal mediation capacity, highlights
the significance of this boundary for defining functional precincts and ecological boundaries
[30]. Changes in species and functional groups between seasons, attributed to the presence of
more labile organic matter reaching the seafloor in summer, provide anecdotal support for this
assertion [64]. Indeed, recent work has shown that such spatial-temporal changes are linked to the
functional traits of organisms because environmental context—in particular sea ice and bottom


water temperature [35]—influences the trait expression of individuals which, in turn, dictates net
community-level behaviour and ecosystem functioning [99,108]. Comparison of our northern and
southern faunal clusters provide some insight as to what may lie in store (elevated bioturbation
