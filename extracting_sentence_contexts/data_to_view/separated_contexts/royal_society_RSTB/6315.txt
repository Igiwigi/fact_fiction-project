keeping these leaves in separate blocks so that the average differences between them
might be eliminated from the treatment comparisons. 2. This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the mean square
variance between plants with the remainder) that the variation between plants is no
greater than within plants between leaves, so that nothing would be gained by restricting
