that he obtained negative results with sterilised soils, is certainly in favour of the
conclusion at which he arrived.

M. Joutm made numerous vegetation experiments in which the soils and the plants
were, with certain precautions, exposed to the free air, and in which known amounts
of combined nitrogen were supplied. He found very variable, but in some cases very
large, gains of nitrogen. He considered that the variations of result were largely due
to the varying conditions as to mineral-supply in the different experiments.

M. Jounin concluded that microbes probably play an important part in the fixation
of nitrogen. He did not think that his results were favourable to the supposition
that the plants themselves effected the fixation. For the present he limits himself
to the establishment of the great fact of the fixation of the free nitrogen of the
atmosphere, leaving to the future the exact explanation.

Tt is to be observed that the large gains shown were chiefly with a polygonous
plant, buckwheat, and not with plants of the leguminous family, which are reputed
to be “ nitrogen collectors.”

To show the practical importance of the fixation of free nitrogen, M. Jounre
calculates what would be the gain per hectare according to some of his results. It
may be confidently attrmed, however, that such gains as he so estimates, do not take
place, either with or without vegetation, in ordinary soils, in ordinary practice.

Dr. B. E. Drerzeti made vegetation experiments, in which plants were watered
