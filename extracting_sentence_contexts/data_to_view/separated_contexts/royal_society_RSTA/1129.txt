Losiewicz et al.
investigated the catalytic activity of different metals in the hydrogen electro-evolution exchange

current using the work function as an activity descriptor, proving that the catalytic activity :2
is a periodic function of their atomic numbers [59]. Likewise, Shen et al. [60] used Â® as an : =
additional descriptor along with the d-band centre to improve the predicting accuracy and to : Ss
understand the catalytic properties in oxygen reduction reactions. They considered the fact that a)
band hybridization and electron transfer can occur at the same time when a molecule adsorbs : <
on TMs. The d-band centre (eg) parameter was introduced by Hammer & Noerskov [61,62] and : >
it measures the interaction strength between a TM and an adsorbate, which is directly related to Lo
the filling of the bonding orbitals. However, this descriptor needs to explicitly take into account :8
how the bond-strength depends on the reduction of the adsorbate antibonding state, which is : =
defined through the upper-edge position of the d-band [63].
