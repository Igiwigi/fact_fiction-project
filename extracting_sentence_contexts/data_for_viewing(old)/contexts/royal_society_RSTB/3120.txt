the sac and in the production of the prothallial tubes, Welwitschia possesses characters
which are quite distinct from anything known in Gnetum.

STRASBURGER, whose material was insufficient for a study of the contents of the
prothallial tubes,* called the micropylar cells which produce them “ corpuscula” and
suggested that the tube itself might be a strongly developed canal-cell. Following
STRASBURGER, recent writers have regarded these cells as homologous with the
archegonial initials of the gymnosperms, each containing a single nucleus which
becomes the oosphere-nucleus.t In consequence, Welwitschia has been looked
upon as occupying an intermediate position between Hphedra and Gnetum
Gnemon.t

In view of the fact now established, that the prothallial tube, probably always,
contains more than one nucleus, it can no longer be regarded as the arrested initial of
an archegonium, That the number of nuclei present in different tubes varies, and
that this variability is not connected with the age of the tubes (see figs. 39, 40), are
strongly opposed to the view that the prothallial tube is an archegonium in any stage
of development. If the nuclei are all potentially sexual, as the characters exhibited
in the early stages suggest, the tube is no more equivalent to an archegonium than
is the whole of the fertile end of the embryo-sac of Gnetum Gnemon.

The results of this investigation, while far from being conclusive, suggest that
the fertile end of the Welwitschia prothallus is a more highly specialised form than
that of Gnetum Gnemon, from which it seems mainly to differ in its partial septation,
which may, perhaps, be regarded as merely a necessary antecedent to the highly
