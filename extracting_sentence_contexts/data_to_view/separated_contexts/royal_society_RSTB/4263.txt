The essential difference in the life-cycle of Marsupial enamel cells from those of
most other Mammals, lies in the fact that in the latter no stage is characterised by
any marked difference in the cytoplasm or nuclei of the ameloblasts. Tn the case of Marsupials, however, we find that there is a stage where the greater
part of the cytoplasm has become transformed into metaplasmic material, the cyto-
mitoplasm alone remaining. The marked changes in the nuclei of the ameloblasts form another distinguishing
feature, for the size of the nucleus is undoubtedly related to the functional activity of
the cell, and therefore to the amount of undifferentiated cytoplasm, so that without
going so far as to accept in their entirety Herrwic’s views as to ‘“ Kernplasma-
relation,” we may safely infer that the great decrease in size of the nucleus is due to
the fact that almost all the cytoplasm has been changed into metaplasm. This great decrease in the size of the ameloblastic nuclei during the earlier stages
of functional activity shows that substances from the karyoplasm must diffuse into
the cytoplasm, whilst their subsequent increase during the stages of rejuvenation can
only be explained by assuming that the nuclear chromatin has the power of taking

from the cytoplasm a material which restores to the nucleus its spherical form and
t¥pical structure. My observations on Marsupial enamel cells lend no support to the views advanced

by Leon Winrtams that the enamel rods are built up of globules formed in the
ameloblasts, probably as a direct nuclear formation, that these pass out from the cell
connected by “ plasm strings,” and that a separate product is taken by the ameloblasts
from the cells of the stratum intermedium and poured about the rods to form the
interprismatic material.
