where abnormal risk-taking or impulsive behaviour is a feature.
Additionally, a number of papers also consider the theories
relating to how risk-taking and impulsive behaviour is gener-
ated within the brain, and how it may have developed over
evolutionary time. Nevertheless, one aspect that is not covered
specifically, in any great detail, in this Theme Issue is the genetic
contribution to impulsive and risk-taking behaviours, despite
the fact there are a great many studies linking single genes
with aspects of impulsive behaviour and risk-taking. These
include numerous rodent studies where the expression of a
key candidate gene has been manipulated resulting in changes
in impulsive and/or risk-taking behaviours [13-17], and even
rare mutations in human families that link single genes to
impulsive, risky or violent behaviour [18,19]. However, more
general analyses of genetic variation and/or heritability
are limited to a handful of rodent experiments [20-23] and
twin studies in humans [24]. Moreover, convincing examples
of hypothesis-free genome-wide studies of risk-taking and
impulsive behaviour are limited. A recent genome-wide
association study (GWAS) of delay discounting performance
