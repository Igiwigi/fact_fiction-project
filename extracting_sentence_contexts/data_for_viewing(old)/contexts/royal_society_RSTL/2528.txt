366 MR. RITCHIE ON THE THEORIES OF GALVANISM.

a-solid to a fluid state ; and as'its capacity for caloric'has undergone a change,
may not its capacity for the electric fluid have -also undergone‚Äù a certain
change? Hence it is, possible that the true-theory of -galyanism may be more
intimately connected with that of latent heat than has yet been snpposed. Since
the zinc is dissolyed without the assistance of oxygen from the water, it appears
that the atoms of the acid have combined with the pure brilliant atoms of the
metal, without the necessity of the metal being first converted to an oxide.

From the short view that I have taken of this interesting subject, it appears
that the electric theory is quite unfounded, and that the chemical theory will
require some modification to embrace the facts contained in the last experi-
ments. 'This I shall not, however, attempt at present ; as my object in this
paper is rather to demolish old fabrics and collect new materials, from which a
more substantial edifice may be raised.
