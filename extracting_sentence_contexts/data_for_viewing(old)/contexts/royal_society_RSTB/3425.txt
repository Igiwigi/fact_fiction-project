compared with legitimate unions is greater in Cuba than is shown in the statistics of
other countries, and this is in spite of the inclusion of still-births in the former.

It is pointed out that, as there is usually a marked excess of M. among first-born
children, and as a large proportion of illegitimate children are first-born, the increased
proportion of F, produced by illegitimate union is still more remarkable.

The fact that illegitimate unions give rise to the birth of an increased proportion of
F. children has long been known ; the inclusion of still-births now enables me to show
that illegitimate wnions result more often in the conception of F. than legitimate
unions, and that this fact must be regarded as a law of sex production.

From these facts it must be concluded that heredity can have no bearing on the
variation in the proportion of the sexes produced by legitimate as compared with
illegitimate unions, and that we have here certain evidence of the influence of
extraneous forces on the proportion of the sexes produced.

The question as to the nature of these forces is discussed, and it is concluded that
the main factor which influences the increased production of F. in this class of union
is an exceptionally active metabolism of the mother, which favourably affects the
development and ripening of those ovarian ova which give rise to F, embryos.

The increased production of F. in consequence of illegitimate union is exceptionally
great for whites in Cuba, while for coloured people it is without parallel in any
country the statistics of which I have seen, except Greece.
