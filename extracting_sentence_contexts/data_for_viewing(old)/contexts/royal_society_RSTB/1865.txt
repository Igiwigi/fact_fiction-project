perhaps no feature in the Marattiacese is more remarkable than the persistence of
type from the remote past to the present day. Srur himself points this out (Joc, cit.,
p. 796). Are we to believe that this type which has virtually stood still through
so many successive geological periods, was so quickly plastic at the Carboniferous
period as to show a progression from a type with entirely separate sporangia, as seen
in Senftenbergia, to the completely synangial condition seen in Danaites, between
the Culm and the lower Coal Measures? I think such a suggestion is improbable,
though, of course, it is not impossible.

Accordingly, whether we discuss the form of the Marattiaceous sorus, or the
relations of the sporangia composing it, it appears desirable to return to comparative
and developmental considerations derived from living Marattiacese, and see how far
the facts detailed above may serve as a basis for views such as shall not be incom-
patible with the fossil evidence.

It cannot fail to strike even a superficial observer how great is the similarity of the
sorus of Danaea to the fertile spike in Ophioglossum. Notwithstanding that the former
is applied throughout its length to the lower surface of the leaf, while the latter is a
body which rises free and erect from the upper, still they resemble one another in
being composed essentially of two parallel rows of laterally flattened sporangia, which
are of approximately uniform size, project only slightly at the surface, are separated
