be correlated with the faults that affect the Barrier Range and the Sirima region at the
south end of the lake.

In this connexion it is also interesting to note the Nakua Hills which were reported
to be of volcanic origin by Athill (1920, p. 363), who speaks of his exploration of a
crater. Since no pre-Pleistocene craters seem to have been preserved elsewhere in this
area, it is reasonable to suppose that this one is not older than Pleistocene in age, and
may in fact be the volcanic expression of the movements that fractured the deposits of
the Omo Valley. If that is true I would suggest that these hills are the most northern
representative of the volcanic centres which occur along the axis of Lake Rudolf.
These are North, Central and Héhnel (South) Islands, besides the eruptions of Pullo,
north of Sirima, and Nabuyatom Cone on the southern shore of the lake.

Reference to Table, fig. 8, will show how this period of faulting and vulcanicity in
the Rudolf region is thought to correspond with the earth movements of Uganda and
the major rift faulting of the Naivasha region.

At Sirima near the southern end of the lake a sheer gorge has been cut through the
