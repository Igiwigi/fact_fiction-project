26. It is extremely natural to suppose that the effect upon the medium is mainly,
if not entirely, operated by the refracted ray in its passage into the medium, after its

Separation from the reflected ray; and as s and s' denote the ratios = = that is to

say, the ratio, for each case, in which the vis vira entering the medium distributes

itself between the particles of the medium and the particles of the ether interfused

amongst them, we ought to expect that in an isotropical medium, like that under

consideration, this ratio of distribution should be independent of orientation, and
consequently the same for both the primary and secondary refracted waves.
