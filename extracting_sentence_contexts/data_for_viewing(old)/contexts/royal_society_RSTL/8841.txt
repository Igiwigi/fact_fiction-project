Wot 80, a perfectly true roller when rolling on a perfectly true surface ought to experi-
Smce no resistance, however soft the roller and the plane might be, provided both were
Emade of perfectly elastic material 80 that the one did not crush the other; and we
might expect, although these conditions are not absolutely fulfilled, that a roller of iron
would roll as easily on a surface of india-rubber as on one of iron, or that an india-rubber
roller would experience no more resistance than one of iron when rolling on a true
plane. Such, however, is not the case. The resistance with india-rubber is very con-
siderable; my experiments show it to be ten times as great as with iron. I am not
aware that this fact has been previously recognized ; and that it has often been over-
looked is proved by the numerous attempts which have been made to use india-rubber
tires for wheels, the invariable failure of which may, I think, in the absence of any
other assigned cause, be fairly attributed to the excessive resistance which attends their
use. Another fact which I do not think has been hitherto noticed, but of which I have
had ample evidence, and which clearly shows the existence of some hitherto unexplained

cause of resistance to rolling, is the tendency which a roller has to oscillate about any
position in which it may be placed on a flat surface.

Howeyer true and hard the roller and the surface may be, if the roller is but slightly
disturbed it will not move continuously in one direction until it gradually comes to rest,
but it will oscillate backwards and forwards through a greater or less angle, depending
