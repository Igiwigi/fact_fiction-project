from the shoot apex, the junction of bud stele and shoot stele tends to be incomplete or
may not be effected at all (Wardlaw 19434, 6). It is difficult to see how such facts can
be explained other than in terms of a basipetal initial differentiation of vascular tissue
in the sense defined by Wardlaw (1944).

During the normal development, the bud stele may become conjoined not only with the
shoot stele but also with a strand of the leaf-trace. Buds of D. filix-mas, though axillary in
origin (Wardlaw 19434), are typically associated with the leaf-traces only. Figure 31 (and
figure 91, plate 12) show a large solenostelic bud in longitudinal median section: its stele is
conjoined both with a meristele and a leaf-trace, but in neither instance is there a confluence
of the xylem strands. This can be ascertained by following the serial sections upwards and
downwards. Figure 32 (and figure 92, plate 12) illustrate the relation of bud stele to
meristele lower down in the shoot where the former is beginning to fade out. These facts
again support the hypothesis of a basipetal development of bud vascular tissue. In figures 29
and 31 xylem of pericyclic origin can be seen. :

Further observations on bud development and the relation of bud stele to shoot stele may
now be considered. Figure 33 shows a transverse section of a shoot at a level where the
incisions have almost disappeared. In the top right-hand corner a leaf-base with its
numerous leaf-trace strands is shown; this level is also the region of conjunction of two
