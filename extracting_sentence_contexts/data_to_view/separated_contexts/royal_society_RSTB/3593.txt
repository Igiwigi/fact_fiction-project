This condition indicates a fast of at least two to three days, and possibly of
a very much longer duration; in captivity, flies will live from nine to twelve days
without food if the conditions of moisture are suitable. A large number of experi-
ments of long duration were conducted, in which the cages were starved for two
complete days between each feed, but there was nothing abnormal in the number of
deaths. The fact that wild flies do not feed at such very close intervals of time as
seems to be implied from the usual laboratory treatment of the flies has, as will be
seen later, a somewhat important bearing on certain parts of the cycle. The actual mechanism of feeding calls for attention, in that it affects the course of
development. The sucking-stomach or crop leads out of the ventral side of the
proventriculus by a long duct ; in a full feed, the gut, up to a short distance behind
