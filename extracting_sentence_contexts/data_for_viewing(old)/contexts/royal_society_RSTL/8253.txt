log t= log a+: log p,
where for log # we can take gz with its sign changed, and thus get a series of equations :—
—ez =loga+: log p,)

whence log @ and log p can be deduced. In his researches on the sun's radiant heat
PoviLLevr assumed 7=80 hk. In accordance with this the values of s for every degree
from 29* to 80” were calculated and the constants @ and p deduced. It was then found
that the values of 92 were tolerably well represented, yet at the same time it was evident
that 9=70 4 or r=60 4 would fulfil the required conditions more accurately; and in
point of fact »=60 þ is very nearly the value that makes the outstanding errors in the
representation of pz a minimum ; 7=58 , lessens the sum of the squares of the errors
to an extent altogether immaterial. The following are the 51 equations of the form (2),
where the coefficient of log p is
