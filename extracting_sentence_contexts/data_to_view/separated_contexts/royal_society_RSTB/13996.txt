At the same time, polyunsaturated fatty thesis is an established biomarker for distinguishing
acids (PUFAs), and more precisely the ratio of omega 6:3 microorganisms and their implications for host health
fatty acids, are important for cognitive abilities in honeybees [122,123]. Our findings suggest that this link might also
[73,113,114]. In fact, a recent study found that dietary fatty prove relevant for bee health. The effect of dietary fatty
acid profiles do not only impact bee longevity, but also acids on bee performance and the correlations between
their lipid metabolism and immune-related gene expression specific fatty acids and the bacterial community in O. bicornis
[30]. They strongly impacted the beesâ€™ gut microbiota, with larval provisions revealed by our study provide a first inter-
high-fat diets, e.g. increasing the relative abundance of esting directive towards an integrative understanding of the
Gilliamella and decreasing levels of Bartonella [30].
