and that there are no higher-order relationships between clus-
ters of traits. In reality, new compatibility relationships
between individual traits arise over time and as a result of
historical contingency, due to higher-order relationships.
Thus, in reality, these dependencies will be both a force and
a product of cultural evolution.

For example, a swastika and a peace symbol are unlikely
to be considered compatible symbols, not because of some
a priori nature of their meanings or appearances, but because
of a particular history of cultural associations attached to both
symbols. While we recognize this fact, constraining the
dependencies at the outset of the simulations and limiting
the model to relationships between individual traits allowed
us to examine the effect of structural dependencies more
directly and avoid unmanageable complexity; by varying c
we could explore a range of scenarios for cultural copying.
Another simplification, for ease of interpretation, that
could easily be removed is the assumption of symmetric
relationships between traits. Building further, asymmetric
relationships, which might indicate sequential learning of
traits, could be explored, and, as a greater challenge, allowing
relationships between triads or higher number tuples of traits
would lead to more complex structures.
