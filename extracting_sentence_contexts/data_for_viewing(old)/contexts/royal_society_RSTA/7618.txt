for ¢<f and = | for ¢>é,. This assumed field ignores the initial phase of the storm in
which e;(¢) first rapidly assumes a negative value but recovers its initial value again in
about 4 hr. It also replaces the gradual (though rapid) increase of e;(t) between 4 hr.
and 18 hr. by an instantaneous increase at 18 hr.

As regards the initial phase, no serious error can arise from ignoring this, because
the current systems induced by the first rapid decrease of e,(¢) will be almost exactly
annulled by the equal and opposite current system induced by the rapid recovery of
e(t). This is, in fact, proved by the observations, which show that i, (¢) recovers its initial
value at almost exactly the same time as ¢,(t).

An instantaneous increase of e;(¢), such as that assumed at ¢ = fj, would produce the
maximum possible value of i,(¢)), viz

$9q°A, which is independent of «. This value of
i,(f) would correspond to a distribution of induced currents on the surface of the
conductor, which would rapidly diffuse into its interior, Therefore, for a short period
after time ¢— ty, the induced field would rapidly decrease. Hence the effect of re-
placing the gradual rise of the observed e(¢) by the assumed instantaneous rise at
¢ = 4, will be to give too high a value of i,(¢) at time ¢ = f,, and too rapid a decrease of
i,() for a short period following this time. If, however, the calculated and observed
