instruments also have quantum and, hence, unobservable parts, through which they interact with
quantum objects.) In classical physics, specifically in classical mechanics, this difference between
objects and phenomena, while still, technically, valid, as defined, for example, on Kantian lines,
can be disregarded, and objects and phenomena can be treated as the same. Correlatively, the : =
behaviour of objects could be treated as independent of observation, because the interference of 3
measuring devices, beginning with our bodies, with the process of observation or measurement
can be neglected or compensated for. nee)

As in Heisenberg’s original scheme, in Bohr’s interpretation, the mathematical concepts :
comprising the formalism of quantum mechanics only relate, in terms of probabilistic predictions, a]
to what is observed in measuring instruments, even, in contrast to classical mechanics, in dealing DN
with primitive individual quantum processes and events. This situation appears to be correlative [Go
to the epistemology just described, as defined by the fact that, unlike in classical mechanics, Ss
one cannot obtain any information about quantum objects, even the primitive individual ones, ,
without interfering appreciably in their behaviour. This makes all such information defined by
the effects of the interaction between quantum objects and measuring instruments. In this regard,
as Bohr emphasized, the recourse to probability or statistics in quantum theory is essentially
different from the use of probability and statistics in classical statistical physics, or in dealing
with such events as a coin toss. There this use is necessitated by the mechanical complexities of the
systems considered, which cannot be tracked in practice, but which emerge from the mechanical
behaviour of the ultimate individual constituents that is causal and, in the first place, amenable
to a realist representation by means of classical mechanics. In quantum mechanics, at least if
interpreted in the spirit of Copenhagen, the behaviour of the ultimate constituents of matter is
not amenable to a realist representation and, as a consequence, is never causal, which makes the
recourse to probability unavoidable even in this case, again, in accord with what is observed in
