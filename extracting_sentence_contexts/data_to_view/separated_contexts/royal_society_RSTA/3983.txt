An interesting speculation would concern
the form of such work if the artists were elsewhere; and in one case this is a splendid example of
how different the view might be without travelling too far from ‘home’. In 1887, the pioneering Russian scientist Konstantin Tsilkovsky wrote On the Moon. This
science fiction speculates about scientists who travel to the Moon and experience low gravity,
but in the course of their adventure also witness a solar eclipse like no other: the Earth eclipsing
the Sun. This conceit is brought to life (in the eventual publication) through a splendid illustration
by Gotman (figure 35).

9. Concluding thoughts

As is so often the case, the best science fiction can foreshadow scientific reality.
