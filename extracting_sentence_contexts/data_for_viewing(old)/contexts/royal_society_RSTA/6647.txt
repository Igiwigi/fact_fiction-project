Introduction: mixing in microfluidics 933

find ideas that are realizable. Surface patterning, a wall with small grooves oriented at
oblique angles with respect to the axis of the main flow (e.g. Stroock et al. 2002), sug-
gests several other possible designs (see Wiggins & Ottino 2004), and some of these
may be possible with conventional planar fabrication techniques. Surface charge, hav-
ing bands of positive and negative charge density in order to generate electro-osmotic
flows (EOFs), suggests other designs and there are undoubtedly many other possi-
ilities (Oddy et al. 2001). However, there may be technological issues to do with
he reliability of possible mechanisms. In fact, this is what at the moment seems to
imit devices based on EOF effects. Finally, some designs may be attractive but not
echnologically feasible. For example, planar fabrication techniques cannot produce
he geometric patterns in static mixer design. Other techniques may be possible, for
example, Bertsch et al. (2001) built replicas of large-scale industrial mixers using a
micro-stereolithography process. Currently the dimensions of the objects are large
or microfluidic applications (O(mm)). Limitations are due to available materials.
Bertsch et al. use an acrylate-based resin, which has the same mechanical character-
istics as the acrylate-based plastics used in the rapid prototyping field. However, it
is only a matter of time before new materials emerge.

It may be argued that the science base for microfluidics is already largely developed
and what remains is technological development. There is no question that this is a
