It seems, in the first place, desirable to introduce uniformity in the methods em-
ployed in the theories of the perturbations of the moon, and of the planets, as far
as this can be done without the sacrifice of any facility in the solution of the pro-
blem. Tt is not probable, howeyer, that the tables of the planets will be deduced
from the variations of their elements. In fact, as I have shown in a former paper,
although the results obtained by either method are identical (as is also obvious &
priort), it is only by numerous reductions that those deduced from the one method
are convertible into those deduced from the other. Moreover, in order to obtain,
through the variations of the elliptic elements, the inequalities of any given order in
the coordinates, the development of the disturbing function must be carried one step
further ; $0 that, for example, in the theory of the moon, to obtain all the inequalities
depending upon the fourth power of the moon's eccentricity, it would be necessary
to obtain the terms depending upon the fifth power of the same eccentricity in the
development of the disturbing function. In the theory of the moon it is necessary to develop many terms in the disturbing
function depending on the square of the disturbing mass, and even some depending
on the cube; or, in other words, it is, as is well known, insufficient to substitute, in
