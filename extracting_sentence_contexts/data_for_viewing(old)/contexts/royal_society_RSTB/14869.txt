or tidal changes, are relatively fast [2,6]. Rapid weather-driven warming—heat-
biology.ox.ac.uk waves—can arise over a matter of days or even hours [4,5,7,8]. Extreme heat
may disproportionately interfere with population and community structure
and constitute the greatest selective force on species under continuing global
climate change [4,9,10].
Alongside shifts in temperature, the geographical distribution of many
parasites (including microbial pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and fungi)
and the severity of infection during disease outbreaks are changing (e.g.
[11,12]). Many populations are therefore facing the simultaneous stresses of
extreme heat and virulent infection [13,14]. Although these environmental con-
ditions may influence all host—parasite interactions in some way [15], much of
the work to date focuses on ectothermic hosts and their parasites (table 1). The
