In the more general case, in which the generating curve, as in the Turbo scalaris,
slides forwards upon the axis as it revolves, increasing at the same time its linear di-
mensions according to the law of the logarithmic spiral, it is clear that the surfaces
of the snccessive whorls would interfere with one another, and that thus the uni-
formity of the spiral chamber would be destroyed, unless the motion of translation
(or the sliding motion) of the curye, by which the space allowed to each whorl upon
the axis is determined, were governed by some law corresponding to that which
governs the linear dimensions of the whorl; unless, in short, the spaces allowed to
the widths of snccessive whorls upon the axis varied in the same progression as the
widths themselves vary. A similar principle applies to the distances of the whorls
measured upon the surface of the shell in the same plane passing through the axis.
These distances are, in fact, in this case, similar linear dimensions of successive
whorls, and are therefore subject, according to the theory, to the law of the loga-
rithmic s$piral, and like the distances of successive whorls of that spiral, on the same
radius yector, are in geometric progression.

Nautilus Pompilius.

These conc]usions were directly yerified by the following observations. A shell of
the Nautilus Pompilius was cut through the middle in a direction perpendicular to
its axis, and a tracing was taken of the section of its spiral surface ; this tracing is
copied in fig. 6.
