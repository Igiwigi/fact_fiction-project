We will avail ourselves, in the first place, of the results of our own observations in
St. Vincent and Martinique, and of our experiences during the eruption of Pelée on
July 9th, 1902. But the Reports of the Commissioners appointed by the French
Academy of Sciences, and of the various parties of American scientific men, already
quoted by us, have furnished many additional facts of importance, and not a few
theoretical suggestions, which we shall be able in some cases to adopt as in accordance
with the opinions we have been led to form by our own investigations. It is only by
the collection of a large body of facts from authentic sources, well and carefully sifted,
that this new branch of the science of volcanology will ultimately be established on a
secure basis, and its results and conclusions entitled to the confidence of scientific
men. The Stages of the Eruptions.
