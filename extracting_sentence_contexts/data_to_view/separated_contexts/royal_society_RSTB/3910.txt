This elimination, however, cannot be in this case correlated
with any feature in the inheritance, on account of our knowing no definite distinction
between the larvee of these two forms, which we might investigate from this point
of view.

4. In the cross HL. esculentus 9Â° x HE. miliaris f no elimination takes place, while
in the cross FE. acutus 9 x E. miliaris 2, again, a constant elimination of a few
chromosomes always takes place. These two crosses have always resulted in maternal
inheritance, despite the fact that elimination only takes place in one, 7.e. H. acutus 2
x E. miliaris ~. In this cross we have a definite feature which we can
investigate.
