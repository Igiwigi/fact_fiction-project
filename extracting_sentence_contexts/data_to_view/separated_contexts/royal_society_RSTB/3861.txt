Or we may instance again the
red series of the upper portion of the Middle Coal Measures in Cumberland, the
Whitehaven Sandstone, which was mistaken by Sep@wick for Permian.t Many
other instances might be quoted, but these will suffice. It is therefore no argument that, because the Sweet Coal Series of the Wyre Forest
consists of red-grey measures with Espleys, these beds must be the equivalents of the
beds of corresponding lithological character in the Southern Pennine and Midland
Coalfields. As a matter of fact they are not, as their flora clearly shows. The sole
test of horizon is paleeontology, and not lithology. For many years past it has been apparent to those who are working out the
horizons of the British coalfields on the plant evidence that the continuous-sheet
theory of Gopwry-AusTEN and others is only exceptionally true.
