was hanging on the wire, was als 31 divisions. Hence the application and remoyal
of the 14 1bs. alternately doubled, and reduced to its previous amount, the magneti-
zation induced by the earth's force.

When the magnetizing current was 4'25 divisions of the battery-galvanometer
scale, the application and removal of pull produced no effect, thus showing that the
influence of the earth's magnetizing force was exactly counterbalanced by that due
to the current. The maximum effect of applying and removing stress was obtained
when the magnetizing force was about 50 divisions (one cell gave 70 divisions). The
Vnrarrt critical value was obtained with 215 divisions of magnetizing current, or
50 times the magnetizing force which balanced the influence of the earth's magnetic
force. This is a much greater number than that obtained by the ballistic method ; that
it is 80 is no doubt due to the fact that the induction-coil then used was much shorter
than the magnetizing coil, and was placed with the centre of its length coincident with
that of the magnetizing coil. With the highest strength of current (567 divisions)
the effect of * on” and © off” was 8:5 divisions, and the effects were, as in the former
experiments, increasing very slowly.

243. The value in absolute units of the vertical component of the earth's magnetic
force was calculated from the value of the magnetizing current which balanced it, and
the total resistance of coil electrodes and battery, which were all measured for the
purpose with great exactness. As before, the electromotive force of one tray cell was
taken as one volt, or 105 on the C. G. 8. system of units. The total resistance with
one cell in circuit was 3:503 ohms, the number of turns per centimetre in the coil
