55'5. They sbow a 8light relation between the temperature of the body and of the
air, but less perhaps than might be expected, and less unquestionably. than would
have been exhibited under circumstances not equally favourable for the preseryation
of an equable warmth, especially at night, in the uniform temperature of the Sitting-
room ; and when at rest, from warm bed-clothes, and during the day from sitting in
cold weather near a fire; and from the clothing then, as well as at night, being varied
with the degree of cold to be resisted, having in view the preserving of an agreeable

which I sball have presently to bring forward, may aid in illustrating the remark

3. Of the Effect of Active Ezercise on the Temperature.

By active exercise, I mean that which occasions acceleration of the heart's action,
and of respiration, and commonly a feeling of increased warmth, such as fast walking
and riding, in contradistinetion to the passive kind, as that which is taken in an easy

active exercise, in different months and under various circumstances :â€”
