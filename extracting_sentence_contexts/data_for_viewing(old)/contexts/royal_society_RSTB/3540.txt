which have been described above.

In the literature of avian and mammalian embryology it is usual to find the
primitive or Hensen’s knot regarded as the thickened anterior extremity of the
primitive streak, and there can be no doubt that in many cases it has the appearance
of so arising. Nevertheless, both as regards birds and mammals, evidence has been
adduced in support of its independent, and even of its primary, origin (¢/ BoNNET
(84) ), Mrrropnanow (’02)). Even in Ornithorhynchus, where the mutual
independence of primitive knot and primitive streak is so startling, these structures
very rapidly come into such intimate relation that they soon appear as differentiated
portions of a single axial structure. The knot is then found to be placed
approximately in the middle of the, then greatly elongated, embryonic area. In
view of this fact it appears to us that the apparent unity and continuity of the
elements in question in other instances must be regarded with some reserve.

Tt must be admitted that in certain cases, both in birds and in mammals, there
appears to be complete continuity, both materially and constitutionally, between
Hensen’s knot, with its blastoporic aperture or depression on the one hand, and
the primitive streak with its primitive groove on the other. Nevertheless, we here
