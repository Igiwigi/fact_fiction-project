E Third, it may be noted that in no case does any one of the experiments given last
& longer than two hours, and that, with one exception (Experiment VI), it is stated
& that the observations had ceased because of some obvious abnormality in the heart's
S action. In my earlier experiments with isolated hearts a practically normal beat
Ss often lasted for four hours or longer, They were however carried out on a different
5 plan, which allowed of the use of defibrinated Dog's blood to nourish the heart.
5 lnstead of permitting the left ventricle tÂ© pump blood ont through a wide aortic
cannula, the only exit left was through a narrow cannula in cne carotid, and, in
correspondence with this fact, the tube supplying the superior cava was also narrow.
In the present series of experiments the widest possible cannule was placed in the
aorta and vena cava, and all the tubing attached to these, and the stopcocks upon it,
had a bore as wide as that, of the cannules. Under such cireumstances the heart pumps
round three or four litres of blood in a very few minutes, and with a smaller amount
the stopcocks and clamps used to make the flasks C and D alternately feeding and
recipient, would have to be changed at 8nch short intervals as to make it impossible
to carry on any uniform geries of consecutive observations. With the original method
1000 to 1500 cubic centims. of whipped blood was enough for convenient use, and
