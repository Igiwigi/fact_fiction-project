of new types of generation (different from synchronous generators (SGs)) in the early 2000s as
well as the constant growth in power electronics (PE) interface-connected loads since the 1960s. :

(a) Transformative changes of power systems 7

The electrical power systems of the future will be substantially different compared with their :w
present states in terms of design, constituent components and operation. They are already, and :
will be even more so in the future, characterized by an unprecedented mix of a wide range of [es
electricity-generating technologies (e.g. fossil fuel, gas, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar and tidal), [BB
efficient electrical power transmission-enabling technologies (e.g. high-voltage direct current ,
(HVDC) and flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices), as well as responsive and highly
flexible demand (e.g. PE-interfaced ‘intelligent’ appliances, electric vehicles (EVs)) and storage
technologies (e.g. batteries, supercapacitors, flywheels, hydrogen and superconducting magnetic
energy storage) with significant temporal and spatial uncertainty. These evolved power systems
will be principally characterized by the following:

(i) Evolving and new market structures and operation with a liberalized energy market
and increased cross-border (between countries and transmission system operators) bulk
power transfers to maximize the effectiveness of market mechanisms.

(ii) New generation and storage technologies, mostly PE-interfaced and often not visible
to the system operator (less than 100 MW typically invisible to the system operator),
including mainly large onshore and offshore wind farms and grid-connected solar
