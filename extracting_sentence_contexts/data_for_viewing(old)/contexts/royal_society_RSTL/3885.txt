he was unable to determine whether they are arterial or yvenons+. In a snbsequent
work in 18164, he has stated that no vessels exist in the Tracheary Arachnida, a re-
mark which LarrenLEy repeated in 1831 ; and in 1817|| Trgviranus stated, that
none exist in the Myriapoda. But in 1825 Straus DurckutinT discovered the ex-
istence of distinct chambers and valves, with lateral orifices in the dorsal vessel of
insects, all which had been overlooked by Tzeviranus in the Arachnida, but he was
unable to discover any vessels connected with, or proceeding from, the dorsal vessel
in insects. In the Myriapoda, he found the anterior portion of this structure in the
Scolopendra divided into three branches, which are distributed to the head, and that
the middle one of these gave off other branches, the course of which he was unable
to trace. In 1828 Carvs published his discovery of a circulation in insects; and
Waexe in 1832, Mr. BowtrBaNK in 1833**, and Mr, TyrreL + in 1835, added
some new facts. But our own countryman Huwre, long before this period, seems to
have been acquainted with the course of the circulatory fluids in insects, and with the
existence of the lateral canals described by Wacxes, which he regarded as veins.
Professor MuLLeR{{ also, in 1824 had traced a connexion between the dorsal vessel
of insects and the ovaries, which he described as vascular, although that opinion was
controverted by Carvs, 'Tzeviranus, BurwsisreR and Wacntr. Some unpublished
observations made by myself in 1829F\ on these structures, several years before I
was acquainted with the observations of MULLER, led me also to regard them as
vascular, and this opinion has since been strengthened by my recent discovery of
