This overlapping is essential if the present paper is to be intelligible at all, since many
of Turnbull’s reductions are not pressed far enough, and an account which begins every

‘discussion at the point where Turnbull breaks it off would, in the present case, be too dis-
jointed to follow. The reductions are effected by using the familiar identities of symbolic algebra. The length
of the discussion is due, in part, to the large number of forms which arise for consideration,
and also to the fact that, for a comparatively few forms, the actual reductions themselves
are of considerable length. It is necessary, particularly in the more complicated cases, to
give the work in detail, since the processes involved are by no means obvious. * Elected F.R.S. 18 March 1948.
