Moreover, the half-yearly points 2 and s and « and d
lie in the same order about © 7; and the interval between the latter two, though 8maller,
is not inconsiderable in comparison with the interyal between the two former points; and
the relation of the four points to each other is much the same in each of the three figures,
the straight line joining @ and & approaching a direction at right angles to the line of
junetion of 7 and s. This would seem to imply that the sxummer form of the diurnal
variation merges into the winter form, not solely by the gradual fading away (and inver-
81on at other places) of the former, in which case the diurnal variation at the opposite
equinoxes would be the same, but also partly by the superposition of a distinct variation,
whose turning-points are considerably removed from those of the ordinary diurnal vari-
ation, and the extent of which is much more limited, and which moreover has an inverse
character at the opposite equinoxes, at which times its influence on the ordinary mean
diurnal variation is most sensible. Tt does not imply a retrograde rotation of the hours
of maxima and minima accompanied by a gradual fading away of the variation, the vari-
ation till preserving a constant character in all respects except extent and turning-points,
because in that case, whilst a single rotation occurs in the arrangement of the points
1, 2, 3, &e. to 12 in figure 31, there should be two and three rotations respectively in
figures 32 and 33, and, in fact, there is only a single rotation in each of the three curves. Now, on referring to plate xxv. of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society
for 1863, where appear similar figures representing (in part) the diurnal variations of
declination at Toronto and St. Helena, it is seen that these figures possess the character-
istics just described of those for Bombay, with the exception that the rotation in the
St. Helena curye is in a right-handed instead of a left-handed direction. To examine
now more directly whether there be a semiannual inequality in the diurnal variation of
declination having opposite characteristics at the opposite equinoxes, and at the same time
to eliminate that other semiannual inequality whose times of oppoxsition are the solstices,
the mean diurnal yariation was calculated for the half year January to June, and com-
pared with the same for the half year July to December; half the excess, for each hour,
of the former half year over the latter was taken to represent, the inequality sought,
which proved to be of 80 definite a character, and 80 similar for Bombay and Toronto,
as to tend to the extension of the examination to all other stations for which reduced
observations were accessible.
