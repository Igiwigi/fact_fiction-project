E. F. Renr.f It depends upon the
fact that the equations giving the stream-lines in a non-viscous fluid and the equipo-
tential lines in an electric field are identical. The apparatus consists of a concrete tank
5 ft. long, 2 ft. 6 in. wide, and 1 ft. 3 in. deep, filled with water and having thin sheets
of aluminium mounted on the two longer sides. An aluminium model of the a√©rofoil,
of 3-in. chord, was placed vertically at 10 degrees incidence in the centre of the tank,
the upper end being above water ; a reproduction to scale of the large model in position
in the Duplex tunnel was thus ensured, so that the wall interference should correspond.
