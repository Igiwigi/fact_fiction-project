Xmin are shown together with the corresponding logarithmic fit for a grain size of 2.3nm. For all
five grain sizes, the coefficients of determination R? for the fits to average time step data are well
above 0.96, and for most cases are around 0.975. The fitted values of A, B and C for the five grain
sizes as a function of rj, are shown in figure 1b-d together with the linear fits to obtain the six
fitting parameters. The fits of the parameter functions A, B and C are also relatively good with
R? =0.98, 0.92 and 0.96, respectively.

To fit the parameters for 7, the AMC data for different grain sizes and different initial positions
need to be sorted by their minimum distance min. In figure 2, the corresponding data are shown
as a function of di for Xmin = 0.173 nm and a grain size of 2.3nm. The fits to the absorption site
probabilities are relatively good with R? > 0.9 for minimum distances below 0.65nm. For Xmin <
0.91nm, the fits still have R? values larger than 0.8, but they become worse for starting positions
further away from the grain boundaries. This is due to the fact that for positions close to the centre
