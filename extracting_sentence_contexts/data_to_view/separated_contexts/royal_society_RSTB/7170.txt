Our observations show that in the great apes, the protocone and hypocone of the upper,
and the protoconid, hypoconid, and hypoconulid, of the lower molars, are the first to
show attrition and exposure of the dentine. The first permanent molars not infrequently
show signs of attrition before the complete permanent dentition is in place (Schultz 1935). In view of this fact, and because the present study revealed a close, but not complete
correlation between the degree of attrition of the upper and lower teeth, the degree of
wear of the second lower molars was taken as an index of age, even when both upper and
lower teeth were available. Adult specimens with the complete permanent dentition in place, but not showing wear
on either of the medial two cusps of the lower second molar, were classified as young
adults, and those showing wear on one or both of these two cusps, in addition to the three
lateral ones, were classified as old adults. The number of subadult specimens in which
some permanent teeth had erupted, and whose sexes could be assessed with reasonable
certainty, was so small that the measurements of their permanent teeth were not included
in the present study.
