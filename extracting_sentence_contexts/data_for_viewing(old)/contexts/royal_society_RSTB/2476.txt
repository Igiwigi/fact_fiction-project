bearing on our question. He writes: “ While at present the Polypodiace form the majority of Fern
species, in the Jurassic formation the Osmundacew# and Cyatheacew with allied families (Matoniex, Proto-
polypodiace) are almost as much in the foreground as the Marattiacew in the Carboniferous Period,”

do exist in the characters of the sporophyte between Ferns on opposite sides of the
barrier, they do not focus definitely upon any two genera sufficiently to demonstrate
a community by descent. But to these similarities, widespread though they are,
must be added the comparisons of the Gametophyte advanced by Hem, and the facts
of Palzophytology ; the former establish with increased strength the affinity of the
Gradatze to the Gleicheniacezs and Osmundacez, while the fossil evidence will hardly
allow the Marattiaceze to be regarded in any other light than as relatively primitive
Ferns. And when, in addition to these considerations, we contemplate the physio-
logical probability of an advance from the simultaneous to the successive sorus, as a
mode of spreading the physiological drain over a longer period, a strong case appears
Sito me to be made out in favour of a transition having taken place in the course of
descent from some types of Simplices to the Gradatze, as against the suggestion of
8 Prantt that they represent two distinct evolutionary branches.
eo Tn conclusion, I may point out that the views put forward in this memoir will
Qharmonise in many features with the arrangement in the ‘Synopsis Filicum,’
Doubtless the system of Sir Wm. Hooker is in many ways open to amendment,
