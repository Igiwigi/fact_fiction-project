In Stage I (embryo 6’97, G.L. 5 mm.) a very minute primordium of the right

ventral pancreas only is recognisable; in another embryo of the same stage (embryo
1’01, G.L. 5 mm.), as well as in Stage IL (embryo 8’98, G.L. 4°5 mm.), two small
outgrowths of approximately equal size are present ; in another embryo of Stage IT
(embryo y’99, G.L. 5 mm.) there is only one outgrowth, the right; in all later
‘stages the two are uniformly present, the right invariably of greater dimensions than
the left. These observations indicate, first, a slight variation with regard to thé
stage at which the primordia appear, and, secondly, a tendency on the part of the right
ventral pancreas to appear before the left. This latter fact is of interest in view
of the facts, that the right ventral pancreas starts to undergo branching at an
earlier stage than the left, and that it develops into a larger gland and contributes
more tissue to the adult composite organ than does the left. The conclusion that
we have to do here with two distinct primordia admits of no doubt. The ventral primordia originate as lateral hollow outgrowths of the hepatic
diverticulum, close to its origin from the gut.
