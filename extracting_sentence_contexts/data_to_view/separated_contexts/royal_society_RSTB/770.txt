The post-ilium (Pt.J/m.) has attained its adult proportions, ze, is of about the same
length as the ischium and pubis; it is also curved downwards, as in the adult, and has
altogether a finished appearance. The pre-ilium (Pr.J/m.), on the other hand, is
very thin, ends in an irregular border, and falls far short of its ultimate dimensions. These facts certainly lend support to the view that it is the post-ilium of Birds which
answers to the ilium of Reptiles, and that the pre-ilium is a secondary structure. The distinctness of the pubis and ischium is well seen both in a dissection and in
sections ; there is a well-defined tract of fibrous tissue passing vertically downwards
from the acetabulum, and separating their proximal ends from one another. Stage F (Plate 18, fig. 276).
