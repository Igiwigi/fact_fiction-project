In certain individuals both the factors A and 8 are represented, or, in other words,
they retain a proportion of the unmodified germ-plasm of the winged forms. This
feature in itself appears to offer a reasonable hypothesis explaining certain phenomena
which have never been adequately accounted for, viz., the occasional persistence
among the soldiers and workers of certain features which belong sensu stricto to the .
winged sexual forms. These are: (1) the occasional presence of wing vestiges in
both soldiers and workers ; (2) the fact that nymphs with well-developed wing
rudiments (and apparently differing in nowise from the nymphs of the winged forms)
have been observed to develop into soldiers. Hitherto, the occurrence of such
individuals has been accounted for on the belief that they are nymphs of the winged
forms which have become “converted” into soldiers through the agency of changed
nutrition. On the other hand, I maintain that it is owing to the mixed nature of
the germ-plasm of these individuals that the transitory parental characters appear
in their ontogeny, before those of the caste to which they belong ultimately assert
themselves.
