The magnetic field
in and around the armature of a dynamo or alternator, and that in and around
a cylindrical case which is used for purposes of magnetic shielding, are examples
of important practical problems in two dimensions. ON LINES OF INDUCTION IN A MAGNETIC FIRLD. 305

One very important feature which characterises the method, is the fact that it
enables us to obtain the exact shape of the lines of induction not only in air, but
in the para-magnetic or dia-magnetic material itself. This cannot be accomplished
by any of the older methods. The method has therefore been applied to determine
the exact form of the lines of induction for a number of cases of mathematical
interest, several of which have been also plotted by calculation.
