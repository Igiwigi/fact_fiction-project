addition of carbonic acid.

Those who maintain that carbonic acid is formed in the lungs will say, that in the
last experiment the carbon of the blood attracted the oxygen of the air, and that the
carbonic acid 80 formed was then evolved. But there is one circumstance which is
I think fatal to such an explanation, for all the acids blacken the blood, and carbonic
acid possesses this blackening property in a remarkable degree. When we agitate
a small quantity of carbonic acid gas with arterial blood, the colour immediately
changes to venous, and when we add carbonic acid to venous blood it becomes
almost black. Now, if the carbon of the blood attracted the oxygen of the air, and
if the carbonic acid were thus formed in the blood itself, it is evident that the firs!
effect of the air on the blood would be to make this fluid blacker than it had been
before ; but the opposite of this is the fact, for the first effect of the air is, not to
blacken, but to brighten the blood ; consequently, from this alone, we may infer, that
the acid is not formed during the experiment, but that it exists ready formed in the
blood, and that it is only removed, and not produced or formed, by the atmospheric
air,

I have already observed that one class of experimenters have obtained results by
means of the air-pump which are in direct opposition to those obtained by others.
May we not now, from the above experiments, explain this difference by supposing
that those who could not obtain carbonic acid made their experiments before the air
had had time to act on the blood, whilst the others had allowed some time to elapse ?

From the preceding statement we may, I think, conclude,
