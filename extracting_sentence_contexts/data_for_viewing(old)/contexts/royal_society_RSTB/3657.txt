= Fic. 25.—View of the apical face of a four-sided pyramid of worked flint dug out from the bone-bed in
a Bolton and Laughlin’s Pit by Mr. J. Rerp Morr. The point of the pyramid is broken by small
c fractures, and so is the face d. The other faces are smooth and bright and produced by large
g conchoidal fractures of the flint. Drawn of the actual size. Probably this piece was used as a
a hammer held in the hand, the apex of the pyramid being the point applied.

3 Fic. 26.—Lateral view of the specimen drawn in fig. 25. The two surfaces seen are @ and ¢ of the first
= figure. The conchoidal fractures are shown in the drawing.

Nore to Fies. 25 and 26,—The interest of this specimen is greatly enhanced hy the fact that I have
received from Mr. EpwArp HeroNn-ALLEN a hammer-stone of the same shape and workmanship, but
twice as big by linear measurement, found by him on the coast at Selsea Bill in a gravel of undetermined
age. From the same source I have also received an enormous rostro-carinate flint implement,
weighing 5 Ibs. 9 ozs., discovered in the same deposit. These are referred to in the postscript at the
end of this memoir.—February 1, 1912.

from the bone-bed in Messrs. Bolton and Laughlin’s pit, the other (pale yellow and
almost white in parts) is from the bone-bed below Red Crag at Sutton, at a spot
where it rests on London Clay and where Coralline Crag is absent.
