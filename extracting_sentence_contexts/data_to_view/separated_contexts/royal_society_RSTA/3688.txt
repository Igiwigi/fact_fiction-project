For the single vacancy, the ion moved into
the split vacancy configuration, while for the higher-order vacancy complexes, it moved into
a position that filled the void created by the removed carbons. It is worth noting that while
the split vacancy is inversion symmetric, the higher-order vacancy complexes are not, resulting
in a permanent EDM and thus static internal electric field. While this is usually avoided for
quantum information processing applications as it makes defects susceptible to environmental
field fluctuations, it is in fact desirable for EDM experiments, as it increases the sensitivity of
EDM measurements [6]. The calculated formation and cohesive energies shed light on which configuration is most
energetically favourable to form (figure 2). Our analysis reveals that, for both 7Â°Pa and '4!Pr,
the substitutional model is less favourable than those containing vacancies, as it generally has
a higher formation energy despite having a marginally higher cohesive energy in certain cases.
