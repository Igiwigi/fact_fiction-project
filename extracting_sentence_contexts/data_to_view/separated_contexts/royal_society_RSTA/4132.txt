The Potential Difference between Equally-concentrated Solutions. The experiments show that the Helmholtz theory of the electrometer and the
Nernst-Planck calculations of the potential differences between solutions cannot
both be true. While there are many facts in favour of the view that the Nernst-
Planck hypothesis gives the quantitative expression for the potential difference
between two solutions, there is one result calculated from the hypothesis which seems
to possess greater weight than any of the others, since it would seem to be a conse-
quence of almost any form of diffusion hypothesis. This is the result that the
potential difference between equally-conceritrated solutions of potassium chloride and
potassium iodide is so small that in measurements of the type with which we are
concerned it can be taken to be zero. Koutravusce has investigated the electrolytic conductivity of solutions of KCl and
KI for different degrees of dilution, and an examination of his numbers shows the
relative amount of ionization in equally-concentrated solutions of the two salts may
be considered identical when the solutions do not contain more than 0°01 gramme
molecule per litre (;}gth normal).
