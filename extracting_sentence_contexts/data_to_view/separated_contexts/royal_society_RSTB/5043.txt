The peristome is reniform, and situated considerably
nearer the anterior than the posterior end of the body, the flexible membrane possessing
a number of relatively small calcareous plates (Lovin, 1874, Plate XXXIX, fig. 225). The slit-like mouth is situated at the posterior border of the buccal membrane, and is
partially concealed by a projecting lip (labrum). The five ambulacra appear to meet
round the mouth so as to exclude four of the inter-ambulacra. his is due to the fact
that the first (unpaired or peristomial) plate in inter-ambulacra 1, 2, 3 and 4 is greatly
reduced (fig. 5). That belonging to area 5 is also small, but forms the lip or labrum
already referred to. The inter-ambulacra bear numerous, rather delicate, spines, those on the ventral
surface, notably those on the sternal plates (fig. 5, st.), being spatulate.
