278 MR. NEWPORT ON THE TEMPERATURE OF INSECTS.

the early part of the spring and summer, at a temperature of at least 10* lower than
the present, would have perished within forty-eight hours. Hence it is not diminished
temperature alone that induces a state of hybernation. Now during the confinement
of these individuals I examined other specimens of the same species, and found the
abdomen in each of them well filled with fat, while the respiratory organs appeared
to be diminished in calibre, and somewhat compressed by its accumulation. This
was particularly the case with one specimen which I examined, and the cireumstance
became the more interesting to me from a knowledge of the fact that both the amount
of respiration and the quantity of heat evolved by the insect are at this period dimi-
nished. But without going further with the causes of hybernation of insects, and
which do not directly belong to this subject, it may be inquired how it happens that
if the sleep of the hybernating insect be induced by a plethoric condition of body,
that there are certain species, as, for instance, the Anthophora retusa, STEPH., which
assume the perfect form and begin to hybernate during the swmmer, even at the end
of August, but do not leave their abodes until April or May in the following spring,
although the morning sun sbines brightly on their dwellings, and sometimes raises the
exterior surface of the bank in which they are deposited to a temperature of 80* Fans.
or upwards? Unto this it may be replied that the bodies of those insects, having 80
recently changed from the larva to the perfect state, are still provided with a full
supply of nourishment ; that the soil in which they are nidificating has not its tempe-
