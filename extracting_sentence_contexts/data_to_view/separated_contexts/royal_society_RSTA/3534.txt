There are other methods of estimating solar
8 disturbance, and it would be of interest to consider likewise data based on these, and
ae investigate the question as to apparent variations in magnetic phenomena with
3 variation in the position of the spotted areas in the sun's surface. T have thought it
2 better, however, to confine myself wholly on the present occasion to WoLF and
S Worrer’s numbers, and to cover a limited portion of the ground in a comparatively
thorough way, rather than to wander at large over the whole field. My own opinion
His that the true inter-relationships of the several phenomena are hardly likely to be
g reached, and they certainly cannot be demonstrated, without a really minute and
& careful study of the facts.

3 In treating of sun-spot relations, I shall not adhere strictly to the order followed in
& the first part of the paper, but shall take first the case of the diurnal periodic changes. § 42.
