The results obtained with Populus tremula differ considerably from those obtained
with Hibiscus vitifolius and the Potato, especially in that Populus can form
intumescences in the dark while the other two plants cannot. But, according to my
results, in Populus, as in Hibiscus and Potato, the formation of intumescences is
promoted by heat, and by the presence of easily assimilable food material, such as
sugar. Up to the present time Populus tremula is the only plant in which
intumescences have been formed in darkness, and we seem therefore to be justified
in assuming, until further experimental evidence is forthcoming, that Populus is in
this respect exceptional. It is abundantly clear from all the experiments that
assimilation is a most important factor in the formation of intumescences, and yet it
is one to which little attention has been paid by most of those working at this
subject. The fact which, more than any other, shows that assimilation is an
essential factor is that intumescences are never formed under water because land
plants cannot assimilate under water. The fact that the leaves of Populus tremula
alone, so far as is known, form intumescences in the absence of light, may probably
prove to be due to the presence of some special substance in the leaves. This
question is referred to again on p. 252.

The experiments made with other plants, chiefly other specimens of Populus, may
now be considered.

In most cases the leaves or branches were placed with their ends in water, or they
were simply laid on wet cotton wool, and the vessel containing them was covered
with a bell-jar. In a few cases the leaves were floated on liquids in covered Petri
