The former and the
character figures given depend on all the 60 selected days of the year. In obtaining
the second set of H range figures, all ranges were omitted which exceeded 200y, and
a mean was taken from the remaining figures in each column. The object was to see
the effect of omitting a few of the larger magnetic storms—all, in fact, which gave H
ranges in excess of the largest range of 1895. The data from 1895, though naturally not as smooth as the 3-year and 11-year
data in Table XI., show the 27—28-day period quite as clearly. It is as unmistakable
in the range as in the character figures.
