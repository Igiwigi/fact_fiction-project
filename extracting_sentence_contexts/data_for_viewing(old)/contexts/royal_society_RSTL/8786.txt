No. I. The Early Development of Pisidium pusillum.

Ix the months of April and May 1871 I obtained a supply of the freshwater bivalve
Pisidium pusillum, from a muddy little stream near Jena, in Saxe Weimar. '

The fact that the development of the eggs. of this mollusk takes place within a pair
of brood-cavities formed at the root of the inner gill-lamella on each side, enables the
observer very readily to obtain embryos in different stages of development.

Lzyvi6 and O. Scnxpr had previously to this described the development of species
of Cyclas, which genus really embraces Pisidium. LTnypie studied Cyclas cornea,
Scnuy studied Cyclas calyculata. At the period when their studies were made the
questions of histogenesis were not quite in the same position as they are to-day ; and
accordingly in their papers little will be found relating to the topics now discussed.
Moreover, on account of the greater transparency of the eggs of Pisidium, I have been
able to work at them with an objective of as high magnifying-power as HARTNACK's
No. 10 @ immersion.
