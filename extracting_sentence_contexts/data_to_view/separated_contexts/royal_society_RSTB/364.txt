These pup are certainly darker, as a whole, than the unblinded ones, but the
difference is not great enough to suggest the blinding as a necessary cause, while
other experiments (to follow) clearly show that it cannot have been effective in this
way. This concludes the experiments conducted upon the larvee of Series IL., kindly sent
me by Mr. Popz, The great mortality was due to the fact that the larvee were sent
very young, and were thus brought up for nearly the whole period of larval life in
unnatural conditions. In the following experiments I made use of larvae which were
fuund in various localities near Oxford, and which were allowed to remain upon the
nettle-bed until they were nearly mature. In this way I secured a very high
percentage of pup.
