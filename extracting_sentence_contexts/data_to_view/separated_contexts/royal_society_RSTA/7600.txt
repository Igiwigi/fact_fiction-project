STATISTICAL ESTIMATION 373

It is known (Neyman and Pearson, 1933) that in such a case, whatever the sample
point E’ within the region A (6’), then for any 0,

At any point, E”, outside A (6’)

(106)

Owing to the continuity of the probability law p (E|®) we shall have at any point

« E’” on the boundary of A (6’,)

é and this inequality must hold good at any point E’ within A (6’) and for any value
Gof Ab. It follows that

Pat any point E’ within A (0’). In fact, if the expression in the left-hand side of
(111) were not zero, then, owing to the continuity of f’ (E|0), for sufficiently small
values of A0, the expression in brackets in (110) would not be zero and would have
a constant sign. As A@ may be both positive and negative, the inequality ( 110)
would not be satisfied. Using the inequality (106) holding good at any point
outside A (0’) and repeating the above argument, we could easily find that (111)
must hold good also outside A (6’) and therefore in the whole sample space Ww.
