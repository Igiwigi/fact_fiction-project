Exvy. XIII. Having made a small rectangular box, I divided it into three com-
partments by diaphragms of bladder, as in fig. 10, in which A,B, C are the
three chambers. Platina poles were introduced into the extreme chambers,
and the box nearly filled with common water. The copper wires w, w' being
connected with the ends of a powerful battery, the water was rapidly decom-
posed through the moist bladder. After decomposition had gone on for eight
or ten minutes, the temperature of the water in the three cells was examined,
when it was found that the temperature of the water in each of the cells had
risen during the experiment, that the temperature of the water at the positive
pole had risen several degrees higher than that in the negative cell ; but what
seemed most remarkable was the fact that the water in the middle cell had
risen seyeral degrees higher than the water in the positive or hottest chamber.
The cause of this curious result s0on presented itself.

The general rise of temperature in the conducting fluid is undoubtedly
caused by the same agency which raises the temperature of a metallic wire
performing the same office as the fluid. The difference of temperature in the
extreme cells depends on the specific heats of the gases disengaged. The
specific heat of oxygen is nearly the same as that of hydrogen. But there
being twice as much hydrogen given off at the negative pole as oxygen at the
