We
introduce the mapping Â£; : 2; > Qj, which assigns to (x, v) the centre of the Larmor circle passing


through (x, v) with a given orientation. Moreover, for the function ; we define the function F; :
Qi, > Rby the rule

F,o Lj = Qj. It then follows from Theorem 1.2 of [19] that the functions F; are, in fact, polynomials. Moreover, as @; are integrals of the two-sided billiard, we have

Fy(P1) =F2(Q2) and F(P2) = Fi(Qi). (5.4)

Remark 5.8. It follows from (5.4) that we may assume without loss of generality that F) = F2 =:
F.
