We now introduce four undetermined Lagrangian multiplying functions, two scalar
quantities %, and ¢,, and two vector quantities A, and A,, it is thus the variation of

- that is to be made null, afterwards determining the functions ¢,, @», A), A, to satisfy
the restrictions which necessitated their introduction. The variation can now be
affected in the usual way, and the condition that it vanishes leads to the following

vector potentials ; in fact from the third we have

Curl A, = grad @,+ . ed

so that A, is the vector potential and then ¢, is the scalar potential. The fourth equation thus determines the usual expression for the reaction forces on
the moving electron ; the fifth equation determines similarly the force on the moving
magnetic pole in the form
