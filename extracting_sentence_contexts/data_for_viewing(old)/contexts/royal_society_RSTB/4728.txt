difficulties it can only be replied, in the first place, that the treatment used in
separating the surface layer, or “ Em«ailschicht,” as it was called by BrepERMANN,
from the rest of the wing-case, is very violent, and may modify the appearance of
the transmission colours. To the second objection, it may be pointed out that the
very slight modification due to polishing, whatever this may be, can change the
colour from gold or green to red, so that some similar modification may cause the

diversity of colouring noticed on the surface. In fact, the colours may be due to
several organic films, giving different surface colours, though what the nature of these
films may be it is difficult to say. The only thing like them that is known is a thick
layer of chitin in certain Tortoise Beetles (see p. 65), which appears a shining gold,
when moistened, at whatever depth the surface is exposed. A slight modification
of this chitin might easily produce a red or a green colour instead of gold.

Finally, on morphological grounds, it is easier to conceive of the development
of a layer of ‘ Schillerstoff” than a periodic structure. Schulze* has shown that
the surface layer of the Stag Beetle (Lucanus cervus, Linn.) is not formed
gradually from the hypodermal cells, as in the case of skin or scales, but is due
to a fluid secreted from special glandular cells, which is ejected upon the surface
of the wing at a late period in pupal development, where it rapidly hardens.
