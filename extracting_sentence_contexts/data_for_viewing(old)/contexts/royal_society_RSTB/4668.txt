necessary. The sections of the adjacent margin of the fin, and in fact a naked eye
examination, shows this margin to be occupied by a special development of the
epidermis, which appears as a narrow, glistening, white band. The sections show
this to be produced by the splitting of the anterior margin by two deep longitudinal
grooves which contain a mass of epithelium, containing large vacuoles, and covered
by glistening patches of coagulated secretion.

Each groove faces the margin of the spine, and when the fin closes down, and the
spine presses down on to the closed fin, each dentate margin fits into a recess formed
by the grooves, and a channel is produced along which the secretion from the
glandular structure of the recess would percolate along the dentate margin.

It is an interesting fact to note that the least specialised C. affinis, that is to say,
least specialised as regards the absence of an anterior keel, which would appear to be
the forerunner of a dentate margin, and the lesser specialised C. monstrosa, with a
keel which is not armed, should be the surviving members of this order, while the
Jurassic Myriacanthus should have possessed the more highly developed spine with
the three dentate margins, just as the recent Callorhynchus.

V. Heap SpPrvnes oF THE PLEURACANTHID‚Äù.

Dr. Smrra-Woopwarp has demonstrated to me the head spines of various members
of the family of Pleuracanthide, which are hollow, and may be rounded or antero-
laterally compressed, and bear a double longitudinal series of recurved denticles.
