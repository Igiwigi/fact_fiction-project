The larvae frequently turned on their sides within the mucous tubes which they rapidly
secreted around themselves. In this position a lateral view of various parts of the body was

obtained and long, flexible, very delicate, non-motile cilia could be seen protruding from
the dorsal and latero-dorsal regions of the trunk, and along the entire length of the tail.
They were 25 to 30, in length and extremely fine. Their extremities were in almost
continuous contact with the mucous tube, at which point of contact they flexed and could
be seen to trail along as the larva progressed. The slightest pressure on this mucous tube
resulted in a rapid withdrawal of the larva from that portion of the tube which was sub-
jected to the pressure. From this observation, and the fact that these cilia were non-motile,
but of such a length as to be near or in contact with the burrow walls, it was concluded
that they had a tactile function (figures 184 and 22a).

The tail was smaller in proportion to the body length in older larvae, but was still
approximately equal to one-quarter the length of the body in larvae with five pairs of gill
pores. Occasionally larvae with four pairs of gill pores were found where the tail was very
much reduced. Presumably complete degeneration was effected when the larva had seven
or eight pairs of gill pores, as recorded by Bateson (1885) for S. kowalevskyi.
