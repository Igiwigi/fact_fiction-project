9. If these propositions are justified, it remains a question for later enquiry as
to whether the men who made the Sub-Crag implements were of greater antiquity
than those who made the implements of the high plateau gravels of Kent or than
those recognised by some archeologists as the makers of roughly chipped flints
found in other localities, but not hitherto generally admitted as of human
workmanship.

10. In any case, the implements from the Sub-Crag beds in East Anglia are of a
special and very distinct type, and cannot be associated with any of those known
from any other locality.

| Postscript, February 15, 1912.—Whilst this memoir has been in the press, two
important facts bearing on the history of the Icenian industry have come to light,
which should be mentioned here, however briefly. The. first is the diseoyery by
Mr. Epwarp Heron-A.en of worked flints, resembling some of those found in the
Sub-Crag deposit, in a gravel of undetermined age resting on Eocene clay, upon the
seashore of Selsea Bill, Sussex. One of these is a very large pointed rostro-carinate
implement measuring 8 inches in length and 54 inches at its broader end, and
weighing 5 lbs. 9 oz. It has the characteristic beak, dorsal keel (shaped by six
well-marked longitudinal flakings), and a flat ventral surface. It is broader and
heavier than any of the Icenian “eagle’s beaks.” Little of the original cortex is left ;
the worked surface is nearly black, scratched here and there by glacial action and a
little stained by iron. The edges of fracture are smooth to the touch, not sharp.
Another specimen is a very large flint hammer-stone, of the shape of a four-sided
pyramid, closely similar to that from Suffolk drawn in figs. 25 and 26 of the
