Z 2nd. That the distortion of fossils, in any plane of bedding, depends on the angle
Sade with the plane of cleavage, by the plane of bedding considered ; increasing with
Sat angle, according to a law, which I have defined in the paper itself. E During the course of the past summer (1857), T was enabled to study the physical
cture of the Old Red Sandstone conglomerate of the county of Waterford ; a rock
Sminently unsuited to the production of cleayage, or indeed, any other phenomena, by
Be influence of polar forces; and, in the course of my observations, I arrived at facts
hich appear to me to be inexplicable on any other than a mechanical theory. As the
themselves are worthy of record, whatever opinion may be formed of the inferences
have deduced from them, and as the observations on which they depend (345) are more
numerous than usnal, and, as I believe, carefully made, I have felt myself justified in
bringing them under the notice of the Royal Society, and thus placing them on record. The Old Red Sandstone conglomerate of the South-east of the county of Waterford
extends in an E.N.E. and W.S.W. direction, from Creadan Head, Waterford Harbour,
to Brownstown Head, east of Tramore Bay, a distance of 74 miles; and in a perpen-
dicular direction, its greatest breadth is about 34 miles.
