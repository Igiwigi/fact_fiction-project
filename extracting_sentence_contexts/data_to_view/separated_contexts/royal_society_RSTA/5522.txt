This value,
which is associated with the asymmetry of the whole rate peak, points to highly correlated ion
dynamics in Al-LLZO. Long-range ion transport in the two compounds, as is seen by spin-lock
NMR, is governed by activation energies of 0.52 eV and 0.35 eV [48,49,53]. The fact that the rate
peaks appear at almost the same Tmax shows that the pre-factor of the corresponding Arrhenius
relation of Al-LLZO is much lower than that in the structurally ordered form of Li7La3Zr2O 2
[54]. In figure 5, we also compare the so-called 7Li NMR motional narrowing curve of tetragonal
LLZO with those of some of its cubic variants for which Zr is replaced by Ta or Mo [54]. Ga-
stabilized LLZO crystallizes in an acentric cubic modification of LLZO and shows even higher

an inter-ring process that enables long-range ion transport. (b) The corresponding ’Li NMR relaxation rates in comparison with
