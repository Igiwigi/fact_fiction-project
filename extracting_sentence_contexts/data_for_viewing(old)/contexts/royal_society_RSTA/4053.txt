Some argue that the fact that the Higgs boson was found to have a mass below 135 GeV should : Sg

SUSY also has other attractive features: it provides a route to grand unification of strong,
electromagnetic and weak forces at a scale of about 10'° GeV and an escape from too rapid a
proton decay. In some scenarios, it also generates a candidate particle for dark matter. Dark matter
is weakly and gravitationally interacting matter with no electromagnetic or strong interactions.
These are the properties carried by the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in models that
conserve a quantum number called R-parity where R = (—1)5®—)+?5 and S, B and L are spin,
baryon number and lepton number, respectively. Hence, arises the question: Is dark matter
supersymmetric in nature?
