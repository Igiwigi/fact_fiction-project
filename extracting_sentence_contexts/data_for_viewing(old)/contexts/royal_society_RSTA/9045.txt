while an important arrangement was made. I have referred to Sir ARTHUR RijckERâ€™s
wish that the stations should be permanently marked and the azimuths of suitable
marks determined once for all. The Director-General of the Ordnance Survey, South-
ampton, Colonel (now Sir Cuartes) C. F. Cross, K.B.E., C.B., was approached on
the matter, and as a result the O.S.O. undertook to mark permanently the stations
and determine the azimuth of suitable reference objects. The importance of this

cannot well be over-rated. Apart from the fact that it relieved me of the necessity
of finding my own azimuth by sun observation, it places the magnetic survey on a
permanent basis, so that in future surveys precisely the same points and reference
objects will be available, and the scheme is linked up with the triangulation of the
British Isles.

The general plan of campaign was worked out by Captain (now Colonel) Wrvrrr-
norHaM, D.S.O., Captain (now Major) Henrtct, and myself. It was arranged that
parties from the O.8.O. should travel in advance to select, mark, and fix a suitable
point of observation and a suitable reference object for use. When a station had
been so determined, maps and descriptions to enable me to find the stations were
sent on.
