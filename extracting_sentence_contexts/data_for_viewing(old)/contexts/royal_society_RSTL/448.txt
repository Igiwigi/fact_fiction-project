require another, but which perhaps may be fairly considered as
nothing more than a consequence of the former, namely, that
the mutual attraction of the molecules situated upon these se-
condary faces, is more strong than that which exists in the
same way between those upon the primitive ones. This stronger
degree of attraction between the molecules on one of the faces
of a crystal than between those of the other, is already ad-
mitted ; so that it may rather be considered here, as giving rise
to an additional observation, than as affording matter for discus-
Sion. I am perfectly sensible of, and make no scruple'to allow,
every objection that may be made against this explanation, to
arrive at which, I have been obliged to make a supposition not
yet admitted ; but the fact itself exists, and seems naturally to
lead to the explanation I have given. I offer it, however, merely
as a hypothesis, which still requires the support of observation ;
and I shall only add, that it is not the first time that the study
of crystals has led me to form such an idea.

With respect to the cause which, notwithstanding the above- /
mentioned mode of crystallization, would still occasion the frac-
