modendra of BRONGNIART, are but different species of one group, if they represent more,
in some instances, than different ages of the same species.

The structure of the woody zone is unquestionably exogenousF. The arrangement of
its vessels and medullary rays, its mode of growth, and that of its a&rial branches all
demonstrate the truth of my conclusions on this point. But the bark is the cellular
covering of a Cryptogam. Whichever of the verticillate-leaved plants of the Coal-mea-
sures constituted its foliage, they are all equally cryptogamic. My strcbilus, the Cala-
mitean character of which it is impossible to doubt, is filled with round spores that
are unmistakably Cryptogamic. The structure of the roots affords clear evidence that
they were not the woody prolongations of the main axis seen in the roots of the Gymno-
spermous Conifers, but adventitious appendages of the Cryptogamic type. All these
facts point to one conclusion, viz. that the Calamites were all Cryptogamic plants, but.
that they possessed a much higher organization than is seen in any of the Cryptogams
living at the present day. Some writers affirm that the living Isoetacee exhibit an
exogenous stem. Since I haye had the opportunity of studying them for myself, I must
confess T have failed to trace the evidence of the alleged exogenous growth; but the
authority of HoreisvER and other botanists is sufficient to show that it exists; in
the Calamites the proofs of 8nch growth are incontrovertible.

There is no question that the only living plants with which Calamites can be com-
pared are the Equisetacewe, with which Mr. Carroraers has unhesitatingly united them ;
