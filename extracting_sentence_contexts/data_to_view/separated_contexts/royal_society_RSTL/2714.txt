experiments during the last year, which will prevent my giving you such full details
of some of the results as I could have desired, although I have been careful to repeat
all those in which measures are of fundamental importance. I hall first beg to direct your attention to an arrangement which I purpose to
distinguish by the name of the Dissected Battery ; it has answered an analogous
purpose to me of one of those optical instruments, by looking through which a mul-
titude of confused lines assume a regular disposition ; and many detached facts, well
known before, have become clearer and of new importance, from their connexion and
comparison with each other by its means. The battery consists of ten glass cells, a
section of one of which is represented in the accompanying figures.

(a, b, cd), Plate VIIL. fig. 1. is a foot of solid glass, containing a cavity (e, f, g, k),
the upper part of which is fitted with a stopper (g,/). Through this stopper the stems
of the two plates (7, j, k, 1, m,n) pass into the lower part of the cavity, which is divided
into two cells by the partition (0, p), and each of which contains mercury, into which
the wires respectively dip.
