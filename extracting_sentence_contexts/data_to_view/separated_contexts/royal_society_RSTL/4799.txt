Diallyl-urea (Sinapoline). When cyanate of allyl is heated with water, it assumes a buttery consistence and ulti-
mately solidifies entirely. The product obtained under these cireumstances possesses all
the properties of sinapoline, which, as is known, is formed by the action of hydrated
protoxide of lead upon mustard oil, and is in fact diallyl-urea. The properties of this
substance presenting complete identity with those of sinapoline, and its mode of for-
mation being perfectly similar to that of dimethyl- and diethyl-urea, we have not
thought it necessary to submit it to analysis. This body is likewise formed when
cyanate of allyl is boiled with an aqueous solution of potassa, with the view of trans
forming it, after the manner of ordinary cyanic ether, into an alkaline carbonate and an
ammonia-base.
