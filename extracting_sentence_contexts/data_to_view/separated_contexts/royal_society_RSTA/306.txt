The differential equation at the point 0
involves the fictitious points 1 and 2, and expressions for the values at these points must
therefore be obtained in terms of internal points and the given boundary conditions. There
are two obvious possibilities, neither of which is completely satisfactory. FicureE 7

First, normals can be drawn from the fictitious points (Fox 1944) and the boundary con-
dition satisfied at the points where these normals cut the boundary. In figure 7, for example,
the normal from 1 cuts the boundary at B, and internal mesh lines at points marked with
a cross. Formulae can therefore be established for the value at 1 in terms of the normal
derivative at B (and the functional value at B if required), and values at the crossed points.
