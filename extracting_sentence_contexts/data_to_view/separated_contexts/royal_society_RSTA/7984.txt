Fig. 5. If the displacement of the tooth is a pure translation, we cannot choose the origin
at the centre of rotation, which is at infinity. Jt is convenient to choose the origin
temporarily at the centre of mass of the fictitious wire, so that by (70)

Hence we may state the result :

Tueorem VI.—If. in the two-dimensional problem, the tooth receives a pure translation,
the points of maximum and minimum pressure occur at the points where the membrane
is cut by a straight line, drawn parallel to the direction of the translation through the centre
of mass of the fictitious wire previously described. The pressure is a maximum or a
minimum according as the tooth approaches or recedes from the socket.
