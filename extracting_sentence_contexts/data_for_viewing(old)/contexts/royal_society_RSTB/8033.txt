conceivable that the forest elephant differs from the bush elephant in this respect. It
would seem more likely, however, that while it is usual, in the genus Loxodonta, for preg-
nancy to be preceded by a series of oestrous cycles, it is possible for the first oestrus after
an anoestrous period to be accompanied by ovulation and fertile mating, with the produc-
tion of sufficient luteal tissue to maintain the ensuing pregnancy.

It may be that multiple ovulation is preceded by a single ovulation in most cases, not
merely because the physiological mechanism takes some time to regain full activity, but
because multiple ovulation is only possible after a corpus luteum has previously been
functioning in one of the ovaries. That the corpus luteum may have this positive effect is
suggested by the finding of Marden (personal communication) that multiple ovulation
can be experimentally induced in the calf only if a single corpus luteum has previously
been functional, and by the fact that, in the cow, experimental induction of multiple
ovulation was most successful when a waning corpus luteum was present in the ovary, or
when progesterone was injected in the case of an animal from which the corpus luteum had
been removed (Rowson 1951). Further evidence that progesterone plays a part in the
initiation of oestrus is given by Robinson (1952).

The ovaries during pregnancy

The thirty-one pregnant animals which were encountered had, in every case, a foetus

in utero. The foetuses ranged in weight from about 12 g to about 120 kg, and in overall
