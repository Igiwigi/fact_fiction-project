Varandas et al. [167] were the first to demonstrate the numerical validity of such sign-reversal
criterion for LiNaK by following the variation of the dominant coefficients in the ground-state
wave function along a path that encircles the crossing point [167]. We have followed the same
approach with state-averaged FVCAS/AVTZ calculations. The results are shown in figure 7.

As first pointed out by Zwanziger & Grant [159], for SLP JT molecules the additional three
symmetry-equivalent C2, seams may prevent the associated electronic wave function of changing
sign when transported around a loop enclosing the four Cis. In other words, the net geometric
phase (GP) effect [164-166] is largely suppressed. Consider first the case in which a circular
path is chosen such that p < p9(Q1) (figure 7a). In this case, only one Ci (the central one) is
enclosed and the adiabatic wave function changes sign along this loop, as seen in figure 7a for
the 1!’ and 214’ electronic states. In fact, a similar sign change is expected when only one of the
three equivalent degeneracies of C2, symmetry is encircled (figure 7b). Conversely, as figure 7c
