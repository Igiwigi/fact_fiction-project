The work of Prof. L. Douio and of Mr. BH. L. Grin, and the present speaker, has made
it certain that the most primitive known Dipnoan is the Middle Old Red Sandstone fish,
Dipterus valenciennesi, and that this fish presents so many resemblances in structure
to the contemporary Osteolepids as to show that the two groujs arose from a common
ancestor not much earlier in date.

It is from this hypothetical fish that I believe the Amphibia to have arisen. The
evidence on which this view is founded is most conveniently presented by a comparison
of the structures of the skeleton, of the body form and movements, and of the mode
of life, in an Osteolepid and an Embolomerous amphibian. In order to secure the
materials for such a comparison I have been forced to investigate the Osteolepid structure
anew, and am able to add very many new and striking facts to our knowledge of the
osteology of that group.

The Osteolepids resemble the Embolomeri in having a brain case which in all is well
ossified, although in the Upper Devonian Eusthenopteron and the Carboniferous Mega-
lichthys it is much less massive than in the Middle Devonian Osteolepis. This brain
â€˜case is not divided into separate bones in any known specimens, but the different regions
are easily recognised.

The basioccipital forms a large circular condyle deeply pitted or perforated by the
notochord. The exoccipitals reach up to a well-developed supraoccipital, which in
Osteolepis stretches forward over the whole of the hind brain, as it does in Embolomeri.
The otic capsule forms a paroccipital process which supports the tabular, and may or
