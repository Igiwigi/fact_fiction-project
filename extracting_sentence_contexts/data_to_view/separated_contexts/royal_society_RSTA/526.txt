It should be emphasized that excited HO2(A’) molecules can also form via the process of
electronic-electronic exchange, HO2(A”) + O2(a! Ag) = HO2(A’) + O2(X3E  )- The rate constant
of this process was measured in [50] and was found to be rather high (approx. 3 x
10!° cm? mol~! s~!). Therefore, in the H2—O2 system with SDO addition, the excited HO2(A’)
molecules can form, and this fact requires a special analysis. Note that, in line with [50], the
rate coefficient of the HO2(A’) quenching channel HO2(A’) + M=HO>(A”) + M is as large as
approximately 10!2-10' cm mol~!s71.

(b) CO—0) system

One of the promising synthetic fuels is the synthesis gas consisting mostly of Hz and CO. The
analysis of the combustion enhancement of syngas in air due to the presence of SDO in the
syngas-air mixture was performed recently in [27].
