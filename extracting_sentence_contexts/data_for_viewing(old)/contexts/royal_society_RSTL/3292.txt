are generally exceedingly few in number and partially decayed, I feel convinced
that their preservation may be considered as a remarkable and not as an ordinary
cireumstance. After a longer interval of time, or under some slightly less favourable
conditions, all the gravel beds of Shropshire, which no one can doubt were accumu-
lated beneath the sea, would be as destitute of organic remains as those of Lochaber.
In some parts of South America I have found beds of gravel which did not contain
a fragment of hell, and yet on the bare surface, nearly perfect ones were strewed in
numbers. Mr. S$mrra describes* beds on the west coast of Scotland, and Mr. LyzuLFf
others in Sweden, undoubtedly of marine origin, but wholly destitute of organic
remains. On the coast of Forfarshire also Mr. LyzLL, as I am informed by him,
found shells in gravel beds extending to the height of between fifty and sixty feet; but
at greater altitudes similar beds occur which do not contain any: he has obseryed
the same kind of fact strikingly illustrated in Norway#. It is easy to imagine several

{ Mr. LyzLL has had the kindness to give me the following observations on this point.

*In the country surrounding the fiord of Christiania, especially between Christiania and Dramman, and be-
tween Dramman and Holmstrand in Norway, deposits of clay and sand rest in horizontal beds on the gneiss,
granite, porphyry, and other rocks. Large masses of this sand and clay reach in some places to elevations of
more than 600 feet above the level of the ea, and nearly fill many upland valleys; but it is only in those
patches which occur at the height of about 200 feet, and usually less than fifty feet above the sea, that shells
