4. Discussion

The MD simulations produced a relatively high density of Shockley partial dislocations forming
around stacking faults that form around some of the grain boundaries, as shown in figure 3.
The density of intragrain dislocations (mostly perfect and Frank type) are remarkably close to
the GND densities estimated in the rapid solidification PFC-AE simulations, as summarized in
table 3. These dislocation densities are 10-20 times larger than the listed experimentally measured
dislocation densities [20,6366]. As discussed more thoroughly in the Introduction section, there
are several sources of error in the experimental evaluation of dislocation densities that can,
to some extent, explain the discrepancy between the MD and PFC-AE simulations and the
experiments.

The discrepancy can be related to the fact that some dislocations can annihilate during cool-
down, and this cool-down is not simulated in this paper. Moreover, solidification velocities are
somewhat higher in the MD and PFC-AE simulations than in typical AM or melt spun conditions,
as indicated by the larger grain sizes in the experiments. Larger solidification velocities in the
simulations are likely to pronounce the formation of dislocations. It should be noted that in this
work, we did not perform a systematic investigation of solidification velocity versus dislocation
density; we did, however, demonstrate a qualitative difference between ‘intermediate quench’
and ‘large quench’ regimes. The ‘intermediate quench’ case was essentially free of intragrain
GNDs with an overall lower average GND density, while the ‘large quench’ case had significantly
higher GND densities, visible intragrain lattice rotation, and trapped microvoid and smaller
lattice defects.
