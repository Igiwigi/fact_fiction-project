complexity, derived from the ideas of algorithmic complexity of Kolmogorov &
Chaitin [70-72]. Given a structure, we might ask: what is the shortest algorithm
that will describe the observed complexity?

The trouble with making use of the concept of Kolmogorov complexity in
any application is that it is not a computable quantity; given a set of data, one
cannot, in general, obtain its Kolmogorov complexity. One cannot compute the
information content of a given sequence because it is not possible, in general, to
go backwards from the sequence to the algorithm that produced it. The nature
of the problem, which is a version of the Berry paradox, and is linked to Gédel’s
incompleteness theorem [73,74], becomes clear when one reasons that a sequence
of 100 digits may appear totally random—and so possess maximum Kolmogorov
complexity—but in fact be 100 consecutive digits taken from, say, 7, and so
possess considerably less complexity.

A further question concerning the algorithmic complexity of a physical
structure is: at what level of description? The algorithmic complexity is
expressible for an object encoded as a string of numbers, but that string
expressing the description of a system and its complexity depends on the level in
the hierarchy at which we choose to look at it. The level at which crystallographers
