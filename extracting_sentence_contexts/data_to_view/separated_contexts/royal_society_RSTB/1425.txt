The successive changes in structure which we find in a branch, as we trace ii
its base upwards, have already been described. The changes consist essentially
rapid increase in the diameter of the pith, and in the number of vascular b
surrounding it. These facts, which have been already demonstrated by the study of spe
showing structure, are exactly reproduced in those medullary casts which re
the pith-cavity of lateral branches. After the fundamental truth had been es a bhine
that the sandstone and other allied specimens, which were long believed to be
actual stems of Calamites, were merely inorganic casts of a central cavity fron
