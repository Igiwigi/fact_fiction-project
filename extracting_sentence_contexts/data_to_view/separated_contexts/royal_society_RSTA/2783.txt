First of all, as demonstrated by Korenaga [36], the method proposed by Belousova et al. [35] does
not produce an estimate on formation age distribution. There is no logical connection between
the formation age distribution and the mathematical operation conducted in their method, and
any ‘growth-curve-looking’ result from their method is better regarded as a procedural artefact. This fact was already hinted by one of the two synthetic tests conducted by Belousova et al. [35]
themselves (see section 5.2 of [36]) and was also alluded by Payne et al. [48]. Dhuime et al. [11]
incorporated oxygen isotope screening, but the core of the method remained the same in their
application. They also introduced an additional layer of confusion; they regarded their ‘growth
curve’ as an estimate on net crustal growth, not on the formation age distribution.
