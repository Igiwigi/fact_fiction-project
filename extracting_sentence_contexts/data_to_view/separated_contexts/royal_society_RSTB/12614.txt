GUN1 was not required for these changes; in

The fact that expression of NEPs is elevated in the fact, the efficiency of editing further increased for rpoCl
double mutants (figure 7c), but the expression of NEP- and further decreased for ndhB transcripts in the cue8 gun1
driven transcripts in their chloroplasts is not (figure 7b), double mutant (figure 9). Thus, we confirm that changes in
