274 MR. MACQUORN RANKINE ON AXES OF

18. Of Oblique Coordinates and Contraordinates.

As there are, in the relations between two systems of oblique coordinates, or
between a system of oblique coordinates and a system of rectangular coordinates,
six independent constants of transformation, it is possible, by referring the equation
of the Biquadratic Surface (19.) to Oblique Coordinates, to make the 8ix terms vanish
which contain the cubes of the coordinates,
