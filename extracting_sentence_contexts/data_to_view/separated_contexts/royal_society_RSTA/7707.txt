BOOKER ON PROPAGATION OF WAVE-PACKETS

when situated at that level. The actual path followed by the wave-packet still remains
to be investigated. There emerges from this interpretation of figs. 7 and 8 an interesting and important
fact concerning the critical electron density which must be attained in the ionosphere
in order to return a magneto-ionic component to the surface of the earth. It might be
thought that this critical electron density could be deduced by putting the angle of
refraction y equal to 47 in Snell’s Law as we did in (2) for the case when the earth’s
magnetic field is neglected. Since, from fig. 4, putting = 47 is equivalent to putting
q = 0, this method would imply that the critical electron densities of the magneto-ionic
components are given by the points D and F in fig. 7, that is, by the levels d and ¢ in
fig. 8.
