regions of the Wyre Forest. After reviewing in each case the results obtained by
previous workers I will add, where possible, such additional information as I have
been able to gather on these matters.

Detailed Geology.
(a) The Highley Regionâ€”

It has been known for more than a century that parallel outcrops of coals occur
near the Western boundary of this district. The Survey Map shows two such seams
extending from Glazeley southward to Billingsley, and two others, more to the West,
from Billingsley to Kinlet Knowl, and again further South at Baveney Wood. It
must not, however, be imagined that these are the outcrops of the same seams.
As a matter of fact these coals do not all belong to the same series of measures.
Those furthest to the North belong to the Sulphur Coal Measures, while the rest are
Sweet Coals.* According to JonEs,+ the Sweet Coals crop out only in the Western
portion of the field. Elsewhere they are always overlain unconformably by the
Sulphur Coal Series.

We will first examine a case where the Sulphur Coals are alone present, the Sweet
Coals apparently being absent. This lies in the Northern part of the region at
