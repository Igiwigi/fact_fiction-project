With ordinary liquids the inlet losses are due to a kinetic energy loss equal to approxi-
mately 1-4pv2, where p = density and v is the mean velocity, and a so-called Couette loss
equal to the pressure lost in a length of the pipe of the order of one diameter. In experiments
we performed with a great number of these liquids in a variety of pipes ranging from capil-
laries up to 2in. iron pipes, the inlet loss was always found to be far greater than that en-
countered with ordinary liquids of similar viscosities (see Wood, Nissan & Garner 1947). The
kinetic energy loss was found to be the same as for ordinary liquids, viz. 1-14pv°. However,
the Couette loss was as high as that encountered in a length of pipe equal to 100 diameters.
See figure 15, where n denotes the length of a pipe, in terms ofits diameter, which would have
caused the same pressure loss as that lost at the inlet of the pipe at the same value of v/D. For
ordinary liquids n is of the order of unity.

The second abnormality arises from the fact that inside the pipe ordinary liquids flow in
concentric laminae of increasing rates of shear. These liquids, on the present theories, would
tend to migrate across the stream tubes. As the migration is a function of é?~*, approximately,
with c<1 the abnormal effects will show more in the outer layers than in the inner layers.
Thus the liquid will appear to flow with a layer next to the pipe of higher viscosity than the
bulk viscosity. This, mathematically, is equivalent to the well-known slip phenomenon with
flow of suspension in pipes but with the slip having a negative sign with these special liquids.
In other words, for the same average shearing stress wider pipes will show higher rates of
