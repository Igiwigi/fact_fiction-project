Its amount is to a great extent independent of the
size of the pores ; though when the pores are of molecular dimensions it mainly arisés
from a bodily forcive on the contained filaments of fluid. This electric osmotic
pressure will then even hold good with respect to liquids which readily mix; for the
obliteration of the sharpness of the interface in the narrow tubes or pores of the
partition will take place very slowly, while the formule of this memoir for electric
tractions are precisely those which hold good for a gradual transition. This action is different from the one discovered by QuincKE and discussed by
von Hetmuourz,* forming in fact a further extension of the scope of the principle of

electrolytic dissociation, in which a stream of conducting fluid forced through a
porous non-conducting partition produces an electric current across it, and conversely
an electric current forced across the partition carries the fluid with it.
