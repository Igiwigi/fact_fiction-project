It

as no © pharyngo-hyal ” element ; nor has the Tadpole, at first ; its distal part, which
Zpecomes the © columella auris,” does nob appear in our Common Frog and Toad until
wo or three months after metamorphosis (se my 2nd Paper © On the Batrachian
Skull,” PP. 622-624)—a fact discovered by Professor HUxLEy. But the positzon of the

© epi-hyal ” region of the hyoid arch, and its continuity with the back of the pedicle and
FPterygoid, is only explicable by reference to transforming and transformed © Anura,”

The large broad © epi-cerato hyal” of the Tadpole is articulated to a speciol facet
by a special condyle below the ethmoid in the antorbital region, and it is only after
the swinging back, 80 to speak, of the quadrate region that the epi-hyal point is
carried under the exit of the facial (its own) nerve (se in Pseudis, © Batrachian Skull,”
Part IIT., Plates 11, 12); this position is a good landmark, and shows that the quadrate
of the Lamprey 8hould have been post-orbital. The epi-cerato hyal (Plate 18, fig. 5, hy., c.hy.; and Plate 19, figs. 1-3, e.hy.) grows
out from the back of the pedicle and pterygoid (pd., pg.)
