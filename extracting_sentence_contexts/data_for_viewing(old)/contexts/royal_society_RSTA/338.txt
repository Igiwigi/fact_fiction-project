of subjects [29]. In that context, k is the index of the subject.

There are basically two approaches to the group ICA problem. One is the approach already
described in §4: We do ICA separately on each data matrix and then combine the results, which
further gives us the opportunity to test the significance of the components. The second approach,
which we consider in this section, is to estimate some ‘average’ decomposition. For example, if
we assume that the mixing matrices are approximately the same, then we can try to estimate the
average mixing matrix.

The first, fundamental question in analysis of such three-way data is whether the three-way
structure can be simply transformed into an ordinary two-way structure without losing too much
information. In other words, can we just ‘collapse’ the data into an ordinary matrix and analyse
it with ICA, or do we need special methods? In fact, in many cases where ICA is applied, it does
not seem to be necessary to construct special methods for analysis of three-way data: it seems to
be enough to transform the data into a single matrix for a useful application of ICA.


Denote by X; the data matrix obtained from the kth condition (or subject). Its rows are the
different variables i, and the columns different observations t. Thus, each X, is a matrix that we
could input to an ICA algorithm, which would model it as X; = AxSx.

Fundamentally, we can construct two different ‘total’ data matrices that contain all the X;, i.e.
all the three-way data. We can concatenate the X; either column-wise or row-wise, obtaining,
respectively, the matrices 1 and 2,
