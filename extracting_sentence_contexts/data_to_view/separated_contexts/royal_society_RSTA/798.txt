All the photographs were taken by the method of alternate exposure, ¢.g.,
Cd 2 min, Kr 2 min, Cd 2 min, . . ., and before and after each comparison a
short exposure of krypton was taken on a different part of the plate, for detecting
any change that might occur in the optical length of the étalon during the comparison. The change was rarely found (even with the longest étalon) to exceed a few
thousandths of a fringe during a comparison ; in fact, it was nearly always less than
the setting errors on the fringes. For example, in a series of comparisons using the
10 cm étalon, the value of e for the cadmium line was found to be 0-424, 0-416, and
0-408, although a period of about halfan hour elapsed between successive exposures. The change during the exposure must have been considerably less than this, probably
of the order of 0-003 of a fringe, which is slightly more than 1 in 100,000,000.
