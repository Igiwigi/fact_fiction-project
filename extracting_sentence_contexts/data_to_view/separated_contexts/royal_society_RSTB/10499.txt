Survey results revealed an average of 2.2 disease incidents during this period, which ranged between zero and
six. Based on the last three disease incidents at a household level, we found that the average direct costs spent on treatment
were 306 KSH, but could be as high as 5300 KSH, with medicine usually constituting the bulk of these costs (table 3). The


poverty-promoting aspect of disease is demonstrated by the fact that a family member could lose up to 10 days of work, or up
to 7 days of school. Table 3. Direct and indirect costs incurred as a result of human illness among pastoralist households in Kenya.

mean (range) proportion of total costs (range) (%)
medicine costs (KSH) 155 (0—2500) 47.6 (0-100)
travel costs (KSH) 83 (0-3000) 24.7 (0-100)
other costs (KSH) 68 (0—2000) 27.7 (0-100)
total costs (KSH) 306 (0-5300)
days away from work 1.1 (0-10)
days away from school 1.2 (0-7)

As families reported more than two incidents of disease in the family over the last two weeks, and an average cost of 306
KSH per disease incident, an average family could experience costs around 17 000 KSH per year, not including the indirect
costs of lost incomes.
