a variety of ingredients, cannot be specified in a manner analogous to that for crystal
structures. We are led, therefore, to consider the propellant as an entity with an
intrinsic specific heat, and to state the amount of heat required to raise the temperature
of the propellant per unit mass as the product of the specific heat into the temperature
increase. If then in time dé an amount dx be burnt away along the normal to the
surface of the propellant grain, the quantity of heat required per unit area to raise the
temperature of the portion of the propellant affected from the initial temperature T,
to the touch-off temperature T; is given by

dx. (T; —T,) 8,

where o is the specific heat of the solid propellant and 8 is the density. The justification
for the acceptance of the constancy of T, during the combustion rests in the fact that
colloidal propellants are extremely bad conductors of heat, and, further, that when
unconsumed pieces of propellant are recovered after gun firing no difference from
standard can be detected in their chemical and physical properties. During the process
of combustion, therefore, conditions are repeated from layer to layer, precisely as if
there had been no preliminary combustion of intervening layers. Hach layer may be

regarded as possessing the temperature T,, and requiring the temperature T, for

decomposition at the surface. T; in consequence is invariant during the explosion,
having a value peculiar to the propellant composition under the special conditions.
We have previously shown* that, within the limits of measurement, no systematic
difference is observable in the closed vessel between total combustion times for corre-
