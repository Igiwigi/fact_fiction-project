coelous condition characteristic of the corresponding
region of the Zygophiurid ossicle.

Dertace and Hirovarp (3) speak as follows of the
unpaired dorsal prominence and the unpaired ventral
socket of the anterior or proximal face of the Zygo-
phiurid ossicle :—‘ Cette fossette et cette téte sont
formées en réalité de deux demi-fossettes et deux demi-
tétes rapprochées, condition nécessitée par le fait que la
vertebre est formée de la soudure de deux pitces symétri-
ques.” It does not, of course, follow that the “demi-
tétes” were at one time separated by an interval, and
were, in fact, a pair of prominences, though this may
have been the case. In Ophioderma egertont from the
Lias the two “demi-tétes” are clearly recognisable Text-ric. 5.—Horizontal Sec-
(Plate 9, fig. 3). In this connection, Acrura squamosa tions through a Mextebra of
Pic. from the Trias proved to be of remarkable and peer deters Ea $0 show

the nature of the joint and in
unexpected interest. Acrura has long been regarded particular the processes a, a.
as possessing a structure resembling in all essentials
that of modern Ophiurids, and a casual glance over the series of photographs of
successive grindings might seem to confirm this view, but there is a striking
difference in the dorsal sections. Here paired anterior processes forming a series of
