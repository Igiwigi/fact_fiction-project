rows of extremely minute puncta (fig. 20); these, however, are not the apertures of pas-
Sages through the shell, as might not unnaturally be supposed; but are, like the punc-
tations of Orbiculing (© 88), mere depressions of its surface,—as I have ascertained by
the careful examination of very thin sections. Tt is remarkable that the plication of
the shell is sometimes wanting, though the punctations may still present themselves in
rows, as Shown in fig. 23; whilst in other cases, not only are the plicz deficient, but the
punctations are distributed uniformly over the entire surface, as shown in fig. 24. That

these variations are not indicative of any specific difference, is at once proved by the
fact that the shells which exhibit them in one part, present the ordinary character of
surface in another. In Plate I. fig. 22 is shown a case in which similar punctations
present themselyes on the septum closing the mouth of the shell of a Dendritina, which,
as will presently appear, is only a modified Peneroplis.

125. The septum which closes the mouth of the shell is perforated by numerons
isolated pores, arranged in a single linear series (Plate I. fig. 2, Plate IT. fig. 1); the
number of these pores depends upon the length of the septal plane (a very convenient
term which I adopt from Professor WILLIAMSON), and thus it usually increases with
the age of the individual, each chamber opening externally by a larger number of pores
than did that which preceded it. The typical form of these pores seems to be circular,
though they are apt to present various departures from that shape ; they usually lie in
a 8ort of furrow, formed by the projection of the lateral borders of the mouth somewhat
