“Secondary thickening ” is, on the other hand, suitable as a general term implying
the continued growth in thickness characteristic of the first and second cycles of
septa,* and in respectively less degree of other cycles, But it may not be taken as
meaning any difference in the microscopic calcareous laminze of the septum.

calycinal section. Its interest is in the fact that, although its thickness is only
‘05 millim., the distance from one centre of calcification (c.c.) to the next is ‘08 millim.,
exactly the same as we have already observed in the thickest septa. We may
deduce, therefore, that in Mussa there is a minimum distance of ‘08 millim. between
one trabecular axis and the next, irrespective of the particular “order” to which a
septum belongs.

or Mussa.

T have not thought it necessary to repeat the details of microscopic structure in
Mussa, in so far as they coincide with those of Galaxea (ef. fig. 14). In both, the
growth-lamella is formed by the coalescence of calcified calicoblasts, about ‘003 millim.
