This I have verified by means of integrals taken round double loop contours of
PocHHAMMER’S type.

VI. It is possible to take such a linear combination of the two solutions

iFi{e;p;e} and ,F,{a—p+1;2—p;x} a”
as will admit all round « = the single asymptotic expansion
(—«)"F, {a, l—p+a;—1/7}. By considering the contour integral

1 e = opt e
a [P(-9 rca p—s) TP (a+s) at ds
we can, in fact, prove that, when |arg «| < 37/2,
TP (a)P(1—p).F {43 p30} +0 (a+1—p) UT (p—1) 2° iF, fa—pt1 52—p; x}
= aT (a) (1+a—p).F,{4, 1+a—p; --1/r}. This theorem is equivalent to two different results when %(7)<0, By this means
we can obtain ITT. anew.
