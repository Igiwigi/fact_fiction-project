node-dating approach along the branch leading to Lorisi-
formes (Ofolemur and Nycticebus; electronic supplementary
material, figure S6). Lorisiformes are constrained by a lower
calibration at 37 Myr (based on the Saharagalago fossil), and
the crown age of this group is inferred to be very close to this
lower bound (between 37 and 42 Myr). In the tip-dating analy-
sis, the age of Lorisiformes is estimated to be much younger
(between 26 and 32 Myr), and correlatively, the rate deviation
detected along the stem branch leading to Lorisiformes is
much milder than in node-dating context. There are two pos-
sible interpretations of this particular observation. On the one
hand, the fossil calibration could be correct, and the rate shift
inferred on that branch could be real. The fact that Lorisiformes
are among the smallest- and shortest-lived primates suggests at
first sight that this particular rate deviation could correspond to
acase where a rapid shift has indeed occurred in the life-history
strategy, leading to a shorter generation time. However, in that
case, the higher substitution rate should have been maintained
over the subsequent branches, within Lorisiformes. Instead,
what is observed here is a high rate only along the basal
branch of the group (electronic supplementary material,
figure S4). Thus, alternatively, the rate shift could be an artefact
owing to incorrect calibration. In favour of this interpretation,
the placement of the Saharagalago reference fossil as a crown
Lorisiformes [44], which defines the lower bound at 37 Myr,
