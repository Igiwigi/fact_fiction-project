Establishing the physical nature of identical particle entanglement is, therefore, crucial :
to identifying its role as a resource for quantum information and communication processing [4
[11,17,22,35-42]. 73

Recently, a different approach has been introduced [32] which describes the quantum states of 2S

identical particles without introducing unobservable labels. This non-standard approach (NSA), iS
so far limited to two identical particles, exhibits peculiar advantages from both the conceptual and ,
practical viewpoints, and is linked in particular to the treatment of their quantum correlations. In fact, from the beginning it avoids the existence of entanglement due to unobservable labels. The particle-based approach to identical particles uses, for quantifying the entanglement in these
systems, the same well-established notions and tools commonly employed for non-identical
particle systems, such as the basis-independent partial trace and von Neumann entropy. In
this sense, the particle-based approach differs from other known approaches and is closer to
the typical scenario of quantum information theory.
