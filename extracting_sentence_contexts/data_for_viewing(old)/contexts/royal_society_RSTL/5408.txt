For when a quantity of the eleCtric fluid js forced into
the apparatus, which ſupports the two balls, we ſhould
from its elaſtic principle, expe” it'to_paſs ont/again
immediately : whereas the fact is, that it paſſes out by
flow degrees; and takes a conſiderable time in eya-
cuating the apparatus effeCtually. Some power there-
fore' muſt hinder the fluid, at leaſt, in fome meaſure,
from eſcaping : and that power muſt be exerted at, or
near, 'the ſurface of the body.

To fay it is detained by an attra&tion of the body,
will not anſwer the purpoſe : for the power which is
ſuppoſed to draw the fluid into it, muſt certainly be
ſufficient to hinder it from paſſing out. Now by the
experiment, the fluid does paſs out, though flowly :
this power therefore, which reſiſts its paſſing out, can
