the cytoblasts free. However, when the fetal tissne is treated with water, there is a
period just before the fibres break up when they become much more transparent,
and the nuclei may be seen in their interior clustered together irregularly, and in
absolute contact ; this fact, that the nuclei are in actual contact, is a most important
one, for it proves very conelusively that they do not occupy the interior of cells. T
have often earnestly sought for, but never yet detected, the appearance 80 generally
figured in books of a muscular fibre as a string of nucleated cells; on the contrary,
the nuclei, when they approach each other, are free cytoblasts, and they may he clearly
seen to be in absolute contact.

The nucleated cells which are seen in the blastema are no more concerned in the
formation of muscular fibre than are the blood-cells. With regard to their purpose,
it is to be observed that they are chiefly found in the layer of tissue investing the
embryo, and if this exterior layer be carefully scraped off from the back of the embryo,
and a portion of tissue be examined below the surface, nucleated cells, as compared
with free cytoblasts, will be extremely rare.
