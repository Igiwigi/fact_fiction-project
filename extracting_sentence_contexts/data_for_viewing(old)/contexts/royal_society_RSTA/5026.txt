at scales greater than the Kolmogorov length (v°/e)!/4, Once again, the upper bound (7.2) is much
larger than Richardson’s prediction and, at times longer than trans, the dispersion of field lines is
independent of resistivity.

(b) Making Goldreich—Sridhar model self-consistent

Historically, a lot of reconnection research was aimed to obtain the Holy Grail number of
reconnection speed, which on the basis of solar flare observations was determined to be 0.1Vq.
This reconnection speed has been recently claimed to be attained in a number of plasma
simulations [16]. We claim, however, that to make any model of strong turbulence self-consistent
the velocity of 0.1V, is insufficient. Below we show this for the GS95 model by reproducing
the arguments in LV99. Magnetic reconnection is required for free mixing of magnetic field lines,
which is a part of the GS95 picture of turbulence. In fact, the critical balance that is the cornerstone
of the GS95 model can be derived from the equality of times for mixing of magnetic field lines
perpendicular to the local direction of magnetic field and the period of the Alfvén wave that this

Figure 11. (a) Turbulent splitting of a magnetic field line. An initial magnetic field line in black is decorated with plasma
elements, which are allowed to move with the fluid velocity. The magnetic field lines that thread these plasma elements at
the later time are drastically different, effectively ‘splitting’ the original line. (b) Reconnection event within three-dimensional-
driven turbulence. The structure of the event corresponds to the LV99 picture and is consistent with reconnection events studied
in solar wind.
