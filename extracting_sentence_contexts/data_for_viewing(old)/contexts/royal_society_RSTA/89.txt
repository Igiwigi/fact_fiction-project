Besides the mean-field limit of (1.9) to (1.11) for N— +00, we shall simultaneously prove
in theorem 5.3 a I’-convergence result, implying that the optimal controls ux, of the finite-
dimensional optimal control problems (1.9)-(1.10) converge weakly in L1((0, T],U) for N > +00
to optimal controls u*, which are minimal solutions of

This is actually an existence result of solutions for the infinite-dimensional optimal control
problem (1.11)-(1.12). Different from the one proposed in [10] though, this model retains the
controls only on a finite and small group of agents, despite the fact that the entire population
can be very large (here modelled by the limit N — +00). Hence, by the stratagem of dividing the
populations in two groups and allowing only one of them to have growing size, we do not need
