The method by which a specimen was collected is another parameter that has been noted to
affect the redox state of Fe in serpentinites. In Evans’s 2008 [38] analysis of bulk rock Fe(III)/Fer 72
versus extent of serpentinization, specimens collected by dredging the seafloor were omitted. The 18
assumption was that these samples would reflect alteration that occurred on the seafloor, not just 2
alteration as a result of serpentinization. Specimens obtained from drill core material, which has : 3
not spent long periods of time exposed to seawater or subaerial conditions, might better preserve
the in situ Fe redox state versus specimens obtained from dredging or outcrops. We included
specimens from dredging and outcrops in the current database because they are a significant Lo
number of the samples for which Fe redox was measured. In fact, Fe in bulk rock dredge samples iS
is significantly oxidized relative to other sample types (electronic supplementary material, figure 1s
Sih). Core samples, which might be expected to be the least oxidized, appear more oxidized than a
outcrop samples; however, the difference is not statistically significant (electronic supplementary aed
material, figures S4d). However, bulk rock outcrop samples do have a greater range of Fe(III) /Fer an)
values extending to fully oxidized while values from core samples do not exceed 80% oxidized =
Fe (electronic supplementary material, figure Sih). It is important to bear in mind that these :s
differences in Fe redox state are also likely to be affected by the geologic setting. Specimens from Do
mid-ocean ridges are most likely to be those that are derived from drill core material whereas : o
specimens from ophiolites are more likely to be from outcrops. The inter-relationship between —
these two specimen characteristics (geologic setting and sample type) makes it difficult to further [3
determine which has more influence on the redox state of iron. Dy
