Our present knowledge of the bionomics of the Indian rat-fleas, Xenopsylla cheopis
(Rothschild), X. astia Rothschild and X. brasiliensis (Baker), which are experimentally
proved vectors of plague (Webster & Chitre 19304, p. 422), though not equally effective,
is incomplete (Hirst 1926, p. 201; Buxton 1938, p. 505); in view of this fact it was deemed
necessary to ascertain the effects of different ecological factors on their development. The
primary object of this study is to elucidate the causes governing the fluctuations in the flea
numbers. The correlation between outbreaks of plague and the abundance and geo-
graphical distribution of these species of rat-fleas has been emphasized by many
workers (see, for instance, Advisory Committee 1910, p. 568; Cragg 1921, p. 395; 1923,
