or less obtuse according to 'the :degree of  oblateness 'of the
primitive spheroid.

It is at-least possible that carbonate -of lime and other sub-
stances, of which the forms are derived from regular rhom-
boids as their primitive form, may, in fact, consist of oblate
spheroids as elementary particles.

It deserves to be remarked, that the-conjecture to-which we
are thus led'by a natural transition, from consideration of the
most simple form of crystals, was long 'since entertained by
Huyenens;* when treating of the-oblique refraction of Iceland
spar, which he $0 skilfully analysed. The peculiar law-ob-
servable in 'the refraction of light 'by that crystal, he found
might'be explained on the-/supposition of spheroidical undula-
tions propagated through'the substance of the spar, and these
he thought might perhaps be-owing to a spheroidical form-of
its particles, to which the disposition to split into the rhomboidal
