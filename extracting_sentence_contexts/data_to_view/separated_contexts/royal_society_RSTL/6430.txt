And if the matrix Y is such that we have Q=0, 7. e. Det. (Q+Y)=0 (which is a
quadric relation between the terms of the skew matrix, that is, each term is contained
therein in the first and second powers only), then the equation becomes
(NYB, C, D, E)*=0. It is clear that this can only be the case in consequence of the coefficients of trans-
formation in the equation

(B, C, D, B)=(N-'(2—T)Q(2+Y)"'QYFB,, C', D', F!)

being ch that there shall exist at least two linear relations between the quantities
(B, C, D, E), and I assume (without stopping to prove it) that they are such that the
number of such linear relations is in fact two. That is, the last-mentioned equation
establishes between the quantities (B, C, D, E) two linear relations, in virtue whereof

we find
