The periodic table is a table of elements or atoms, and the elements or atoms themselves are
neither metals nor non-metals. Normally, we mention it as metal element or non-metal element
means when the element exist as a solid, liquid or gaseous status under ambient temperature and
pressure. As well as rationalizing the metallic versus non-metallic status of the chemical elements.
under ambient conditions, the Goldhammer-Herzfeld model obviously allows one to predict the
critical conditions under which a metallic element can become non-metallic or, conversely, a non-
metallic element can acquire metallic status. Pioneering studies by Strutt [32] and by Bender [33]
in the early part of the last century explored the experimental conditions under which the element
mercury was transformed from a metal—surely its recognized, universal status as a magnificent
conductor of electricity—to a stubbornly resistive insulator or non-metal. Thus, Strutt noted

It is known that mercury vapour, even at very high temperatures, is a good insulator; a
better one in fact than air under similar conditions. Liquid mercury, on the other hand,
is of course a good conductor, like other metals. He further noted Since the liquid and
saturated vapour are indistinguishable above the critical temperature, one or both of these
(states) must undergo a remarkable change of electrical properties as that temperature is
approached [32].

Strutt observed a remarkable reduction of close to eight orders of magnitude in the electrical
resistance of saturated Hg vapour at high pressures, when compared with its electrical resistance
in the vapour under room pressure conditions.

A more recent experimental realization of the remarkable density-driven metal-to-non-metal
transition in elemental Hg is given in figure 9. Note its transition from the metallic state to
its non-metallic state as the elemental density is reduced. Even though these data are at high
