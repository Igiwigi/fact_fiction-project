Then q other directions are specified by the ¢
meteorological variates, and any linear regression formula is represented by some line
through the origin in the space of q dimensions, specified by these q directions. The
multiple correlation, R, is then the cosine of the angle which the line OP makes with
the space of q dimensions. If the variate y is unrelated to the variates «,,..., x,, the
line OP may be regarded as drawn at random through O, in the space of » dimensions ;
using this fact it may be shown without difficulty that the chance that R? falls into
the elementary range dR? is

n—3,

exist between the meteorological variates, provided no one of them can be exactly
