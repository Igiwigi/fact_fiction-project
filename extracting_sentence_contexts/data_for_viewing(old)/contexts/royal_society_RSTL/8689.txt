Sion for e, the density or distribution of matter over the space or surface to which the
theorem relates, such that the corresponding integral V has its given value, viz. in
A and B there exists such a distribution over the plane w=0, in C snch a distribution
over a given surface, and in D such a distribution in space. The establishment, and
exhibition. in connexion with each other, of these four distribution-theorems is the
principal object of the present memoir ; but the memoir contains other investigations
which have presented themselves to me in treating the question. It is to be noticed
that the theorem A. belongs to GREEN, being in fact the fundamental theorem of his
memoir of 18359, already referred to. Theorem C, in the particular case of tridimen-
sional space, belongs also to him, being given in his © Es8ay on the Application of
Mathematical Analysis to the theories of Electricity and Magnetism'” (Nottingham, 1828),
being partially rediscovered by Gavss in the year 1840; and theorem D, in the same
case of tridimensional space, to LEJEUNE-DIRICHLET : see his memoir © Sur un moyen
general de yerifier Vexpression du potentiel relatif a une masse quelconque homogene
ou h6tcrogene,” Crelle, t. xxxii. pp. 80-84 (1840). I refer more particularly to these
and other researches by Gavss, JacoBr, and others in an Annex to the present memoir.
