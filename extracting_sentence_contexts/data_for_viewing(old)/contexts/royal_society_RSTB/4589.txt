The queen differs very little from the ordinary unfertilised winged female. Owing
to her greater age, she is usually somewhat darker in colour, her wings have been
lost, and only the scales or wing stumps remain, in the form of two pairs of small,
dark brown, triangular appendages (fig. 7). The anterior wing scales in some
examples are very small, measuring only half of the length of the mesothorax. In
another specimen, however, they almost reached the hind margin of their segment.
The posterior wing scales usually attain a length of half that of the segment bearing
them. In length the queen generally exceeds that of the winged female, and
measures on an average 15 mm, The abdomen is slightly more bulky, and attains a
width of 4:5 mm. across its broadest region. The antennse were imperfect in the
queens which were examined} one or more of the terminal joints being missing.
Hearn (1903, p. 51) has recorded the same fact in Termopsis, and mentions that he
has observed the mutilation actually taking place. In some instances the insect bites
off joints of its own antenne, and on other occasions its companions performed the
operation on one another. The significance of this process is unknown.

In Archotermopsis the queen has hitherto remained undiscovered, and it is remark-
able in exhibiting none of the specialisation or great size seen in the queens of the
majority of Termites.

9. The King.

The king can be distinguished from the winged male by the absence of wings, only
the wing scales remaining, and by being usually darker in colour, but no other
