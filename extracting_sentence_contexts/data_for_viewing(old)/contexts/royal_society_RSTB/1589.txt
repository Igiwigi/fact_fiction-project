—a fact whieh snpports our suggestion that this ridge is in part the equivalent of the
dorsal lamina in other Siluridw. In a. precisely similar manner the anterior wall is
firmly adherent to the deenryed anterior margin of the transverse process of the
fonrth vertebsa. The inner wall of the air-sac is also attached to the dorsal ridge,
where the latter imversos the side of the complex centrum, The only other point
at whicel) each ait-sac is attached to a ricid portion of the skeleton is sliout the centre
of its ventral avall, where the latter blends with its investing superficial coat, and
hotl hecome firraly attached to the triangnlar outgrowth from the ventral ridwe.

The straight posterior process of the tripus lies near the inner extremity of each
dir-sac in relation with the imperfect dorsal wall of the latter, bat we were only able
to detect « few fine-seattered fibres extencling from the outer margin of the process
obliquely outwards and forwards towards the antero-lateral and anterior walls of the
