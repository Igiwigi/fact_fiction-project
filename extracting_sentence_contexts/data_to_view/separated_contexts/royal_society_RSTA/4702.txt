The medium has hitherto been taken as absolutely transparent, that is, no
degradation of energy occurs in it, the absorption bands above so called being really
produced by total and nearly total reflexion of the radiation, which thus is not
absorbed by the medium, but simply cannot get into it. Suppose that there is
present a conduction current, which may be considered to include all causes which
put 39’ out of phase with J and so lead to regular absorption of the energy of the
waves: it may be represented, as in Part II., § 11, by the formula

C€=k(m' d/dt+o)D;
K’ = 1+ {3 + (d/dt)" ©} /B,

thus simply adding to the formula for the square of the index of refraction the terms
— (kiv’ + kp e'r)/(m"p* + 0”), which satisfactorily represent the general features
of metallic propagation as was shown in Part IL, § 11.*

It is noteworthy that as the period becomes very rapid the effective index ot
refraction always approximates to unity; so that very short waves will not suffer
sensible reflexion, refraction, or diffraction even while their length may include many
molecules of the material medium. In fact when the period of the radiation is
sufficiently high, the free periods of the polar molecules are not quick enough to
enable them to respond,t while the comparatively free ions are prevented by their

we now have

(* For example, it explains why the real part of «? is negative for metals. In Part II. the generally
received contention (based on a narrower theory) that x? cannot be negative for purely elastic, that is
dielectric, media was admitted without examination: but it is obviously inconsistent with the discussion
above.
