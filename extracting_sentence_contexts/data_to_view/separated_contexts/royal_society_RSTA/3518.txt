In smart grid planning, it remains unclear whether new asset-heavy investment (e.g. a new
line and/or transformer) will be needed even in the presence of increased ICT infrastructure and
fast control of network devices, storage and demand, which can rapidly instigate reduction of
transfers and even eliminate network congestion [14]. The availability of distributed storage,
for instance, could locally provide power to consumers while battery charging and transfer
actions take place during hours where the network is not congested. Likewise, fast control of
network devices could eliminate post-contingency, real-time congestion by changing network
topology (e.g. through line switching), impedances (e.g. through the adjustment of FACTS set
points and soft normally open points [16], ie. relying on power electronics-based technology)
and power flows (e.g. through dispatchable HVDC links), thereby reducing the need for
network redundancy. Furthermore, the reliability role of redundant transmission and generation


infrastructure could be substituted by the deployment of flexible devices that can carry out
advanced operational measures, creating a strong relation between planning and operation
that should be carefully studied when expanding the system [17]. In addition, economics
and reliability will not be the only drivers of network planning, and thus new investment
solutions should also facilitate the achievement of environmentally driven energy policy targets.
