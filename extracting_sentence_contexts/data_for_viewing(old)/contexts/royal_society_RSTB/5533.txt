from the first, which extends ventrally into the limb dorso-laterally along the body-wall
and mediolaterally towards the middle line. The ventral and biggest part of the ccelom
passes into the limb cavity and forms its intrinsic muscles. The median diverticulum
of the coelom forms the ventral longitudinal muscle, while the lateral coelomic diverti-
culum gives rise to fat body and body-wall muscles on its outer side, cardioblasts on its
upper side, and the thin connecting layer of cells between the lateral and medial coelomic
diverticula becomes the visceral muscle layer. Further, at the junction between
ventral (limb) and dorsal ccelom two pairs of hollow diverticula grow out to form the
extrinsic muscles of the leg, namely flexors and extensors.

The first thing to note there is the greater development of ccelomic cavity in the
generalised Orthopteron than in Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera (in the latter
case it is absent), EscuertcH, 1900; Noack, 1901, etc. The fact that insects have a hemo-
ceelic body cavity in the adult is foreshadowed by the reduction of embryonic ccelom.
The retention of conspicuous coelomic cavities in embryos of Orthoptera must be regarded
as a vestigial feature. In comparing the differentiation of mesoderm in Carausius and
Pieris Wiesmannâ€™s Blutzellenlamelle corresponds exactly to what I have called median
mesoderm, both giving rise to transverse muscles and to blood cells. The subsomitic
mesoderm in Pieris corresponds with the ventral medial ccelom and the inner and
outer medial diverticula of Carausius, which gives rise to intrinsic and extrinsic muscles
of the leg and longitudinal muscles of the body wall.

In the dorso-lateral portion of the ccelom of Carausius we have obviously the nearly
exact counterpart of the somitic portion of mesoderm in Pieris. Slight differences,
difficult to explain, lie in the different positions from which the fat body arises and the
