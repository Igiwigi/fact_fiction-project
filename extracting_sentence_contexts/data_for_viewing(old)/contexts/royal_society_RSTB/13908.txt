genetic basis of phenotypic differentiation among human popu-
lations. An early application of this approach found polygenic
signals of selection on height within Europe [59,60], where poly-
genic scores were over-differentiated among populations
compared to the neutral prediction based on Fey. Importantly,
the null distribution of this test of neutrality at the level of the
phenotype does not rely on accurate polygenic scores and so
changes in LD, GxG and GxE should not cause false signals.
However, the results are very sensitive to slight biases in esti-
mated effect sizes due to population structure, and indeed the
signal of polygenic selection on height turned out to be almost
entirely due to stratification [61-63]. More generally, the imper-
fect portability of polygenic scores and the fact that the mean
environmental contribution to phenotypes can vary greatly
between populations raise concerns about over-interpreting
differences in mean polygenic scores as genetic differences in
the average phenotype among populations [60,64-67].

The consequence of genetic differentiation on the low
generalizability of GWAS results for phenotype prediction
may appear to contradict Lewontinâ€™s observation of minor
allele frequency (MAF) differences between populations.
However, allele frequency differentiation for complex traits
under selection can occur at a rate faster than drift. This
would lead to noisy estimates of additive genetic values,
