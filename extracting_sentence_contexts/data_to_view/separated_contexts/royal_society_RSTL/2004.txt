Of the Biphosphate of Soda. This salt admits, as I shall immediately show, of 80 many changes in its
constitution and properties, as to entitle it to be considered one of the most
interesting of chemical substances. The facts which I haye to communicate
on this subject-are certainly the most extraordinary of the paper, and were. de-
termined with care and considerable difficulty,

I had an opportunity of noticing the dimorphism of this salt, and confirmed
the observation of MiTscHgRLICH, that both forms of crystals possess the same
chemical properties and the same proportion of water, Of the four atoms of
water which the crystals contain, they lose, I find, two atoms at the tempera-
ture of 212?, and not a particle more till heated up to about 375*.

1st. Thus 4:96 grains of the crystals reduced to powder, when dried on the
water-bath for several days, retained only 0:76 water, or consisted of
