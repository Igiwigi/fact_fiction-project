During the course of the present experiments notes were made of the apparent
intensity of the light at each pressure, and, according to visual observations, the
brilliance of the image thrown upon the jaws of the slit increased gradually with the
pressure until at 100 atmospheres it became painful to the eyes to observe it, the
brightness apparently increasing more rapidly after 50 atmospheres than between
1 and 50 atmospheres. It is to be remarked that with this increase of brightness there is little concomitant
decrease in the necessary time of exposure. As the pressure was increased the
spectral lines became very much wider and more diffuse, and in some instances were
spread out over 15 Angstrém units; consequently, though there is an increase in the
intrinsic brightness of the arc, the fact that the area over which the energy of
vibration is spread is increased in a greater proportion, results in the intensity of the
radiant energy received upon the photographic plate being less than that received
when the total amount of light is less and the energy concentrated into narrow lines. The city mains at 100 volts were used as the source of supply, a reduction being
effected by a resistance frame. The current in the are varied from 12 to 20 ampéres ;
this could not be measured accurately on account of the intermittent nature of the
arc, nor could a higher voltage than 50 be used across the terminals, because at the
moment of striking it a short circuit through the molten metal was produced, and the
wiring of the building was not capable of taking more than 30 ampéres.
