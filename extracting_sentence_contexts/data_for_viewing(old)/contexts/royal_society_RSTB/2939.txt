pressed in such a way that the broader surfaces are anterior and posterior, while
the narrower surfaces are towards the pallial cavity and the interlamellar space
respectively. The thickness of the chitin is probably in no case absolutely uniform,
but the broader sides of the tube have each a thickened area. Concerning this,

Petseneer has already stated (72, p. 177) that “cet épaississement est surtout
développé vers le cété interne des feuillets chez les Anomiide, Arcide, et Trigoniide,
et surtout vers le cdté externe (done ventral des filaments) dans les autres Lamelli-
branches ;” but although this statement is correct in the main, and may be allowed
to pass as a text-book generalisation, it fails to take into account the fact that the
position of the thickened band frequently varies at different levels. The general
tendency is for the thickening to be nearer the interlamellar edge of the filament in
sections taken towards the ventral edge of the demibranch than in those taken at
higher levels. Occasionally there are two thickened bands on each broad face, one
towards the incurrent and one towards the interlamellar side (figs. 11A and C, and
fig. 13C b).

The cavity of the tube of chitin may be traversed by a continuous membrane of
chitin (intrafilamentar septum), running lengthwise down the filament, and dividing
the tube into two tubes, or there may occur isolated strands of chitin running from
side to side. A careful examination of serial sections is necessary to distinguish
these latter from the intrafilamentar septa. The presence of the septum must have a
