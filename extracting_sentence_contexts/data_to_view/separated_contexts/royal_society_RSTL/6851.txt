To experiment with water, it was necessary to saturate it with the salt of which the
cell was formed, but the absorptive energy is due solely to the water. We might infer
from this alone, were no experiments made on the aqueous yapour of the atmosphere,
that that vapour must exert a powerful action upon terrestrial radiation. In fact, in all
the statements that I have hitherto made I have underrated its action. The deportment of the elements sulphur and iodine, dissolved in bisulphide of carbon,
is in striking harmony with all that we have hitherto discovered regarding the action of
elementary bodies. The saturation of the bisulphide by sulphur scarcely affects the
transmission, while a quantity of iodine sufficient to conyert the liquid from one of
perfect transparency to one of almost perfect opacity to light, produces a diminution of
only two per cent.
