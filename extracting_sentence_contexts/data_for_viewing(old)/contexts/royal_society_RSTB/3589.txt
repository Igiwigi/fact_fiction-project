2 grades between the first stages, as in fig. 2, and the large masses like those in
S figs, 4-6. Fig. 5 shows the compact form of a spherical body, such as is common

g seeming to come directly from it.
iS There are also in the layers of the host very numerous cells filled with a blackened
frothy network, which appears not unlike cells once occupied by fungal clusters
which are now effete, the fungus having probably withdrawn to the outer zones of
the host. 5

Halitâ€”That the fungus was an underground form seems indicated by the fact
that its host was a rhizome or the base of a stem. Whether it was a saprophyte or a
parasite there seems at present no means of determining. Figures given by Harric
(1880) show swollen, thickened cells arising from the mycelium of a living form, which
are very similar to those of this fossil although less extensive. Among living forms
such cells are known to function as resting stages or microsclerotia, and it is extremely
probable that the fossil clusters have the same function,
