The paper concluded as follows —

« May not the spectroscope afford us evidence of the existence of the * red-flames *
which total eclipses have revealed to us in the sun's atmosphere, although they escape
all other methods of observation at, other times? and if 80, may we not learn something
from this of the recent outburst of the star in Corona ?”

Before the paper was written I had diligently swept round the solar disk in search of
evidence of the red flames, but without result. This want of success I attributed to the
excessive brilliancy of the spectrum of the circumsolar regions in the field of view of the
instrument employed. I found in fact (although I did not discontinue my efforts) that
both for these observations and for those on sun-spots more dispersion Was Necesary ; in
one case to weaken the atmospheric light, in the other to widen the spectrum. I therefore represented my requirements to the Government-Grant Committee, and
was at once 8upplied with funds to procure a spectroscope of the requisite dispersive
power. The construction of this instrument was commenced in the beginning of 1867 by
Mr.
