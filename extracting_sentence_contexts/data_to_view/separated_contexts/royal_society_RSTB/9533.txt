Nonetheless, it is full of insights into
the disease and an important means to prevention. Sloane states that his ‘Account of inoculation’ was ‘given to
Mr Ranby, to be published, anno 1736’. In fact, it was not pub-
lished until 1755, just over a year after Sloane’s death. Why
Sloane provided this account at this time to John Ranby FRS
remains obscure as Ranby was not involved in editing Philoso-
phical Transactions. By 1755 his ‘co-author’ (the person who
communicated the paper to the Royal Society), the Reverend
Dr Thomas Birch, was the Secretary of the Society with respon-
sibility for Philosophical Transactions.
