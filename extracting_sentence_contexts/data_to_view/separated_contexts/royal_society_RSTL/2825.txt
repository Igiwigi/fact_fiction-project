The motion of the diurnal waye being thus irregular, we can account for the
variety of values of the diurnal inequality at different places. We can also conceive
this wave to move in a manner even more irregular than we have yet described ; and

some of the facts do appear to indicate this further irregularity. For example, the
diurnal inequality appears sometimes, for several days, to leap from its proper tides
to the alternate tides, without vanishing in the transition, as in rule it does. Now
this irregular movement may be accounted for by supposing that the diurnal wave,
which usually completes its oscillation and returns in twenty-four (lunar) hours, does
sometimes occupy a longer or shorter time in the oscillation.
