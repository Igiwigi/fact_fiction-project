The general distribution of rain through the year could, indeed, be roughly
represented by dividing the period up into say 6 sections and recording the total rainfall
in each period. If the rainfall were approximately evenly distributed in successive days
or weeks, this method might indeed give a fairly accurate picture of the sequence of
rainfall. But notoriously the rain is in fact often concentrated in short spells, with

rainless periods intervening, consequently if March and April formed one section, a
great part of the rain ascribed to that section might fall early in March in one year, and
late in April in another, and it would be impossible to regard such falls as equivalent

in their effects on the crop. . Whereas a late April fall might well be nearly equivalent
to one occurring early in May. This consideration suggests that a finer subdivision of the year is necessary ; that
months or even weeks should be treated separately.
