This hypothesis of two rotatory systems in the German Ocean is recommended
by its giving the most consistent and probable relations among the cotidal lines and

the intervening spaces, as may be seen by reference to the chart ; and I have therefore
adopted it as the best approximation I can now obtain to the form of these lines. This theory is, indeed, nothing more than a representation of the facts of the case ;
yet it gives a view of the mechanism of the tides of the German Ocean different from
any which has hitherto been suggested. The southern rotatory system, which exists
between the coast of Suffolk and the Netherlands, may be conceived to be kept in
constant circulation by impulses received from the adjacent tides, that is, an impulse
at 6" on the coast of Norfolk, and an impulse at 12% on the coast of Belgium. Thus
it resembles a watch or clock, which is kept in continual motion by a sustaining force
applied at intervals.
