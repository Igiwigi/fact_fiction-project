granules throughout the corium, one gains the impression, from incinerated pre-
parations, that the inorganic content of the isthmus is actually greater than in the
uterus. This is confirmed by the analyses of BuckNER, Martin, and Perer (1925),
who obtained an average figure of 0-44°%, CaO in the isthmus and 0-24% CaO
in the uterus of the “ heavy laying hen.’’ Unfortunately their figures do not include
the calcium content of the uterus, when it contains a partly calcified shell, in com-
parison with material not in full secretory activity, though their analyses indicate
a reduction to 0- 18%, in the resting, partly atrophied organ.

With these facts in mind, the special granules in the apical ciliated cells, revealed
in incinerated and stained preparations, fig. 25, Plate 18, and gu, figs. 28 and 29, Plate
19, cannot conclusively be regarded as the pro-secretion phases of calcium secretion
in the uterus. In fact, sections from material fixed in alcohol-formalin and Zenker-
formol may be placed in nitric, hydrochloric, and acetic acids, without the slightest
alteration in the subsequent staining of the granules with iron hematoxylin. The
appearance of the granules and, indeed, their reactions to acids are more consistent
with the assumption that they are the shell matrix secretion. The quiescent state
of the basal cells during secretion, leads to the conviction that the uterine epithelium,
as a whole, does not take any part in calcification. The slight increase in cyto-
plasmic ash in the epithelium seems nothing more than a result of increased calcium
supply from the blood stream, which permeates the entire uterine wall.

During active secretion, the gland epithelium contains cytoplasm which is neither
alveolar, as in the albumen region, nor homogeneous, as in the ciliated cells. Its
preservation in alcohol-formalin is poor. The lack of any definite organization in
