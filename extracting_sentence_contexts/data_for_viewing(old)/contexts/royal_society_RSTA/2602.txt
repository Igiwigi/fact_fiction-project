A second reason for the comparative scarcity of deep explanation may be that, since the ea
conversation is online, participants usually do not know each other; additionally many cues .
such as tone and body language are not represented, and so it is harder to build up a picture
of individual knowledge bases. Thirdly, also due to the fact that the conversation occurs online
in real-time, often with parallel threads, participants are under time-pressure, and therefore may
not articulate lack of understanding as much as they would in a slower-moving conversation. The
public nature of the conversation may also be a factor here.

There was no pattern as to mathematical context or purposive element in the deep
explanations. An example of a deep explanation concerning a conceptual misunderstanding is
below:

the convex hull. But apparently it means a full line, so that the next point can be ‘behind’ the previous point. Got it.

Yeah, so it’s an infinite line extending in both directions and not just a ray. I’m thinking spirograph rather than the convex hull.
