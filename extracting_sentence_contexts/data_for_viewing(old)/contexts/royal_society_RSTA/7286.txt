step-functions, it follows that any finite discontinuity in the incident wave will disappear
in the returning wave. In fact, by virtue of the integrating property in the first region, they
become discontinuities in the velocity derivatives. This is verified by the two graphs in
figure 11, which describe the returning wave originating from a finite pulse of length z in
which the velocities are represented, respectively, by

—{B' (t+) —B'(t+-x—2bz)} and —{H(t+x) —H(ét+x—26z)},

where 8’ is given by (65). The two cases z = 0-6, z = 1-0 are shown in the figure. The graph
is everywhere continuous, but there is a discontinuity in slope at a distance z from the wave-
front, where the velocity has a maximum value. Since the returning energy must remain
finite the velocity in this case must tend ultimately to zero. For z = 1 and (¢—x) = 8b it is
within 12-6 °%, of its maximum value.
