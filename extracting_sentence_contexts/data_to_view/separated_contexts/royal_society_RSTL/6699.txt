The like remarks apply
to the lines G(m?, n, p), G(n?, n?), G(m?, n), and G(m#); but T will deyelope them some-
what more particularly as regards the lines G(m*). 16. Given a curve m, then (as in fact mentioned in the investigation for ND(m))
through any point whatever of the curve there can be drawn

(—m+2=)mP+m—2+M
lines meeting the curve in two other points, or say [mP+1M—2+I lines through three
points. But in general no one of these lines meets the curye in a fourth point ; that
is, we cannot through every point of the curve m draw a line through four points ; there
are, however, on the curye m2 a certain number ( =4G(m)) of points through which can
be drawn a line through four points, or line G(m*).

17. But the curve 1m may be such that through every point of the curve there passes
a line through four points.
