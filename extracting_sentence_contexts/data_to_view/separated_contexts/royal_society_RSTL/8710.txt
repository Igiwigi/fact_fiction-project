& They till remain attached to the top of the neural canal, though the connexion has in
each case become a pedicle s0 narrow that it can only be obseryed with great difficulty. Â© It is fairly certain that by this stage each posterior nerve-rudiment has its own
S 8eparate and independent junction with the spinal cord; their dorsal extremities are

important modifications since the last stage. The important feature of the section figured (fig. D b), and one which it shares with
the other sections of the 8ame embryo, is the appearance of connective-tissue cells around
the nerve-rudiment.
