or the lower crust at fast-spreading ridges), it will start crystallizing. The first increments of 78
crystallization are olivine (+Cr-spinel), quickly followed by olivine + plagioclase. At the point : =
where plagioclase joins the liquidus, the crystallization rate increases dramatically [120]. As a : =
result, the magma turns into mush as a crystal framework starts forming. At what proportion :B
of crystals a framework starts forming has been the subject of considerable recent interest. This : =
so-called critical crystal volume fraction (@¢) is not simply a function of the crystallinity, but also 28
depends on grain shape, the degree of particle alignment, surface roughness and melt viscosity are
[121,122]. Hence, there is no unique value of ¢¢: it differs from one system to the next, and : -)
within the system as any of these parameters change [121]. Another key aspect is that, even at : S
relatively high melt proportion, crystals may form force chains that can sustain yield strength 783

[121,123]. A consequence of force chains is that the mechanical transition from melt to mush
occurs at relatively low crystal proportions [123]. At mid-ocean ridges, the fact that crystallization
is dominated by plagioclase, which has a large degree of shape anisotropy, promotes low ¢¢ [122]
and hence early mush formation: natural and experimental observations suggest that plagioclase-
dominated systems may behave mechanically like a mush at relatively low crystal content
(approx. 20-25% [122,123]). Such modal proportion is strikingly similar to the fraction of crystals
that have formed from MORBs at lower crustal pressure by the time it reaches clinopyroxene
saturation (22% in the Indian MORB modelled in §3a; see fig. 13 in [34]). Hence, by the time
clinopyroxene crystallizes, it does so within an olivine + plagioclase framework. Average MORB
possesses a Mg# of approximately 60 (though slightly higher at slow-spreading compared to
fast-spreading ridges [99]), which requires approximately 40-50% fractionation of a primary melt
(Mg# ~ 72). Hence, given that a framework already forms at 20-25% crystallization, a significant
proportion of MORB crystallization is likely to occur in this framework-dominated mode, rather
than in a melt-dominated mode. The implication is that, being an interstitial phase in a crystal
