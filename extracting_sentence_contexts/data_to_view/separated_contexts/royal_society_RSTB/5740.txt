Entering the internal capsule, they turn laterally in front of the optic radiations,
and appear to be distributed to the cortex just anterior to the area striata. The experi-
ments were not adequate for the determination of the corticifugal connections of the pars
posterior. The investigation of the connections of this element is rendered difficult by
the fact that it is traversed by fibres of passage—cortico-tectal fibres and optic tract
fibres. Marchi material of the rat’s brain after enucleation of one eye shows that while
many of the optic tract fibres of retinal origin penetrate the pars posterior on their way
to the anterior colliculus, none appear to terminate in it (CLARK, 1931). Nucleus dorso-medialis—The dorso-medial nucleus is the equivalent of the “ medial
nucleus * of human descriptive anatomy, and of the nucleus medialis dorsalis of recent
authors.
