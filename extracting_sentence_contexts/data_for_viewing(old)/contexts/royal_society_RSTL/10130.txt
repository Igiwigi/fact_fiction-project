Sb PFirst Stage. —Newly-hatched embryos of Acipenser ruthenus from 5h millims,
= to 6% millims. in length.

Z The specimens figured by me (Plate 12, figs. 1-3) are rather smaller than the one
S figured by Mr. Barrour (© Comp. Embryol.,” vol. ii., p. 88, fig. 53) which measured
> 7 millims, in total length, but his description may serve for mine, which were nearly
Z as much developed as his slightly larger specimen.

2 After describing the development of the embryo, Mr. BaLrour explains its peculiar
Z outspread form in its unhatched condition (op. cit., p. 86, fig. 52), and says :—* The
E further changes which take place are, in the main, similar to those in other Ichthy-
E opsida, but in some ways the appearance of the embryo is, as may be gathered from
£ fig. 52, rather strange. This is mainly due to the fact that the embryo does not
6 become folded off from the yolk in the manner usual in the Vertebrates ; and as could
'S be shown in the sequel, the relation of the yolk to the embryo is unlike that in any
S other known Vertebrate. The appearance of the embryo is thus something like that
& of an ordinary embryo slit open along the ventral side and then flattened out. Organs
which properly belong to the ventral side appear in the lateral parts of the dorsal
surface. Owing to the great forward extension of the yolk the heart (fig. 52, B)
appears to be placed directly in front of the head.” Then, after describing the
progress made in the development of the brain and organs of special sense, Mr.
BALrour says:—* At the sides of the cephalic plate the visceral arches make their
appearance, and in fig. 52, A and B, there are shown the mandibular (Md.), hyoid (Za.),
and first branchial (Br.) arches, with the hyo-mandibular (spiracle) and hyo-branchial
clefts between them. They constitute peculiar concentric circles round the cephalic
