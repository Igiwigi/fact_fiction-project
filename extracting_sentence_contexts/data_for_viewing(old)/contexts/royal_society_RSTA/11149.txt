We might suppose that the nuclei differ from those produced by Réntgen rays
merely in being so much larger, that their velocity in a given field is diminished
enormously, the charge in each nucleus remaining the same. It is difficult, however,
to believe that the efficiency of the nucleus in helping condensation would remain

unaltered by such an inerease in size as would reduce the velocity to anything like
such a small value as 1/4000 centim. per second for a potential gradient of 1 volt
per centimetre. In fact, if we can trust to obtaining approximately correct results by
applying to drops as small as 2 X 10~° centim., the formule which hold for larger
drops, we can see* that these nuclei must amount to at least 2 x 107° centim, in
radius; the supersaturation required to cause condensation to take place on drops of
this radius being that produced by an expansion, v,/7, = about 1°01, which is very
far removed from that actually required, v/v, = 1°25.

The ionisation may be a result of the expansion, This is the view I am inclined to
take.

It is easy to understand, according to this view, how the number of drops produced
is entirely uninfluenced by even a strong electric field, for the whole time for which the
ions would be free to move under the action of the field, before the formation of drops
