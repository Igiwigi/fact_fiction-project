Very similar phenomena to the above-described also occur in normal fishes, and it
is of interest to note some cases, where the differences throw some light on the
changes in the Flat-fishes. In Trachypterus at this stage the whole skull is depressed
downwards and the jaws project upwards (fig. 99), so that there must be some
difficulty for a time in the opening of the mouth. With the further development of
the arches, however, the base of the hyoids is carried forward between the mandibular
rami, thus enabling the mouth to be opened in the normal manner. But the skull
remains permanently in the depressed condition and the jaws are very protractile.
Symphurus comes nearest to this condition (fig. 92), but the skull returns later to a
more horizontal position (figs. 93, 95) and a snout is formed where Trachypterus has
none. The skull in the Bothoids is also strongly depressed and likewise recovers to
some extent. The recovery is connected with the fact that the anterior part of the
skull (ethmoid and parasphenoid axis) is flexed upwards again on the posterior part
(figs. 75, 77, 93), and this is the case in all Flat-fishes.

In another Teleost the pectoral arch is drawn forward (fig. 98) when the jaws ossify
and the skull is only slightly depressed. The same thing occurs in the Flat-fishes as
a general rule, but here again it is sometimes retracted later, and this retraction is
correlated with the forward growth of the abdominal muscles (fig. 45). When this
occurs, towards the end of the second stage, the hyoclavicular muscles begin to show
signs of rupture. In Symphurus, at a still later stage, it will be seen that the
retraction of the pectoral arch is connected with the final changes in the meta-
morphosis (figs. 96, 97).
