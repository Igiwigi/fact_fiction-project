They discover that the lighthouse was
over-designed, with a safety factor of approximately 10. Carter et al. [12] considered the unusual
steel transporter bridges located in Newport, Wales, and Middleborough, northeast England,
built more than 100 years ago. They reveal that the survival of the steel transporter bridges is due
in part to the fact that wind loading on each structural element was applied with no consideration
of the sheltering of neighbouring elements. Considering a statistical description of loads, extreme environmental design conditions
have been historically defined by means of classical stationary extreme values analysis theory. Unfortunately, we are facing a period of accelerating climate change which might result in most
previously identified design parameters being obsolete.
