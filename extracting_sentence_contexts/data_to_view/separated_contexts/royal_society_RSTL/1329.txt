But
it can scarcely be supposed, that, from touching the polished
surface of tin-foil in the gentlest manner with. the smooth-
round end of a silver probe, any part of the former metal was
carried away by the latter ; and even. when friction was used,
as the zinc was much harder than the gold and silver, it is not
probable that it was in the least. abraded by, them. Besides,
moisture, as I have already said, increases this effect of. fric-
tion, though it lessens friction itself. The most powerful argument, however, in favour of my
