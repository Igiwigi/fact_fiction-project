it has appeared that, although at the period dealt with there is an entire absence of
ectodermal shield-differentiation in front of the primitive knot, there is nevertheless
present, behind the knot, a tolerably extensive area, traversed by a lengthy primitive
streak, and characterised by the cubical character of its ectoderm, as well as by
the presence of a not inconsiderable mesodermal sheet. This “ primitive-streak
area” is, moreover, entirely unconnected with the primitive knot, being separated
from it by a not inconsiderable extent of bilaminar blastoderm, whose ectodermal
layer is still flattened and squamous like that of the non-embryonic vesicle-wall
(cf. text-fig. 7).

A statement of the condition thus summarised formed the main thesis of our earlier
preliminary communication. It was pointed out towards the close of that paper that
the recognition of the facts then outlined would involve a reconsideration of the
entire question of the significance of the mammalian primitive streak.

* Batiowirz (01) has also figured an “ Epithelpropf” very similar in histological character to that
referred to in Specimen Y, though occurring in the stage corresponding to our “ postgastrular”
(cf. BALLOwtrz’ text-fig. 39 and figs. 43-5, Taf. xxxiii), But the important difference is here noticeable
that the “ Epithelauswuchs” or “ Epithelpropf” is formed at the anterior lip of the blastopore.
