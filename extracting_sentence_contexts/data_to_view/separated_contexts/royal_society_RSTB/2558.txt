Curiously enough, another Madreporarian family, apparently remote from the
Eupsammide, has a very similar microscopic septal structure. In the Turbinolide,
the axes of calcification in the median plane of the septum are also very closely set
and the growth-lamelle very smoothly apposed. An important difference however
consists in the fact that a trabecular axis never bends out of the median plane in
Turbinolide. There are therefore no septal granulations into which the axes of
fascicular bundles of fibres bend. When a granulation forms on the septal surface, it
covers a number of small centres of calcification in the median plane, from which
practically parallel-placed fibres pass into the granulation, The fine structure of
smooth-septate Eusmilinge is essentially similar (antea p. 161).
