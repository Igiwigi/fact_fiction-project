Box 1. Characteristics of a typical FFS.

— A group of 20-25 farmers, assisted by a project-trained facilitator, prepares two training plots of around 1000 m? total.
The FFS group spends roughly one-half day per week setting up experiments, making observations and jointly managing
the two plots, one using local, conventional farming methods and a second plot testing new practices appropriate to the
crop and location.
