The temperature
is allowed to increase to 150?, and the retort then permitted to cool. The process is
repeated by introducing a fresh charge of hydrogen fluoride into the retort and of
ammonia into the test-tube, and again heating in the paraffin bath. If the quantity of
the silicate taken be not more than 0-2 grm., twice charging the retort is sufficient ;
if it amount to 0-5, three or four repetitions of the process are required. 'The process
must in fact be repeated s0 long as any fresh flocks of silica can be seen to form in the
ammonia tube. Finally, 0-75 cub. centim. of sulphuric acid are introduced into the
retort, and the temperature raised to 160”, the stream of hydrogen being continued as
before®*. The several ammoniacal charges of the ammonia tube are now brought together into
a platinum dish with all the washings from the test-tubes and the connecting tubes;
and these are now slowly evaporated in a water-bath with continual stirring.
