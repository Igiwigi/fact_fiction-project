As it 8eemed highly probable that the meerschaum plate was of finer texture than
the porcelain plate previously tried, the fact that the difference of pressure with the
meerschaum was nob larger than with the porcelain was a matter of s80me gsurprise.
There appeared, however, to be a possible cause for this in the thinness of the meer-
schaum. -Tt was possible that there was some flaw in the plate, or more probably that
the thinness of the plate allowed a considerable equalization of temperature by the
conduction of heat. It, was therefore rexolyed to try a thicker plate of meerschaum,
and a plate '25 inch (63 millims.) was introduced in place of that previously tried,
