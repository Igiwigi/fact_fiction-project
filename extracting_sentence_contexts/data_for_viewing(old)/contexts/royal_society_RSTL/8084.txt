338. 'The Table exhibits the generation of the several coyariants; viz. (A, B) denotes
d.A.9,B—0,A..B, (A, BY: denotes ?A . d!B—2d d,A . d,d,B+02A. dB, &c. (se post,
No. 348). The column F, :=(f#f)*, &c. shows Gorpax's notation, and the generation
of his 23 forms ((ff)* written as with him for (F, F)', &c.): it will be observed that
the forms are not identical; if the calculations had been made de novo, I should haye
adopted his yalues, simply omitting numerical factors of the several forms (thus every
term of 4, =(#f')* contains the factor 2. (120), =28800): of course the presence of
these numerical factors renders the F, s, ©, &c. as they stand inconvenient for the
expression of results; and the numerical fixation of the values was no part of GoRDAN's
object. But by reason of the existing Tables the change of notation is in fact more

than this; thus H instead of being a submultiple of (B, C)*, that is, of p, is in fact
=—+E(B,CY*+2B?; and 80 in other cases. If the occasion for it arises, there is no
difficulty in expressing any one of the forms f, 1, ©, &c. in terms of the (A, B, C..V, W);
thus in the instance just referred to, p=(8:)*, we have

£=(/f)*=(A, AY=800 C,
