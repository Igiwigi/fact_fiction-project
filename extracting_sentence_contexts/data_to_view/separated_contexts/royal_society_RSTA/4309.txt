Natural History may be considered in two very different lights: either, 1st, as a collection 2 |
of facts and objects presented by nature, from the examination, analysis, and combination

of which we acquire whatever knowledge we are capable of attaining both of the order of
nature, and of the agents she employs for producing her ends, and from which, therefore,
all sciences arise; or, 2dly, as an assemblage of phenomena to be explained; of effects to be
deduced from causes; and of materials prepared to our hands, for the application of our
principles to useful purposes. Natural history, therefore, considered in the one or the other
of these points of view, is either the beginning or the end of physical science. [1]

1. Biological complexity

Biology cannot escape from the laws of physics and of chemistry; yet biology differs from physics

and chemistry in that living beings show behaviour which, while compatible with these laws, is :B
not observed in other systems; for this reason, we call physical and chemical systems inanimate, as : =
they do not display those qualities inherent in life.
