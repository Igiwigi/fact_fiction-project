Even when the correction involving £ is not applied, so that account is not taken of
the variation of dispersion within the small breadth of the line, the result is
d\ = 0°039 A.U. This would be sufficient to indicate that there was no Diffuse series
component, and it gives an estimate of the comparatively small degree of dependence
of the result on irregularity of dispersion.

(XIX.) Discussion. We may at once state that we have at present no theory to offer for the results
obtained, but it would appear that the changes in relative intensity which we have
found are facts which must be seriously considered in theories of thé origin of spectra
in relation to the structure of the atom. It cannot be said that spectroscopy has
already passed from the descriptive to the rational state. We do not propose to discuss
in detail the bearing of our results on the application of the quantum theory to the origin
of spectra, but attention may be drawn to certain considerations.
