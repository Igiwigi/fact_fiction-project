The mapping


det: ¥(X) > R inherits many of the usual properties from the finite-dimensional case. For
example, detT 40 if and only if T € W(X) MN Iso(X, X). Furthermore, the map T+> det T/| det T|
is continuous on W(X) NM Iso(X, X), despite the fact that det: ¥(X) —> R is not continuous when
dim X=oo. For a thorough discussion of the determinant and its role in Fredholm theory,
see [21]. The parity of a path of Fredholm operators of index zero was introduced in [22] and its role as
an index for bifurcation demonstrated in [23].
