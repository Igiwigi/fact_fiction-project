we reduce the governing
equation to

Viw = 1, (48)
and the boundary conditions to
dw 0
55 = % 5p on the edgesx =+4, y=+4, (49)

when the origin is situated at the centre of the plate. x, y and w are now purely numerical
(they are the quantities which in (28) and (3 A) were denoted by x’, y’, w’).

34. On account of symmetry only one quarter of the plate need be considered, and
further simplification comes from the fact that the boundaries are straight lines
containing rows of nodal points. By displacing simultaneously, and through equal
distances, a nodal point adjacent to the straight boundary and its image point with respect
to that boundary we automatically satisfy the condition dw/dv = 0.
