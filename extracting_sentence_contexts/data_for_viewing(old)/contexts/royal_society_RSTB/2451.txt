OF SPORE-PRODUCING MEMBERS. 63

The sporangia of Zrichomanes speciosum* have been exhaustively treated by
Prantt. I have made observations on several species of the genus which substan-
tially support his facts; but as Prantt did not give drawings of the mature sporangia,
and as numerous drawings of them have been published by various authors which
do not represent their exact form, and frequently take no account of the orientation,
I have represented the sporangia of 7’r. radicans in figs. 99-102, from four different
points of view. Fig. 101 shows the sporangium presenting its central face; the
close analogy with fig. 97 of Hym. dilatatum is obvious, though it is smaller in size,
and with fewer cells in the annulus ; but fluctuations less in extent though similar in
nature are found in 7’. radicans itself, the cells of the annulus varying between 20
and 25. ‘There is also a greater simplicity in the region of the stomium, which in
Trichomanes is represented by two cells only, Fig, 102 represents the “ peripheral”
face, the thin-walled region (“ Platte”) being surrounded by the annulus, which takes
the form of a twisted loop. This twisted form is clearly shown in fig. 99, which
demonstrates also the relation of the sporangium to the receptacle, and that the
