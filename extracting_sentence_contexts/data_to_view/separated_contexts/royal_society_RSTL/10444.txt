PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND

The 8kull of the Tadpole, evidently a mosb generalised structure, covered the whole
question with a cloud of doubt. Since then, whilst wayering, I have collected copious evidence of what sgeems to me
to be a true cond pre-oral rudiment in the antorbital region, and a, first or terminal
rudiment in the front of the face,

I have already shown (* Batrachia, ' Part II, and © Urodeles,” Part I, and in my
papers on the © Selachian and Avian Skulls”) the very constant occurrence of an
ethmo-palatine in seyeral large natural groups of Vertebrata. Here, in the larva of Psendis, I have shown this part partly 8egmented off, and
when not 8egmented off, it is yet very distinet, and not to be misunderstood; it agsumes,
in fact, four positions, each of which is like what is seen in the members, generally, of
ome large group or groups. This large and mosb remarkable conjugational bar is parallel with the skull in the
two first stages (A and B, Plates 2 and 11). So it is in the Siluroid Fishes (e.g., Clarias capensis), where the palatine bone
formed by the ossification of an autogenous cartilage (in these and other Teleostei)
remains distinct, but has no © ethmo-palatine” or ascending process, as in the Salmon.
