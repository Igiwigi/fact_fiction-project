In this ſecond Experiment he

« at Yenice with Signor Pivari. In my Return

Dr,


[ 388 ]

« Dr. Cornelius, who aſſured me, in Preſence of
« Dr. Rzviera, that he alſo had tried a great many
« times to purge others by clectrifying them ; but
« that it had never ſucceeded with him but once,
« which was upon a Maid-Seryant, to whom he had
« oiven ſome Rhubarb to hold in her hand, Not-
<« withſtanding which, finding it never to have pro-
« quced the fame Effet in any other Perſon, it ra-
<« ther ſeemed to him, that ſome other Cauſe might
© have occaſioned what happened to his Maid.
<« Pleaſe to let me know, if in any thing elſe I can
« obey your Commands, and you ſhall eyer find me
« ready, to the beſt of my Ability,” &c. : We ſee then from this Letter, and from the Ac-
count I have before given of my Viſit ro M. Pivari,
that I have not been able to verify at Yenice any of
thoſe Facts, in which my Curioſity was intereſted. I might add alſo (and I ought, without Doubr, ſince
I have engaged to mention exadly cvery thing I have
been able to find out from my Enquiries upon this
SubjeA), that of all the Perſons of the Country,
who have been with M. Pzvarz, to be certified of
the Truth of his Experiment from ocular Demon-
ſtration, and whom I was able to interrogate, I found
but one who atteſted them, as having ſeen them : This was a Phyſician, a Friend of M. P7zvaii, whom
I found at his Houſe, and who had, as he faid, al-
moſt always aſſiſted him in his Experiments.
