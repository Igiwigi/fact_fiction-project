Again, it is a matter of frequent observation in the analysis of coal gas, when the
residue of marsh gas, hydrogen, and carbonic oxide is exploded in an eudiometer,
with a large excess of oxygen, that carbon is deposited towards the bottom of the
tube. When, however, the mixture is sufficiently diluted with air, the marsh gas is
completely burnt. This fact is easily explained on the assumption that in the
explosion-wave (which is set up in marsh gas with oxygen but not with air) the
marsh gas is more or less decomposed in the wave-front, and some of the liberated
carbon escapes combustion by cooling. {

I do not forget that the question raised concerning the breaking up of yet unburnt
compounds in the explosion-wave, may also be asked concerning the elementary mole-
cules. What happens, for instance, to the molecules of oxygen in the wave? When
a molecule of oxygen reacts with a molecule of hydrogen, is an oxygen atom liberated,
and, if so, how far does its existence influence the rate?
