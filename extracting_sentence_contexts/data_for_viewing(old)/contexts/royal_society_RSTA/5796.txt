The second sum is equal to 3 Wa pet Qup (x, x)dadgT. The first one, due to the property div uj =0,
is equal to

where we have also used the assumptions of uniform convergence of the series of the derivatives.


Recall that T(t, x) = (e'40T )(x), see (1.4); from the previous facts we have

d(T — Tg) = («A + Lo)(T — Tg) dt +) uj VT awl.
id

The mild formulation of this identity, furthermore applied in a weak sense to a smooth test
function ¢ with compact support in D, is

(@, TW) — To(t)) = >> i, (eeg, 4: vT()) awl,
id

where (.,-) is the inner product in L?(D) and we have also used the fact that the semigroup e('-5)4o
