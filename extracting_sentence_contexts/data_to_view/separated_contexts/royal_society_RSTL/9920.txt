The agreement, which is shown in diagram IIL., Plate 74, is remarkable. There
are gome discrepancies, but nothing which may nob be explained by inaccuracies,
particularly inaccuracies of temperature.

42. The effect of the temperature above the critical point. â€”TIt is a fact, of striking
8ignificance, physical as well as practical, that while the temperature of the fluid has
8uch an effect at the lower velocities that, ceteris paribus, the discharge will be double
at 45? C. wha it is ab 5* C., 80 little is the effect at the higher velocities that neither
Daxoy or any other experimenter seems to have perceived any effect at all. In my experiments the temperature was constant, 5* C. at the higher velocities, 80
that I had no cause to raise this point till T came to Danor's result, and then, after
perplexing myself considerably to make out what the temperatures were, I noticed
the effect of the temperature is to shift the curves 2 horizontal to 1 vertical, which
corresponds with a slope of 2 to 1, and 80 nearly corresponds with the direction of
the curves at higher velocities that variations of 5? or 10* C. produce no sensible effect ;
or, in other words, the law of resistance at the higher velocity is sensibly independent
of the temperature, 4.e., of the viscosity,

Thus not only does the critical point, the velocity at which eddies come in, diminish
with the viscosity, but the resistance after the eddies are established is nearly, if not
quite, independent of the viscosity.
