To write equations of motion in explicit form, we need vector fields w;(q) which allow us to
express the generalized velocities q in terms of quasi-velocities § = (21, 22, 23,v); see (4.17). For


the considered case, we obtained

2(q) sinh qo Oq1 sinq3 qa cos q3 coth qz qa (6.27)
and w3(q) = sings 2s cos ca — sin g3 coth a

= sinh q2 9q1 % aq2 % P aq3°

Non-vanishing commutators of these fields are
[w1,w2]=—w3,  [w2,w3]= wi, [w3,w1]= —we. (6.28)

With these relations, we obtain

These equations are Hamiltonian with respect to a degenerated Poisson bracket. In fact, denoting
x = (M1,M2,M3,z,p) and

P=|M, M O 0 OO], (6.30)

we can write system (4.29) in the form

Matrix P defines a degenerated Poisson structure of rank four with one Casimir function

7. Pseudo-Euclidean rigid body with a moving point

In this section, we consider a rigid body in the pseudo-Euclidean space with a point with mass
mg which can move in the body frame along a hyperbola. More precisely, we assume that vector
Ro(z) is

Ro(z) = [coshz, sinh z, 0].
