described as the motor tract, and to which the function of volition seems till to be
accorded by VaLexTINÂ®, CareenTERF, and BaLyf, is extended in Iulus, as in other
Articulata, as a separate fasciculus along the upper surface of the cord ; but in these
Myriapoda it is much narrower in proportion to the whole width of the cord than in
insects. This fact is interesting in reference to its presumed function. On a cursory
inspection it does not appear to give off any branches, but seems to pursue its course
uninterruptedly along the whole length of the cord. It does not indeed give off fila-
ments to the nerves from a ganglion immediately opposite to their origin, while pass-
ing over that ganglion, but immediately it has passed one ganglion it gives off the
filaments that proceed to the nerves from the next ganglion.
