Thus the law appears to fit the observations as closely as is possible within the limits
of experimental error. It is worth noting that with these glasses, which contain a
high percentage of lead, no deviations from the law, such as will be shown later to
take place in some borosilicates, appear to exist. Nevertheless one important experimental fact throws doubt on the universal
validity of the linear law, even for lead glasses. Pockets has shown (‘ Ann. d.
