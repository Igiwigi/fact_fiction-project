'The gases, it will be observed, exhibit a gradually increasing power of dynamic radia-
tion from carbonic oxide up to olefiant gas. This is most clearly illustrated by refer-

ence to the results obtained in the respective cases with the first length of the second
chamber. They are as follows :—

Its proximity to the pile, and the fact of its "FIG bes cross but one plate of alt.
makes the action of the second chamber much greater than that of the first. Each of the Tables exhibits the fact that as the length of the chamber increases the
dynamic radiation of the gas contained in it increases, and as the length diminishes the
radiation diminishes. We also see how powerfully the gas in the second chamber
acts upon the radiation from the first.
