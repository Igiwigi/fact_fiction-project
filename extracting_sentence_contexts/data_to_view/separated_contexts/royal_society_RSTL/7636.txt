I was therefore obliged to conclude that very
little was known about this point, probably in consequence of the difficulty of accurately
examining such minute parts at an early period of development, and I was hence led to
attempt the obseryations recorded in the present paper. 'They were made during the
years 1865, 1866, and 1867, on the embryo of the common domestic fowl, artificially
incubated. Though not nearly as complete as T could have wished them to be, they
nevertheless demonstrate certain new and interesting facts connected with the develop-
ment of the semilunar valves, and the formation of the aorta and pulmonary artery in
the bird's heart. These appear to me to be valuable, as possibly throwing light on some
of the congenital malformations of this part of the heart. In working at the deyelop-
ment of the semilunar valves, I was also obliged to examine very closely into the mode
of division of the truncus arteriosus into two vessels, and found that the manner in which
it becomes divided differs from that usually described to occur in some very important
particulars.
