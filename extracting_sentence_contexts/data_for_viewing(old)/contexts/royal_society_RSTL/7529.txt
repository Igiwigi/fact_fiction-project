OF THE BLADDER AND PROSTATE. 27

The fibres which can with any degree of propriety be regarded as pursuing a
longitudinal or vertical direction are comparatively few, and are confined to the
anterior, posterior, or lateral s8wrfaces. They are best seen in the bladders of the
lower animals.

2nd. External layer, consisting of fibres arranged in attenuated fiqure-of-eight loops.—
Returning to the anterior aspect, we observe that at a point about half an inch above
the cervix the fibres diverge from the mesial line gradually and with great regularity in
an upward and downward direction; they in fact cross each other, and form figure-of-
eight loops (Plate III. figs. 1 & 2, cd ef), the more attenuated"of which are nearest to
the line in question. 'These loops are placed beneath the longitudinal fibres, and are 80

A arranged that they include the urachus (a) and urethra (6) in their terminal portions.
© SABATIER®, as was explained, obseryed a sinular looped arrangement, and described the
Z fibres which embrace the urachus and urethra, and are continued on the anterior surface
SZ as oval fibres. He was not aware that the fibres crossed each other and formed figure-
= of-eight loops. If a single fibre were taken, it might be regarded as setting out from
> the left side of the nrachus and running in a spiral direction from left to right down-
wards, until it reached the cervix, round which it curves to proceed in an opposite direc-
'S tion, or from right to left upwards. The course of the fibre in question is indicated at
= Plate V. diagram 1, cd ef. The looped fibres form a figure-of-eight patch or layer which
