(a) Clarifying the inference process

My position regarding reported conclusions in fingerprint
matters was expressed in 2008 already [70]: experts shall
abandon the _identification/individualization conclusion
altogether. Cole followed with the same recommendation in
2009 [71] and some fingerprint experts start to come to the
same conclusion [72]. A proper evaluation of the findings
calls for an assignment of two probabilities. The ratio between
these two probabilities gives all the required information that
allows discriminating between the two propositions at hand
and the fact finder to take a stand on the case. This approach
is what is generally called the Bayesian framework [73]. Noth-
ing prevents its adoption for fingerprint evidence. That vision
just acknowledges the fundamental contribution of Bieder-
mann et al. [74,75] on the topic of decision theory. Cole [14]
rightly expressed his surprise that SWGFAST was not endor-
sing decision theory, as in Biedermann et al. [74], to justify its
choice for the term ‘decision’ in the definition of identification.
This is a mistake; decision theory is the only logical way to
understand and justify current practices.

Another, more fundamental point is that SWGFAST
appears to misconceive the nature of decision theory as it is
