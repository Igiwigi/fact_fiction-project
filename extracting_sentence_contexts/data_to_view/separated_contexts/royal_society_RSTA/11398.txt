Allowing an experimental uncertainty of 20 per cent., no
~change could be detected in the leak due to the diffusion of hydrogen through the
wire. This strongly supports the view, which also seems required on other grounds,
that the hydrogen does not act per se, but produces some change in the platinum
surface, and this change is prevented from taking place if the platinum is heated
in air,*

In contrast to the negative ionisation, the positive ionisation produced by the hot
platinum tube was found to be altered when hydrogen was allowed to diffuse through
from inside. In fact, at constant temperature an additional amount of ionisation is
eaused thereby which is proportional to the amount of hydrogen diffusing through
the tube. At high temperatures the positive ionisation was found to be readily saturated. Thus at 1200Â° C. the leak with +80 volts was equal to 64 divisions, and with
+400 volts 75 divisions with air inside the tube; with hydrogen diffusing through,
the values under these voltages were 88 and 95 divisions respectively.
