Accordingly, we shall usually state the results without the
calculations, the laborious character of which is greatly lightened by using the leading
terms of the covariants only. We have

V/W, ¢ (%4) = % =e t+ {Wy (W,, ws) — wy (wy, Wy)}.

Inserting the values of the invariants which occur in this equation, and using the
relation

on using the expression for ¢ (7) obtained in § 40. The fact that the value of
