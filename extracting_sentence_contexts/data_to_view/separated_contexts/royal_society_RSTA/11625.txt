SytvestTEr’s theory is, in fact, not only a theory of the partitions of a number A,
‘© but also a theory of the multipartite numbers whose content is A. For purpose of
generalization I prefer to regard it from the latter point of view. If we consider the graphically regularised partition

it is clear that we may pile B upon A, and then C upon B, &c., and thus form a

which is regularised in three-dimensions just as the Sylvester-graphs are regularised
