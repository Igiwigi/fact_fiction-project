few minutes to a temperature a little above 400°, with the result that all the masses
of H have broken up into 7 and liquid. The pattern, resembling that of 93, produced
by the mercury boiling, can still, however, be traced.

Fig. 100 records an early attempt to study the reaction of the H temperature. A
considerable mass of the alloy Sn 90 was maintained for several hours at a temperature
slightly below 400°, and it was automatically stirred by means of a massive copper
stirrer made of coils of thick wire. The reaction, which produced nothing but H, was
continued until the stirring was brought to an end by the large quantity of solid H
that had formed. The ingot was then cut and polished as usual. A comparison with
fig. 89 makes the great increase in the amount of H very evident.

The Isolation and Analysis of the Bodies » and H.—The fact observed during the
etching of the alloys, that hydrochloric acid has no perceptible action on the crystals
of y or H, can be utilised for the separation of these bodies from an alloy in which
one of them is present together with tin. If we wish to get pure y, the alloy must
be sharply chilled at a temperature above 400°; to obtain pure H, the alloy must
have been maintained at a temperature a little below 400° for a period long enough
to transform all the y. It is in the observance of these two precautions that our
method of isolating the substances constitutes an advance on previous work. We
find that the ingots of alloy are rapidly disintegrated by the action of strong
