maximum temperature reading and the maximum diminution of the nerve response is probably

:

owing to the “lag” of the apparatus between the nerve and the source of heat. The nerve

was ina glass chamber in a copper oven, under which a small spirit-lamp flame was placed at «
and removed at w. The temperature chart below is that of corresponding readings each minute
of a thermometer in the oven. No marked effect occurs with a rise of at least 10°; with a rise to
38°—viz., of 20°--the response diminishes; with the subsequent fall of temperature the response
increases again.

The record is given in illustration of the fact that the response of fresh nerve is not affected by slight
variations of temperature. The effects of considerable variations, as regards the character and sign

of the response, will be described and considered in connection with the detailed study of positive
and negative effects of excitation.

N.B.—The actual magnitudes of excursions, e.g., in fig. 13, as compared with fig. 12, are of no account
as indicative of magnitudes of nerve-effects in terms of potential. The resistance differs in different
nerves, and the galyanometer is more or less shunted. The magnitudes of excursions must in all
cases be compared with the magnitude of the standard excursion by 0-001 volt taken at beginning

and end of each observation.
