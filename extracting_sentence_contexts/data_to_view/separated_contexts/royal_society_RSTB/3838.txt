This floor is
best studied in the Midland area, where the measures rest directly on Silurian
rocks, except in the Southern and Northern parts of the field, where there is some
evidence of the existence of Old Red Sandstone,t Carboniferous Limestone,{ and
Millstone Grit. We have, then, prior to the beginning of Upper Carboniferous times, the existence
of an uneven§ and, in part, folded floor, on which the Coal Measures were
eventually deposited. This fact, I believe, is more than any other the key to the
solution of the difficult stratigraphy of the Wyre Forest and the neighbouring
coalfields. With the commencement of the Upper Carboniferous period we find the denudation
of this ancient floor still in progress, and that it continued during the period when the
Millstone Grit and Lower Coal Measures were being deposited in the Southern and :
Northern Pennine areas. There is no real evidence that true Millstone Grits were
ever laid down along the Welsh Borderland, for there is very little doubt that
the beds so named, which occupy a very limited area in Coalbrookdale, and
perhaps at Baginswood, to the west of the Highley Region, will eventually share
the same fate as those of Titterstone Clee Hill,|| which have been recently shown
to belong to the Lower Carboniferous Series, and to be unconformable to the true
Coal Measures there developed.
