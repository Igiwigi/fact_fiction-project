For such points we can approximate further in (82) to obtain
the form (73) already used in the derivation of the asymptotic form for Q(¢), namely,

p(t, —X,y) ~1 2 tog 4R, (t/R large, R large). (73 bis)

(b) R large, t—R large
These conditions are those necessary for the slit to behave effectively as a simple two-
dimensional source, and the pressure is therefore given by equation (70) or its equivalent

equation (72). If we use Q(t) = 0 for t<0and change the integration variable in (70) to ry, we can write
the approximation in the third form

p(t —Xy) ~ ~if + HH ee vary (R large, t—R large). (86)

When R is very large so that ¢—R can be oe but (¢—R)/R small, we can approximate
further to equation (86) and write

) w Qlt—B)

JR? Q(t) = 2 Oa,

p(t, —Xy
(t—R large, (t—R)/R small). (87)

For a point of very large R the approximation (86) will become valid when ¢— R becomes
large and will in fact remain valid thereafter. However, in the early stages of its validity it
will be simpler to use the form (87), whilst ultimately the more convenient solution (73)
becomes valid. It will be noted that the form (86) and its special case (87) involve arguments of Q from
0 to t—R, but, in general, these forms are only strictly valid when the contributions from
large arguments predominate.
