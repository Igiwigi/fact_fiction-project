The
arrear on this occasion was therefore about 10 on the side of the higher dips, it
having been about 12* on the side of the lower dips when the ship arrived, in 1840,
at the same station from localities of lower dip. The experiments at the Cape in April 1843 were the last, I understand, that were
made in the Erebus during the progress of the voyage, for the purpose of examining
the influence of the ship's iron on her compass by the usual process of swinging the
ship: and by an unfortunate misunderstanding, the repetition of the experiments on
the return of the vyessel to the Thames, which had been ordered by the Admiralty,
and was fully designed to have taken place by Sir James Ross, was also omitted
It appears therefore that in every instance in which the proper experiments were
made, the disturbances were found to be consistent with the hypothesis of an induced
magnetism conforming gradually to the changes in the terrestrial magnetic pheno-
mena occasioned by the changes in the ship's geographical position, but not changing
simultaneously with those changes. But whether the hypothesis of a gradual conformity of a part of the ship's iron,
instead of an instantaneous conformity of the whole, to changes of the terrestrial
dip, be or be not the true explanation of the facts which have been thus pointed out,
the facts themselves are highly deserving of consideration by those to whom the cor-
rection of compass errors is of consequence ; the anomalies which present themselyes
to any previously entertained systematic view are of too large amount, as well as too
consistent on the different points, both in the observations at sea and in harbour, to

be ascribed either to errors of obseryation or to accidents; and the promineney which
has been given to them on this occasion will not be misplaced, if it should serve to
impress upon those who have the power of carrying out practical snggestions, the
importance of giving a sufficient trial to the method proposed by Mr. ArxcuBarp
Smrrn in the eighth number of the Magnetic Contributions, whereby the variable
term in the correction formula may be at all times determined experimentally at sea,
by deflections of the compass needle obtained with the sbip's head on two opposite
points of the compass. The observations needed are extremely simple, require no
unusual circumstances of weather and no reference to celestial objects, and need
occupy but a very few minutes.
