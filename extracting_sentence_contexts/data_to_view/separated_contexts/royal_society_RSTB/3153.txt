t Op. cit., p. 83. THE DIURNAL CURVE OF THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ANIMAL BODY. 223

* Since the temperature of the human body can only be considered as the result of
continual production and losses of heat, of varying amounts, it appears a very
remarkable fact that the sum total* should always remain so nearly the same (under
the operation of so many, and doubtless every moment changing processes and
influences) that the internal temperature varies by little more than a degree
Centigrade.”

“What Lavorsrer has said of the body-weight—‘ Quelle quantité d’aliments que
Yon prenne, le méme individu revient tous les jours aprés la révolution des 24 heures
au méme poids d peu prés qu'il avait la veille, pourvu qu'il soit d'une forte santé, que
sa digestion se fasse bien, qu'il ne s’engraisse pas, qu'il ne soit pas dans un état de
croissance, et quil évite les excés, may be said with still greater aa otal of the
temperature of the body.”

It must strike all who have read the remarks which I have made on JURGENSEN’s
painstaking observations, how coarse was the method employed and how great
were its inherent errors. To keep a rigid glass thermometer for 24 hours, and
in one case as long as six days, permanently in the rectum, would necessarily produce
local congestion and irritation, which would materially falsify the observations ; that
such results actually occurred from time to time is frankly admitted by JiircENsEN. But there is a further observation to be made, viz., that the error due to the
constantly varying personal equation of the weary nurses who, through the long
night, had to take readings of the thermometer every five minutes, must have been
very great indeed.
