The lighter orange shaded area still represents the sensitivity using a maximum
value of H, as low as 0.5 m, and Sig is computed using Avo: The thin solid line with crosses represents the evolution of 54), with

belongs to the observed wMIZ but not to the modelled one, and Aj; as the area where the model
and observation agree that a given location belongs to the wMIZ. A classical way of assessing
the ability of a model to capture an extent is to use Ay; and the errors Aig and Ag to assign a
model score [45]. In our case, we are challenged by the fact that an absence of detected waves is
not necessarily indicative of a region without waves, particularly if an area has few wave events
in each month. Thus, the IS-2 dataset can provide a large number of false negatives, and a low
WAF value (i.e. no waves detected) is less predictive of wave state than a high WAF value. This
is visible in figures 1a and 2, where areas with a high density of detected waves (WAF > 0.1) are
interspersed with missing values and locations with WAF =0.
