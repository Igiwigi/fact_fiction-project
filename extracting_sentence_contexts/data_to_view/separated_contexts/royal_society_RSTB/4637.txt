Sections were made through this line, and Plate 2, fig. 18, shows the point of
junction, p, between it and the iridescent chitin. The latter has a cuticle, c,
beneath which the pigment is quite opaque. The red portion is raised into curious
cone-shaped papilla, b, which contain much less pigment than is shown in the
illustration, The red colour is due to the fact that the underlying tissues, which are
pigmented red, show through the transparent chitinous layer.

be a vivid apple-green, and in specimens preserved in alcohol this colour persists.
