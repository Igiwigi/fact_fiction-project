P and P’ are tubes soldered on to the upper brass covering of the chamber in order
to afford an entrance for the gas or vapour, and also to admit of the vessel being
connected to a gauge or pump. In order to keep the vessel air-tight, a rubber band,
with a mixture of beeswax and resin spread uniformly over its surfaces, was inserted
between the outer brass and aluminium coverings which, after being heated, were
screwed tightly together.

Electrometer.—The electrometer was of the Dolezalek pattern with a platinum
suspension. The needle was charged to a potential of 80 volts, which was found to
be the voltage most suitable for the conditions of the experiment ; with this potential,
which did not however correspond to the most sensitive condition, the electrometer
afforded a deflection per volt of 420 mm. on a scale about 1 metre distant. As a
matter of fact, an exact determination of the sensitiveness of the electrometer was
not essential in the present investigation inasmuch as it is only the sign of the
charge that it is necessary to know in order to determine the points of discontinuous
curvature referred to in section 2.

The leads from the upper electrodes to the electrometer quadrants were all screened
by brass tubing kept at zero potential.

4, Sources of Error.—A. Theoretical Assumptions.

Duration of Réntgen - ray Discharge.—It is assumed in the theory that the
duration of the discharge proceeding from the Réntgen-ray bulb is small compared
with the time an ion takes to describe the distance between the electrodes. This
