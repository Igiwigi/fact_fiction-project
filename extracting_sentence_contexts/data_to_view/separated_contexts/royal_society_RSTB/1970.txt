Finally a tube of broth inoculated with fresh spores
on December 30th, at 5 p.m., and kept at 23° C., showed at 9 a.m. the next day a
slight turbidity, which was found to consist of actively motile rods and chains. The
latter retained their motility longer than I had ever observed before, chains of seven
or even eight rods still exhibiting slight undulating and rotary motions at the end
of 12 hours. These observations are important, since the fact of motility might very
easily be overlooked, confined, as it is, to the youngest stages of the rods and to
a comparatively brief period of time, and to special media. Tn old cultures or in cultures made under unfavourable conditions, involution forms
are produced in great numbers and astonishing varieties. Plate 16, fig. 6 shows a
number of these forms from a culture six weeks old on saccharose-agar at 33°.
