8 § 15. The declination (see Table V.) is the element in which the non-cyclie effect is
mallest and most variable in sign. The D curves are read only to the nearest 01,

a that apparent non-cyclie changes of this amount on individual days possess little,

Af any, significance. If we take the last six years in Table V., we see that the mean
non-cyclic effect for the year in no case exceeds 0/05, and if we combine these six
years, we obtain a mean non-cyclic effect which absolutely vanishes. Again, while
the mean non-eyclic effects for 1890 and 1891 are of substantial size, they are opposite
in sign.

These facts are certainly calculated to rouse suspicions as to the bond fide nature of
the non-cyclic effect in D, There are, however, a variety of considerations which
point to its having a real physical origin.

In the first place, the contribution of the true secular change to the mean non-cyclic
effect in D, viz., — 0/016, is in the opposite direction to the resultant effect, so that
