In this
- experiment is brought before us, in a very forcible manner, the very slight difference
which truly separates the phenomena of oxidation and reduction, which are usually
regarded as $0 distinct. In speaking of the formation of sulphuric acid, I have said
that the oxidation of sulphurous acid by nitric acid is to be attributed to a polar
condition of the oxygen liberated from the nitric acid, which polar condition is in-
duced by the formation of hyponitric acid within the system of which it forms a part. Now the formation of water in the peroxide of hydrogen is a fact precisely similar
to the formation of the hyponitric acid in the nitric acid, and it might reasonably
be anticipated that this oxygen would have a similar oxidizing power, This is in
truth the case; for when the temperature is low, the solutions dilute, and the experi-
ment carefully managed, no gas is given off, but a deep blue solution is formed,
containing perhaps, as stated by Barrtswil*, who first examined this reaction, a
higher oxide of chrome. This solution however rapidly decomposes, oxygen is
evolyed, the blue colour disappears, and the final result is the same as if the com-
pound had never been formed, When manganate of potash, peroxide of manganese
and various other substances are snbstituted for the chromate of potasb in this expe-
riment, a similar decomposition takes place, but without any signs of the intermediate
stage of oxidation. Under other cireumstances the oxidation and reduction may be
Separated, Thus, when peroxide of barium is thrown into an acid solution of the
prussiate of potash, the prussiate is oxidized and the red prussiate is formed.
