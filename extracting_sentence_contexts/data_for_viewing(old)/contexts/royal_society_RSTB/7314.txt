was in use. The usual convention has been adopted, namely, that the visual acuity is unity
when the widths of the lines of which the characters are composed, subtend an angle at the
eye of 1 min. of arc. In the case of Landolt’s ‘broken C’, it is the gap in the C which
subtends this angle at the eye of the observer. Thus, in both cases, a visual acuity of 1-7
would indicate that the visual angle was 0-59 min. of arc. It will be observed, with both
kinds of test object, that the acuity when using blue light, instead of giving better results
than with green light, actually gave somewhat worse. It will be remembered that both
Kénig and Roaf obtained a similar result. So that in these cases also, acuity does not
appear to be dependent on diffraction at the pupil, but on some other factor. It seemed
unlikely that this factor would be chromatic aberration, because if it were, a coloured light
should give a better result than a white one, and such is not found to be the case. Neither
does the difference threshold for light intensity seem a likely factor, because in this case the
fact that the white light was twelve times as bright as any of the coloured lights would have
caused the visual acuity for white light to be substantially better than that for the colours,
and this was not found to be the case.

The most likely factor appeared to be the retinal mosaic. But if this were the case, it
would be expected that the result with white light would be markedly superior to that given
by any coloured light, because, as has been pointed out above, white light stimulates all
the foveal receptors, while coloured light stimulates only a few. But the author did not
find this, because the acuity he obtained by coloured lights, particularly by green light,
was substantially equal to that obtained by white light. Other observers, except Roaf,
