F., for the initial 4;-inch intervals on the three respective ruled scales A, B, and C, are
thus :—

For scale A, ac = 4832-7

»  B, sv = 4835-8
»  C, BS = 4835-8.

302 A. BE. H. TUTTON ON DETERMINATION OF

The facts that the #,-inch intervals for seales B and C were identical, and that both
were 3-1 bands larger than the corresponding interval on scale A, were confirmed
several times over by direct comparison on the wave-length comparator.
