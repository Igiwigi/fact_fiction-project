and so, since 39 =0, we have 3(f) =0 for all t €[0,T], ie. u(t)=v(t) for all t €[0,T]. So strong
solutions” are unique.

However, while strong solutions are unique, we cannot in general guarantee that they exist for
all time, only for a short time that depends on the size of the initial enstrophy. Nevertheless, if the
initial enstrophy is sufficiently small then we can prove the existence of strong solutions for all

7Note that the solution v does not occur explicitly in the right-hand side of (5.5); this suggests that in fact strong solutions are
unique in the larger class of all weak solutions. There is currently no proof of the result in this generality; rather, it is known
that strong solutions are unique in the class of all weak solutions that satisfy the ‘energy inequality’, which is (4.10) allowing
only s =0 (this result is due to Serrin [22], see also [3] or §6.3 in [5]).
