However,
to these locations [82]. The nuclear periphery comprises the imaging using X painting probes has demonstrated that both
nuclear membrane consisting of lipid bilayers traversed by Xa and Xi are often located close to the nuclear periphery
the nuclear pores and the internal lamina, which contains [17]. Surprisingly, this same study also showed that the Xi
lamin fibres that interact with chromatin at the LADs located had, in fact, a distinctly more internal nuclear position than
throughout the genome [83-85]. The nucleolus interacts the Xa, which was interpreted as possibly due to the Xaâ€™s
with the chromatin at the nucleolus-associated domains elongated structure resulting in a higher frequency of appar-
(NADs), and these interactions may be facilitated by proteins ent periphery touching [17]. An alternative explanation is that
located at its edge (such as nucleophosmin) and by internal the Xa, which is upregulated to balance expression of
proteins (such as fibrillarin) that interact with ribosomal X-linked and autosomal genes, may be preferentially located
RNA genes [82,86,87].
