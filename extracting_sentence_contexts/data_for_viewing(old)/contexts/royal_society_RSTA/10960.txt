proportional to 7, not to 7°. In fact, the taller the component curves are, the
narrower they are. This consideration is overlooked if we allow ourselves to substitute
the maxima of the curves for the curves themselves when these become narrow.

§ 53. This latter source of error, by which 7* is substituted for 7, will not affect the
shape of the resultant energy-curve if the average length of train is taken to be
independent of the velocity. But we have seen that greater velocities give shorter
trains. And this error tends in the same direction as the other ; for it gives too great
prominence to the longer trains, i.e., to the smaller velocities, which velocities send
light to the middle of the spectrum line. Hence the effect of the error is to make the
resultant curve too steep.

Accordingly, the only accurate way of investigating the limiting width for zero
