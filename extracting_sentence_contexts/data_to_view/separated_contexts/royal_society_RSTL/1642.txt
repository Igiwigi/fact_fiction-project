It was not till the revival of science in Europe that the
two great philosophers, HuyGnEens and Newton, first en-
gaged-in the consideration of this question, and reduced to
the known laws of mechanics, the principles on which the
figure of the earth should be determined. They demonstrated that the rotatory motion should occa-
sion differences in the force of gravity-in different latitudes,
and consequently that parts of the earth in the neghbourhood
of the equator $hould' be more elevated than those near'the

poles. The most simple hypothesis; which first presented itself to


322 Don J. Ropn16vez's Observations on the

their'imagination, was that which supposed the earth to be
throughout composed of the same kind of matter, and its sur-
face that of a spheroid generated by revolution round its axis,
This hypothesis, adopted by Newrox only as an approximation
to the truth, is, in fact, perfectly consistent with the equilibrium
to which particles in a state of paste, or of tardy fluidity, would
arrive in a short time after their present motion was impressed;
and the eccentricity derived from this hypothesis is at least
not very remote from that which actually obtains in the pre-
sent state of consistence and stability which the earth has since
acquired. But the homogeneity of the matter, of which the earth con-
8ists, is at variance with all geological observations, which
prove evidently that at least 5ooo toises of the exterior crust
is formed of an immense mass of heterogeneous matters vary-
ing in density from each other ; and upon the supposition of
a tate of fluidity of the whole, it should follow that the strata
should snccessively increase in density from the surface to-
wards the centre, that the more dense would accordingly be
subjected to less of centrifugal force, and consequently that
the spheroidical form resulting from this cause would be less
eccentric than would arise from a state of perfect homoge-
neity. The most simple, as well as the most effectual means of
verifying the hypothesis respecting the figure of the earth, is
to measure in the two hemispheres several arcs of its meri-
dians in different latitudes, at some distance from each other.
