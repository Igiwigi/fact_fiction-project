is that this one could be interpreted as the version without
replacement (see [10]). The difference between the two versions
disappears when groups are large; for m-— oo, aggregate
benefits and (net) costs become the same in both versions, and
also the difference between the two Fsr’s, disappears. Group
selection, however, may very well take place with groups of
limited size, where these differences are not negligible.

To more generally reiterate the point that equation (2.7) is not
