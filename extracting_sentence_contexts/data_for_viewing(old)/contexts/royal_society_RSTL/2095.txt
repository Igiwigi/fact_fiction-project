This experiment presents the same results as the preceding
one; and shows, that the observed fact is not influenced by
the eccentric position of the source of heat.

As the silver wire, from which the needles were sus-
pended, had been unwound from a small cylinder, I thought
it probable that it might be a little twisted ; in which case it
would, from the weight of the needle, untwist until counter-
balanced by the elasticity of the wire. If, in these circum-
stances, heat were applied, it might happen that the elasticity
of the wire would be altered, and consequently, from that
circumstance alone, that the needle might change its position.
If this were the case, on reversing the direction of rotation
