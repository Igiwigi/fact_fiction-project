except for a few fibres, become detatched from its
normal insertion, the epiphysis of the postero-medial
process of the hyoid. This may be an abnormality
in this specimen, but is the same on both sides.

aponeurosis of intermandibularis M. dilatator lary ngis with a narrow insertion on the

posterior, hiding intermandibularis anterior part of the arytenoid, overlapped here by the
anterior. constrictor externus, which becomes narrow posteriorly,
and is attached to the tip of the epiphysis of the
postero-medial process, wedged between this and the spoon-shaped lateral process of the
cricoid. M. constrictor laryngis anterior with the usual relationships, but appearing
complicated owing to the fact that some of its fibres cross each other, while others
are continuous from right to left sides. M. constrictor laryngis posterior well developed,
interrupted by the muscular process of the cricoid.
