amount of fixation, indicating, M. Jounm thinks, how necessary is a due balance of the
mineral supplies for the full development of the action.

Tn the second series, as in the first, the unfavourable influence of organic manures
was obvious.

M. Jour concludes that his own results, like those of M. Berruenot, show that
the fixation of nitrogen is due to a physiological action. Microbes play an important
part; and his own experiments show that the action is developed in the absence of
clay. His results were not very favourable to the supposition that the plants them-
selves effected the fixation; but he considers that further comparative experiments,
with and without vegetation, are necessary to settle the point. For the present he
limits himself to the establishment of the great fact of the fixation of the free nitrogen
of the atmosphere, leaving to the future the exact explanation.

In order to show the practical importance of the fixation of free nitrogen, M. Joutre
takes for illustration the results of the experiment No. 5, in the first series, in which
the largest amount of gain was indicated. In that experiment the complete mineral
manure, with caustic lime in addition, was used, without any artificial supply of nitrogen.
At the commencement the soil contained 1째56 gram, and at the conclusion 2째042 grams

of nitrogen, and the crops contained 0째3834 gram, showing a total gain, therefore, of
0째8654 gram nitrogen. As the soil in the pots was 10 cm. deep, he calculates that
this would correspond to 1144 kilograms of nitrogen fixed per hectare weighing
2000 tonnes (= 1021 Ibs, nitrogen per acre). Or, reckoning only according to the
