The following observations will serve to show this —

*Another specimen was divided into two hemispheres. Tn one hemisphere two

connexions,

then well rubbed with sandpaper and brickdust.* The spines along these lines were
laid in a very marked way, while spontaneity and reflex irritability, not only along
them, but also in the inter-ambulaeral spaces between them, were completely destroyed.
