ducible, confirming that the modulations have some fundamental origin rather than one
associated with an instrumental feature or with slight errors in angles. If it were not for the
shape of the modulations, a simple explanation of the fact that the envelopes of the maxima
and minima are not mirror images of each other would be that the modulations are caused
by the presence of a periodic term with the low frequency of the modulation itself, rather
than a frequency close to that of the fundamental, but the fact that the distance between
the upper and the lower envelope curves itself varies periodically, and other considerations
discussed below make this explanation improbable.

The variation of the fundamental period with orientation is summarized in table 4 and
figure 10. Since tin is tetragonal, the simplest representation would be by a single ellipsoid
with m, = my; this would cause the square of the period to vary as

m, cos? f+ m, sin? yf, (11)
which is in satisfactory agreement with the observed behaviour for small values of y, if it
