where F, is the left-hand side of the second component of the vectorial Wiener-Hopf
equation (2.14), while F is given in (2.12). In (3.12) and below, we denote the £2 norm on R by
Il - ll2.

Additionally, in these figures, we also show the distributions of three measures: the quantity
5F, mentioned above, and the norms of difference between the consecutive iterative steps
WRiga — Rn lo, Wy — Zi lz, to provide a fuller picture of the numerical method’s rate of
convergence.

One can observe in figure 3 that the iterative method (3.6) converges faster (in terms of the
number of iterations) and gives more accurate results for higher values of L,. However, it is
important to account for the fact that functions Z*(t) and R~(f) oscillate with frequencies that
grow as we increase L,. and, consequently, a larger number of mesh nodes N are needed to account
for this. This, in turn, makes each individual iteration more time-consuming.

To further clarify this point, and the dependence of the final algorithm on the number of
integration points N, in figure 4 the same graphs are provided for fixed N = 800 with differing
values of L,. It is clear that the number of iterations needed to reach the saturation limit decreases
with increasing L,. On the other hand, for a fixed value of N, the numerical method gives more
accurate results for smaller values of L,. The latter issue is eliminated by taking the number of
mesh nodes N as a function of L,, as demonstrated by the results in figure 3.

It is worth noting that calculating the functions Z;}, Rj; at each step of the iterative process
(3.6) only involves evaluating the singular integrals within (3.10), while K* and T* remain the
