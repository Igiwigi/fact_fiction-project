In writing of “ Differentiation in Sexuality,” in relation to Pineus pini, however,
Marcuat’s arguments do not seem consistent. He says, “ Productivity is attenuated
through the succeeding generations (migrantes and exsules)*, and in the spring
appear the Sexupare, which constitute a means of return to sexuality.” Now in no
known Chermesine is the productivity attenuated through the succeeding genera-
tions, for the Sistens type, in all genera and species, if not quite so highly productive
as the Fundatrix, is certainly much more so than the Gallicola migrans, the generation
which preceded it. In Dreyfusia niisslini, B., again, the Sistens and Fundatrix are
identical in structure and productivity upon Marcuat’s own showing. The pro-
ductivity thus alternates in successive generations as far as the main cycle is
concerned,

With the main facts in hand, it appears that the cycle of Chermesina is explicable
only upon the lines now to be laid out.

In the first place, we must assume that the primitive insects from which the
Chermesinze sprang lived upon some species of Spruce, were winged, and of both
sexes. In the second, that parthenogenesis set in early by the production of a
primitive Fundatrix, which again produced the winged Sexuales, thus starting an
alternation of form. Next, that the male Sexualis dropped out, making partheno-
genesis complete, and giving an alternating cycle, thus :—
