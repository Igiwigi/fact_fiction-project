On the con-
trary, a large number of reports support the idea that NO
can inactivate COX2 [87,88]. In several experimental
models, COX2 has been linked to anti-inflammatory and
neuroprotective properties [89,90]. In fact, prolonged overex-
pression of COX2 in the brain has been associated with the
delayed cell death that occurs after many types of brain
injuries [91]. These apparently contradictory results of NO
influence on COX2 expression may be related to the levels
of NO, the cell type and/or the state of activation of the
cells [83,92]. Another possibility would be COX2 expression regulation
of transcription, since COX2 end products can modulate gene
expression [93].
