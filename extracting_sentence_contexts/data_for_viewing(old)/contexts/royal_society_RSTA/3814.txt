The spectral estimate consists of a single multiplication of the complex-valued kernel and the
Fourier-space representation of the unconditional input. Hence, during estimation, all coherent
large scales are weighted properly via the gain (figure 3a), while the scale-dependent phase
(figure 3b) efficiently accounts for the correct stochastic shift in time. A snapshot of a flow field
estimate, ii(z,f), for a random segment of the input signal, (zw, t), is shown in figure 4. Time
histories at each wall-normal position are shown in inner-normalized form, with high- and low-
speed zones marked with black and blue lines, respectively. The unfiltered input signal, u(Zw, t), is
shown at its near-wall position of z}, ~ 4.3, alongside a long-wavelength pass-filtered equivalent
with 4; > 7000. Per the kernel gain |H|, only the larger scales of the unfiltered input are included
in the stochastic estimate. In fact, the linear transfer kernel is an inherent scale filter since only
the scales that are coherent between the input (zw) and output (z) are included in the estimate,
while the incoherent scales cannot be estimated (|H| ~ 0 for these scales). For one outer-region
location, za ~ 464, we have shown a comparison of the estimated and measured fluctuations
(top of figure 4). Visual inspection reveals that the estimate captures the large-scale content of
the direct measurement reasonably well. Notably, when high- and low-speed zones in the input
occur with a longer duration (gleaned from the filtered input signal shown for reference at the
bottom of figure 4), they penetrate further into the estimated field (to higher z locations); this is
an instantaneous visual of the wall scaling in figure 3a.
