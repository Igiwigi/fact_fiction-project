& From the experiments described, a 0-012in. filling plate would appear to be the most
@ serviceable for general use.
9 In exploratory experiments a 0-024in. plate was used for 664, mercury fulminate and
S Service azide, and an 0-008 in. plate was used for basic lead styphnate and A.S.A. It was
= verified in the case of lead styphnate that 0-008 and 0-024 in. filling plates gave practically
& the same curve of sensitiveness. Since the probability of detonation did not appear to be
= sensitive to the thickness of explosive used, the thickness of the plate was selected to give
€ easy filling and a good detonation, with the minimum quantity of explosive.
& Checks with an inert material were made to test the weight constancy of the explosive
® retained by the holes in the filling plates. When no brass disks were used, it was found that
§ the weights delivered on each Hoffman roller were constant to + 1-5 %. With a bottom brass
g disk, the variation in weight of explosive was somewhat larger (+4-5°%), owing to small
A differences in thickness and curvature of the disks. In view of the fact that the probability of
detonation does not appear to be sensitive to the thickness of the layer of explosive, within
the range investigated, these minor variations in weight may be neglected.

Discussion

The following comments may be made on the results listed in table 50.

(1) It will be noted that with the exception of compositions based on mercury fulminate or
L.D.N.R. (lead di-nitro-resorcinate), the percussion sensitiveness of all the other initiators
listed in table 50 is of the same order.
