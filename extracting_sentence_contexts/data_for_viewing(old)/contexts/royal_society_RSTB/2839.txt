Lane remarks on the sharpness of the contrast between the tissues of the one
generation and of the other.{ Unfortunately attempts to trace the nuclear conditions
which accompany these vegetative transitions in the Archegoniatz have so far been
without result, and a decisive opinion on nuclear grounds as to the validity of these
cases as arguments against the antithetic theory must be held in suspense.§
Meanwhile, on grounds of general comparison, there is good reason to regard these
developments as short cuts in the life-cycle, rather than as historical throw-backs,
and that they arise under peculiar states of nutrition ; on this view they would not
be fitting material for far-reaching morphological argument as to the primary origin
of normal forms.||.

Taking into account the fresh facts and arguments issued since 1893, I see no
sufficient reason for changing the opinion then put forward : for the purposes of this
discussion I shall continue to assume the antithetic view of alternation in Archegoniate
Plants as « working hypothesis, though fully aware that it is not, and probably that
it never can be, proved.

on a basis of adaptation.
