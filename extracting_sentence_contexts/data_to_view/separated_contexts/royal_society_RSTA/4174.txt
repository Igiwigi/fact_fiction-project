The strong coupling function between respiration and the heart oscillations
(figure 4u—x) is the only one to have been studied previously, and our results confirm the earlier
work [19-21]. More importantly, the propofol and sevoflurane anaesthesia made the form of the
cardiorespiratory coupling function more time-varying and unstable—which is opposite to the
effect of anaesthesia on the delta—alpha coupling (cf. figure 4a—d).

(b) Effect of anaesthesia on the coupling strength

In order to assess the influence of anaesthesia, we first quantify the coupling (amplitude) strength. The latter has been extensively studied in earlier work [13,15,45,51]: wherever reference was made
to coupling causality and directionality, it was in fact the net coupling strength, or a measure
proportional to it, that was being evaluated. Our coupling decomposition enables us to go beyond
this by quantifying the coupling strengths of the individual components of the net coupling. In figure 5, we summarize the changes of coupling strength induced by anaesthesia.
