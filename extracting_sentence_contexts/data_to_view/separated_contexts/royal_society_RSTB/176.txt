But, since the main centre for vision (in the occipital lobe) is intact, one would scarcely expect hemiopia
to result from the removal of an outlying part ! ¢ A further investigation upon this region and into the parts of the cortex which are connected with
other special sense functions is, in fact, now being carried on by one of us, in the hope of succeeding
in clearing up some of the discrepancies in the evidence of previous observers. We may perhaps here
most conveniently notice a statement which has been made by Dr. Ferrier in the second edition of his
‘Functions of the Brain,’ to the effect that we had removed the occipital lobes on one or both sides
“ without the slightest appreciable impairment of vision.” It will be seen from the text, and from our
Record of Cases, that this is a mistake.
