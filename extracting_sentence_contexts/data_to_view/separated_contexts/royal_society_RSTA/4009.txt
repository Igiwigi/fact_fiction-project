On the other hand, the close analogy with salt solutions leads one
to expect that alloys could be electrolysed, and those who have experimented in the
matter are not by any means certain that greater experimental resources will not
enable them to electrolyse alloys. There is at least one fact in the phenomena of re-crystallisation which the solution
theory, apart from electrolysis, does not cover, while the electrolytic theory explains
it very readily. We refer to the fact that only strained crystals will grow, while
unstrained crystals show no tendency to change even at higher temperatures, The
explanation, on the electrolytic theory, is that in the unstrained state the crystals are
surrounded by practically continuous films of eutectic, and that electrolysis only
becomes possible when severe distortion has broken through these films in places,
allowing the actual crystals to come into contact ; the electrolytic circuit would then
be for each pair of crystals, from one crystal to the other by direct contact and back
through the eutectic film. Our view of the phenomena of re-crystallisation in solid metals may be summed up
thus :—We believe that the action is one of solution and diffusion of the pure metal
constituting the crystals into the fusible and mobile eutectic forming the inter-
crystalline cement. This diffusion results in the growth of one crystal at the expense
of the other, owing to differences in solubility of the crystal faces on opposite sides of

the eutectic film, and it seems probable that this phenomenon of directed diffusion is
really a form of electrolysis.
