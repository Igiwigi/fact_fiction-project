G. SEMPLE: CREMONA TRANSFORMATIONS OF SPACE OF FOUR DIMENSIONS

locus V,**; and we see immediately that these are just the planes which meet I,‘
in conics ; for the points of a conic of F,* correspond to lines joining a point of | to the
points of cy. Also the locus of planes corresponding to points of c, is of order four V,*; and since
one of the planes of K passes through any given point of c., every plane of V,* contains a
generator of F,*, and it is in fact the plane joining the generator to the fixed point O
which corresponds to the plane of c,. Hence V,° is the locus of planes which meet ¥*
in conics and V;! is the locus of planes joining O to the generators of F.*. The Quadric-sextic Transformations {2, 4, 6}.
