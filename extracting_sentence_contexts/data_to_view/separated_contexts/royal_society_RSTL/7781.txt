tonode, at which points, in the type under consideration, their extremities appear to termi-
nate as cul-de-sacs. Their inner or medullary wall is almost invariably composed of very
narrow elongated cells (fig. 11, 6) with square extremities, being in fact elongated modi-
fications of the ordinary medullary cells. I have not succeeded in discovering any cells
in their peripheral wall; this appears to be composed of the innermost and first formed
barred vessels of the woody wedge (11, g), to which each canal belongs. Their diameter
yaries from -03 to -1 of an inch, their width being uniform throughout their entire
length, except at their extremities, where they rapidly contract until they disappear.
