uniform in the strained fluid. A hole was therefore drilled in the inner cylinder of such an
apparatus and the pressure tested as in a of figure 12. No pressure was generated.* (b) When
an inner double cone was substituted as in figure 12, thus varying the rate of shear at the
surface, the excess pressure phenomenon was observed. (c) A condition of uniform shear
can also be produced on the conical face of a stator, as in figure 12c, provided that the cone

* There is an apparent paradox here: the liquid inside the manometric chamber is stationary and, on
the present hypothesis, it should act as a sink for the broken fragments of the colloidal structure and show a
pressure head. However, the head here is compared with the level of the liquid in the beaker which has very
low rates of shear throughout and is therefore also a sink. In other words fragments would concentrate both

in the manometer chamber and the free volume above the cylinder. The net result is a small pressure after
a long time, which in fact was observed in some experiments.

touches the rotating beaker at its centre and is symmetrically placed as shown. Again, a
negative result at all speeds should prove that the derivation was correct. Actually, it is
very difficult to produce the ideal conditions, required by this experiment, of coincidence
between the centre of the beaker and the apex of the cone and of the axes of the cone and
beaker. If such coincidences take place, then at any point radial distance r from the axis
located on the stationary cone with half apex angle «, for a beaker rotating with Qradians/sec.
