intriguing findings; however, the human studies have often been based on
rather crude and even non-specific pharmacological manipulations. Theories
have not always taken account of all of the published evidence available,
especially concerning the organizational heterogeneity of the systems, and
many of the relevant findings emanating from animal behavioural
neuroscience.

First, these monoamine systems are in fact often divided
into anatomically segregated subsystems, for example, the
mesolimbic, mesostriatal and mesofrontal DA systems; the
dorsal and median raphé 5-HT systems, the ascending
locus coeruelo-cortical and lateral tegmental NA systems.
These systems have different terminal domains (e.g. neo-
cortex and hypothalamus, respectively) and, therefore,
contribute to different information processing systems,
which may contribute to several behavioural dimensions,
rather than being monolithically related just to one. Most of
the evidence [7] also recognizes that any relationships with
neurochemical activity cannot necessarily be modelled in
terms of simple linear or monotonic functions relating behav-
