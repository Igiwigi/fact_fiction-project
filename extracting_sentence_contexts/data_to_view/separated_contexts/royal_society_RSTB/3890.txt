Below 10 per cent. the blood would be reduced with considerable difficulty, whilst it
would not get oxidised much above 65 per cent., the alveolar pressure of oxygen
being 48 mm. in Ropersâ€™ case at the Margherita Hut. However interesting the aggregation of the hemoglobin molecules may be as
leading to an adaptation for the purpose of facilitating respiration, it is evident that the
phenomenon of aggregation, if it exists at all, has a much more far reaching interest
than this. So far as we know the acid causes aggregation of the molecules of hemo-
globin to take place in virtue of the fact that these molecules are protein molecules. There is no reason to suppose that they stand alone among the proteins of the body in
respect of the effect of reaction upon them. Presumably their aggregation is typical
of some other proteins, whilst in others under conditions of acidosis the aggregates
would break down.
