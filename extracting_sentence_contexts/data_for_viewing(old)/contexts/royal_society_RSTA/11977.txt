internal stress in a conductor carrying a current which tends to alter its shape bu
not to produce motion of translation of the conductor as a whole,

3. According then to the type of theory which considers a current system to b
built up of physical current-elements of the form (u, v, w) 57, the energy associa
with an element of volume 67, as existing in the surrounding field and controlled by
the element, is

T = (Fu + Gv + Hw) dr.

The ponderomotive force acting on the element will be derived from a potential
energy function — 'T, by varying the coordinates of the material framework : i

and a couple

(oH — wG, wk — vwH, uG — vF),

the former being derived from a translational, the latter from a rotational virtual
displacement of the element.* We may simplify these expressions by taking the
axis of z parallel to the current in the clement 67, so that w and v become null
then we have
