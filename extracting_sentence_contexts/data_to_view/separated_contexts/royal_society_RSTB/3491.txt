In consequence of this, the presence
of a ganglionic cellular lamina in the sub-ectodermal plane is not at all suggested
by the appearances seen on examination im toto by transmitted light, as in fig. 75. But it is nevertheless a fact that the entire oblong area under consideration is
occupied by cellular tissue which is, at least in part, of ectodermal origin, and
which represents in an imperfect fashion the non-marginal or pedicular portion ot
the ganglionic lamina representing the glossopharyngeus-vagus complex. This fact
will become clear during the subsequent consideration of the sectional anatomy
of the region. Comparison may even now be made with advantage between fig.
