One was killed five minutes after insemination and the other one an hour after that
operation. In both cases no sperms were found in the uteri though these elements
were abundant in the vaginz. The etherisation of the females was so slight that I am
convinced that the drug had no influence on the motility of the sperms, and the fact
that no sperms were found in the uteri leads me to conclude that the transfer of these
elements from vagina to uterus is ordinarily accomplished by other means than
unassisted sperm activity. In dealing with this problem, it must be kept in mind that in mammals that ovulate
at regular intervals, particularly in man, there is much evidence to show that sperms
may pass from the vagina to the uterus without the intervention of an orgasm (MARSHALL,
1922, p.174; PuaczEK, 1926, p.117). Although this evidence is of necessity not always
all that could be desired, it is nevertheless often so circumstantial that it would be
hazardous to deny its importance.
