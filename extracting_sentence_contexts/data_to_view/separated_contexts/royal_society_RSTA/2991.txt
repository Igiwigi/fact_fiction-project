Thus, we suppose
that late epoch radiation can, in principle, come from the joint subsystem (N, I). In this figure, we
also include subsystem Dearly denoting matter that has fallen into the region surrounding the black
hole at an earlier epoch or indeed matter that may have collapsed to form the black hole in the
first place. As in the main text we apply strong subadditivity:

I(R’ | R) <I(C,N’, R’:R) =I(N, 1: R) =I(N: R). (A 12)

Here, we used the fact that joint subsystems (C, N’, R’) and (N,1) are unitarily related. Finally,
the most natural assumption is that the infallen matter I is independent of the quantum state of


the black hole, (B, N), or its early epoch radiation R. The original inequality of equation (A 1) for
pure-state black holes is thus found to still hold in the presence of mixed infallen matter.
