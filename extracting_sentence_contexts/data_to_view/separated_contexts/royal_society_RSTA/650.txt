This view also implies a potentially emergent nature of biological processes, as not reducible
to physical ones, classical or quantum, but rather as unrepresentable or inconceivable in
their own right. At least, this nature would not be ‘mechanically’ described as a theory and,
correspondingly, not represented by its mathematical models, just as quantum objects and
processes were not described (rather than placed beyond any description or conception) by
Heisenberg in his discovery of quantum mechanics. There is, again, a crucial difference, because
in quantum mechanics, such causal connections are difficult and, in interpretations in the spirit of
Copenhagen, impossible to assume, in the latter case by virtue of the fact that a realist model of
how quantum phenomena come about is, to return to Bohr’s locution, ‘in principle excluded’ [12,
vol. 2, p. 63]. As indicated above, the situation on this score is far less clear in biology, psychology
or economics, where such connections would be molecular in the first case, neurological or
psychological in the second, and psychological, sociological, political or economic in the third. Indeed, while still entertaining in principle a similar argument, Bohr, too, was even more tentative
regarding psychology than he was regarding biology [2, pp. 158-166].
