dynamical phases in the system: a laminar phase where E(t) ~ t and an avalanche phase where we observe drops of E(t)
corresponding to the bursts in the energy dissipation. (Online version in colour.)

solid) obey completely different physics and the variable F is not at all related to any plastic flow. In fact, as we shall see, the scaling observed for the avalanche sizes and their interevent time are
completely different with respect to the one observed in amorphous solid. In figure 1a, we also report the signal corresponding to the energy dissipation for the same time
window, which shows, as expected, a strongly intermittent behaviour. Notice the link between the
strong fluctuations occurring in the upper signal and the kinetic energy loss in the lower signal.
