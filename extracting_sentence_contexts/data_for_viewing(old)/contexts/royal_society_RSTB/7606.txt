“2 south-eastern corner of the island, MacGregor (1892, p. 65) found in 1891 that the
3 natives were fond of tobacco. In 1895 MacGregor traversed the island from Hughes
z bay to Seymour bay. At halfway between Diaware and Itona, near Mount Taumoa,
3 he says (1897, p. 5): ‘they had a few plants of tobacco, which were doing well. This was
4 the first time I had seen it cultivated on the islands, but could not learn where they had
© procured the seed.’
It would seem that when Sir William MacGregor first visited the D’Entrecasteaux
£ islands tobacco was unknown in many places, but in the neighbourhood of Dawson
g Strait it was already known and appreciated. Malinowski (1922, pp. 39-41) says that
& the Dobuans who inhabit the flat lands on both sides of the strait are pleasant honest
3B folk and are allies of the natives of Dobu island. The Dobu islanders were fierce and
s daring cannibals and head-hunters and were the dread of the neighbouring tribes.
g The fact that MacGregor found tobacco smoking among the Dobuans probably was
& due to the trading expeditions of the kula system or ring (Seligman 1910, pp. 526-40;
Malinowski 1922; Fortune 1932, pp. 200-34). This is the circulation in defined direc-
tions of articles of great sentimental value which is accompanied by ordinary trade.
One important section of the kula ring is from the Trobriands to the Amphletts and
thence to Dobu, which is a great receiving and distributing centre, but the Trobriand
men have no kula relations with other islands of the D’Entrecasteaux group.

R. F. Fortune wrote to me in 1928 that in Dobu (Goulvain island) the Papuan
bamboo tobacco pipe, dumo, is almost universally replaced by the cigarette, lipulipu,
rolled in dry banana leaf, sagilubu; it is smoked without a holder. This is in imitation of
the white man; a few old people still use the dumo. The Dobuan term for tobacco is
ltapwaki or tapwa’i; he regards this as a native rendering of ‘tobacco’. In Fergusson
