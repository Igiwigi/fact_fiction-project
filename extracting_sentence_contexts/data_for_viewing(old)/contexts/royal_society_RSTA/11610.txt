The component forces acting at the centre of the first sphere are

AMq cos 6/2dt, pMq cos 6/2dt, vMq cos 6/2dt.

Those acting at the centre of the second sphere are the same with reversed signs.

For two spheres colliding with relative velocity qg we find that the virial is
eMq cos 6/2dt at each instant during collision. We have to multiply this by the
chance that, given two spheres A and B with relative velocity q, they shall be in
collision at any given instant.

It is assumed that we are dealing with a space throughout which T, is constant,
and therefore the fact that the relative velocity is q, affords no presumption with
regard to the relative position of the two spheres. About the centre of sphere A
suppose a spherical surface described with radius c. An element of that surface is
2rc* cos Asin 6d. Upon that element of surface form the element of volume
2c? cos 9 sin 6d qdt. And form a similar element of volume on the other side of
the sphere A, that is, using 7 â€” @ for #6. Then the two spheres are at this instant in
collision if the centre of the sphere B is within either of those elements.

Let V be the volume in which 7 spheres are moving with T, constant. Then by
our assumption B is as likely to be in any part of V as in any other. Therefore the
chance that A and B, having relative velocity q, are in collision, is
