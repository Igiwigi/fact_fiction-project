Some theoretical descriptions had incorporated the possi-
bility of higher order MinD structures on the membrane
[38-40,60] for which there is also some evidence from recon-
stitution experiments [61]. None of these descriptions has
been applied to the geometry of a flat membrane, though. In fact, essentially only the mechanism introduced in [44]
has been analysed in geometries corresponding to Min pro-
teins on flat membranes. Given the harsh criticism this
model received [62], it is all the more surprising that to our
knowledge no other mechanism is capable of reproducing
the travelling Min-protein waves that were observed
in vitro. In particular, the model by Huang et al. [32], which
is used in many current studies, can to our knowledge not
reproduce any of the patterns observed in the open geometry.
