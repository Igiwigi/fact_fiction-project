Several specimens of Fungi were obtained from the layer of carbonised plant remains
in the cliffs of Skansen (Plate 4, fig. I’), and a selection was sent to Mr. J. RaMssorrom,
of the British Museum, who kindly supplied the following information:—‘ The slides
show a quantity of undoubted fruit-bodies and mycelium. ‘Though the reference of the
fruit-bodies to some definite genus is difficult, if not impossible, a most interesting fact
is that they appear to belong wholly to Asterina-like Fungi, and the mycelium which
occurs, often in considerable quantity, also belongs entirely, or nearly so, to such Fungi. The fruit-bodies are for the most part characteristic, being flattened, radiate, disc-shaped
structures somewhat resembling in appearance the Green Alga Coleochete.”” These remains
afford interesting evidence of climatic conditions.
