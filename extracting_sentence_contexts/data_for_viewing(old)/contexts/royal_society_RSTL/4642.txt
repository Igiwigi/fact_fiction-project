This table shows that the alkaloids in question differ from each other by n C, H,,
the elementary difference of the various alcohols and their derivatives ; we perceive
moreover that the series ascends regularly up to the term C,, H, N+5 C, Hz, when the
compound C,, H, N+6 C, Hyzis wanting; lastly, we miss the terms C,, H, N+8 C, H,
and C,, H, N+9 C, Hz. The first gap might be easily filled by submitting amylani-
line to the action of iodide of methyl, methylamylaniline being in fact C,, Hjy N
=C,, H, N+6C, Hz. The other wanting terms cannot be reached from aniline be-
fore s0me of the missing alcohols are discoyered.

MOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE VOLATILE ORGANIC BASES, 125

On examining more closely the formulz of the preceding conspectus, we find that
s8everal of them represent basic compounds previously known. Chemists are ac-
quainted with the beautiful reaction by which Zixix first linked aniline to benzole
through nitrobenzole.
