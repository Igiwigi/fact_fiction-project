The hridge of Alford, over the Don, is happily situated for illus-
trating this, being on one of the rapids, where the ground-gru is earliest and most
abundantly formed. While the other rapids, and the unshaded parts of this one,
were quite occupied by gru on both the 5th and 7th of January, spaces in the shade
of the masonry at this bridge were quite clear of it. It cannot be admitted as an
explanation of this fact, that heat may have been there laterally transmitted to the
water by contact with the piers and walls; for if this took place, why then did the
clear spaces on the bottom narrow gradually towards the low extremities of the em-
banking walls? Besides, the transmission of heat laterally had not hindered the for-
mation of surface-ice, in contact with a pier, on a piece of still water under one of
the arches. The modification of the radiation by shade was also exhibited in the
absence of all gru on the bottom, along the foot of the dense tuft of Phalaris grass
in the Leochal, where there could be no more transmission of heat laterally, than at
the general line of the grassy banks of this stream.
