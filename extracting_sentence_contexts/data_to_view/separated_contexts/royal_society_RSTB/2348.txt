H. SCOTT ON THE STRUCTURE AND AFFINITIES

the sporangium or nucellus, so as to leave only a narrow opening or micropyle, at the
top. The fact that only a single megaspore or embryo-sac, occupying almost the
whole of the sporangial cavity, comes to perfection, much heightens the resemblance
to a true seed, especially when we find the embryo-sac filled with the prothallus or
endosperm. The presence of an integument is in itself far from conclusive; the
indusium of the megasporangium in Azolla is at least equally like an integument, yet
it does not constitute the organ a seed, for it does not permanently inclose the
megaspore.* Neither is the single megaspore in itself a crucial character, for this,
though unknown in Lycopods, is common to all the Rhizocarps. In Lepidocarpon, however, the “retention of the megaspore,”t one of the great
characters of the Spermophytes, appears to hold good; at no stage is there any
indication of dehiscence, or of the envelopes of the seed-like organ in any way
breaking down.
