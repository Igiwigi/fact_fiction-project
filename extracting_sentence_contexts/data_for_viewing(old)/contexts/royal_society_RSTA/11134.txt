potential difference between the KI and the KCl both results cannot be true. The
potential differences in the two cases (maximum surface tension) must differ by about
0:2 volt, or else the potential difference between 4n KI and 3n KCl must be about
0°2 volt.

In the face of evidence that there is a chemical effect of the anion upon the surface
tension, and that this effect increases as the potential of the liquid with respect
to the electrode decreases, it does not seem advisable to say more than that the
potential difference (reckoned from the solution to the electrode) is considerably less
at the maximum surface tension when the solution is KCl than when it is KI. The
marked depression of the maximum value of the surface tension observable in the
case of potassium iodide solutions is one of the characteristic features of the curves
dealt with by Roramunp—the actual fact of the depression was apparently first
noticed by Gouy ;* but the depression is really a perfectly general phenomenon, The
amount of depression depends upon the concentration of the solution as well as upon
its chemical nature. The depression for concentrated solutions of chlorides is very
pronounced, and for dilute solutions it can readily be observed that the maximum
value of the surface tension rises as the concentration diminishes. It is obviously an
effect which does not depend upon the density of the solution. For example, a
saturated solution of caustic potash (which is soluble in about half its weight of
water) has as high a maximum surface tension as a half-normal solution of potassium
chloride. The effect of the ions (apart from the electrostatic effect) upon the surface
tension would appear to depend, for a given potential difference, upon their nature
and concentration in the solution. Whether the surface tension in the neighbour-
hood of the maximum is ever controlled by the electrostatic effect alone, depends (on
