Probably the arcualia
turn first into cartilage, while the centrum-forming masses grow out later, and still
later turn into cartilage, repeating the course of phylogenesis.” Even in the extinct Amioids, there is nothing to preclude the view that certain
component parts of the “ bodies” of the vertebrae are developed independently of the
arcualia. In Hurycormus the hemal arches are attached to the hypocentra, and in
the caudal region the neural arches also are attached to the hypocentra, although in
the trunk they merely alternate with the pleurocentra, owing to the fact that the
hypocentra do not extend sufficiently upward to meet the neural arches. But there
is nothing to suggest that the hypocentra and pleurocentra are developed as
outgrowths from arch-tissue. In Osteorhachis the neural arches alternate with the pleurocentra, and are
separate from them.
