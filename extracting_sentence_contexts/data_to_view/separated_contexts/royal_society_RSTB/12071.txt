For single-celled organ-
Thomas A. Richards isms, determining the specific circumstance of the individuals within a
population is key for understanding: (i) the variation upon which selection can
act to result in evolutionary adaptation [1,2], and (ii) the diversity of rare forms
present in a natural environment which can rise to prominence in the event of
environmental perturbation [3]. This is a hindrance when we consider the fact
that much of the interesting biology we seek to understand occurs on the scale
of a single cell, a scale that is often difficult to study experimentally. Consider for example a simple experiment to ascertain the susceptibility
of a clonal population of bacteria to antibiotic treatment. A comparison of an
antibiotic-treated population versus an untreated population with a subsequent
measurement of the mean number of surviving cells can give an idea of the
overall efficacy of the antibiotic in use.
