cavity of Haliotis. Thus the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood will be higher than that
in the exhalant current, and this degree of efficiency would be impossible if the directions
of flow of blood and of water were the same.

The gill filaments are very mobile, the presence of muscles attached to the skeletal bars
enabling them to contract inward, thereby throwing the afferent surface into folds, the
tips bending inward and upward. Longitudinal muscle in the gill axis enables the ctenidium
to contract in length.

Currents in the mantle cavity. The action of the lateral cilia causes a powerful inhalant
current (figure 2, /) to be drawn in above and on both sides of the head (not merely above
and to the right as stated by Crofts (1929)). As in other zygobranchs, the exhalant current
(E) passes out through the shell apertures, a fact noted by all who have observed these
animals in life, The inhalant current, as indicated in figure 5, impinges on the osphradia
when it enters the confines of the cavity. It has already been argued (Hulbert & Yonge
1937) that the osphradia are tactile organs concerned with the estimation of sediment
brought in with the inhalant current. This matter will be reconsidered later. The heavier
particles collect on the floor of the mantle cavity, those in the central and anterior regions
being carried forward (figures 2, 3) and over the right side of the head to the exterior

(figure 5, R), as observed by Stephenson (1924). Posteriorly, material from the left side
collects in masses (figures 3, 5, z) beneath the penultimate shell opening through which it
