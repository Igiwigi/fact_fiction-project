He thinks that enclosure may almost or quite suppress his force. To this I can reply
that I have myself verified nearly all M. THornâ€™s facts of rotation (including those
just now communicated) when working in the free air of a large room, and it was only
when I found the delicacy of the observations was impeded by draughts and currents
that I put screens round the apparatus. I have not found glass screens interfere
materially with any of the rotations, M. THorx now says that it is necessary to hold
the pillar or the exciting body in contact with the hand during the whole duration
of the experiment.
