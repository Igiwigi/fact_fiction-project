To investigate
this further, the amount of metal ions removed was measured
over shorter time increments. The time course was the same
at pH 2.9 and 7.4 (figure 6b; electronic supplementary
material, figure 2). In fact, at both extremes of pH tested,
more than half of the magnesium diffused out of the glue
in merely 5 min, and roughly 20 min for calcium.
