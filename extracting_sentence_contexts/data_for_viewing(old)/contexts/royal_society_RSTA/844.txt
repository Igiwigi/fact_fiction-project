a bigger room in which the door we just came out of is just one of the points of interest [8].

In summary, Hilbert might well have agreed with the starting point of relative realism but
would have taken a more absolutist view of reality rather than subscribing to the ‘relative’ side
of the thesis. My view is that one does not have to swallow the philosophy for our approach to
be useful. As with the philosophy of quantum mechanics, we do not need to get bogged down
with what ‘real’ actually means as long as our model explains the perception of reality and key
features of this perception at an operational level, which for us means principally its hierarchical
structure whereby to some degree what we experience is determined by what assumptions we
are working within.

It also seems likely that Hilbert would not have agreed with the use to which we put this
philosophical position. Where Hilbert might have wanted to build on empirical facts to find a
complete set of precise axioms to shore up a theory more or less found by physicists, we are doing
the opposite. In [1], we used our philosophical position to propose what we believe to be a single
key principle or ‘crude axiom’ (rather than a complete set of precise axioms) to help determine the
mathematical structure of the not-yet-known theory of quantum gravity. Back in 1988 when I was
finishing my thesis, this would have been a necessity—there was seemingly no real prospect of
empirical tests for any theory of quantum gravity due to its energy scale being a factor of 10'¢ out
of reach (a situation that is now seen very differently). Secondly, theoretical physics back then was
in my opinion still stumbling from structure to structure like Richard Feynman’s drunk looking


for their keys in the light of a street lamp not because this is where he really thought he lost his
keys but because this was the easiest place to look. Given our view that physics is a subset of
