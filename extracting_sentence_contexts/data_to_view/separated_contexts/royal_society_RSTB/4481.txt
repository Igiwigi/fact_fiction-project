The graph, Stat. 1040, fig. 8 on p. 189, gives a good idea of the size of the larvee in
autumn in the western Atlantic. In the first place, it will be seen that the smallest
specimen was 17 mm. long only—a marked lowering of the previous minimum record
of 34 mm.—but, despite the intensive fishery, only a single specimen of this small size
was taken throughout the whole cruise, and only a very few slightly larger, 2~3 em.,
amounting to 1-2 per cent. of the total number. Furthermore, the graph shows that
an overwhelming majority of the larve were of sizes varying between 34 and 4$ cm.
in length. (As mentioned above, no specimen over 5 cm. was taken by the
“Margrethe ” in the western area, west of the line referred to on p. 189.)

These facts, in my opinion, warranted the following conclusions :—The spawning of

of the eel cannot go on regularly throughout the whole year; there must, in autumn
at any rate, be a cessation or decrease in the production, otherwise we must have
found tiny larvee in greater numbers at this season.
