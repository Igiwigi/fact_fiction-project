The plots show the level of significance we can reach in terms of a minimal density variation
of only 5%. We expect much greater density variations in the crater region, due to not only
the empty space inside the crater, but also to the solid rock plug. In fact, recent gravimetric
measurements seem to indicate the presence of a high-density layer of rock at the bottom of
the crater.

Figure 17. Significance (coloured scale) of the observed muon count variation (Poisson statistics) for a 5% density variation
as a function of the observation angle, after (a) two-year and (b) four-year data-taking. Below a certain elevation, due to the
huge rock overburden, no discernible signal can be extracted.
