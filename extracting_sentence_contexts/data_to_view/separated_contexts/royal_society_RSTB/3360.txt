In spite
of this, after subcutaneous injection of five times the minimum lethal dose in a
rabbit, the distal hemorrhages are usually not severe until 24 hours subsequently. We have also observed that the greatest prolongation in the coagulation time of
the blood after subcutaneous injection of Echis venom is not reached till at least
24 hours. The fact that five times the minimum lethal dose does not kill much
more rapidly than a single minimum lethal dose subcutaneously administered may be
explained by slowness of absorption.

In order further to investigate this point we compared the minimum lethal dose
subcutaneously and intramuscularly in pigeons (see Tables VI and VII).
