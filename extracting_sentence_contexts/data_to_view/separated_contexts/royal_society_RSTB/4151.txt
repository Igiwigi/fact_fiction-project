WATSON ON THE MONOTREME SKULL:

part of the brain cavity, and it is easy to see how, by a great expansion of this process,
we can arrive at the monotreme condition, where the whole side wall of the anterior
part of the cranial cavity is formed by a homologous ossification in the membrana
spheno-obturatoria, and the whole of the dorsal part of the epipterygoid has
disappeared, leaving only its quadrate process.

(c.) To complete the discussion of the monotreme “ pterygoids, "it remains to
discuss their homologies with bones i the Therian skull. Gaupr’s conclusion that the pterygoid of Echidna is homologous with the
pterygoid of ordinary mammals seems to be a natural one, supported by sufficient
evidence,

Comparison of the monotreme skull, as interpreted in the preceding parts of this
paper, with that of a mammal shows that in the otie and sphenoidal regions the two
agree bone for bone, except that in one case there is an “ Echidna pterygoid” and
no alisphenoid (for the small ala temporalis, ossified apparently by extension from
the basisphenoid, ean scarcely be called such), and in the other no Echidna pterygoid
and an alisphenoid. This fact suggests a comparison of the Echidna pterygoid and
the alisphenoid. In the Marsupials and some Insectivora we find a special tympanic wing of the
alisphenoid. As the Marsupials, whatever their exact origin, do retain in their adult
structure and in their development many primitive features, and as the Insectivora
are undoubtedly the most primitive living group of placental mammals, it is
probable that this tympanic wing is really an essential part of the alisphenoid of
early Theria.
