orthostichies. Such a common feature would not be shared by the Chenopodiacese
if their phyllotaxis were originally alternate.

Again, it might be contended that the original phyllotaxis was alternate and that
the shortness of the alternate internodes of the main stem of alternate-leaved Cheno-
podiaceze is merely a case of correlation, and represents the necessary transitional
stages between the opposite insertion of the cotyledons and the alternate insertion of
the foliage-leaves. Against such a view may be urged: (i) The various
considerations and facts cited in Part I of this paper. (ii) The similar nature of the
internode and displacement sub-curves of branches, where no such transition is
indicated. (iii) The agreement of the displacement sub-curve with that concerning
the displaced branches of the Boraginaceze or displaced leaves in Scrophularia.
(iv) The fact that the displacement sub-curve retains its distinctness high up the
main axis, where there is no apparent reason for the occurrence of any correlation
dependent upon transition.

I therefore conclude that the zigzag internode-curve of the Chenopodiaces is due
to displacement, and that the displacement sub-curve in this family and in
connection with the Boraginaces: points to some principle determining the dimensions
and distribution on the plant of morphological modifications. In this connection it is
worthy of note that in axes with occasional or invariable displacements the
maximum displacement by no means coincides in position with maximum length of
internodes.

One most interesting result obtained in this work is that the displacements of the
