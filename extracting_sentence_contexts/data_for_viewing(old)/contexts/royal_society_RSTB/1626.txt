i¥is manner, SAcEwenn remarks, the air-bladder acquires a tolerably direct connection
mith the external medium, and will, therefore, much more promptly react to pressure
@uillations than if entirely confined to the abdominal cavity.
= SAGEMEHL is scarcely correct in attributing any important physiological distinetion
Gitween the obviously bipartite aiv-bladders of the Cyprinidz and the Characinide
gd the air-bladders of the normal Siluridw. In both cases the aimbladder is
Ebysiologically two-chambered in the sense that it consists of a smaller distensible
@iterior portion and a larger posterior and indistensible part, but in the Cyprinide
e bipartite character is obvious externally, whereas in the Silurida it is only by
ternal examination that the essentially bipartite nature of the air-bladder becomes
Apvious. {n fact, in all the normal Siluride the air-bladder is, physiologically, as
truly bipartite as in other Ostariophyse, and the former derive precisely the same
physiological adyantage in the registration of hydrostatic pressure variations from
this fact as do the latter. Neither is SacemeHL quite accurate in supposing that
Aughenoglanis® and Auohenipterus possess an air-bladder which is bipartite externally
asin the Cyprinidia, inasmuch as we have already shown, in the morpbological section
of this paper, that in both genera the bladder is substantially similar to that of all other
Siluridi: normales so far as this point is concerned. Sagewunt’s suggestion that the
