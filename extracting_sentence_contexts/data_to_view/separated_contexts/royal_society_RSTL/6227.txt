Flame being improper for my purpoſe,
becauſe the elecric fluid is readily diſſipated by its

in order to ſee if they were moved by it: but not per-

a little, and when I removed the heated iron, they

iron nearer to the Towrmalin than before : the balls
in this caſe moved with vigour towards the ſtone, and
continued in contaf with it for a conſiderable time ;

ſame manner as I did the plan one, the balls were
not moved towards the Teurmalin, but from it, and
continued in that ſtate. In this experiment they were
