It should be realised

the alloys mentioned by Farapay were not to be found among the seventy-nine existing
specimens ; for example, it was unfortunate that some of the alloys containing high
percentages of platinum or rhodium could not be traced. Proof that Farapay
actually made these is to be found in the fact that he gives measured values of their
specific gravity, agreeing sufficiently well with the values calculated from their com-
position ; but not a single specimen of these special types has yet been found, though
a most careful search has been made in the Royal Institution and in Sheffield.+

taken in hand on November 27th, 1930, and after some delays arising from the
