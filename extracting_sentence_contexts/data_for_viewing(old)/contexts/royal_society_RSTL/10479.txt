The difference between 1:4534 and the mean of Table XT., viz., 1:4542, would
indicate a fall of about 455, but the determinations are hardly precise enough to
warrant us in regarding this fall as an established fact.

Note 2 to \ 37.

Two further determinations of the E.M.F. of CLark cells have been published
8ince this paper was communicated to the Royal Society. They both depend upon
the evaluation of currents by means of silver, as in F 38.

A. v. ErrixNGsHAUSEN (Zeitschrift fiir Elektrotechnik, 1884, xvi. Heft) finds ab
15%5 the value 1:433 volt, using KonLRravscn's (cond) value of the electro-chemical
equivalent,

Again (Amer. Journ. Sci., Nov., 1884) Mr. CARHART obtains 1434 volt. This
