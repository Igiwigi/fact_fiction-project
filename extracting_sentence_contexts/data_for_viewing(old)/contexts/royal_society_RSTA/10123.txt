hardly questioned—for believing the theory in its general form to be untenable. The
1895-6 data were from a Kelvin portable electrometer, whose insulation was never
in doubt. The present data are from an electrograph, whose insulation may depend,
especially at night—sometimes it may be feared not inappreciably—on the greater or
less dryness of the air. Also, for one and the same amount of aqueous vapour in the
air, it seems all important so far as potential is concerned whether fog forms or not,
and in the long nights of winter no satisfactory data exist as to the occurrence of fog,
or its thickness when present. I have thus omitted consideration of the effects of
aqueous vapour as too large a subject to be included in the present paper.

A similar remark applies to wind direction. There are here two main difficulties :
first the fact that the direction is perpetually shifting, and the extent of the variation
in a single day is often large; second the fact that when the wind is light—and there
are few fine weather days when this does not happen sometime during the 24 hours—
the record of direction is often uncertain, the strength of the wind being insutticient to
turn the vane of the Robinson cup anemograph. In particular is this true of foggy
days in winter, the precise days in which the potential tends to be highest.

and Potential Gradient.

prominent maxima and minima is the barometric pressure. EvERErT seems to have
