The interior
of the platinum tube was lined with charcoal, the crystals
were covered with it, and some had assumed a beautiful
brown tint.

4. The conclusions drawn from the last experiment are
founded upon the supposition, that olefiant gas is decomposed
bythe simple operation of a high temperature, and that one
volume is resolved into two volumes of hydrogen, losing at
the same time its carbon. The importance of this fact, as con-
nected with these researches, induced me to repeat with every
requisite precaution, the beautiful experiment of M. Ber-
THOLLET, Which consists in decomposing this gas by passing
it repeatedly through a red hot earthen tube; instead of
which, however, I employed a tube of platinum, arranged as
in the last experiment, increasing the heated surface by the
introduction of quartz crystals. One hundred measures of
olefiant gas,* obtained by distilling alcohol with sulphuric
acid, were passed and repassed through the tube heated -to
high redness, until they ceased to dilate : when the apparatus
was cool, the volume of gas was almost exactly doubled ;
there was a copious deposition of charcoal in the part of the
tube that had been ignited, and the evolved hydrogen was $0

* 'This gas was washed with $olution of potassa to separate a little carbonic acid,

and was then ascertained to be pure by the action of chlorine, with the precautions
afterwards described.
