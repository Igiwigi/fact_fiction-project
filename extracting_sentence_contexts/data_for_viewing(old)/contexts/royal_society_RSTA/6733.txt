of the solutions has advantages over others such as osmotic pressure, elevation of boiling-
point and depression of freezing-point, in being accurate and experimentally convenient
over wide ranges of the temperature and composition of the system. The main source of
error in using this method for a study of this kind on two component systems in general is
in the determination of the composition of the vapour phase, but this can be avoided by the
choice of a particular system in which the solute has a negligible vapour pressure over the
temperatures used.

The system benzene-diphenyl, which was chosen for the present study, is one in which the
solute molecule diphenyl consists of two units of the solvent molecule benzene, and appears
to be suitable for a test of the theoretical formulae. However, it is not entirely satisfactory,
since the theory would apply exactly only if the molar volume of diphenyl were twice that of
benzene. It is, in fact, less than this by about 15%. Moreover, the units, in this case phenyl
groups, are not spherical. From the experimental aspect the system is easy to handle;
diphenyl has a conveniently low vapour pressure, and both components can be obtained
pure without much difficulty.

This system has been examined previously by Washburn & Read (1915, 1919), Warner,
Scheib & Svirbely (1934) and Gilman & Gross (1938), but the precision and extent of the
work was not such as to allow the necessary calculations to be made with the required
accuracy. More recently, Tompa (1948) has measured the vapour pressures of solutions
