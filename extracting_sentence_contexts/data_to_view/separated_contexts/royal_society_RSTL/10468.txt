Remarks on. Table I. Tt will be seen from the above table that the specific resistance of iron is more
increased by a given amount of elongation than that of any of the other metals, and
that the specific resistance of aluminium is actually decreased by stress in the line of
flow of the current ; this latter fact being signified by a minus 8ign placed opposite
alumininm in the sixth column. It is also remarkable that the valne of z for the alloys, platinum-silver, German-

slver and brass 8should be considerably less than that of their components ; and this
cireumstance, taken in connexion with the comparatively large increase of resistance of
iron, would suggest that there is ome relation between increase of electrical resistance
caused by rise of temperature and that due to mechanical stress.

* Tron (2), iron (3), steel (1), steel (2), and brass (2) were tested some years ago by a method similar to
the one here described,


AND STRAIN ON THE ACTION OF PHYSICAL FORCES. 53

But the change of resistance attending a given amount of expansion caused by rise
of temperature is, in the case of iron, more than a hundred times that resulting from
the same amount of expansion produced by mechanical stress ; and it is evident that
with all metals the alteration of electrical conductivity following on alteration of
temperature is due for the most part to other canses than mere contraction and
expansion. Carbon.
