There are, however, a
few rather coarser-grained streaks in the section, and these are composed of calcite
grains which show marked twinning, and which are being broken down by granula-
tion into minute grains like those composing the mass of the rock. These latter are
seen under a very high power to be distinctly flattened, while the pigment still

‘yemains as minute black dots scattered throughout the mass. The somewhat
coarser-grained streaks evidently result from the rolling out of little veins of
calcite formed in the rock during the earlier stages of its deformation, as shown by
the fact that they cut obliquely across the foliation of the rock in many cases:
They consequently are free from pigment, but have been greatly crushed by later
movements, and now consist of small calcite fragments in a finely granulated ground-
mass, presenting a typical cataclastic structure. These fragments have precisely the
same “ fibrous” structure as that seen in the calcite of artificially deformed marbles. The fact that these later veins have not been recrystallised would seem to indicate
that the finer grained groundmass of the rock is still intact in this respect, and
that the flattening of the minute calcite grains has probably been produced by the
pressure to which the rock has been subjected, as it is in the case of the Carrara
marble in the experiments described in this paper.
