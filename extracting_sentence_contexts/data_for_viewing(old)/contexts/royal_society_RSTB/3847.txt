the gamophyllous zone to be retained when the actual free members have been lost.
Thus a gamophyllous perianth of two median members, with feebly developed free
lobes, is actually present in a phase of degradation in the staminate flower. With
such a loose investment to the central nucellus, the micropyle was probably originally
carried to its exterior by a “stylar” prolongation; since in development it at first
always lags behind the perianth (fig. 2). The subsequent rapid acceleration of its
rate of growth to form the present 10 mm. tube suggests that it is only the excessive
elongation that is secondary. That is to say, given an elongated “ stylar” micropyle
for some such preceding cause, its present extreme extension is clearly a secondary
modification, occurring late in development, and consequent on the assumption of the
cleisanthous condition by the cone as a whole.

The fact remains that neither the cone nor the flower present any mechanism in
terms of a special growth-factor beyond the gradual elongation and protrusion of the
“stylar” tube. ‘There is no ultimate internodal extension to open up the subtending
scales, and the extruded tubes merely push back the slender tip of the bract in their
passage. In this continued growth the tube again merely follows the course of the
simple curve impressed on it in following the contour of the bract-scale, the result
being that it only rises about 1 mm. free from the cone-surface, and displays no
further structural modifications for insect pollination.

Biologically the essential point of interest centres in the starch-storage of the
