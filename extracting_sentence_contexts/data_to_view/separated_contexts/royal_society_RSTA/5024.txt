It is here desirable to observe that the numerous astronomical determinations of
azimuth, latitude, and differential longitude which have been made at various stations
of the Survey, furnish a number of external and independent facts of observation with
which the triangulation might have been brought into accordance. The azimuths
more particularly seemed to have a claim for introduction, as they were measured

_ with the intention of forming a check on the triangulation ; they are very numerous,

and are given in full detail in the accounts of. the operations, But the triangulation

of this Survey cannot be forced into accordance with any astronomically determinec
facts of observation without a liability to introduce errors, arising from deflections of
the plumb-line in astronomical observations, which far exceed the errors ordinarily _
generated in the triangulation. Moreover, other errors would arise, more minute, but —
becoming very sensible in long distances, from the errors in the numerical elements of
the earth’s figure which were adopted as the basis of the geodetic calculations of
latitude, longitude, and. azimuth.
