It will be readily seen that, as far as the parthenogenetic generations are
concerned, there is a most striking alternation of form, a winged, leaf-feeding, lowly-
productive type being succeeded by a wingless, stem-feeding, highly-productive type.
When the sexual generation is reached, however, this alternation breaks down in a
singular manner, On the analogy of the Progrediens, the Sexuales must be regarded
as potentially winged; they are lowly-productive and are leaf-feeders, yet they
follow the Sexupara generation, which in these respects has similar characters.
Between the Sexvales and the Fundatriz, on the other hand, there is a complete
alternation, so that the sexual generation must certainly be regarded as the essential
starting-point from which the alternation arises, while the Sexupara marks the
termination of that alternation.

It is the Sexual generation, then, which is the crux of the whole life-cycle, a fact

very wrongly, was discarded by BOrNeER in 1908.

The wool-like wax which is secreted from special glands is adaptive to protecting
the eggs and in some cases the first-stage larva, not from cold, but from excessive
heat or light rays. The production of this wax is, however, irregular, for it is pro-
