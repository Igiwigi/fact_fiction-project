© subject of air-lines, as Report on a Mission in Italy by M. Jaxssex, &c. All these
2 papers contain descriptions or allusions to experiments showing the effect of reflections
& Aromvarious surfaces, and of the passage of light through strata of variable lengths, &c.
= And in turn I also (in keeping with suggestions by Professor SToks, for which I am yery
= much obliged) tried certain experiments which I will now briefly allude to. Selecting a
B bright clear day, I first turned the collimator to the 8un about the meridian, and set
S the slit for good definition of the lines; after this, with the slit as before, I admitted

S the swn's light reflected from blue or white glass backed with velvet, from ink of various
DS degrees of blackness, from coloured solutions, &c. ; and finally I got a reflection from a
2 distant muddy river; but none of these, or other experiments which need not be
S detailed, produced the smallest approach to the variable lines which were the especial
z aim of these experiments, nor yet, as a matter of fact, to those 8een only at snnset that
5 are plainly air-lines. Some of the belts are specially deserving of attention—for instance
£ the huge shadow 1073 to 1155 of Kircnnopy's scale on my Map ; this shadow or belt
Y stands out like a wall at sunset, and then not only comes into existence itself, but
S with it come 1108, 1114, and 1121, which 7 could not sce 8un high, nor has Kircn-

2 6. Tnow turn to another fact. When the autumn has well adyanced here, there springs

up from the plain country, stretching away SE. and 8:W..by W., a kind of haze which
becomes visible at.sunset, and which grows day by day in height until it attains to
perhaps 3” or more aboye the horizon; this haze, moreover, grows denser daily, until at
last it is sufficiently opaque to obscure the sun's rays. I need not in this place enter
