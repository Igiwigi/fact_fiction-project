Firſt, the town inhabi- |
tants being leſs healthy, and dying faſter, have not the

ſame ſtrength. of conſtitution with the 'country.inhabi-
tants. Secondly, i in the town a ſmaller proportion! of the
Ala abies! marry; and they marry later, than in
the cotintry.”* The ſurvey fully- proves this;" for. it! ap-
: pears, that though the number of inhabitattsatthemoſt
common marrying ages, compared with the whole num-
ber of the living above the age of 14, is ſmallerrin the
country thart the'town; yet the proportion of” the” mar-
ried tothe living above.'x4,-is-very nearly the. fame in
- both ſituations. - And there are more widows and wi-
doyers i in the town than in the country in the propor-
tion of near 16 to 11. We learn from hence, T think,
clearly in what manner towns operate, in checking po=
pulation; and preventing the increaſe of mankind.
'Dr.2ERCIVAL informs us, thatthe reyerendandlearned
Dr: TUCKER has. been led, by ſome obſervations he has
made at Briſtol, to doubt whether the common opinion”
is right, with. reſpec to, the diſproportion between the
number of male and female births; and that he, there-
fore, wiſhes a farther inquiry may , be made.into this fub-"
jeR., This has induced me ta collect the following facts, A
which, I Dk, will abundantly ſettle this point.
