The magnitude and continuity of the frontal torus, the accompanying supra-toral
fossa which. gives emphasis to it, and the confluent passage into its curvature of the
nasal bones are all characters of great significance. The glabella, which contributes to
the composition of the torus, shares its importance ; but when, after full appreciation
of this fact, we have assigned to the glabella its value as expressed by its index, we
must be careful in subsequent analysis to eliminate its influence as far as possible ;
for to introduce it into fresh measurements of other characters would be to count it
over more than once and thus to exaggerate its part. Such a proceeding is all the
more dangerous since its real nature may be cloaked only too easily under the
obscurity of statistics. Yet the magnitude of the glabella certainly has this
illegitimate effect in several of ScHwALBE’s measurements, such, for instance, as the
frontal angle, the altitudinal index, and the so-called bregma angle. This follows
from the fact that the line which this distinguished anatomist selects as a base is
drawn from the glabella to the inion, so that the glabella contributes to its length ;
a line from nasion to inion would have been less open to objection, a fact recognised
by Scuwaxpe, for he remarks that this would have certainly afforded a more
rational base, and only rejects it on the ground that the difference in the base
scarcely affects the general results. So far as the Neandertal calotte when
considered. alone is concerned, this is doubtless correct, but the fact is overlooked that
the effect becomes more considerable when this skull is brought into comparison with
others in which the glabella is less strongly pronounced. In any case, “ die
rationellere Basallinie,” 7.c., the nasi-inion line, would seem to offer the safer guidance
and we shall therefore adopt it, at the same time giving measurements founded on
the glabella-inion line for comparison with the results obtained by Scuwa.Be.
