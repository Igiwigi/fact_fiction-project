When
the wick increases to a considerable size from collecting
charcoal, it cools the flame by radiation, and prevents a
proper quantity of air from mixing with its central part; in
consequence, the charcoal thrown off from the top of the
flame is only red hot, and the greater part of it escapes un-
consumed. The intensity of the light of flames in the atmosphere is
increased by condensation, and diminished by rarefaction,
apparently in a higher ratio than their heat, more particles
capable of emitting light exist in the denser atmospheres,
and yet most of these particles in becoming capable of emit-
ting light, absorb heat; which could not be the case in the
condensation of a pure supporting medium. The facts stated in Section I. show that the luminous
appearances of shooting stars and meteors cannot be owing
to any inflammation of elastic fluids, but must depend upon
the ignition of solid bodies. Dr. HALLey calculated the height
of a meteor at ninety miles, and the great American meteor
