2 we found analogous phenomena. 'The great height to which the Loess rises in the
S neighbourhood of Paris has often been remarked upon by the French geologists, and
B its occurrence on the hills aboye Meudon has long presented a difficulty *. Its height
S there is about 320 feet measured by an aneroid barometer. It is perfectly well
SZ developed, is several feet thick, contains a few land shells, and presents all the cha-
E racters of the same material on the lower levels. M. CHARLEs D'ORBIGNY has shown
Z me the Loess rising up to the top of the hill above Ivry, and between the fort and
V Villejuif. It there attains a height of 305 feet above the river. These levels give a
EZ height above the high-level gravels of 150 to 200 feet, for at the Butte-aux-Cailles these
Z are not more than 130 feet above the river; but some gravels I observed on a hill-terrace
near Mont Valcrien may be as much as 150 to 160 feet above the Seine. Further search
may also show the existence of higher beds; or such beds may have been denuded.
However much, in fact, the Loess may extend beyond the limits of the present river-
valleys, it is always bounded by higher hills flanking the 'plains and the lower ranges.
Thus, though it spreads over the low plains and hills of Belgium, it does not rise more
than two-thirds up the flanks of Mont St. Pierre at Maestricht. In Kent it extends
far up the slopes of the hills flanking the river-valleys, but it is in all cases bounded

* This outlier of Loess has been represented as capping those hills. This would greatly increase the
difficulty of connecting it with any old river-action, as it would extend the river boundaries to a compara-
tively indefinite distance, Such, however, is not the case. High as it is, it is still at least 100 feet below the
summit of the hill.
