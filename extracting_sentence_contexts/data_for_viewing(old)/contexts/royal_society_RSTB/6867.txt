removed the two wires will at first share a common spiral, but their coils do not inter-
lock at any point and they can separate laterally without any impediment. Two spirals,
each with the amplitude of the original one, will then diverge from the tied end.

It seems highly probable that the manner of separation of chromatids at meiosis
is an indication that the meiotic spiral is of a different geometrical type from that
exemplified in mitosis. Since both are constructional it seems probable that chromo-
some structure after pachytene must in some way be different from chromosome
structure at mitosis. The words ‘‘after pachytene” are used intentionally rather than
“after pairing”’, for these geometrical considerations of the spiral apply to all chromo-
somes at the first meiotic division, whether paired or unpaired (e.g. as in figs. 68,
73 from the triploid). The physical basis of this difference cannot at the moment be
fully specified, but one fact regarding it will be described on p. 199.

THE EARLY MEIOTIC PROPHASES

The way is now clear for examination of the early meiotic prophases. The general
appearances of these are shown in figs. 10 e¢ seq., Plate 16, and the details in figs. 29-45,
Plate 17. The technique is the same as for the preceding stages of mitosis, all of which
are from one pinna. All the early meiotic figures up to zygotene (i.e. figs. 10-14) are
from another pinna of the same frond fixed two days later. The remaining stages,

* An inexperienced reader is strongly advised to perform this experiment or alternatively to refer
to Geitler’s figs. 27, 38 and 32 (1938) previously quoted.
