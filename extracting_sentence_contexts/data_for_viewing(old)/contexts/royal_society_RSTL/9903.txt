stunted, and very dark green, leafy growth. This colour indicates a high percentage
of nitrogen in the dry substance, or more properly speaking a deficient assimilation of
- carbon in proportion to the nitrogen taken up, owing to deficient mineral snpply.
The result was a considerable increase in the amount of nitrogen taken up compared
with that without manure, but still, less than with the mineral manure alone without
nitrogen,

With the mixture of the nitrogenous and mineral manures, on the other hand, the
produce was still more gramineous than with the ammonia-salts alone ; in fact, the
weight per acre of gramineous herbage averaged more than twice as much ; the pro-
portion of the produce due to both leguminous and miscellaneous species was also
less, though the average weight per acre of both was rather more. But here, the still
more characteristically gramineous herbage was made up in much less degree of a few
8pecies only, Thus, whilst Festuca ovina and Agrostis vulgaris contributed by far
the larger proportion of the total herbage grown by ammonia-salts alone, and Anthox-
anthum odoratum, Holeus lanatus, and Dactylis glomerata were only very moderately,
and every other grass very sparingly, represented, with the ammonia-salts and mineral
manure together both Festuca ovina and Agrostis were much less prominent, ZHolcus
and Dactylis were nearly as much 80, and Poa pratensis was the most prominent of
all. The character of development of the grasses was, moreover, totally different ; there
being, when mineral manures, including potass, as well as ammonia-salts, were used, a
