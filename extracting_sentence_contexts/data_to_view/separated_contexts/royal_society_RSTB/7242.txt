The cause of these move-
ments is not known. (159) The perception of small coloured test objects

Attention has been directed previously to the fact that yellow and blue test objects in
close apposition, tend to decolorize one another. This was particularly noticed in the case
of a grating consisting of alternate blue and yellow bars, which were replaced by black
and white (see ยง 41, p. 550). But a similar observation was also made in the case of a
grating with bars of red and blue-green, which also became black and white.
