in fact, appear to be congeneric.

The specific name jonesi was really an invalid renaming of Nummulites liassicus Jones
on its transfer to Involutina by Terquem and Piette, as Terquem explains in his intro-
duction (1862, 2FL, p. 425). This explanation has been accepted by, I think, all later
authors.

In his revision of 1874 Bornemann invalidly chose J. jonesi (=liassica) as the type
and only species of Jnvolutina.

To his new genus Problematina Bornemann assigned three of Terquem’s species, and
the first he mentioned, Jnvolutina deslongchampsi, was designated as genotype by Cush-
man (1927, Contr. Cushman Lab. 3, p. 188). Since, in my opinion, this species isa synonym
