Shortly after this had
been done, 1 noticed that the pigment was in a state of full diffusion in a ring round
about the opaque mass, producing the reticular appearance shown in the stripe down the

b; middle of the sketch. I had in a preyious case seen a similar ring become affected with
Q congestion, when a portion of mustard had been applied for a long time, in conse-
JN quence of the pungent yapour of the volatile oil Playing upon the neighbouring parts
Z of the web, and there could be no doubt that the effect on the pigment in the present
=y instance was due to the 8ame cause ; but in the latter no material change was as yet
E visible in the blood except close to the edge of the mustard, where the corpuscles were

[= the irritant had lain being examined, was found to be the seat of the most intense inflam-
Z matory congestion, indicated in the drawing by the crimson colour of the vessels, but
Â© the pigment there had experienced only an exceedingly light degree of diffusion, being,
S in fact, almost exactly in the same state as at the commencement of the experiment.
'Z Thus the yapour of the volatile oil, though operating too mildly to cause inflammatory
= congestion, nevertheless induced the highest possible degree of pigmentary diffusion ; 2
