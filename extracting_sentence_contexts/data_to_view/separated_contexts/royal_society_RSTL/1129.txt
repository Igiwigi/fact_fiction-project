BerTHoOLLET, and Dr. Muxxray, of Edinburgh,
who both contended for greater latitude as to the proportions
in which hydrogen and charcoal are capable of uniting, and
considered these proportions indeed as subject to no limita-
tion. The facts, however, which have since been multiplied in
this, as well as in other departments of chemistry, tending to
prove, that bodies capable of energetic combination unite in a
few definite proportions only, leave little doubt that the same
law holds good with respect to the compounds of hydrogen
and charcoal. Not that it is meant that the known compounds
of those elements are the only possible ones ; for others will
probably be discovered, which will still be found conformable
to the general law, that when one body combines with another in

different proportions, the greater proportions are multiples of the
less by an entire number.
