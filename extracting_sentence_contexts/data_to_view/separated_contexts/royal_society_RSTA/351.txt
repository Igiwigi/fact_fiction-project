This feature will be referred
to as an ‘emission edge’. In the case of metals, the edge occurs at the short wave-
length limit of the band; the amount of radiation emitted of shorter wave-lengths
is very small. In the case of L-spectra the edge is doubled; this corresponds obviously
to the fact that we are dealing with two L-levels, the L,- and the L,-level. Since L,-
and L,-levels differ only in spin, it is safe to assume that the corresponding band forms
are identical; and the weakness of the L,-spectra makes it a fairly simple matter to
separate them out to give the pure L,-spectra. L,-levels, as we shall show subsequently,
do not provide any observable spectra.
