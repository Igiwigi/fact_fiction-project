Results of one-way BACI ANOVAs comparing differences between monthly mean data for bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton from Lake 260 and
for unimpacted reference lakes before, during and after EE2 additions. No corrections were made for multiple comparisons.

not possible because of the absence of pre-impact data from 260 and 442 in all years but 2002; in the second year of
reference Lake 240 and the fact that Chaoborus have lifespans

of 1-2 years in ELA lakes, making data points within years
non-independent. Nonetheless, the data are consistent with
an effect of EE2 additions. EE2 additions, aerial abundances in emergence traps in Lake
260 increased about twofold when compared with previous
years (electronic supplementary material, figures S1 and S8a).
