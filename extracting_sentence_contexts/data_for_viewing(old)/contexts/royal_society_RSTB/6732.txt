However, some of the smaller fibres of the n. cristae staticae probably end in the
hinder part of the pedal ganglion, some perhaps even in the 1. magnocellularis. But
it is the . maculae staticae which is in the most close relationship with the giant-cell
lobe, which it enters posteriorly and ventrally (figs. 3, 4). The fibres spread out in the
lobe and many of them branch and presumably make synaptic contacts in the lobe,
though it is not easy to follow individual fibres with certainty. It has not yet been
determined whether all the fibres end in the lobe, or if some pass to the chiasma in the
pedal ganglion.

Even more remarkable than the spreading out of these statocyst fibres in the lobe,
is the way in which the ventral dendrites of the giant cell itself are entangled in the
n. maculae staticae (figs. 3, 4). Some of the finer dendrites accompany the nerve
beyond the margin of the ganglion proper, and in fact almost to the sensory epithelium
itself. The connexion is so close that it is difficult to believe it to be without functional
significance. It is possible that impulses in the fibres from the statocyst influence the
dendrite by a sort of collateral synapse.

Two other sets of fibres enter the ventral part of the lobus magnocellularis and are
probably tactile. The brachio-magnocellular tract (figs. 3, 4 and fig. 24, Plate 43) is a
bundle which, besides efferent fibres, carries many afferents which undoubtedly end
in the lobe, forming a dense network of fibres and terminal knobs around the dendrites
of the giant cells. It is reasonable to suppose that these are either afferent fibres
running through from the skin of the arms, or are processes of cells in the brachial
ganglion which are connected with such afferents. Entering close to this tract are
bundles from the n. postorbitalis and n. collaris (figs. 3, 4) which contain sensory
