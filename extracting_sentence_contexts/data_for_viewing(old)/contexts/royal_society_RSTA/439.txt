vertical pendulum supported at its mass centre, in recent times this direct approach to measuring


G has been tried [15-17] with respective accuracies of 1.4, 5.0 and 1.7 x 10-3—none fully up
to the accuracy reported in 1896 by C. V. Boys, whose work is discussed later in this section.
(At this meeting G. M. Tino told us about his group’s latest free-fall measurement of G that
again used atom interferometry and which had an accuracy of 1.5 x 10-4! A paper about this
now-becoming-interesting determination appears in these proceedings.)

While the measurement accuracy of little g has increased by eight orders of magnitude during
its 400-year measurement history, the measurement accuracy of big G has only increased by three
orders of magnitude during its 300-year measurement history. Why, you might ask, has big G’s
accuracy not benefitted from a similar sort of increase? I think the reason rests with the fact that
the concomitant ‘noise sources’ have stood their ground (not gotten any smaller) and as such,
they continue to hide the really small ‘big’ G signal. On the other hand, little g’s sea of systematic
problems does not appear until one reaches today’s obtained accuracies of a few parts in 10°.
Accordingly, from this time forward, further increases in the accuracy with which little g can be
measured will be hard won.

One other factor is that the measurement of little g has many practical uses and as such, has
enjoyed considerable ‘research support’ because of these applications. Big G on the other hand,
has essentially no practical uses (knowing its value to 1% satisfies the few demands on knowing
its actual value) and accordingly, the kind of continuing support which would be required to
make a focused frontal attack on its accuracy has been missing. I know, and many readers of this
paper will also know, that this measurement is one of the toughest (and therefore most useful)
