with hatchets and ice tools, 80 as to arrive at a nearly eyen surface of the hard deli-

water from the part under experiment. The theodolite being stationed as usnal over

+ Mr. WiLLi1zansos, Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge, to whom I proposed this experimental test of the
theory of movement by echelons, made a series of independent observations on the Mer de Glace, which coin-

which he observed on different glaciers, I am glad to say that Mr. WiLLiamso0N was led to abandon the theory
of sliding columns or fragments, and to accept that of plasticity as connected with the mechanism of the veined
structure which I have endeavoured to illustrate above.
