tozoon, and the duration of its fecundatory power, are in a ratio inverse to that of an
increase of temperature in the surrounding medium,

2. EVOLUTION OF VITALITY IN THE SPERMATOZOON AND OVUM.

Wacxer and Levckarpr have already pointed out* that the power of motion
possessed by the spermatozoon is elosely connected with the completion of its struc-
ture and composition, and is gradually evolved as the development of this body
proceeds. This power of motion I shall presently endeavour to show I regard as the
visible exponent of its fecundatory force, or form of vitality, and that a similar power
is evolved concurrently with this in the gpermatozoon in the contents of the egg, the
evolution in both being more or less influenced by temperature, according to the
species. These facts are well shown both in the Frog and Toad.

Several pairs of Frogs were collected on the 2nd of March, when the temperature
of the season was low, and strong easterly winds prevailed, during which Frogs
seldom spawn, except in very sheltered places. As one female had passed some eggs,
and believing that the others were equally advanced, I selected a pair, which
appeared to be the most mature, for experiment. The fluid from the male was
obtained with the greatest ease, in full quantity of a white and somewhat opake
colour. When examined with the microscope it was found to consist in chief part of
developmental cells, containing each its motionless immature spermatozoon. Besides
these cells it also included many others less far advanced, and in which I was unable
to distinguish this body. In addition to these there were some also from which the
spermatozoa were in the act of being liberated, besides many very active spermatozoa
