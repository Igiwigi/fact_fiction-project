MirLeR is certainly mistaken in
his statement that fig. 33 follows directly after fig. 32, without the intervention of a
Schizopod stage, for the metamorphosis is really quite complicated, and a true Schizopod
stage exists, although it is of extremely ehort duration. F

VI.—RELaTION BETWEEN THE LARVA oF LUCIFER, ACETES, SERGESTES, PEXAUS,
AND EUPHAUSIA, AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DECAPOD ZofA AND THE
CruUsTACEAN NAUPLIUS. A STUDY IN MORPHOLOGY. 109

The general significance of the peculiar type of Decapod metamorphosis, of which
Tneifer is now the most thoroughly known illustration, has been discussed with the
greatest ability and knowledge of the facts by Cavs in his © Untersuchungen zur
Erforschung der Genealogischen Grundlage des Crustacean-Systems.” My own ac-
quaintance with the phenomena of Crustacean morphology in general is very far from

= heing sufficiently extended and minute to qualify me for a critical discussion of this
a work; but while the facts in the life-history of Lucifer seem to tend to a similar con-
5 clusion, and even to place it upon a much firmer basis than before, they also indicate
= that CLavs's views cannot receive unqualified acceptance in their present shape.

= T shall not venture at present upon the broader aspects of the question, but I wish
» to draw attention to the resemblances and differences between the various larval
bl

& s8tages of Lucifer and those of a few closely-related forms. The materials which are at
g present available for a comparison of this kind are extremely scanty, for there is no
Z other closely-related form in which all stages, from the egg to the adult, have been
2 actually traced in a single species by rearing captive specimens. S Comparison of Lauciter and Acetes.
