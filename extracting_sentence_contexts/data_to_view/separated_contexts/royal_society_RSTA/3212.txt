Reichsanstalt,’ 4, 239, 1905) has
elaborated a very accurate formula which takes the form

7h = Aat+B(1—a) +Cm,

where « is the coefficient of ionisation. GriNEIsEN has given the constants A, B,
and © for a large number of electrolytes, and the formula brings out the important
fact that the equivalent viscosity increment for electrolytes has a minimum value at
concentrations varying from normal to $ normal. But GrRiNEISEN’s results stop
short of furnishing a theoretical explanation of the facts. He observes (loc. cit.,
