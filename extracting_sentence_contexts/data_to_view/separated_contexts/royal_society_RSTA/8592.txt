Both these crystals
are diamagnetic. Saltpetre cleaves parallel to its axis; topaz perpendicular to its
axis. The planes of cleavage, therefore, stand in both cases equatorial, thus agreeing
with sulphate of zine and sulphate of magnesia. ~

“Where do these facts point? A moment’s speculation will perhaps be allowed us
here. May we not suppose these crystals to be composed of layers indefinitely thin,
laid side by side, within the range of cohesion, which holds them together, but yet not
in absolute contact?
