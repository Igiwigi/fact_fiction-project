Tn fig. 2 such a graph for an imaginary bar calibrated into # equal parts is shown by
the full circles. The end points of the graph are necessarily zero, for Â»(0/0), and 9(0/z),
are by definition equal to zero. This does not imply that in making readings on the two
end graduations no errors of observation have been made, and in actual fact, by forcing
