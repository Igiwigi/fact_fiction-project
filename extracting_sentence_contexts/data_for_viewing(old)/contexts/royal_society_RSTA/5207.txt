summer 1995, the collider energy was continuously increased, from 130 GeV up to approximately
206 GeV reached in 2000. During the LEP2 era the experiments continued the study of fermionâ€”
antifermion production,? but, more interestingly, at higher centre-of-mass energy new physics
channels became accessible, such as the production of a pair of W or Z bosons. Also, the Higgs
search became a central theme of the activities, as discussed below.

The Tevatron at Fermilab near Chicago was a proton-antiproton collider, installed in a ring of
approximately 7 km circumference and operated from 1983 up to September 2011. Most relevant
for the later discussion of Higgs searches at this accelerator was its Run II period (2001-2011),
during which proton-antiproton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV were recorded
by the two experiments CDF and D@. The spectrum of physics processes studied at a hadron
collider such as the Tevatron or the LHC is much richer and more complicated than an ete~
machine. In fact, space constraints prevent a discussion of the Tevatron physics programme here.
However, just to mention one of the interesting processes, with some resemblance to those at
LEP, Z bosons can also be produced in proton-antiproton collisions and subsequently decay
to, for example, lepton-antilepton pairs. However, in contrast to LEP, here the Z boson can be
accompanied by one or more hadronic jets from initial- or final-state gluon radiation, as well by
further hadronic activity due to the so-called underlying event. I mention this type of process
since it turned out to be important to the Higgs search, as discussed later.

3. The pre-LEP history

Interestingly, it took about a decade from the original formulations of the Higgs mechanism
until the first comprehensive phenomenological study of Higgs production and decay was
