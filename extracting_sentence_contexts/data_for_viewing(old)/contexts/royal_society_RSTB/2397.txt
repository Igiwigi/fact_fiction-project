fossils. It is a fact of some interest that this curious seed-like form of Lycopodiaceous
fructification should have already appeared at so ancient a period as that of the
Calciferous Sandstone deposits, which belong to the lowest strata of the Carboniferous
Formation. At present, Lepidocarpon Wildianum has only been found in the form of
detached specimens, in the mature, seed-like condition. Further search in the rich
material from this locality will no doubt reveal other stages of this fructification.
In the meantime, the specimens at present available are of value, as supplementing
our knowledge of the closely similar Coal-Measure form.

In Plate 42, fig. 16, a small specimen of Lepidocarpon Wildianum is represented in
tangential section. From its narrow proportions the section appears to have been cut

* The incompleteness of the integuments accounts for the fact that they are not always to be found in
the transverse sections of the strobilus,

near the proximal end, especially as the sporangium is here scarcely if at all attached
to the sporophyll beneath. The sporangium has the same organisation as in the Coal-
Measure species; the outer layer of its wall has the customary columnar structure,
and is lined by a delicate tissue, several cells in thickness. The integument, which
just overtops the sporangium, is formed of dense fibrous tissue, and the sporophyll-
pedicel is also, for the most part, of firm construction. This section corresponds very
