we conceive of the world should also be taken into account when discussing the classification of
scientific entities.

Having reviewed these developments in the philosophy of classification, and the way that
natural kinds are conceived, we can return to the question of improving the periodic table.

Tl. Back to the periodic table

If we are to believe what the experts on the philosophy of classification and natural kinds have
to tell us we should renounce the notion that we will ever arrive at a truly optimal periodic table,
since any system of classification must inevitably remain interest dependent. Of course this state
of affairs should not negate the attempts to resolve such questions as the membership of group 3
of the periodic table, but it should remind us of the fact that any resolution must concede a certain
degree of conventionality, or choice, on the part of the scientific community.

For example, another currently debated topic concerning the classification of the elements
has been the debate concerning the relative virtues of Janetâ€™s left-step periodic table [42]. This
representation is arrived at by making two simple changes to the 32-column table shown in
figure 5. The first change requires that helium be moved from its traditional position, at the top of
group 18, to the top of group 2. The second change is to relocate the now modified s-block of the
table to the right-hand edge, to the right of the p-block (figure 14).

This table is more consistent from a physical perspective since atoms of helium contain two
electrons and is therefore analogous to the atoms of the traditional group 2 of the periodic
table, all of which possess two outer electrons. Another attractive feature of the left-step table
