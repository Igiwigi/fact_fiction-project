This apparent counterevi-
dence, however, does not necessitate such a link, as it can be accommodated in
the updated formulation of RPT [3]. For example, some types of recurrent proces-
sing may occur during inattention, while the key types that are necessary for
conscious perception may not. Therefore, RPT does not in fact mandate a
mutual independence of (all types of) attention and consciousness. Second, attention does not necessarily lead to cognitive access. We outlined
this point on page 3 of our original paper [1], and M&H have written extensively
in agreement [4].
