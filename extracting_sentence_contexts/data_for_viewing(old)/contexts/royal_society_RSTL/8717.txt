viz. the expression on the Rs. Side is here the mass of the shell thickness If.
Taking 8=3 we have the ordinary formule for the Potential of a uniform spherical
shell.

V'=Mlog/ &+0, V"=M log,

each satisfying the potential equation oF 4 FE 4 but V', instead of vanishing, is

infinite at infinity, and the conditions of the theorem are not satisfied ; the Potential of
the cylinder is in fact infinite. But the failure is a mere consequence of the special
value of s, viz. this is such that sâ€”2, instead of being positive, is =0. Reverting
to the general case of (s+1)dimensional space, let the surface be the infinite cylinder
a*... +2=f*; and assume
