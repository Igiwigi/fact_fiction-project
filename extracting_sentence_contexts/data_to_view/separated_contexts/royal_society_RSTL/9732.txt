Although there was very little less nitrogen taken up than where the ammonia-salts
were till applied, the percentage of nitrogen in the dry substance of the mixed
herbage was reduced by more than one-third. In other words, with the increased
supply of mineral matter there was, for a given amount of nitrogen taken up, a greatly
increased growth, involving a greatly increased amount of carbon assimilated. Of total mineral matter there was, with the increased supply of it, an increased
instead of a much reduced actual amount of it taken up ; in fact, there was twice
as much taken up during the seven years as where the application of ammonia-salts
alone was continued, and the percentage of it in the dry matter of the produce was
also higher. There was, over the seven years, more of every mineral constituent
(except 8oda) taken up on plot 6 with the mineral manure, than on plot 5 with the
ammonia-salts. Of potass there was nearly four times, of phosphoric acid about two-
and-a-half times, of sulphuric acid about one-and-a-half time, and of silica (of which
none was supplied in the manure) more than one-and-a-half time, as much taken up
as where the ammonia-salts were still used.
