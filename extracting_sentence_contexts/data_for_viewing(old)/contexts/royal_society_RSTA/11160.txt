strained crystalline grains of iron under vertical light and under oblique light.

Rotation of the stage upon which the strained specimen is fixed makes the bands
on one or another of the grains flash out successively with kaleidoscopic eftect.
When the specimen is rotated through 180° from the position in which the lines
show brightly on one particular grain, the lines on that grain do not shine out
again, though they may be visible as black lines on a very faintly luminous back-
ground ; this is important as proving that the lines are not due to either furrows or
ridges, but to steps in the surface. In this respect there is a striking contrast
between the slip-bands and any accidental furrows or scratches which may have been
left on the specimen through imperfect polishing.

Incidentally, fig. 17 illustrates the fact that oblique light picks out the boundaries
of the crystalline grains, showing that these boundaries are marked by inclined
surfaces connecting grains whose faces are at different levels. This is observed
also in ‘the etched surface of the metal before straining. The boundaries, which
appear dark under vertical light, are bright on one side of each crystalline grain
when the light falls with grazing incidence from one side; but the sloping sur-
faces which mark the boundaries between the grains have not the sharply-defined
inclination of the slip-surfaces. The lines due to slip-bands on one or more grains
will shine out brightly when the light has a particular angle of incidence, and will
vanish when the incidence is slightly changed. The boundaries are generally not so
bright, but remain visible under a considerable range of incidence.

Figs. 18, 19, and 20 present a striking example of the kaleidoscopic effect under
