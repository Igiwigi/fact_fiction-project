Such signals have been established to some extent upon our own coasts, and to a still
greater extent along the coasts of Canada and the United States. But the evidence as
to their value and performance is of the most conflicting character, and no investigation
sufficiently thorough to clear up the uncertainty has hitherto been made. In fact, while
the velocity of 8ound has formed the snbject of refined and repeated experiment by
the ablest philosophers, since the publication of Dr. Dernax's celebrated paper in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1708, no systematic inquiry has, to my knowledge, been
made into the causes which affect the intensity of ound in the atmosphere. As an attempt to fill the blank here indicated, I beg to submit to the Royal Society
some account of an investigation on fog-signals recently carried out at the instance of,
and in conjunction with, the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House.
