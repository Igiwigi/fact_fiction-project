This paper has outlined the present status of DBT. It deals with a relatively new method
of primary gas thermometry linking the thermal energy to an absolute frequency, namely
the line centre frequency of an atomic or molecular resonance, and a frequency interval,
which is the Doppler width of the line. Compared with other optical methods, such as total
radiation thermometry, it has the advantage of requiring relative intensity measurements of the
electromagnetic radiation.

It has been shown how the method could fully exploit the mature technology of laser
frequency control and measurement, either in the near- or in the mid-infrared regions. In
fact, the DBT methodology has recently benefited from the extremely small uncertainties in
building an absolute frequency scale underneath an absorption spectrum. In this respect, two
main approaches have been described: one of the them is based upon the technology of optical
frequency comb synthesizers, the other one makes use of a reference oscillator that is stabilized
against a Doppler-free molecular absorption line. Such a reference oscillator can be based upon
an ECDL, a CO} laser or a QCL, as recently demonstrated [79].

As for the thermometric substance, it is surely a matter of discussion whether it is more
advantageous to work with atoms or molecules. A low-pressure atomic vapour system, such as
Rb or Cs, offers the advantage of the simple structure of its absorption spectrum, when compared
with polyatomic molecules. Furthermore, collisional perturbations of the absorption profile can
be neglected, because the vapour pressure can be extremely small (approx. 10~4 Pa) [80,81]. On
the other hand, alkali or alkaline-earth metal atoms present other difficulties, including the strong
