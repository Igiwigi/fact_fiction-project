It is possible to predict from laboratory experiments the length of time taken by the
fish to develop from the stage of maturity, referred to above as Stage II, to the condition
of full breeding activity. As will be shown later, the full development of maturity
might be expected about seven days after the fish were observed migrating up the
tunnel.

This was confirmed by transferring the fish from the river to a stream similar to
that at the top of the tunnel. This second stream was known not to contain any fish
before the experiment was started, nor was it connected either with the river or another
stream. About fifty fish, the majority of which were in Stage II of maturity, were
caught in the river and placed in the stream. After a week these fish could still be
seen in this stream, two nests were found and a number of males with the full breeding
colours seen. he fact that these fish in the streams began breeding earlier than those
which finally nested in the shallows of the river, is probably due chiefly to the higher
temperature of the water in the stream as compared with that of the river. Experi-
mental evidence of this will be given later.

The migrations of Gasterosteus in the neighbourhood of Baitsbite appear to be as
follows :â€”

The fish leave the feeding ground off the sewer outflow and enter the shallows of
the river. Some of the fish then endeavour to move into the shallow streams connected
with the river. In about ten or twelve days from their first movement away from the
feeding ground the fish nest, either in the shallow breeding streams or in the sheltered
