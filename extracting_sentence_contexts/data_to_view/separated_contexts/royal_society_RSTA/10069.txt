The effect of this increased complexity would be that the velocity of the ion would
be diminished without altering the ionic change, and also that the concentration
change at the cathode would be lessened, owing to the carriage of extra solvent
molecules to the cathode. Both of these effects would cause a diminution of the
cation transport number as the solution was diluted. It will be noticed that this explanation involves a change in the active mass of the
solvent, and, as a matter of fact, it was not possible to measure the transport number
except in solutions which were so concentrated, that the assumption of a constant
active mass for the solvent was no longer justified. We have not been able to calculate, even approximately, the velocity of the various
ions, as we had no means of determining the actual nature, concentration, or degree of
dissociation of the corresponding electrolytes. Summary.
