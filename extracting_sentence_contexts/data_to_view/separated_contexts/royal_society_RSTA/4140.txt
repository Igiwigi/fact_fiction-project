Such 2
patterns might, alternatively, be captured by the so-called algorithmic randomness. This sense of aed
randomness provides a probabilistic guarantee of such an absence of patterns, since almost all 22
sequences are (computationally, Martin-L6f) random, yet is unable to guarantee absolutely the : 8
non-presence of computable patterns. DNS

Specifically, algorithmic randomness has been considered to be characterized by an absence of : z
patterns and defined (in algorithmic information theory) via the property of the incompressibility : &

of finite strings of symbols, and the latter suffers first from the fact that the complexity of any
string is only fixed up to a constant which depends on the universal Turing machine considered. In order to develop a more rigorous notion of algorithmic randomness, it would thus appear
necessary to consider the limit case of infinite sequences of bits. One then finds that there are no
maximally random sequences (cf. [10]).
