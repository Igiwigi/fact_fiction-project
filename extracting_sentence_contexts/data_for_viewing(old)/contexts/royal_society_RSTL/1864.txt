158. One form of apparatus which I purpose having arranged, is to have
several discs superposed ; the discs are to be metallically connected, alternately
at the edges and at the centres, by means of mercury; and are then to be re-
volved alternately in opposite directions, 1. e. the first, third, fifth, &c. to the
right hand, and the second, fourth, sixth, &c. to the left hand ; the whole being
placed s0 that the discs are perpendicular to the dip, or intersect most directly
the magnetic curves of powerful magnets. The electricity will be from the
centre to the circumference in one set of discs, and from the circumference to
the centre in those on each side of them ; thus the action of the whole will
conjoin to produce one combined and more powerful current.

159. I have rather, however, been desirous of discovering new facts and
new relations dependent on magneto-electric induction, than of exalting the

force of those already obtained ; being assured that the latter would find their
full development hereafter.

160. I referred in my former paper to the probable influence of terrestrial
magneto-electric induction (137.) in producing, either altogether or in part,
the phenomena observed by Messrs. CurismIE and BarLow #*, whilst revolving
ferruginous bodies; and especially those obseryed by the latter when rapidly
