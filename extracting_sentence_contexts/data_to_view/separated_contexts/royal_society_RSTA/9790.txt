A. FOWLER ON THE SPECTRUM OF MAGNESIUM HYDRIDE. 451

the poles became heated and entered into combination with the magnesium vapour
in the outer parts of the are. Other experiments have shown that hydrogen is
occluded in considerable quantity in the metal, and, in fact, the C and F lines were
often present in the spectrum, although no hydrogen was otherwise introduced into
the globe. Attempts to completely expel the occluded hydrogen from the metal
employed have not been successful. In this experiment, if a high vacuum was first produced, the oxide bands were not
seen at all, but the hydride spectrum gradually appeared as before.
