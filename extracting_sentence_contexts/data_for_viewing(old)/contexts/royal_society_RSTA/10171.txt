3rd Group.—Experiments Showing the Stimulating Influence of Hydrogen upon
the Catalysing Power of the Surface.

The fact that the rate of combination throughout a given experiment is always
proportional to the partial pressure of the hydrogen, can hardly have any other
meaning than that the formation of steam is an indirect process, dependent on a
primary change, induced by the surface, in which the hydrogen is concerned, This

led us to investigate the separate influence of hydrogen and oxygen respectively at
430°, and also of hydrogen at red heat, upon the catalysing power of the surface.
