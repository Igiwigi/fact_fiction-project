Hence,
if E. cordatum be regarded as phylogerontic (a reasonable hypothesis), the
recrudescence of phylobrephic structure seems to-imply that reversionary tendency
in racial old-age that has been aptly termed “ second-childhood.” In a recent paper,
L. F. Sparn (1919) draws attention to the fact that the suture of Jndoceras
baluchistanense, NortLinc, with 37 lobes and 38 saddles, recalls the “acme of
specialisation among Triassic Ammonites.” He argues that this, one of the last of
the Ammonites, fails to reveal gerontic characters, and ascribes the sutural elabora-
tion to environmental conditions. By a similar argument, Lovenechinus should have
been a burrower in the sand like Echinocardium, but such a supposition appears
grotesque, in view of its general structure. May not Indoceras afford another
illustration of imperfect atavism in a gerontic form ?
