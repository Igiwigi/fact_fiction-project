'The great develop»
ment of these plants when ammonia was supplied (which was in fact almost in prv-
portion to the amount supplied), the cessation of growth with the limit of the suppls
together with the contrast between the growth with the aid of the ammonia and that
without it, all afford evidence in one direction in regard to the question at is$Ue, 50 far
as these plants are concerned. In Table XIV., relating to the plants to which ammonia was supplied, an experiment
with clover is recorded. Reference to the remarks in the Appendix, Þ. 975, will how


that we failed to get any growth with clover without” the | addition of ammonia.

- Hence, excepting s0 far as this fact is itself a point for remark, no contrast can be

drawn between the growth of this plant with and without an extraneous supply of

combined Nitrogen. From what has already been said, it will be easily understood that the contrast be-
tween the beans and peas grown with and without the addition of ammonia is not
very satisfactory. These plants proved to be 80 sensitive, under the conditions provided

in the experiments, that it was obyious that, in many cases, they suffered from other
causes than a want of combined Nitrogen, which we were not able to control.
