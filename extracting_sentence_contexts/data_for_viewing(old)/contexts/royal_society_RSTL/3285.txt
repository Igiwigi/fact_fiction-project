shelf as any in Glen Roy; and although the fragments of it do not extend over more
than, perhaps, balf a mile in length, its origin must be as carefully attended to in any
general theory of the formation of the shelyes, as if its length had been twenty times
as great. Its want of continuity and shortness possess, indeed, in themselves much
interest, because we thus know that those causes which have marked with horizontal
lines the sides of the mountains of Glen Roy in s0 wonderful a manner, have been in
action here, though they have produced but little effect. Moreover, we see that if
the surface had been originally rather more rocky, or had been less steeply inclined
than at present, or had been subjected to a very little more alluvial action, all evi-
dence would have been obliterated of the extension thus far of the action of these
causes.

I have already alluded to the important fact communicated to me by Sir Davip
BrewsTER, namely, that he has seen $helves in the valley of the Spey. At Phones,
which is situated about a mile from the Truim, and about five above its confluence
with the Spey, one broad and well-marked shelf occurs, along which a carriage can
be driven. On the banks of the Spey, about twenty-five miles below its source, two
shelves occur in an elevated angle between the Burns of Belleville and the river.
They are small; the upper one, however, is very broad; and their elevation is
about 800 feet above the sea. Sir David BrewsTER says, that the shelves in both
places appear horizontal, and that they resemble those of Glen Roy, though pos-
ses8ing far less grandeur and symmetry. The fact of their occurrence at these dis-
tant points is, as we $hall hereafter see, highly important.
