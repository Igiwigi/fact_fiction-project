Likewise, in the ever-expanding literature on the ecological effects of
climate change [5,6], loss of community diversity has not been a prominent theme. In the face of this seeming scarcity of evidence, here I argue that as climate
change intensifies, its likely effects will include widespread losses of terrestrial
plant community diversity across multiple spatial scales and organizational
levels. This assertion is based on empirical and modelling evidence that, first,
many future climates will be conducive to lower plant diversity than present
ones, even if dispersal were unlimited; second, dispersal by most plants is in
fact extremely limited relative to climate change velocity; and third, climatic
tolerances are linked to particular functional strategies and lineages, implying
potential losses of functional and phylogenetic diversity as well as taxonomic
diversity. Present evidence on climatic warming and plant community diversity
may be skewed by coming disproportionately from north-temperate alpine
mountaintops, where conditions are unusually favourable for increases in
species richness, at least at local scales and in the near term. Author for correspondence:
