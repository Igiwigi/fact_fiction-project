Douprvuyt stated that in the Dog opposed hemisections of the cervical region of the
cord when separated from each other by about 1-1'5 cm. did not interfere with the
production of movements in the lower limbs on exciting the cortex cerebri.

5. Ablation of one Hemisphere.

= To test localisation in principle Goxrzt has in the Dog removed large proportions of
fe brain, and recently§ succeeded in completing the ablation of one hemisphere.
gThe animal under these circumstances could walk, run, and use the limbs in all
agtomatic movements of feeding, &c., there being no obvious persistent hemiplegia as
ig Monkeys and Men. For many ts however, there is in the Carnivora marked
hemiplegia of the opposite side - the lesion (all authors), and according to Hitzie
the loss of the “‘ muscular sense” is permanent in these animals. This fact, as well as
the concomitant persistence of anesthesia to moderate tactile impressions, is also
cfpfirmed by the observations of Scuirr, and one of us (V. H.).

-2SEMoN and Horstey|| found that in all animals examined after removal of one
kigmisphere the “automatic” ¢.e., respiratory, movements of the vocal cords were

BBrfectly bilateral.
