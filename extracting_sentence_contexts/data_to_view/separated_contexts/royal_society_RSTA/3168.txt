Without these possibilities, it is not clear what a given modification is really testing. “3
As an example, let us consider the case of the possible new interactions in antimatter particles. :B

We start with the action for a test particle in a gravitational field: is

where I used the metric

ds? = (1 +29) df? — (1 — 24; dx dy’. 2) Ss

From the previous action, the equations of motion of the massive particle can be obtained. Note 8
that the coefficients in front of the gravitational potentials ¢ and y are universal. Hence, in the :
correct coordinates, one can locally cancel the gravitational field for all particles (and hence the areal
fact that constant gravitational potentials are unobservable in General Relativity). fo

The action (3.1) is valid for particles and antiparticles. One can easily modify it in both cases 24
in an arbitrary way. For instance, one can consider that antiparticles have the action ae

Here I have changed the coupling to the metric fields and included new possible force carriers
