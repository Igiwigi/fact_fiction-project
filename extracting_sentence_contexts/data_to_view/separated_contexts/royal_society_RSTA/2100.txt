We will call such work of purification dynamical reduction or simply
reduction. It seems widely accepted today that the concept of reduction has worked as a strong
motivating force for the advancement of nonlinear science over the past half-century. As a
remarkable fact, reduction provides, besides the explanation of how this or that dynamical
behaviour observed occurs, a powerful tool for predicting utterly new types of behaviour whose
existence in nature has never been imagined before. Since the result of reduction often takes a
universal form, the predicted dynamics is also expected to appear universally. The universal form
of the reduced evolution equation also implies that seemingly unrelated phenomena occurring
in systems of completely different physical constitution may have something in common at a
deeper mathematical level.
