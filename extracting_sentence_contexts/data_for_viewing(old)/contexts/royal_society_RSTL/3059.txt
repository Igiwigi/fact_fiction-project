temperature of boiling oil, melting lead, or boiling mercury ; all of which are,
however, placed aboye it in M. Guyrox's table. M. Guyrox also places the
melting point of silyer at the 22nd degree of Mr. Wzpcwoov's scale instead of
the 28th, which was, according to his own determination, a correction first $ug-
gested by Sir Janes Ha in the 9th volume of Nicnorson's Journal. Taking
the value{of each degree at 62.5 Fanr., it fixes this point at 1892 Fanr., which
agrees very nearly with my own experiment in the paper before alluded to;
but continuing the calculation up to the melting point of iron, upon the 8up-
position of an uniform progression, the 130th degree corresponds with 8696*
Fan., which, although only about half the amount 17977? assigned by Mr.
Wepawoop, is very far removed from the result of my calculation 3479.

Nevertheless, it is a curious fact, that M. Guyron's Es8ay contains proof that
his determination is erroneous, and that mine is a near approximation to the
truth. As a collateral means of verifying the indications of instruments in-
tended to measure high degrees of temperature, he refers to the calorimeter as
capable of affording the necessary data by a calculation from the amount of
heat communicated to known quantities of fire or water by bodies in a state of

and DzsormEs, who had in this manner determined the following points :
