This is the construction of the sextactic points obtained by PLUCKER and
STEINER.

40. Reverting to the equation of the line joining the point of contact of the five-
pointic conic with the point of simple intersection, this meets the cubic in a third point,
and Mr. SALMON has shown that this third point is in fact the second tangential (tan-
gential of the tangential) of the point of contact, or, what is the same thing—


CONTAOT AT ANY POINT OF A PLANE CURVE. 391

Theorem. —The point of simple intersection of the cubic and the five-pointic conic is
the third point of intersection with the cubic, of the line Joining the point of contact,
with the second tangential of this point.

41. I have not sought to yerify this theorem by my formulee. IT remark, that com-
bining it with the before-mentioned theorem, the five-pointic conic is completely deter-
mined as follows ; viz.—

Theorem.—The five-pointic conic touches the conic at the point of contact (two con-
ditions); it passes through the two points in which the polar conic is intersected by the
tangent to the cubic at the tangential of the point of contact (two conditions); and it

s through the point which is the third point of intersection with the cubic of the
Qline joining the point of contact with its second tangential.
