It may become more or less saturated with aqueous vapour. 'Z The increase of pressure to which the air is subjected in the vessel A is s0 slight, and She time in which it is there in contact with the water is 80 short, that the total amount
oxygen and nitrogen absorbed by the water must be very small; and, since any
'Zhange in the constitution of the total amount of air will be dependent on the ratio of
She absorption coefficients of oxygen and nitrogen on the one hand, and on the ratio of
e quantities of these gases in the air on the other, it will be yery much less than in
Ale actual amount of air absorbed; it will in fact be too small to be of any importance. Ej The whole of the carbonic acid of the air may be absorbed by the water; but as
mangements are made for the artifical supply of it, this is of no consequence.
