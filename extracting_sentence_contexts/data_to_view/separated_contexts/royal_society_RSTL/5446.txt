This equation will give two equal yalues for A if
m(8m*—92)* +27&(m*—z)=0,
an equation which reduces itself to
(41*—3%)*=0.

. "IP 4m? . 7 . Whence, if 49*—3& be negative, 7. 6. if E> the values of A will be imaginary, but

m_ 4m? - 2
if 4?—3% be positive, or «< =, the values of A will be real. If a= =, then there

will be two equal values of A, which in fact corresponds to a cusp upon the axis of #. Whenever the curve is real there will be at least two real points on the axis of #; and
4am? : .
when 4 < =, but not otherwise, then for properly selected values of A there will be
four real points on the axis of vx. Differentiating the equation of the curve, we have
((a*+1*—e)v+ 4A)dr+(a*+3*—e)ydy=0 5

and if in this equation we put dx=0, we find y=0, or a*+y*—&=0, 5. e. that the points
on the axis of z, and the points of intersection with the circle 2*+y*—«=0, are the only
points at which the curve is perpendicular to the axis of az.
