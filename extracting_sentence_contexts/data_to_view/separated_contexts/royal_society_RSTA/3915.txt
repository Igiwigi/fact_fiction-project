The potential
functions Wa through which the fuel and product species interact with the Janus particle have
a finite range. These interactions, in conjunction with the inhomogeneous concentration fields of
species generated in the vicinity of the motor as a result of the asymmetric catalytic activity, give : =
rise to body forces acting on the motor. Because momentum is conserved these forces generate 3
fluid flows within the boundary layer of thickness 5 where forces act, and the velocity field, :
0(R, 0) = 05(8), at the outer edge of the boundary layer, Rj + 5 = R, is the slip velocity, which takes nee)

where A => r(e— We) /keT _ e—-Wa/ksT) dy, In writing equation (2.1), we used the fact that the : 5
total number of A and B particles is conserved in reactions, so that the concentrations satisfy
co =Ca + cp, where cg is the total concentration of A and B. Making use of the reciprocal theorem of hydrodynamics [35], the velocity of the Janus motor
can be obtained from the surface average of the slip velocity at the outer edge of the boundary
layer at R: V = —(vs). In order to compute the velocity, the solute concentration field at the outer
edge of the boundary layer is needed.
