hybrids will be needed to better understand how paralog dmrt1 type 1 transcript (produced in germ cells) results in germ
genes work and interact in Xenopus species. cells loss in both ZZ and ZW X. laevis larvae [44].

Gonadal differentiation takes place in allotriploid (LST)

and allopentaploid (LLSST) X. Iaevis x X. tropicalis hybrids,

(b) Fertility in hybrids although their germ cells are lost early in development in
both male and female developing gonads. Testis and ovarian
differentiation is possible in X. laevis developing gonads
without germ cells [51]. In fact, the morphology observed
in developing ovaries and testes from LST and LLSST hybrids
is similar to the morphology of male and female developing

Most triploid and pentaploid hybrid gonads of both sexes
lack germ cells. The loss of germ cells in these hybrids
occurs early in gonadal development and may be related to
entry into meiosis (at NF55 in females and NF59 in males
[33]), as germ cells are present between the stages NF50 ~ .
and NF54 (cross X197). Furthermore, the few gonads with gonads of busulfan-treated X. laevis tadpoles: the ovaries
germ cells identified among the hybrid samples were from have large amounts of extracellular matrix between the
tadpoles at earlier stages of development. This conflicts cortex and the medulla, and the testes have shrunken
with other tetraploid (2n=36) and hexaploid (2n=54) cortex with more Sertoli cells [51].
