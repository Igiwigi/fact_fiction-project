In the theory of cyclic fluid motion, the circulations, being constant, must thus b
taken as momenta; and when the energy is expressed in terms of them, it must b
modified before the forcives can be derived from it in the manner of LAGRANGE a
Hamiztron. In the theory of electrodynamics the currents are not unalterable with
the time; and as they are differential coefficients with respect to the time of definite
physical quantities, the charges of electricity, they may be taken as velocities, provided
we recognize the play of corresponding forcives. In the electrodynamics of complete
circuits, after MAXWELL, there is no reason, in that theory taken by itself, why the
functions designated as the electrokinetic momenta should not be taken as velocities
instead, if so desired ; for they satisfy all the above conditions, though of course the
corresponding forcives would be of quite different types from the usual ones, is
remark is in illustration of the fact that the distinction between momenta and
velocities is to a certain extent one of convenience. A theory which would regard the current flowing in a complete cireuit as
generalized momentum of the latent zethereal motion labours under many difficulties. Such a hypothesis seems tempting at first sight, and, for example, lends itself easily
to the inclusion of permanent magnetism in a dynamical system: it has according!
