P, (1) = 41172794, P,(1) = 37357°62, P(#) = 7063812. The linkage as
shown in the map is much smaller than in the case of Ag. This is doubtless due to the
fact that in both cases the chains start with the long series of ¢ links. In Ag several
of these in succession lead up to the ultra-violet region from which chains run back
again towards longer wave-lengths. In the case of Au, however, two of these
long e links carry right across the observed region, and if the Au linkage is analogous
to that of Ag, the points from which linkages would run back again are beyond the
observed.
