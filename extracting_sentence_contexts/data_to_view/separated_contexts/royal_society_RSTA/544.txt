It is known, of course, that these FRF
data are deficient; essentially, because we have not included all the information which has been
generated in the measurement process by selectively ignoring or averaging components in the
response data which are generated by the nonlinearity of the test structure. Simply, if we excite
a nonlinear structure with a pure sine tone excitation, then the response will generally contain a
component at the excitation frequency (as normal) plus additional components at other (typically
higher) frequencies. The extra information contained in those higher components comes from the
fact that the nonlinear structure has a higher order behaviour than the linear one (for example,
a cubic component in the stiffness) and so cannot be completely described by the conventional
single-term FRF format. Depending on exactly which signal is used for the excitation, this extra
information can be eliminated or subsumed into the overall FRF according to the algorithm used
to compute the response function. Further discussion on this issue can be found in [2-4].
