INFLUENCE OF THE AIR ON ELECTRIFIED BODIES CONSIDERED. 223

hitherto universally received acceptation of the former, it relates especially to the in-
dications of the electrometer, which are found by experiment, all other things being
the same, to vary in certain cases with the square of the density ; whereas the latter
is expressive of the relation of the whole quantity accumulated to the space occupied,
and is always in the direct simple ratio of the density*.

25. But in these reasonings on the probable source of electrical phenomena, we
must not overlook the evidences in fayour of electricity being a fluid, operating for
the most part by attraction alone, without regard to its elasticity, according to the
laws observable in cases of simple pressure, its peculiar property being a tendency to
a state of equal action ; hence it endeayours, when accumulated in given points, to
flow upon surrounding masses, thereby producing currents, and the various pheno-
mena of electrical induction.

26. It is not essential that I should here enter upon the merits of the above hypo-
thesis ; but supposing it to rest on an adequate induction of facts, then it is clear that
the term tension would be ill applied, as expressing other than elastic power : we
should rather employ some such term as pressure, which would be immediately ass0-
ciated with altitude or thickness of the electrical stratum. We might, however, till
retain the term intensity as expressive of the operation of either the whole or part of
the pressure in a given direction, and employ it to measure the quantity on a given
surface by the aid of its known relations.

27. It has been supposed by the late Mr.
