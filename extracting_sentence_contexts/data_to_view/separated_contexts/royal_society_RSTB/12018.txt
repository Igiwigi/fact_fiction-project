Participants were actively encouraged to take
breaks in order to avoid fatigue.

(c) Electroencephalography recording and analysis

The EEG was recorded at a sampling rate of 256 Hz using a 64-
channel Refa 8 amplifier and 64-channel Waveguard EEG caps
(both from ANT Neuro, Enschede, The Netherlands). A band-
pass filter from 0.5 to 20 Hz (with a slope of 48 dB/oct each)
and a notch filter of 50 Hz were applied. Following that, a raw
data inspection was conducted manually to reject technical arte-
facts from the EEG, before an independent component analysis
(ICA; Infomax algorithm) was conducted. Using ICA, horizontal
and vertical eye movement, blinks and pulse artefacts were
corrected in the EEG data. After these pre-processing steps,
cue-locked segments were formed.
