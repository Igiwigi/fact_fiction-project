carbonate of lime in its constitution—Globigerina or other. There were, however, three or four hyaline
Foraminifera—like Triloculina. Separating these carefully and treating them with acid, I found that
the complete form (not a membrane but a shell) remained after the action of the acid.

July 10, 1875.—Sounded in 2950 fathoms. I noticed one or two hyaline forms but the acid had no
effect, and the same was the case with what I supposed was a large piece of Biloculina

{Note.—I see that in notes over a year ago I have noticed that sulphuric acid (weak) did not affect
some of the Foraminifera shells in the deep soundings, but I had forgotten the circumstance. It now
appears to me more likely that SO, is the agent concerned in the removal of the CaO.CO. from the
shells than CO, as supposed by THoMSON and BucHANAN. This would account for more CO; in the
bottom water and the presence of CaO.SO, in sea-water in such abundance. Also supported by the
fact that in the South Polar Sea there is excess of SO, as well as in the lower water of the Mediterranean
and Greenland currents. |

July 14, 1875.—Sounded in 3125 fathoms. I noticed one or two hyaline Foraminifera. These latter
were affected only in colour by the acid. Their shell under the higher powers has much the appearance
of the larger Challengeria . . . . Ihave frequently noticed remains of these in the soundings. They
have a yellowish appearance and look mottled.

July 26, 1875.—Sounded in 2225 fathoms. One piece of a rather large Pulvinulina was the only
trace of the surface Foraminifera noticed, and this, on treatment with weak sulphuric acid and afterwards
with strong hydrochloric acid, did not all disappear. A film on the outside and inside of the shell
seemed to be unaffected by the acid.
