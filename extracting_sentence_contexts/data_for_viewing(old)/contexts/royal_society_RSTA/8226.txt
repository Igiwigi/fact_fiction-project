that as n’ > © g ~1, and it seems unlikely that g should differ much from unity for
such values. For small n’, (6.43) gives g ~ 44/3n’, so that g is then small. Apart.
however, from this region of very high frequencies it appears that Kramers’ formula
is a good approximation when E alone - 0. These conclusions are in strong contrast
with those of OpPpHENHEIMER.* In his notation, g is defined by the equation (Joc. cil.

For E = 0 (the threshold) and n’ (his 2) = 1, his curves (loc. cit., fig. 3) indicate a value
of g-of about 8. For n’ = 2 the curve goes off the diagram, and g must be about 25
or more. In fact, his equations (16) and (19) give for large n’: g ~ 34/3n'3/2. It is
owing to these large factors near the threshold that OrrENnHEmER finds an opacity
approaching the value required in the stars. His argument is obscure. but there seems
to be no doubt that he has made a mistake. The approximations for large n and »’
have been worked out again on the basis of his general formule, and the result is the
same as Krameurs’.+ This correction is of crucial importance. It is evident that if his
