S the temporary molars, 80 rudimental in size and transient in duration. I can scarcely
Subt but that the true molars of this animal would be identified by every one as homo«
HÞgous with the true molars of the diphyodonts, which are generally regarded as belonging
& the permanent series, although they never have deciduous predecessors. Now, if the
komology between the true molars of the Thylacine and those of a Dog, for instance, be
Eanted, and if the anterior teeth (incisors, canines, and premolars) of the Thylacine be
If the same series as its own true molars, they must also be homologous with the corre-
Sonding permanent teeth of the Dog.

5 It may be objected to this argument, that the true molars of the diphyodonts, not being

Accessional teeth, ought to be regarded as members of the first or milk-series; but, in
truth, the fact that they have themselves no predecessors does not make them serially
homologous with the predecessors of the other teeth, while their morphological charac-
ters, as well as their habitual persistence throughout life, range them with the second
or permanent series.

We have been 80 long accustomed to look upon the second set of teeth as an after
development or derivative from the first, that it appears almost paradoxical to suggest
that the milk or deciduons teeth may rather be a set snperadded to supply the tempo-
rary needs of mammals of more complex dental organization. But it should be remem-
bered that, instead of there being any such relation between the permanent and milk-
teeth as that expressed by the terms © progeny ” and © parent” sometimes applied to
