Accordingly I took it off with spirit
of wine, and found the rings disappear; on lackering it again
they returned; and in like manner I caused a well finished
concave metal speculum to form the rings of which we are
speaking, by giving it a thin coat cf lacker. This is a clear
proof that these rings were exactly the same with those of
thick plates (to use NEwrToN's expression), for the coat of
gums is, when thin, pretty transparent, as may be seen by
laying one on glass plates. But this coat is extremely thin, and cannot exceed the 20oth _
part of an inch; $0 that the colours. of thick plates are in fact
the very same with those of thin plates, except that the two
kinds are made by different sized plates. We cannot, therefore,
distinguish them, any more than we do the spectrum made
by a prism whose angle is go* from that made by one whose
angle is 20*. This kind of colours is not the only one I have
observed of nearly the same kind with those of plates; we shall
presently see another much more curious and remarkable.
