Provo, UT, USA). Participants were presented with an ethically

were simply asked to read it carefully. After a 1 min distractor
task (a word puzzle), the test questionnaire was administered,
before participants completed the party-preference scale. Finally,
participants were asked if they had put ina reasonable effort or if
their data should be discarded, and were then debriefed; this
included a clarification that the report was fictitious.
