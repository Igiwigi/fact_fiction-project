His method of
dealing with these terms does certainly give a complete, though only formal, solution. Unfortunately the results involve series of terms each of which is a complicated Hankel
function, and it is extremely difficult to check results by numerical data. We shall,
however, follow his methods and obtain results slightly more general than his, and
establish only qualitative agreement with experimental facts.

assume at first that there is saturation. According to our fundamental assumptions let
(1, m, m) and (I, m M2) denote the directions in which the elements in L, and L, lattices
respectively are pointing, in the presence of an external homogeneous field H. Now, on
the macroscopic theory of magnetism, uniform magnetization of a body is secured in
presence of a homogeneous field if (i) the body is continuous, and if, further (ii), it is
bounded by a surface of the second degree.
