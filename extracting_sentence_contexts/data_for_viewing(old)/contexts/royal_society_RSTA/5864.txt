compartments. Details about this emerging equilibrium distribution, together with its main
properties, will be provided in the following. Lastly, t > 0 measures the time scale at which these
equilibrium distributions of social contacts are reached by relaxation.

In general, the description of the time evolution of epidemic spreading in terms of the
distributions f;(x, f), as given by (2.1), is richer than the classic one obeying (1.1). This is due to
the fact that, in (2.1), the system depends on an additional variable allowing a more realistic
characterization of the transition rates between compartments. In particular, by assuming that
the pathogen transmission does not depend upon the contact among individuals, the proposed
description (2.1) collapses to the standard approach (1.1) as shown in [18].

In our model, the transition rates can now be assumed to be dependent on the intensity of
social contacts in the compartments. As detailed later, in fact, they are obtained by taking into
account, in a very natural way, the heterogeneity of the population in the form of the variance of
the distributions f;(x, t) [18,23]. This point of view provides a better understanding of the role of
the different individual behaviours in the spreading of a disease [5].

In general, the knowledge of the densities f;(x, t) allows us to evaluate various macroscopic
quantities, independent from the number of contacts, the so-called moments of the distributions,
obtained by integration with respect to the variable x â‚¬ R,. In this respect, the zero-order moment
gives the number of individuals N;(t) in each compartment at time f > 0
