30 M. SNOW AND R. SNOW: EXPERIMENTS ON PHYLLOTAXIS.

The results of this second group were obtained when a large part of the presumptive
stipular area of I,, on the side next to P,, was left on the apex, and could therefore be
occupied by I,/. Thus in six of these experiments considerably more than half of this
stipular area was left on the apex, in one just about half was left, and in one slightly
less than half. In the remaining one the amount was not determined (see Table III).
On the other hand, out of the eight experiments of the first group, in two only was about
half of this presumptive stipular area left on the apex, and in five less than half was left.
In the remaining one (No. 350) the plane of the cut could not be determined with
certainty, as the older leaves had been displaced, probably through unsatisfactory
embedding. It may be noted that I,/ never occupied the gap between I, and the
wound. This may be explained by the fact that I, is situated at a higher level than P,,
being younger, so that the gap between P, and the wound became available the
sooner.

There remain four experiments, forming a third group, in which I,/ occupied a rather
different position, its centre lying directly above the wound. Three examples, Nos.
210, 367 and 379, are shown in figs 14-16. In the four experiments of this group, as
in most of those of the first group, only a small part, less than half, of the presumptive
stipular area of I, next to P, was left on the apex, so that there was no available gap
between P, and the wound in which the central part of I,/ could arise. The centre of
this primordium arose above the centre of the wound and can hardly be said to occupy
a gap at all.
