1. Introduction

For macroscopic systems, the second law of thermodynamics prescribes ever-
increasing entropy. In fact, decreases of entropy are permitted on short time
scales. When the dynamics of small quantum systems on short time scales
is studied, the flow of information between the environment and the system
can be important [1]. In a microscopic theory, there are three major effects of
he environment (or bath) on the system.
