to identify the cognitive building blocks that shaped the human ‘interaction
engine’ [4,5], the suite of socio-interactional capacities thought to underlie
modern language, such as face-to-face orientation, joint attention and coordinated
joint action. Arguably the most powerful social tool in the animal kingdom,
human language may thus have evolved as an adaptation to a new demand:
the coordination of joint action [2,5]. Elements of the interaction engine may
differ in when they emerged in the hominin lineage, supporting the idea of a
stratified, or gradual, evolution toward modern human communication [5].
Among these elements, both face-to-face orientation affording the use of
multiple articulators and the sustained exchange of communicative turns have
