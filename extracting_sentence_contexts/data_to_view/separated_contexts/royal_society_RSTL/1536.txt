the unintentional errors of the historian are s00n rectified and
adjusted. On this account, and as the fact of the eclipse is s0
confidently related by HEeroporvs (indeed, its singular coin-
cidence with the battle will ever render it memorable in
history), I would place the termination of the war between
Alyattes and Cyaxares, in the year 610 B. C.: and, if the
other events of that period, as related by the historian, cannot
be reconciled to this date, I should attribute the confusion to
the want of authentic documents and information at the time
that the history was written.

I have before observed, that all these calculations have been
made from the Tables Astronomiques, lately published in France:
which tables have since been adapted to the meridian of Green-
wich, and to astronomical time, by Mr. Vixce, and inserted
by him in the third volume of his System of Astronomy.* In
these tables are given the secu/ar variations in the moon's mean
longitude, mean anomaly, and mean distance from her node,
as deduced from the formule of M.
