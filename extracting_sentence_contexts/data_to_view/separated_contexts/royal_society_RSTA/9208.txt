It is fairly evident that in this case
some serious error has been made in determining the energy distribution. At first
sight it looks as if the intensity of the spectrum used by Houston was so low
that he was dealing mainly with rod vision. That this is not the true explanation is
shown by the fact that he also publishes results obtained with a much less intense
spectrum, and the maximum he obtains for this rod visibility curve is as much below

F the value obtained by other observers for the rod curve as is the maximum he obtains
for the bright or cone visibility curve.§ Our curve lies considerably below those
obtained by other observers in the blue and violet. This is probably almost entirely
due to the fact that we are dealing with pure cone vision, while other observers, who
apparently used a much larger photometric field, were probably dealing with a mixed
