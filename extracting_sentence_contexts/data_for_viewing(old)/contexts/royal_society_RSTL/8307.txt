(amongst the Bristle-worms) in a separate order, Onycophora; and he is followed
by CLavs and SCHMARDA and most zoologists, although the position of Peripatus has
always been considered doubtful. GEGgNBAUR (Grundziige der vergleichenden Ana-
tomie, p. 199) speaks of the placing of Peripatus amongst the worms as by no means
certain, but adds that Peripatus certainly connects the Ringed worms and Arthropods
with Flat worms. The older writers on the subject come nearer the mark. Nuweort*
8ays, © DE BLAINVILLE first connected Myriopoda with Annelida by means of the bristly
genera, the Annelida Errantia ; but subsequently remarked a closer connexion between
the two classes in the singular #uliform genus Peripatus.”

De QuarReFaGesF does not place Peripatus with the worms, but in his * Histoire
Nat. des Annel6s” gives a short account of these animals in the Appendix. He dwells
on the fact that Peripatus has feet armed with nails, to which muscles are attached,
and not bristles lodged in a follicle. He considers that Ds BLANVILLE was near the
mark when he formed a special class © Malacopodes” for Peripatus, but that M. GERVAIS
was most in the right when he placed the group in affinity with the Myriopods.

M. Ds QraTReFAGES was evidently quite right in following M. Gzrvais in this
matter. The affinities of Peripatus will be discussed shortly at the close of this paper.

Ds Quarreyaces+ gives a list of four species of Peripatus, viz. P. iuliformis of Cuba
with 33, P. Edwards of Cayenne with 30, P. Blainville of Chili with 19, and P. brevis
of the Cape with 14 pairs of feet.

The specimens obtained and examined by me here cannot be of the species * brevis,”
