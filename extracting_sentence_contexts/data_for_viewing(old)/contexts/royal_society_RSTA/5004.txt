Among the first pairs of quasars to be used for this test were 3C273 and 3C279, both of which
lie close to the plane of the ecliptic. In 1995, for example, the deviation of the predicted deflection
from the Einstein prediction was found to be (1+ y)/2 =0.9996 + 0.0017. Nowadays, with the
use of VLBI for precise geodesy, accuracies at the submilliarc are routine. Even in the direction
90° from the Sun, the deflections amount to 4 milliarcsec, which is easily measurable. As a result,
radio quasars all over the sky can be used to measure deflections of stars from the fundamental
reference frame. In a 2004 analysis of almost 2 million observations of 541 radio sources made at
87 VLBI sites, the predicted deflections were found to agree with the Einstein prediction at the
level (1 + y)/2 =0.99992 + 0.00023. The accuracy of the best VLBI experiments is now better than
100 microarcsec.

In addition to these tests, radio astronomy contributed a fourth test—the delay of a radio signal
from a transponder on a space vehicle or planet due to the fact that the radio signal passes through
the gravitational potential well of the Sun. This Shapiro effect [25] depends in the same way as the
deflection tests upon the parameter (1 + y)/2. The deviation of (1 + y)/2 from unity must be less
than 0.0012% (figure 3).

There is now such confidence in the correctness of General Relativity that gravitational lensing
has become a standard tool of the astronomer and cosmologist for studying such topics as the
distribution of dark matter in the Universe and the detection of exoplanets about nearby stars.
A spectacular example of gravitational lensing is provided by the Hubble Space Telescope images
of rich clusters of galaxies, such as Abell 2218 (figure 4). While Einstein and Eddington had
been somewhat cautious about the utility of gravitational lensing as an astronomical tool, in
characteristic fashion, Fritz Zwicky, the great, if individual, Swiss astronomer, had no hesitation
