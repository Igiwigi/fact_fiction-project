Possibly the original thickness had been twice or thrice as great. The terracing of
these deposits was often very fine, and in other places subsidences and landslides had —
taken place, and the surface of the ash was fissured, broken, and highly irregular, —
Great stones, 12 feet across and more, lay in this ash, whether ejected during this

eruption or fallen from the old agglomerates in the cliffs, we could not say. ,

On the knife-edges of the spurs the new mass still lay, firm, coherent, forming an
excellent pathway, so smooth that one might have thought it had been prepared
expressly for the foot (see Plate 35). When the sun shone after heavy rain, the
smooth, narrow, winding strips of fine wet ash on these ridges reflected the light,
and they seemed like lines of silver traced on the dark-grey background of the hill. On
them the rain had little power of erosion, as they formed, in fact, the only tracts of level
ground on the whole mountain. The fine dust was washed away, and the coarser sand
exposed by the beat of the raindrops. They were, as a rule, from 2 to 5 feet wide ;
laterally, as the slope increased, little rivulets formed, at first so small that they had
almost no cutting power, and on each side of the smooth central line there was a strip
fluted with little furrows. This passed in turn into the sculptured rill-marked
surfaces of the sides of the valleys. The division line between these surfaces was
wonderfully sharp, for as each channel deepened it pushed its head upwards, and the
steep upper parts of the erosion curves produced little rapid descents, by which one
type of surface graded into another.

At heights above 2500 feet the gradient of the path became somewhat steeper,
and as the surface here was covered with 5 feet or more of fine ash, which when wet
