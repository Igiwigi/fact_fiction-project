Although his identification of the cytotectonic field underneath the inferior frontal with the intermediate

precentral area is questioned by BropMANN and Mauss, for our purpose it suffices that both he and
BropMann recognised this area in man as being different from the rest of the frontal lobe. Tn my opinion CampBELL’s interpretation of the frontal fissures in anthropoids and
their homologies with the human fissuration is right. The fact that in recent human races the midfrontal sulcus is so frequently broken into
pieces and its connection with the precentral interrupted, indicates that the region
through which the midfrontal runs is a region of great developmental changes. The fissural
changes occur especially in fields 8 and 9 of BropManN. Concerning the function of field 8
in man, we know, Prevosr (1868), Sanur (1906), Forster (1923), Forster and
PENFIELD (1930), that it contains the centre for the conjugate deviation of the eyes
(field 8%, 8, and y). On account of experiments with dogs (and monkeys) in which similar reactions occur,
in stimulating an analogous (precrucial) region (field 12 in dogs) Ferrier (1877, 1887)
had already concluded that the prefrontal lobe is par excellence a centre of attention.
