The alkali-metals yield but feeble ultra-violet spectra, otherwise the sodium lines
would likewise be ever present.

The evidence that the calcium lines are due to dust is the following : two metallic
electrodes, alloys of copper and silver, were filed up 80 as to present bright points ;
they were each opposed to a graphite electrode, and the spark was made to pass from
the metal to the carbon ; in the one case the calcium lines were either very faint or
invisible, but in the second they were very strong. The interval of time between the
taking of the photographs was not more than half a minute. The calcium lines were
strongesb at the metallic or negative pole.

The following facts have been established by the foregoing observations :â€”

When carbon or metallic electrodes are moistened the 8hort lines are lengthened,

With very few exceptions the non-metallic constituents of a salt do not affect the
8park spectra of solutions.

Tnsoluble and non-volatile compounds do not yield spark 8pectra.

The 8olution of a metallic chloride yields spectral lines identical in number and
position with the principal lines of the metal itself.

Short lines become long lines, but otherwise their character is identical, whether the
