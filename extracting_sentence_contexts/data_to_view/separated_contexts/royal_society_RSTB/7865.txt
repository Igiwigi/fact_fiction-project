In
a fresh specimen its course can just be made out by stretching this wall, and it is not visible
from the inner surface. As the course of the tube is followed towards the uterine horn it
sinks farther in from the peritoneal surface, and the junction of the tube with the lumen of
the horn is deep in the musculature and connective tissue and can only be found by
dissection. That Watsonâ€™s illustration differs from the arrangement here described may be
due to his specimen being one of the Indian genus, but it may equally well be due to its
being an animal whose development has been affected by a life in captivity, to which fact
it is at least safe to attribute the small size and apparently inactive condition of the ovary
itself. The outer compartment of the ovarial sac is fimbriated, while the inner compartment
is lined with peritoneum. The arrangement of the peritoneal structures in this region would
appear to be different from that of other mammals as yet described.
