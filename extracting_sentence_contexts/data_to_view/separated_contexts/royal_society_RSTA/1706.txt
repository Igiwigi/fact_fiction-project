of
water, we find that the deviations which are produced by increasing the concentration
to water 45 per cent., acid 55 per cent., are even greater than those which result from
diluting to water 95 per cent., acid 5 per cent. ; and this is true, not only for one wave-
length, but for the whole range of wave-lengths shown in Table II. The linear law is
thus shown to be even less exact in concentrated than in dilute solutions. A natural sequel to the recognition of the fact that the linear law is inexact, is the
introduction of a third term into the equation, which thus changes from

[a,] = A.+Be to [a2] = Ao+ Bie+C.eâ€™. This method of expressing the specific rotatory powers of the acid was adopted by
WrintHER in 1902, Its application to the data now recorded is shown in Table II. The parabolic formule were all based on the readings for solutions containing 55, 70
and 85 per cent.
