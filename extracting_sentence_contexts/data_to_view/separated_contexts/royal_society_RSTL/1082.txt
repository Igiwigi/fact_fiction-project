slowly finds-its point of rest at the negative
pole, in the electrical circuit ; but silex, even when diffused
in'its gelatinous/state: through water, rests indifferently atthe
negative or positive poles. E. From. this indifference to positive and negative electrical
E attractions, following the general order of facts, it might be
£ inferred, that if these bodies be compounds, | the electrical
- energies of their elements are nearly in equilibrium ; and that
S their-state is either analogous to that of insoluble neutral salts,
5 or-of-oxides nearly saturated with oxygene,

5 » The combinations of silex and alumine, with acids and alka-
= lies, as: well as their electrical powers, were not inconsistent
5 with either of these ideas ; for in some respects they resemble
'Z in physical characters, fluate and phosphate of lime, as much
Z as in-others, they approach to the oxides of zinc and tin... = On the idea that slex might be an insoluble neutrosaline
Z compound, containing an unknown acid or earth, or both, and
I capable of being resolved into its secondary elements, in the
5 same manner as sulphate of barytes, or fluate of lime, I made
3 the following experiments.
