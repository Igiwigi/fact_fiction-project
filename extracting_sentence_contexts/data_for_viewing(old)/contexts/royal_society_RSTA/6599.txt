* Tuomson and Tarr’s ‘ Natural Philosophy,’ 1883, § 778" (i).

+ In 778" (g) he remarks that ‘‘a deviation from the ellipsoidal figure in the way of thinning it in
the middle and thickening it towards the end would, with the same moment of momentum, give less
energy.” I conceive that the energy referred to throughout this paragraph is kinetic only, and we have
seen that the kinetic energy is less for the daumb-bell than for the ellipsoid.

[If we write U for a quantity proportional to the excess of kinetic above intrinsic energy, so that
U=e-+(1—i), then figures of equilibrium are to be determined by making U stationary for variations
of the parameters involved in it. This course is actually pursued in the Appendix below, the function
(viii.) being, in fact, this U; and the variations of it, being made stationary, afford a controlling solution
of the problem of this paper. The similar method may easily be applied to the case of Jacont’s ellip-
soids. From this point of view the interesting function to tabulate is e + (1 — 7), and we observe that
in the case of the Jacobian ellipsoid referred to on the last page it is ‘6052, and for the dumb-bell it is
6156. Is not the energy referred to by Sir W. Tuomson this function U? (Addition to foot-note,
