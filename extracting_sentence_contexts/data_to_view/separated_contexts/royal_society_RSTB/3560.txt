To the
Rey. F. F. Horr I am indebted for help and kindness at Woburn Sands. I must
also acknowledge with thanks the fact that some of the expenses of the work were
defrayed out of the Royal Society Government Grant, which had been given me
for the general study of Cretaceous plants. LITERATURE QUOTED. Batey, J. W., 1910.
