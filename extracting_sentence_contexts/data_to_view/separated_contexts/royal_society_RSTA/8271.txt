A. Notation. ,

1. m,n, p, q, ete., are integral numbers representing the theoretical distances of certain
graduations from the zero of the scale in appropriate units. They are, in fact, the labels
of these graduations.

2. m/n means the actual distance between the graduations marked m and n. For
convenience m is taken as the smaller number of the pair.

3. ,(m/n), means the distance m/n in terms of the distance p/q as correct, i.¢.,

n—m
A(m/n), = m/n — eres

/4. This quantity will naturally be expressed in much smaller units than m/n or p/q.
