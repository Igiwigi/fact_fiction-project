coat carefully removed. I thrust the point of the blade of a
pair of sharp scissors through the choroid coat into the vitre-
ous humor, to the depth of about an eighth of an inch, and
divide all, $0 as to insulate a square portion of each mem-
brane, leaving the edges free, and consequently no connection
except by surface; yet the choroid does not recede from the
membrane I describe, the membrane from the retina, nor the
retina from the vitreous humor. I take the end of the por-
tion of choroid in the forceps, turn it half down, and pass a
pin through the edge, the weight of which is insufficient to
pull it from its connection. I separate the membrane in like
manner, but the retina I can scarcely detach from the vitreous
humor, so strong. is the connection. The same fact may be
ascertained by making a transverse vertical section of the
eye, removing the vitreous humor from the posterior seg-
ment, and taking the retina in the forceps, pulling it gently
from the choroid, when it will appear beyond a doubt that
there is a connection between them.

Let us contrast this account of the matter with the com-
mon one. The retina, a membrane of such delicacy, is
