shorter than with 35° C. This shows that with the rise of temperature the desiccating
influence of a humidity is enhanced, which is also borne out by the larvae of X. cheopis
when kept at 40% R.H. with 27 and 32° C. The fact that all the larvae of X. cheopis died
within a day at 60% R.H. and 37° C indicates its fatal drying effect at this temperature. 40
