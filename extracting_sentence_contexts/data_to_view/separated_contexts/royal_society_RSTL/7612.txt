This spec-
trum may be seen simultaneously with the three characteristic lines Hz, HS, Hy;
but at an increased temperature, when these lines begin to expand, it entirely dis-
appears.” MM. PLicxER and HreroRy also determined the action of the discharge of a small in-
duction-coil through a tube enclosing hydrogen which was gradually rarefied to the
highest tenuity to be reached by a Geis8LER's exhauster ; they found that, as the exhaus-
tion proceeded, the red colour of the gas gradually faded into an © undetermined violet,”
and that He disappeared, while HP, though fainter, remained well defined. With hydrogen gas in G1ssLER's tubes, then, the following facts are established :—

1. With a certain degree of rarefaction and temperature, we obtain three character-
istic lines, He, HB, and Hy.

II. By increasing the temperature, we expand Hy first towards both ends of the spec-
trum, then HP, He remaining almost unchanged after Hy has passed into an undeter-
mined large violet band.
