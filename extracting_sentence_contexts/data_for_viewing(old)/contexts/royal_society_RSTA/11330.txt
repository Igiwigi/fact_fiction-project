Euclidian geometry is, that in the Euclidian plane it is impossible to obtain a recti-
linear figure with more sides than three, the sum of whose angles is 7,

If to the original polygon we apply the substitution ยง,,., the point D,,, is
unchanged, and the ares D,,.D,,,, and D,,,,C, are transformed into each other. So
the parts of the boundary of the polygon which correspond to each other in the
transformations of the group are D,,,.D,., to C,Di41, C,D, to C,.D,,..., C.D, to
D,.2D,, respectively. If now we suppose the polygon lifted up from the plane, and
these corresponding ares pieced together, we obtain a simple closed surface, without
multiple connectivity.

Therefore the genus (genre, Geschlecht) of the group (as defined by Porncars) is
zero. The group however may have, and will in fact be proved to have, sub-
groups whose genus is greater than- zero.


14 MR. E. T. WHITTAKER ON THE CONNEXION OF
ยง 4. The Automorphie Functions of the Group.

from the fact which has just been proved, that the genus of all groups of the
kind we have found is zero, we know that the algebraic relation between any two
automorphic functions of the group is of genus zero; therefore all the automorphic
Junctions of the group can be expressed as rational functions of a certain one of them.
We shall denote this one by z.
