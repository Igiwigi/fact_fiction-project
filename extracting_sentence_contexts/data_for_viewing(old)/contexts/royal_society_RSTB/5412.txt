culture, it seemed reasonable to hope that a similar stage could be found in the organism
when living in the tissues of its natural host.

2. Methods used in the Preparation of Material for examination.

The material used for this investigation originated in a number of different ways.
Some of the slides have been in the possession of the authors for many years. They
were stained with Heidenhain’s hematoxylin after being mordanted with iron alum,
and despite the fact that a few are over twenty years old, they still show the cytological
structures in perfect detail. The majority of the slides, however, were freshly prepared
from material fixed in Bouin's fluid. With early infections in young roots, complete
sections of the root, cut transversely into pieces about 4 em. long, were used. In
instances where the hypertrophy was greater and the disease more advanced, small
cubes about 0-4 cm. in length were cut out. All the material was embedded after
fixation and stored in paraffin wax.

For making slides the paraffin blocks were microtomed at a thickness of from 3-5.
Both iron alum with Heidenhain’s hematoxylin and Flemming’s triple stain methods
were employed. The latter, however, was found to be more difficult to manipulate
where large numbers of slides were involved, and the results obtained were in no way
superior to those of hematoxylin, except in slides showing the Akaryote stage and in the
