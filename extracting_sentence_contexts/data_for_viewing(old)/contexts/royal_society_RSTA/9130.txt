The importance of these equations lies in the fact that in the case of steady motion
all the coefficients are constant.
Since
(7.658) 2? = (40)? + (ay)?+ ... + (%w-»)*,

we may state the following result :

TurorEM XXXII (K).—Jn order that the motion of a holonomic system may be stable
in the kinematical sense, it is necessary and sufficient that the values Of %0)5 2), «+45 Ry —1)
as solutions of the differential equations (7.654) to (7.657) should be permanently small.
In the case of steady motion the coefficients in these equations are constants.
