predictor of zooarchaeological abundance across all models,
with herbivores more abundant than carnivores. This almost
certainly reflects the increased likelihood of prehistoric
humans to hunt herbivores for subsistence, as well as the
higher available biomass of large herbivores in ecosystems
compared to carnivore biomass. Interestingly, the scaling of
abundance and body mass in the zooarchaeological record
also differs between trophic groups; small herbivores were
more abundant than larger herbivores, a pattern shown in
natural populations, whereas large carnivores were more
abundant than smaller carnivores, which is significantly differ-
ent from the pattern seen in natural populations [35]. This
unexpected finding may reflect the fact that because herbivores
were more heavily exploited overall for subsistence, humans
were less discriminate and hunted all body size classes oppor-
tunistically, leading natural patterns of relative abundance
to be reflected in the zooarchaeological record. The particu-
