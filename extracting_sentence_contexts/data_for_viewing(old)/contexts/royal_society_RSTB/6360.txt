membrane surface, to the larger body which finally lies half embedded in the
peripheral fibres of the membrane and which projects from it externally. During
this process, the larger secretion masses, which I have identified as shell matrix,
have not reached the surface of the shell membrane.

In discussing the origin of the shell matrix itself, FRoBOésE refers to the process as
comparable to the formation of a membrana decidua which involves the degenera-
tion of maternal tissues, from which the keratin-like matrix might easily be derived.
It must be stressed, however, that the evidence derived from portions of uterine
wall, which have been removed from contact with a developing egg and fixed more
rapidly than is possible with an entire specimen, is conclusive that the epithelium
never degenerates to the extent of shedding its cells in any conspicuous degree. In
fact, it is difficult to identify even the heavily stained areas of contact in such material.
Similarly I have not been able to confirm the distinctly double layered stratification
of the epithelium illustrated on Plate 3, fig. 3, of FRoBésk’s paper.

Some account must be taken also of the relative amounts of secretion contributing
to the shell layers. The mammille, which are not so numerous in the present
material, either in the partly developed shell, ma, fig. 32, Plate 20, or in the mature
shell, ma, fig. 36, Plate 21, as compared with the illustrations of Naruustus (1868),
are relatively small bodies spaced only at intervals on the shell membrane. Small
epithelial pits, such as I have described, seem sufficient source for these bodies. In
contrast, the shell matrix is an even, well-developed layer of dense secretion requiring,
one would imagine, much more than the activity of the epithelial cells which happen
to lie in contact with the shell, to produce its volume within the time-period of shell
