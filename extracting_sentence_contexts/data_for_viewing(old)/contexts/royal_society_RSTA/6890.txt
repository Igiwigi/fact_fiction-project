The former measures the energy of an electron based on one atom, due to the field of
a different, neutral atom. The latter measures the resonance energy between two atomic
orbitals, one of which is based on the neutral atom.

The integrals of (49), (50) and (51) result from both the usual molecular orbital and
valence-bond approximation. It is hoped later to generalize the method to deal with the
integrals which result from more refined types of approximation (see for example, James
& Coolidge 1933; Coulson & Duncanson 1938; Frost, Braunstein & Schwemer 1949).

By dealing with the three types of integral (49) to (51) in the same way, we reduce them
to one single set of subsidiary quantities. Hitherto, integrals of different classes were treated
separately, each with its own auxiliary functions. An additional advantage with our present
treatment lies in the fact that no complications arise when the nuclei are of different elements.
