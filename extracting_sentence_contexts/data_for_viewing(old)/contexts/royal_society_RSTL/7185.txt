probably from animalculze and diatomacew. The place was not far from Victoria Land,
at some distance from Coulman Island. Tt contained only 15-598 salt. The third, from
652 57! 8. lat., 164* 37' E. long., had the surprising quantity of salt 37:513 per 1000.
The mean of these three observations is 27-225 per 1000; but this mean number is of
very little consequence, being derived from numbers differing s0 greatly. It is, however,
very surprising that water from the neighbourhood of the supposed Antarctic continent
should have a salinity higher than any one found in the south equatorial regions of the
Atlantic, and only be exceeded by a single one in the North Atlantic regions. IT am
Sure that no material fault exists in the analysis, and this curious fact must thus remain
unexplained until repeated observations in that region shall procure us further informa-
tion. Should the observation be proved to be correct, it would render the existence of
a *Gulf-stream ‚Äù in the Antarctic zone very probable. There is still another peculiarity
in these observations which deserves attention, viz. the great proportion of sulphuric
acid to chlorine. In the water in the neighbourhood of Coulman's Island it is
12:47 : 100, and in that from 65* 57' S. lat. 12:55 : 100, while in the whole ocean it
is as 11:89 : 100. This might depend upon the very pronounced volcanic character of
the Antarctic continent. There is still one question to be discussed with respect to
the Antarctic Sea, how it is to enter into the mean numbers of the whole ocean. The
observation from the neighbourhood of Coulman's Island must be rejected, because it is
too near the land, and we have no corresponding observations from the open Antarctic
Ocean. Its high coefficient (1-861) shows the great influence of the neighbouring land.
