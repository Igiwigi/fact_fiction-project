rise to the fall in temperature exhibited by the results obtained from equation (2) at
low densities. At high densities, as already pointed out, the two equations give, in
some cases, accordant results, in all cases tolerable agreement; it therefore appears
to me to be reasonable to suppose that the facts I have recorded are due to partial
dissociation at low densities and pressures, which dissociation is prevented by the
very high pressures ruling at densities of 0°40, 0°45, and 0°50.

As no free oxygen is ever found in the analysis, in cooling down any free oxygen
due to dissociation must have combined and the heat lost by dissociation regained.
The re-combination must, however, be very gradual, as no discontinuity is observed
in the cooling curves.

A certain amount of confirmation is given to the view I have taken by the fact

that if the explosives be arranged according to the amount of heat generated, derived
from equation (1), regard being also had to the amount of CO, found, it will be found
that the differences between the two formule decrease approximately as the factors
to which I have referred decrease, as is shown in the following table :—
