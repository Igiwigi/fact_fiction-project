1 inch from
its distal extremity, a small white vesicular-looking body, which on being floated out
into the water, was found to be rather ragged on its surface, and to have the size of
the cavity noticed in the recently ruptured Graafian follicle. This body was sub-
mitted to microscopical examination. When viewed as an opake object, nothing
could be made out beyond the fact that it was covered with white floeculi. It was
then placed between two pieces of glass, and examined by the aid of transmitted
light; but it was too opake for the eye to distinguish its structure, notwithstanding
that the flocculi were very transJucent and were seen to be made up of oval nucleated
cells (see fig. 6). By the employment of slight pressure the body was readily crusbed,
and then I could perceive that it was composed of a mass of nucleated cells, among
which, at one part, there was a number of highly refractive oil-globules (see fig. 5).
