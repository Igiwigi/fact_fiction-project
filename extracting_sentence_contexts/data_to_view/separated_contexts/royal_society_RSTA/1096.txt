shows that long-scale variability is preserved in the non-respiratory component, while in (6) one can see that variation with the
respiration period is removed from this component. (Online version in colour.)

Thus, the data used for the disentanglement are: the times of R-peaks, tx, and the respiratory phase

and the frequency, w(t) and w(t), and in particular w(ty) = Wy, and w(ty) = wy. Note that in this

test, two latter series are obtained from equations, while in fact respiratory phase and frequency

should be estimated from data, which will certainly introduce an additional error. The respiratory-
