However, the failing of all NETs that : e

we especially need to note here is the ratchet effect of passing tipping points during the process
of ‘overshoot’. If some types of NETs can be made to work at global scale, then the atmospheric
accumulation of CO, can go down as well as up. But if that accumulation, even if it ultimately
turns out to have been transitory itself, drives some crucial factor affecting the climate past a
point of no return, that change in climate will be permanent in spite of the fact that its cause was
temporary. Temporary changes can produce permanent effects. For example, the cryogenic scientists who have concluded that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet
(WAIS) probably is now irreversibly melting think that the reason why the melting is irreversible
is that the crucial Thwaites Glacier is a marine-based ice sheet: it rests on land but that land is
under water [22,23].
