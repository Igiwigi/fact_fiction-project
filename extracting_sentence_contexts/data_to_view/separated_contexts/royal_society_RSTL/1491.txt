When it
is more enlarged these symptoms go off. From these observyations it appears, that this small lobe of
the prostate gland, which has been overlooked, is from the
Situation and the circumstances, in which it is placed more
liable to become diseased than any other part of the gland,
and produces symptoms of danger and distress peculiar to
itself, which have been hitherto supposed to arise from the
body of the gland becoming enlarged. To enter further into the effects of disease on this lobe
would be improper on the present occasion ; but not to have
noticed them at all would have been equally s0, since the
only importance, that can be attached to the facts, "which
have been brought forward in this Paper, arises from the
light they throw on the diseases of the prostate gland. EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE, | (Plate II.)
