Hence the reading for the true octahedron face o’ is 40° 24’; therefore the reading
for w is 220° 24’, and the three faces replacing are unequally inclined to @, and do
not belong to the same form (fig. 114).

If it be true that the vicinal faces, whether they belong to the same or to different
forms, are always triakis-octahedron faces, then of the faces replacing an octahedron

wire oy, and the other two on the lines o# and of, which make an angle of 120° with
oy in the field of view (fig. 12). This is a fact which is readily established by means
of the micrometer eye-piece; the changes of the images, for example, during the
growth of the crystal can be easily followed by the movable cross-wire when it has

been adjusted so as to run along the line oa. This affords an even safer method of
ascertaining the reading corresponding to the true octahedron face o; for after it has
> been found that the images from the vicinal faces travel along the lines ao, Bo, and
yo, making angles of 120° with each other, the reading for the true octahedron is
known to be that corresponding to their intersection o.

When examined in this way the two adjacent octahedron faces of potash-alum give
