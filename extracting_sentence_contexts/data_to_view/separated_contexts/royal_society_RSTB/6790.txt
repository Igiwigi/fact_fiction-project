From time to time during the last 60 years various pigments
have been isolated from anemones, but the metabolic origin and function of the
pigments remain obscure. Not only are the colours often intense, but they vary so
greatly within the same species that even anemones living side by side may show a
complete contrast of pigmentation. This variation is as important as the fact of pig-
mentation itself if we are to consider the function of the pigments. In order, therefore,
to attack this problem we chose a species Metridium senile (L.) in which colour varia-
tions are striking and of many kinds. Its varieties depend not so much on complex
patterns as upon large washes of a few pigments over well-defined regions of the body.
