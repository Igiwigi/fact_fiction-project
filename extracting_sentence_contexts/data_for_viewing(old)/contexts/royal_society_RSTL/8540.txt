section of part of a rootlet. The root-bundle (x) consists of a few slender yessels, which
are sometimes barred and at others reticulated. This bundle is surrounded by a sheath
(o"), which is often yery clearly defined, especially in the transyerse sections (Plate
VIL. fig. 46, 0). It consists of long, narrow, thin-walled, and parallel-sided cells. This
is invested by the principal parenchyma (0), the cells of which are somewhat lengthened
in the longitudinal direction ; and the whole is enclosed in a well-marked and often
very $harply defined parenchymatous cortical inyestment (0), which only differs from
that upon which it rests in the cells being yet more elongated and compressed, These
rootlets further differ from those of Stiqmaria in being of a darker colour, and more
suggestive of a robust and less delicate texture.

I have called attention to the peculiar aspect of the outer bark as seen in all yertical
and transverse sections of it, and also to the fact that the largest and outermost cells of
its inner parenchyma are frequently intersected by secondary cell-walls, which are
parallel to each other as well as to the periphery of the axis, It appears obyious to me
that we have here a meristem structure analogous to some peculiar bark-tissues
described in two of my previous memoirs*. It also appears clear that the outer paren-
chymatous cells of the inner bark were the source from whence additions were con-
stantly being made to the inner surface of the outer bark, by the elongation of those
cells in a radial direction, and the contemporaneous development within each cell of
the numerous parallel tangential cell-walls already referred to. It obviously follows
that each long column of parallel cells, seen in Plate VIII. figs. 47, k, & 49, k, with their
common, strongly marked, radially arranged boundary lines, represent what had originally
