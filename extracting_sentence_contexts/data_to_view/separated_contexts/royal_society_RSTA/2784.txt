They also introduced an additional layer of confusion; they regarded their ‘growth
curve’ as an estimate on net crustal growth, not on the formation age distribution. That is,
they seemed to think that they could correct not only for crustal reworking but also for crustal

recycling. This fact may not be very obvious in their paper; in their fig. 2, they denote their growth : =
curve as ‘crustal reworking corrected’ (a tag appropriate for the formation age distribution), but : S
in the main text, they use this curve to discuss ‘net rates of continental growth’. A series of review 2
papers written subsequently by the same authors [20,21,49,50] has made it clear that they do : &
