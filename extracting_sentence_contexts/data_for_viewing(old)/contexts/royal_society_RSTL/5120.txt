magnet) either terminate at its exterior, or at any assumed points, to be called poles;
or are continued and disposed of within. For this purpose, let us consider the ex-
ternal loop (3093.) of fig. 5, When revolving with the magnet no current is pro-
duced, because the lines of force which are intersected on the one part, are again
intersected in an opposing direction on the other (3110.). But if one part of the
loop be taken down the axis of the magnet, and the wire then pass out at the equator
(3091.), still the same absence of effect is produced; and yet it is evident that, ex-
ternal to the magnet, every part of the wire passes through lines of force, which con-
spire together to produce a current ; for all the external lines of force are then inter-
sected by that wire in one reyolution (3101.). We must therefore look to the part
of the wire within the magnet, for a power equal to that capable of being exerted ex-
ternally, and we find it in that small portion which represents a radius at the cen-
tral and equatorial parts. When, in fact, the axial part of the wire was rotated it
produced no effect (3095.) ; when the axial, the inner radial, and the external parts
were revolved together, they produced no effect; when the external wire alone was
revolved, directly, it produced a current (3091.) ; and when the internal radius wire
alone (being insulated from the magnet) reyolyed, directly, it also produced a current
(3095. 3098.) in the contrary direction to the former; and the two were exactly
equal in power; for when both portions of the wire moved together directly, they
perfectly compensated each other (3095.). This radius wire may be replaced by the
magnet itself (3096. 3118.).
