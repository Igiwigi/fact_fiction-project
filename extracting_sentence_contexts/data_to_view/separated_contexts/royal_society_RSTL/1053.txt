In order to give support to this opinion, cases were adduced,
in which, from some anatomical peculiarities, it seemed almost
impossible that the fecundating fluid could be conveyed into
the uterus; and yet in several of these cases impregnation had
really taken place. It would be digressing too much to state
the facts in detail, sceing that in this inquiry I deduce nothing
from them; nor would such statement solve the problem be-
fore us. The facts are already in the possession of physiolo-
gists, but are not admitted as satisfactory proofs. Those who
hold the contrary opinion, either cavil at the accuracy of the
Statement, or draw a different conclusion; therefore to attempt
conviction by these materials would be to engage in the service
of forlorn hope. It remains then to try whether by a patient
experimental investigation, we can make such an accession of
new facts to our present stock of knowledge as will enable us
to unloose this Gordian knot.
