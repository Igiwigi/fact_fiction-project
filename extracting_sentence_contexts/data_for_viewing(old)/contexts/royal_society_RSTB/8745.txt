discussion by Conner & Lande [130]). Despite the fact that
Berg’s papers focused primarily on homeostasis and modular-
ity (‘correlation pleiades’), most of the subsequent literature
stimulated by Berg’s work has addressed patterns of inte-
gration [130]. This paradox reflects the fact that there are two
divergent interpretations of her thinking that probably
stemmed from the various ideas developed by Berg regarding
the effects of specialized pollination on flowers. We illustrate
this with the following quotations:

integration was achieved by the reduction of floral parts
via fusion (third statement), and not by simple stabilizing
selection on the different parts, as often suggested in the lit-
