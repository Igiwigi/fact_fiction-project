force u on N parallel spring-mass systems of frequencies a, = kAq, akin to the Caldeira—Leggett
model [20,21], or the action of a force u on the extremity of a line of N identical springs and masses
connected in series, similar to Lamb’s model [22].

In many physical circumstances, the equation y(t) =ru(t) is not accurate enough, however,
because we assumed x(0)=0. If N is very large, it may be more realistic to assume that
x(0) is unknown but follows a probability distribution. A popular assumption is that x(0)
is in thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature T, and follows a Gibbs distribution (x ~
exp(—(1/2T)x" Kx). Accounting for this, we should update the bath equation to y(t) =ru(t) +
J/2rTw(t), where w(t) represents a zero-mean unit-intensity Gaussian white noise process (note


that we assume units are chosen such that Boltzmann’s constant is kg = 1); see [9]. In fact, the
added noise term is exactly the so-called Johnson—Nyquist noise [20,23-25].

In the following, we use the equation y(t) =ru(t) + J/2rTw(t) with constant T to model
infinite heat baths. This is also our first example of how a time-scale separation argument
applied to a lossless system can be used to derive phenomenological models (Ohm’s law and
Johnson-Nyquist noise). In particular, it highlights under what assumptions we can expect the
phenomenological laws to be accurate.

(b) Dissipative systems

A dissipative linear system is obtained when interconnecting a lossless system (A,B,C) with :
resistive elements 1; at some of its ports. As we just explained, the resistive elements are also :2z
