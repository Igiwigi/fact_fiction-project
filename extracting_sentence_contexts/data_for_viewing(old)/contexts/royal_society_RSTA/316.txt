detailed analysis, and often a fully quantum description. It would seem natural

o try and develop a dedicated control theory for quantum systems that would

ideally be of a universal character. This would of necessity take into account the
features of the quantum world, of the measurement and estimation of quantum
systems, the processing of quantum information, and the manipulation and
actuation of quantum systems by their environment.

The development of quantum control, to date, is strikingly dissimilar to its
classical counterpart: closed-loop constitutes only a relatively small fraction of
theoretical work on quantum control, and is even rarer in experiment; also there is
as yet no analogue of Wiener-Kolmogorov filtering, despite the fact that Kalman
and nonlinear filtering for quantum Markov models are well developed. In these
notes, we shall be interested in feedback that affects the dynamics of a given
system. We should mention that there are other closed-loop strategies, notably
adaptive feedback [10] in quantum chemistry, which uses learning algorithms but
where control policies are applied to copies of the given system (molecules).
