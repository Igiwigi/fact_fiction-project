None of the specimens tested at this time have given so low values of JHdI for the
higher cycles, though the values in Rings III. and V. are practically identical with
those in the Japanese iron for cycles in which B is less than 4000. The superior
magnetie softness of this wire (No. IX.) was further shown by the fact that its
coercive force after strong magnetization was 1째75, whereas in all the rings now
tested the coercive force exceeded 2. At least: one other specimen of wire used in
the Japanese experiments was as good,

The comparison suggests a doubt whether all that is possible has yet been done by
manufacturers of iron to produce a quality specially suitable for such uses as the con-
struction of transformer cores. The conditions of manufacture which secure low
hysteresis appear to be imperfectly known, or, at least, to be less generally recognized
than electricians might wish, It must, however, be admitted that with respect to
hysteresis losses under the comparatively low intensities of magnetization usual in
transformers, the sheet iron of Rings III. and V. is very nearly as good as the wire
tested in Japan.
