Although the explant enlarged, the sternal plates did not move apart, but instead
began to approach one another as in normal development (fig. 27, Plate 38). That
this approximation of the plates was not due merely to expansion by growth was shown
by the fact that the distance between their outer (costal) margins diminished as well
as that between their inner (ventral) margins. The front-ends of the plates came in
contact first, after which the hind-ends continued to move inwards until the outer
edges of the plates, which originally sloped away from each other, became parallel or
