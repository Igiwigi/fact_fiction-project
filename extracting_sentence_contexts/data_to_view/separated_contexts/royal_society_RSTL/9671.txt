H. GILBERT ON THE RESULTS OF

preceding, but the earlier accumulations, or what may be called the normal stores of
the 80il and subsoil, would be drawn upon. That snch was really the case may be
concluded from the fact of the reduction of the percentage of nitrogen in the surface
8oil of plot 6, as of plot 7 where mineral manures alone had been applied for 20 years,
and where the very complex and highly leguminous herbage accumulated, throughout
the period, an otherwise unaccountably large amount of nitrogen. With the differencesâ€”in the amount of produce, in the botany, in the character of
development of the herbage, and in the probable sources of the nitrogen of the crop,
the change in its chemical composition was also extremely marked. Although there was very little less nitrogen taken up than where the ammonia-salts
were till applied, the percentage of nitrogen in the dry substance of the mixed
herbage was reduced by more than one-third.
