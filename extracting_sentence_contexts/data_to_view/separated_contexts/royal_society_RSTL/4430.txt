Why may we not admit that in this case the decompoxsition is de-
termined solely by these relations? The heat which attends upon. this and other
similar decompositions is, on the electro-chemical theory, as confessed by its greatest
supporters, an inexplicable enigma. Heat is the constant sign of combination, but
here it asserts is only decomposition, 80 that theory and fact are plainly at issue. On
the other hand, admitting that in this experiment the formation of the elements is a
true chemical synthesis, the evolution of heat is accounted for ; and as the elements,
chlorine and nitrogen, are far more permanent forms of matter, and less readily altered
by chemical action than the chloride of nitrogen, s0 it is reasonable to believe that the
particles of which they are composed are in a far more intimate state of combination. The transition from these experiments to the most ordinary cases of the formation of

the element is obvious, it being plain that the reduction of oxide of silver* into
oxygen gas and the metal, differs only from the spontaneons decompoxsition of the
chloride of nitrogen in the temperature at which it takes place.
