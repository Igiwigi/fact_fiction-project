in the first segment of the head in Pieris, a pair of somites, a neuromere and a pair of
limbs.

With regard to the epipharynx the facts that it arises as a paired structure, quite
as distinct as the premandibular appendages, and that it possesses a small double mass
of mesoderm which passes into it as it develops into the median lobe, may tempt one
to the conclusion that another segment is concerned here. It must be remembered,
however, that the mesoderm of the epipharynx is secondarily separated from the

protocerebral mesoderm. This together with the fact that no neuromere is present,
leads one naturally to the conclusion that there is no segmental significance to be
attached to the at first bifid epipharynx. I contend therefore that the embryology of
Pieris fully substantiates the orthodox conception of the six-segmented constitution
of the insect head.

Head segmentation is notoriously a subject beset with many pitfalls to the embryo-
logist, especially in studies of the more specialised groups of insects. In the latter forms
somites tend to become reduced, or even obliterated, and any criticism of Orthopteron
investigations, based on the development of a specialised insect like Pieris, must always
be of a guarded nature. Wresmann (1926) in a clear review of the subject of insect
head segmentation points out the great advance which has been made possible by
embryological study. ‘The earliest researchers, working by purely anatomical methods,
