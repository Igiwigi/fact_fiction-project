Here o =3aNÂ°/?/4 characterizes conservative nonlinearity, and d= VNky/4, dissipative terms. Considering the reduced system, we illustrate the evolution of the regime of intense energy beats
which appears as a limit cycle (red bold line) on the phase planes of figure 9(a(i-iii)). In spite of
the fact that the LPT has its special geometrical meaning solely for the two-oscillator, conservative
models or externally loaded single d.f. models, we will refer to the limit cycles obtained in the
present model as the LPT limit cycles due to their correspondence to the LPT of the conservative
subsystem in the limit of zero dissipation. The LPT limit cycle emerges for some low values of nonlinear and dissipation parameters
of the system. It encircles one of the stationary points (unstable simple periodic regime of the
full system (3.30)) at (7/4, 32/2).
