ยง 18. The regular diurnal inequality is of special interest for theorists, particularly
those whose ambition it is to discover an explanation of the phenomena of terrestrial
magnetism. There are, however, other facts connected with the daily changes which
merit a close study. If we take the case of a surveyor or explorer making frequent
use of an accurate compass, it is, no doubt, well that he should know the general
features of the regular diurnal inequality; but what immediately concerns him is
how far the needle is pointing from its mean position at a given hour of a given day.
Now, no examination of past data can supply exact prophetic information as to the
future, but the present investigation has provided data which will, I trust, enable the
practical man to see more exactly how the matter stands, and will give him a more
adequate idea of the risks he runs in accepting individual observational data as
representative. The statistical data which seem most likely to serve this purpose
consist of the mean values of the absolute daily range (absolute maximum less
absolute minimum) for different months and years, the relative frequency of absolute
ranges of specified size, and the frequency with which the absolute maximum and
