In our four-dimensional cosmology [43-46], we shall not cancel the anomalies. In fact, we shall
assume that only fields of the bosonic degrees of freedom of the massless gravitational string
multiplet appear as external fields in the effective action describing the dynamics of the early
Universe. Chiral fermionic and gauge matter are generated at the end of the inflationary period
as we shall discuss later on, in §4. With the above assumptions, one may implement the Bianchi
identity (2.5) as a constraint in a path-integral, via a pseudoscalar (axion-like) Lagrange multiplier
field b(x). After the H,») path-integration, then, one arrives at an effective action for the dynamics
of the early epoch of the string-inspired Universe [44-46], which, upon the assumption of constant
dilatons, contains only gravitons and the now dynamical field b(x), canonically normalized,
without potential, which corresponds to the massless string-model-independent gravitational (or
KR) axion field [48,77]:
