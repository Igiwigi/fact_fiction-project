characteristic reactions of the Pierid pigments. The brighter pigments, such as the
reds found in the Vanesside, are the more characteristically soluble; the darke
pigments being less so. In this family occurs the remarkable white pigment which
turns bright yellow with alkalies. It is found in the English “ Marbled White,’
Arge galathea (vide ‘Nature, vol, xxx., p. 571). It yields no trace of murexide
In the Lycenide chemical pigments play a subordinate part, interference colours
predominating. From no species of this group have I been able to extract murexide-
yielding bodies. Lastly, the brown pigments of the Hesperiidae, or “Skippers,”
are soluble with difficulty, and do not yield the reactions described.

In the apparently strict confinement of these special pigments to the Pieride, we
have interesting evidence justifying the customary classification of these insects as
natural group; but the fact has a still more important bearing on the subject 0
mimicry. The resemblance between the genus Leptalis (Pieridee) and certain of th
Heliconiide is, perhaps, the best known of all instances of protective mimicry. }
have found that the mimicking Pierid retains the characteristic pigments of its group
while those of the mimicked Heliconid are quite distinct. This would seem wholl ,
to refute the argument that in such cases the likeness may spring from a real affinity

between the two insects.

* T have for instance been quite unable to confirm the observations of A. B. Grirriris, referred to
the commencement of this paper. Soluble green pigments undoubtedly exist in the various spec
mentioned by this author (Jos. cit.), but after many efforts I have been unable to obtain from them
uric acid reactions whatsoever.
