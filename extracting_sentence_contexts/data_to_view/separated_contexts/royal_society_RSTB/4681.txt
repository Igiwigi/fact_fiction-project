There can be no doubt that the
basal parts of the radiating lamelle are of sheath-origin, for the upper and lower
parts of the membrana elastica externa are still recognisable at a time when the
secondary calcification around the double cone has already taken on a radiating
appearance (fig. 27, p. 880). But the fact that the calcified rays of the adult do not
actually reach the surface cannot be taken as proof that their outermost parts are
not of perichondrial origin, for several instances are known in which there is delay in
the process of calcification of perichondrially produced cartilage. While the cartilage
that occurs between the outer edge of the calcified ray and the surface of the
centrum in the adult Torpedo is a small-celled growing cartilage, there is not
the same evidence as there is in the horizontal and vertical rays of caudal vertebrae of
Rhinobatus and Trygonorhina that this tract is of perichondrial origin. In Narcine,
another genus of the Torpedinide, the evidence of sections from a young specimen,
