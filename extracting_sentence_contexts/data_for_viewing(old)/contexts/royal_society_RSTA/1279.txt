ignoring the time dependence. This provides the equations for the director, but leaves however a
gap in the self-consistency of the model, namely in the flow part. One can note in equation (2.4)
that setting u = 0 leaves the equation

Vp=-AV -T (5.1)

with the additional stress tensor T from (2.5) provided in terms of Q. Thus in principle not all
the solutions for the Q-tensor part would be valid, but only those that satisfy the additional
constraint (5.1).

It can be checked that at least in the BE formalism stationary solutions of the Q-tensor
equations, i.e. satisfying (3.1), automatically satisfy the constraint (5.1). This is no longer the
case for time-dependent solutions. In fact, J.L. Ericksen, considering the case when the inertia
is present (thus having also a second time-derivative in (2.1)) and working in the EL formalism,
called these solutions ‘twist-waves’ [113]. These are solutions which exhibit dynamic behaviour
of the directors, such that they do not create a velocity flow. They represent an interesting and
important limit behaviour of the system, as such it is important to understand (in various theories
(BE, EL, relaxed EL, .. . )): the following:


Research topics 4: Provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence solutions
of (2.1) (considering also the case with an inertial term as in [113], i.e. a second-order time
derivative) that also satisfy the additional constraint (5.1).

Another important direction of research concerns the effect that the flow has on the dynamics :S
