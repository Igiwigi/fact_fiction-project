This Griinwald—Letnikov-based approach to discretization of fractional :
derivatives had very strong impact on the way of thinking in fractional calculus, that even
fractional integrals were routinely discretized on equidistant grids, too. However, it is clear
that for fractional integrals it was not a necessity at all. On the other hand, it was unclear

what one could do with approximation of fractional integrals on non-equidistant grids, if : =
one wants to have a uniform approach to discretization of both fractional derivatives and : 3
fractional integrals. : ca

Second, solution of fractional differential equations in large time intervals is a computational 1
problem due to the fact that the number of points taken into account in computations grows with : >
the growing value of the time variable. This is caused by the non-local character of fractional- :3
order differentiation. So far, the only aid in this respect was the ‘short memory principle’ 18
