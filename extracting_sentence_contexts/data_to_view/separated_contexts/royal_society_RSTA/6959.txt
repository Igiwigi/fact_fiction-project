The comparison between y-sitostanol and the preparation of a/-sitostanol,
for example (table 4), was undertaken to settle the question of the identity or otherwise
of these compounds. The X-ray photographs are exceedingly similar, much more so
than photographs so far studied of different individuals, and suggest that the main
constituents of the two preparations are identical. But the fact that the two sets of
photographs are not exactly the same indicates that there must be one or more different
constituents in either or both samples. And one possible constituent is suggested by
the fact that spinastanol also gives photographs practically identical with those of the
sitostanols in the spacings, though markedly different from them in the intensities of
the X-ray reflexions. Other similar examples of mixed crystals appear among the
sitosterols themselves.
