If the above conception is
correct, O. cinnamomea, O. regalis, and QO. claytoniana form a series of degeneracy
gin which O. cinnamomea is most primitive and O. claytoniana most. specialised. Sit i is interesting to note in this connection that Camppett, from his study of the
S gametophyte, has reached the conclusion that O. cinnamomea is more primitive than
& O. claytoniana. Ee But if the hypothesis presented in the last paragraph be considered to be the most
spreasonable explanation of the anatomical facts, it leads us somewhat further. Very
‘4 striking features of the large proportion of specimens of O. ciimamomea, in which pith
Sand cortex are obviously one, morphologically, are the presence of internal sieve-
tissue, and the frequent communication of internal and external endodermal layers
‘3 through the foliar gaps, as well as the ramular ones. In other words, there is an
obvious tendency in what may be regarded as the most primitive condition of the
8 S central cylinder in the existing Osmundacez to approximate the polystelic type of
S Van Tiecuem.
