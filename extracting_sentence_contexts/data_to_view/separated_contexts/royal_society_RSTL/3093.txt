away the electricity filently; this property, 1 fay, ope-
rating from the very beginning, prevents the electric
fluid from being accumtilated in the prime conductor,
and of courſe the quantity of it will always be ſmall. But
when a double or interrupted conductor is uſed, the ſe-
cond conductor receives no electricity till the prime con-
ductor is pretty highly charged, and, if put at the greateſt
ſtriking diſtance, not till it is fully charged, and conſe-
quently the ſharp point preſented to the oppoſite end can
carry away none of it till that time; when the wholequan-
tity is thrown off at once, Itſhould ſeem then;that theex-
ploſion in onecaſe, and the non-explofion in theother, de-
pended wholly upon the different quantities to be thrown
off: whence it will follow, that though a ſmall quantity
of electricity will paſs off ſilently upon a point, yet that
this power is very limited; for that if a fomewhat greater
quantity be applied ſuddenly to a ſharp point, it will not
paſs off filently, but create an exploſion 3 In wn to
its denſity. The facts above related are a ſufficient anſwer to that
other experiment of Mr. NA1RNEY, in” which he exhi-
bited a ſharp point, that when perfectly communicating
with the earth drew off the eledricity ſilently from the
prime condu@or; but received exploſions freely, when
the communication was broken by interpofing little

be owned to be condlufive. But if it was intended to ſug-

it is owing to this circumſtance, and, conſequently, that
<Mr. wILSON' experiments at the Pantheon were unfairly
Sade; in this view it has no weight, becauſe we have
Salready ſeen that an interrupted communication is not
#the only circumſtance that will produce an exploſion, for
that increaſing the quantity of eleQricity will have the
