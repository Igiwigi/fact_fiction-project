measured using an inductive-cell sensor that measured the rate
of decay of an electromagnetic field (ca 3 cm around the sensor,
for details see [24]). Conductivity, together with temperature,
was used to calculate water salinity [24]. Anomalies caused by

otariid seals (19% lung, 47% blood) rely more on their lung
oxygen stores and less on their blood oxygen stores compared
with phocid seals (5% lung, 60-65% blood) [6,7]. In fact,
because of these assumptions, differences in oxygen stores

are likely to be even greater than these body oxygen store cal- air bubbles around the sensor cause the conductivity/salinity
