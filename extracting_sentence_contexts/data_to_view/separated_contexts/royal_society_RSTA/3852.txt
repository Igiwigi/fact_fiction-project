Vast globular bodies of
fire were seen projected from the fiery furnace, and bursting fell back into it, or over
it on the surrounding bushes, which were instantly set in flames. About four hours
from the lava boiling over the crater it reached the sea, as we could observe from the
reflection of the fire and the electric flashes attending it.‚Äù Now this looks very circumstantial, but the fact remains that when we were at the
mouth of the Larikai this summer we saw no lava in the bed of the stream there. This torrent flows down a tremendous gorge, cut in the old lavas and tufts of this
part of the mountain. On the shore below there had been a small alluvial fan, but,
as already mentioned (p. 454), it had slid away and disappeared during the eruption
of this year.
