d 2. On the Viscous Theory of Glaciers.

A glacier is a mass of ice which, connected at its upper extremity with the snow
which fills vast mountain basins, thrusts its lower extremity into the warm air which
lies below the mnow-line. The glacier moves. It yields in conformity with the sinu-
o8ities of its walls, and otherwise accommodates itself to the inequalities of the
valley which it fills. It is not therefore suwrprising that the glacier should have been
regarded as an ice-river by those who dwelt in its vicinity, or that this notion
8hould haye found a place in the speculations of writers upon the subject. The state-
ments of M. RExÞVU in connexion with this point are particularly distinet ;—* There are,”
he writes, © a multitude of facts which scem to necessitate the belief that the substance
of glaciers enjoys a kind of ductility which permits it to model itself on the locality
which it occupies, to become thin and narrow, and to elongate itself like a soft paste *,'
But this obseryer put forward his speculations with great caution, and often in the
form of questions which he confessed his inability to answer. © M. Rgxpu,” says Pro-
