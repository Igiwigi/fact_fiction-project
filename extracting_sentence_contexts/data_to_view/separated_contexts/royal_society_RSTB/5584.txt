THE BIOCHEMISTRY OF MICRO-ORGANISMS. 125

It is evident from the above facts that the biochemically interesting fungi
are by no means confined to the commoner genera and species—such as species of
Aspergillus and Penicillium—but that investigation of some of the rarer species, many
of which grow well on purely synthetic media, is bound to lead to results of interest
and to the isolation of interesting, and possibly new, types of metabolic products. Summary. Carbon balance sheets are given for a wide variety of species of fungi belonging
to different orders, families and genera.
