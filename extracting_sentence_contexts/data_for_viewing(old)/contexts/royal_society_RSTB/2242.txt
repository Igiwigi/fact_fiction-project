and 2nd divisions of the trigeminus may be together equivalent to the field of a
complete posterior root of a segmental (spinal) nerve, but that neither of the fields is
so when taken singly.

But the skin-field supplied by the 3rd division of the nerve is, like those supplied
by the Ist and 2nd divisions, overlapped from behind by that of the IInd cervical
nerve, and to a far greater amount than they. This argues for the skin-tields of the
first and third divisions of the trigeminus belonging to the same segmental level, and
for no one of them by itself constituting a complete segmental area. Further, to the
skin-field of the ramus mandibularis, the test for a complete segmental skin-field,
namely, that it extends from mid-dorsal line without a break to the mid-ventral line,
can be applied with certainty, since its position in regard to those lines is not dubious.
The field, as a fact, occupies the mid-ventral line along a considerable length ; but it
does not actually attain the mid-dorsal line anywhere, although it approaches on the
scalp at one point somewhat closely (see p. 61). It is, therefore, very unlikely that
this field is of complete segmental character,

A third feature in which the separate skin-fields of the three divisions of the
trigeminus differ from the fields of complete segmental (spinal) nerves is the following :
The overlapping of fields of contiguous spinal nerves is regular and very considerable ;
the contiguous skin-fields may have half of their respective areas in common. With
the fields of the three divisions of the trigeminus the extent of mutual overlap is
irregular and not nearly so great. Thus, on the conjunctiva the fields of the 1st and
2nd divisions meet, but hardly overlap at all; similarly those of the 2nd and 3rd
divisions at the angle of the mouth. I do not know of detailed observations on the
