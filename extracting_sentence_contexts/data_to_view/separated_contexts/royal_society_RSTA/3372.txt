Despite the strong inhomogeneity of
the systems, in fact, at sufficiently strong interactions the experiment observes a suppression
of the system dynamics: within each tube when a part of the atoms reaches the localization
condition n=1, transport is suppressed also in the remaining adjacent parts with different
occupation [50]. For each set of measurements with a given value of s, ac can be determined by means of a
second-order polynomial piecewise fit [50], which is justified by the phase slip based model [31,
33]. In the absence of an exact theoretical model to obtain the critical momentum to enter the
dynamical instability regime at finite interaction, in fact, it is possible to use a QPS-based model
to predict the interaction dependence of pc, which well reproduces the experimental behaviour
of pe with the interaction and shows a quadratic dependence of p¢ on dg [50]. This result justifies
the choice of the quadratic polynomial fit in figure 4b, where is shown that a, increases when
s decreases. Comparing experimental results, extracted for different values of the lattice depth,
with a theoretical analysis based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations an excellent agreement
has been found [50].
