This apparent independence is partly due to fracture and partly
to the presence of an elongated foramen running lengthwise. The alveolar groove
below and a deep sulcus above reduce the connection of the bar with the rest of the
maxilla to a narrow neck, which under slight pressure, such as would be conveyed
by the immediately underlying lower jaw, would be readily broken across. That the bar is really a palatal process of the maxilla is strongly suggested by
the fact that it bounds on one side the alveolar groove with its teeth. ;

Mistrusting my own judgment I consulted Mr, Goopricu on this question ; he
was kind enough to examine photographs of the serial sections as well as the
reconstruction of this region, and came to the conclusion that the interpretation
just given is correct. This is extremely satisfactory, for if the bar were an indepen-
dent bone it would be difficult to find a place for it in a rational scheme of the skull. On the upper side of the palate, just where the palatal bar of the maxilla
terminates behind, the rounded angle by which the facial and palatal limbs of the
maxilla pass into each other becomes more deeply excavated so as to form a recess
on the side of the nasal chamber. ‘This, as it is continued outwards and backwards,
becomes roofed over by the descending edge of the base of the lacrymal bone, and
is finally converted into a canal, which ends blindly against the maxilla and
lacrymal at their common suture; the recess, however, farther forward opens on
the face by a perforation which lies on the same suture.
