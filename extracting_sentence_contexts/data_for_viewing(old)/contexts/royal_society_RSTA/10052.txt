MR. F. E. SMITH ON THE NORMAL WESTON CADMIUM CELL. 415

Electrical Standards Department. That a small current may be taken from the cell
without any permanent effect is proved from the, observations when cells have been
short-circuited, but the effect of a comparatively large charging current may be more
serious. Lord Rayiercu attempted to manufacture a Clark cell by the formation of
electrolytic mercurous sulphate inside an H vessel, the anode being mercury, the
electrolyte zinc sulphate, and the cathode an amalgam of zine. The cells so formed
were not constant, and their E.M.F.’s were low. In 1904 we attempted in a similar
way to produce cadmium cells, but it was evident that normal mercurous sulphate was
not formed, as the resulting salt was highly coloured ; it was sometimes yellow, but
more often green. The fact that the depolariser in some of our anomalous cells has,
after a long period, turned a yellowish-green suggested to us that its formation might
be accelerated by small charging currents. The constancy of other cells subject to
the same treatment is certainly against such a view, but a slight difference in the
original composition of the depolarisers might account for the more rapid change.
To test this point, we placed a normal cell in circuit with, but in opposition to, two
Leclanché cells for 18 hours. At the end of that time a green compound had formed
between the mercury electrode and the glass, but the depolariser appeared to be
unchanged. There is little doubt, however, but that some of the green salt was
present over the whole surface of the mercury. The E.M.F. of this cell was at first
very high, but in 4 weeks it gradually fell to 101833 volts. The observations which
we have so far made do not enable us to say whether any further fall is probable,
but it is evident that the small charging currents to which a cell is subjected in a
