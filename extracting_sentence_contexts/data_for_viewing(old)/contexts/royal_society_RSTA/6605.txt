Preface

Published online 28 March 2002

This Theme Issue is timed approximately to coincide with the bicentenary of the
discovery of interference by Thomas Young and his publication of the results in
Philosophical Transactions (Young 1802, 1804). Lord Brougham’s devastating criti-
cism of the earlier paper, though seriously misguided, might nonetheless give pause
to any editor of a Theme Issue.

As this paper contains nothing which deserves the name, either of exper-
iment or of discovery, and as it is, in fact, destitute of every species of
merit, we should have allowed it to pass among the multitude of those
articles which must always find admittance into the collections of a Soci-
ety which is pledged to publish two or three volumes every year.

Young made his discoveries when, as described in the article by John Mollon, he
was a Fellow Commoner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. The annual one-day
meeting organized by the Cambridge Philosophical Society accordingly, with help
from Emmanuel, took ‘Interference’ as its title this year and gave rise to rather more
than half of the 14 papers presented here. A number of other papers were invited in
order to give a somewhat fuller, if still woefully incomplete, coverage of this enormous
field.
