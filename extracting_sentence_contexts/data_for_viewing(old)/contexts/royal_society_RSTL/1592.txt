markable phenomena.

I heated lime gently in a green glass tube, and passed the
phosphoric sublimate, the saturated oxymuriate of phosphorus
through it, in vapour ; there was a violent action with the pro-
duction of heat and light, and a gray fused mass was formed,
which afforded by the action of water, muriate and phosphate
of lime.

I introduced some vapour from the heated phosphoric sub-
limate, into an exhausted retort containing dry paper tinged
with litmus: the colour slowly changed to pale red. This
fact seems in favour of the idea that the substance_ is
an acid; but as some minute quantity of aqueous vapour
might have been present in the receiver, the experiment can-
not be regarded as decisive: the strength of its attraction
for ammonia, is perhaps likewise in favour of this opinion.
All the oxymuriates that I have tried, indeed form triple com-
pounds with this alkali ; but phosphorus is expelled by a gentle
