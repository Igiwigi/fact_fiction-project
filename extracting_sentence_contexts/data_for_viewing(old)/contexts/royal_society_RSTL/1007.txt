54 Mr. Davv's Lecture on $0me

Well burned charcoal and plumbago, or charcoal and iron,
might be made the exciting powers; and such an arrangement
if erected upon an extensive scale, neutrosaline matter being
employed in every series, would, there is every reason to
believe, produce large quantities of acids and alkalies with
very little trouble or expence.

Ammonia and acids capable of decompoxition, undergo che-
mical change in the Vorratc circuit only when they are in
very concentrated solution, and in other cases are merely
carried to their particular points of rest. This fact may in-
duce us to hope that the new mode of analysis may lead us to
the discovery of the true elements of bodies, if the materials
acted on be employed in a certain state of concentration, and
the electricity be sufficiently exalted. For if chemical union be
of the nature which I have ventured to suppose, however
strong the natural electrical energies of the elements of bodies
may be, yet there is every probability of a limit to their
strength: whereas the powers of our artificial instruments
seem capable of indefinite increase.

Alterations of electrical equilibrium are continually taking
place in nature; and it is probable that this influence, in its
