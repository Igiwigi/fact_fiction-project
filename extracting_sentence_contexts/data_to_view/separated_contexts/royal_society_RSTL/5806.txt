the solid layer be 62 feet thick, it would be like @ in the accompanying diagram (fig. 13);

scorie of each should touch and join in the middle of the section, then 6 would seem to
be a prolongation of Â« with merely one of those slight breaks or thinnings out and
resumptions of beds with which we are familiar. I may observe in concluding this subject, that if there be cases (though I did not
happen to see one on Mount Etna) where the melted matter has run out from the inte-
rior of a stream of lava which has descended a steep slope, 80 as to cause the superfticial
crust, together with the solid central layer, to fall and cover in separate pieces the floor
of the arched tunnel, this fact would not favour the notion of those who question the
analogy of ancient and modern formations in volcanic mountains. The result of the
collapse would be simply this, that a stratum of fragmentary and scoriaceous materials
of unusual thickness would be seen in the area of the downfall. Tighty inclined modern lava near the Montagnuola.
