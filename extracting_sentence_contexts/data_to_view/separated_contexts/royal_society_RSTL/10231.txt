It is extremely difficult to determine whether these yarying lengths represent the
actual snccession of the filaments since the latter are in their early stages closely
contracted together and their arrangement cannot be made out. This grouping
persists for a long time and the dorsal filaments remain permanently shorter than the
others, and of different structure as K6L11KER has observed. (The dorsal filaments
are in many cases longer than the others, but this is, in {enzlla at least, only
apparent, and is due to the fact that they never become convoluted like those of
the lateral and ventral septa.) All of the filaments except the dorsal pair increase
rapidly in length and very 800n become folded back and forth and yariously convoluted
(see figs. 183, 205).
