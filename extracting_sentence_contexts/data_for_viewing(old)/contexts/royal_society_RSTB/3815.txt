tangential association. The resemblance of the resin canals of Araucariopitys to
those of the pine cone indicates that they are of a primitive type, since the
conservatism of this region is now generally recognised. This form, then, from the
character of its traumatic response, which is not of the “revival” type, cannot be a
pine supposedly differentiating in the direction of the Araucarians, at such a stage
that the resin canals are developed only in case of need.

The other feature referred to, which supports this view, is the relationship of resin
canals to the spur shoot in both Araucariopitys and the living pine. A reference to
figs. 65 and 68 (Plate 7) will make this point clear. The fact that the branch of
Q Pinus resinosa from which the former figure comes was severely wounded nearer
a the main stem may not be without significance. The wounding in this case has

¢ “revived” the ancestral relationship to the spur shoot which is so clearly marked
