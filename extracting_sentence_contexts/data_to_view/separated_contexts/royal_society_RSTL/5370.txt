Several small specimens occur
on the free duplicatures of the allantois continued from the umbilical trunks near the
Placenta: in almost every case they are developed on the course of the large vessels, and
are restricted, with few exceptions, to that part of the allantois which is in contact with
the chorion, and which forms the endochorion of embryologists. The free surface of
these peculiar bodies is 8mooth and polished, not villous like the cotyledons of the Z2u-
minantia; from which they likewise differ essentially in projecting inwards towards the
cavity of the allantois.


390 PROFESSOR OWEN ON THE FOAETAL MEMBRANES

The most important modification in the vascular structures connecting the chorion
with the uterus, in the Elephant, is their combination of two forms of the placenta, viz.
the © annular” and the * diffused,” which forms are restricted in other Mammalia to
distinct kinds of quadrupeds. This fact, appears to me to point to the inapplicability of modifications of the placenta
to the characterising of primary groups of the Class Mammalia. According to the annular or zonular part of the placental structure in the Elephant,
it 8hould be classed with the true Carnivora: according to the diffused vascular villosities
at the two poles of the chorion, it would rank with the true Pachyderms of the Cuvierian
System. The Elephant, however, is not the only hoofed quadruped which has an annu-
lar placenta: the Hyrax, which CuvIER 80 sagaciously discerned to be a kind of miniature
Rhinoceros, differs from its great ally by having an annular or zonular placenta.
