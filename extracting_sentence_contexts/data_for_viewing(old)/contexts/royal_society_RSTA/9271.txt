spring, so that there is more wood substance in the former part of the annual layer
than in the latter. In hardwoods four main types of longitudinal elements can usually
be distinguished—tracheids, wood-fibres, parenchyma cells and vessels. The wood-
fibres are long narrow thick-walled elements ; the tracheids are somewhat wider, and may
be thin-walled or thick-walled, as in conifers; the parenchyma cells are small and
thin-walled, and form very weak tissue ; the vessels are long thin-walled tubes, with

diameters much wider than those of the other cells—in fact reaching occasionally as
much as 0-02 inch. While in some woods these elements are distributed almost
uniformly throughout each annual layer, so as to render the wood practically homo-
geneous, in many other woods the summer region of each annual layer contains most
of the thick-walled elements and the spring region the weaker elements, especially, in
ring-porous woods, the vessels.

It thus appears that a closer approximation to the actual elastic behaviour of many
woods will be obtained by considering a material which is heterogeneous, being built up
of alternate layers of different anisotropic elasticities.

§ 6.1. Possible Effects of the Annual Layers.—In calculating the elastic constants of
wood from various mechanical tests, it has always been assumed that the same formule
