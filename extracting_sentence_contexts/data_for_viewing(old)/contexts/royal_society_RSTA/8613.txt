This, together with the definition of P, (5.43), forms the criterion for stability. The
expression (7.11) may be expected to hold for positive values of » from 0 to 1, but it
holds over a greater range than this. It holds in fact till the second term ceases to be a
small correction. In calculating numerical values for P it was found that this occurred,
in the cases considered, at about the value » = — 0-5.

Evaluation of the Root of As = 0 when yu is Negative.

In the case when » is negative, that is when the cylinders rotate in opposite directions
it is necessary to take account of several rows and columns of Aj. Being unable to
discover any approximate formula of the type given in (7.11), it was decided to select
particular values for «, R, and Ry, substitute in equation (6.03), and determine the
maximum value of P and the corresponding value of 6 by arithmetical exploration.
It was expected that the results so obtained would bear a qualitative resemblance to
the results obtained with any other negative value of yw.
