were published, no one has made any examination of the structure of the soft parts of
any of the members of the Tabulata, with the exception of Prof. VERRILL, who has
examined a Pocillopora and found it to be a true Zoantharian polyp with twelve septa
and twelve tentacles (Ann. & Mag. Nat. Hist. 1872, vol. ix. 4th series, Þ. 3559, from
Snamax's * American Journal,” 1872, vol. iii. pp. 187-194, *On the Affinities of
Palzozoic Tabulate Corals with Existing Species ”).


STRUCTURE AND RELATIONS OF CERTAIN CORALS. 93

Professor VERRILL, in the paper above quoted, as he has done before, combats the con-
clusions of Prof, Agass1z, that the whole of the Tabulata belonged to the hydroid polyps.
This fact, he 8ays, has only been proved for the Millepores : the remaining Tabulata
should be joined with the true polyps, with which their relations are very near and
intimate. The transverse partition-walls, the presence of which was held by MiLNg-
Epwarps and Hae as a characteristic distinction, are structures of a very low order,
that occur in widely different forms, and are only brought about by the simultaneous
emptying of the generative products from the radial chambers. Where the emptying
is not, thus periodically simultaneous, a separate transverse septum is formed in each of
the chambers shutting off the space thus become vacant. 'True tabulw are found not
only in Millepora and Pocillopora, but in Coalastraa, Alveopora, and Asﬀteropsammia,
Colummarig is, apparently, closely allied to Colastraa, Favosites to Alveopora, Porites, &c+
Teliopora being shown to be an Aleyonarian, tabulz are proved to be present in forms
still more widely different than is shown to be the case by Prof. VerriLL. The relation
of Favosites and Columnaria appears now in a different light.
