Hg Hg had forty-eight lines, Pt Hg only
twenty-five, s0 that the presence of Pt instead of Hg as electrodes put out twenty-three. It however brought out four new ones, of which No. 15 7 is found with every solid metal,
Nos.33, 59 x”, and 76 £ with most of them. There is here no superposition, but, instead,
either an antagonism of platimum and mercury, or the curious fact that the fluid elec-
trodes act differently from the solid. It would be interesting to compare the. spectra of
tin in these two states. The case is the same with a chemical compound as with a mixture.
