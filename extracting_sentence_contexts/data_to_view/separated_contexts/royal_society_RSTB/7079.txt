An investigation of the distribution of stresses at the extreme tip is
therefore likely to prove of interest; the indications are that the apical cell and those ad-

jacent to it are under compressive stress. This is inferred from: (a) a consideration of cell
growth and division at the apex; (6) the fact that when the apex is punctured the hole
does not become distended; and (c) the considerable exudation of sap on puncturing and
the collapse of adjacent cells. It has, however, been found possible to puncture the apical
cell so that the subsequent necrosis was slight, i.e. involving the apical cell and its im-
mediate segments only. When the apical cell is destroyed, lateral buds are formed, first in the subapical region
and then in the apical meristem itself; buds are also formed on meristems which have, in
addition, been isolated from the subapical region.
