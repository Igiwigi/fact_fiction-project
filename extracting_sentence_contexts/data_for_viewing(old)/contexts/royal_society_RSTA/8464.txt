HAMILTONIAN SYSTEMS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. 145

Ff, the characteristic ratio of H being real and rational ; then, in general, there branches
from the family JF at S a family of ordinary periodic solutions, for which the period
tends continuously in the neighbourhood of & to an integral multiple of the period of S.
Exceptionally, however—i.e., at isolated members of the family S*—there may branch
a finite number of singly-infinite families of singular periodic solutions instead of one
doubly-infinite family of ordinary periodic solutions.

The most striking result of the investigation which follows is that for fourth order
Hamiltonian systems in general, the periodic solutions are in general “ singular” : they
satisfy in general the above definition in that they occur in singly-infinite families and
have their characteristic ratio in general non-zero. We show, in fact, that any periodic
solution & belongs in general to a singly-infinite family J, along which the period and
the characteristic ratio vary continuously, and that if & has its characteristic ratio
real and rational, there branch in general from JF at S a finite number of singly-
infinite families (in general two) of periodic solutions, along which also the period and
the characteristic ratio vary continuously.

This result indicates that Hamiltonian systems of equations may be divided into two
categories according to the nature of their periodic solutions. For systems of the first
category the periodic solutions are in general “ ordinary”: such systems may be appro-
priately described as soluble since apparently all readily soluble systems are here included.
For systems of the second category the periodic solutions are in general “ singular,” and
they may be described as insoluble, since here apparently all systems which have hitherto
