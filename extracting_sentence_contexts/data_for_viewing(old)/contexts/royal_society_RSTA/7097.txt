This temperature can be interpreted as the transition temperature of the three-level problem.
It is substantially lower than the transition temperature corresponding to the two-level Bethe
problem, but still higher than Onsager’s value. The derivative of s with respect to T (which
would correspond to the specific heat in our problem) would have a maximum at this
transition temperature, but not a singularity.
At low temperatures (110) becomes
5= 84",

which represents the jumps due to the presence in the surface of adsorbed molecules and
vacant surface sites, which were not allowed in a two-level model. At high temperatures s
becomes now larger than 1 (in fact, its maximum value for 7 = 1 is 1-8). The reason for that
is again that we have now the possibility of jumps of height 2 intermolecular distances, and
therefore the number of bonds parallel to the surface per molecule (equal to s) can now be
greater than 1.

20:3. Many-level problem
It is interesting to see how the surface roughness behaves with increasing number of levels.
In the case of five levels, one obtains the equations

for the calculation of ¢, = ¢(1) = ¢(—1) and ¢, = ¢(2) = e(—2). The surface roughness s is
