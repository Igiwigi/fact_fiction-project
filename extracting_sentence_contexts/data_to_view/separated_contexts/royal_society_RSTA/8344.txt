Such terms, in which ¢ enters other than
through exponential functions, are called secular terms, and a term on the right of an
equation which on integration leads to a secular term is called a critical term. Since our
object is to construct a solution free of secular terms we must, by some means, ensure
that no critical terms occur on the right at the successive approximations. This condition is satisfied of itself as regards the equations for ¢,, o,”, for here
a term Ae” is critical only if nc = + pe, and this cannot be so since e/o = A/v and
is not an integral multiple of v.t The usual method of securing its satisfaction as regards
the equations for ¢.", ws? is in principle as follows: we include in the solution for
Heng RE eens the: * complementary function ’’ terms which are, in fact,
additive arbitrary constants ; in any equation the coefficients of the critical terms depend

* Of course, we cannot solve for «2 until Co has been found.
+ By definition we have 0 = R (A/v) = }, and we are here treating the case in which 4 x 0. HAMILTONIAN SYSTEMS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. 189

upon arbitrary constants which have been thus introduced in solving preceding equations,
and their vanishing is secured by suitably assigning these arbitraries.* ‘Thus we have
already seen that to make the critical term vanish from the equation for w,") we must
put %, = ¢(o — »)/a, %» being the “ complementary function ” term m ¢3. The disadvantage of this procedure is that the expressions for the ¢., ;,'° are not
completely and finally determined each from a single equation, and the presence of
constants whose values are fixed only when we are considering subsequent equations
introduces grave complications when we attempt to prove the series convergent.
