of circulation that we should attribute to the atmosphere in the latitudes outside ot
the trade-wind zones, we should naturally be led to expect (as I have pointed out in
some detail in an earlier part of the present paper in describing his theory) that the
great sheet of air floating out from the Equator in the upper regions of the atmosphere
towards either Pole, while having a motion towards the east also, would gradually cool
in advancing to higher latitudes, and would therefore descend in middle and high
latitudes to the Earth’s surface and would next, as a bottom current, flow back
towards the Equator while also flowing eastward, and so would be a current towards
the Equator, not towards the Pole. But, on the other hand, it had been brought out
through accumulated observational results that the winds of middle latitudes while
blowing towards the east, which so far is in agreement with Hapixy’s theory, do, in
opposition to what would be expected under that theory, blow more towards the Pole
than from the Pole. Thus the facts and theory seemed to be at variance. It then
occurred to me that facts and theory could be reconciled by supposing that the great
circulation brought into probability under HapuEy’s theory does actually occur, but
oceurs subject to this modification, that a thin stratum of air on the surface of the
Earth in the latitudes higher than about 30°—a stratum in which the inhabitants of
those latitudes have their existence, and of which the movements constitute the
observed winds of those latitudes—being by friction and impulses on the surface of

* Reference having been made in the text here to my paper read at the British Association Meeting
for 1857, on the “ Grand Currents of Atmospheric Circulation,” and to the Abstract of it printed in the
volume of the Association for that year, I have to mention as a correction that the theory here described
and correctly designated as Hapiuy’s Theory, was in the printed Abstract erroneously named as
Hauuey’s Theory. I was led into that mistake as to authorship of the commonly accepted explanation
