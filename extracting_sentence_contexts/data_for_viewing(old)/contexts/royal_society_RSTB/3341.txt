mineral matter is entirely permeated by plant remains because the tissues are still
there, so well preserved that every cell may be seen and there can be no doubt that
the mineral matter was deposited round the plant tissue. An explanation of the
small amount of carbonaceous matter found in such coal balls is given in Section IV,
p- 200: for the moment it suffices to point out that in these cases where the mineral
is deposited absolutely in the tissue of the plant, there is less carbonaceous matter
than is present in the dolomite described by Mr. Srrauan. For this reason his
argument, that the dolomite must have been deposited in water absolutely free from
plant débris, appears to us invalid. It is true that in the bulk of the dolomite stone,
plant tissue is not recognisably preserved, and that at first sight it appears entirely
free from such structures except for very decomposed coaly fragments ; but such an
appearance is no proof whatever that plant structures were not present and
decomposed during the formation of the mineral concretions. In fact, a number of
cases can be observed illustrating this in an ordinary “ coal ball,” where the process
has taken place on a smaller scale, and in the midst of a stem otherwise preserved so
that each cell is recognisable small concretionary masses may be seen with no trace
of plant tissue in their purely crystalline structure. In such cases we know that
the water in which the mineral was deposited could not have been free from plant
débris, none the less the mineral appears now to be free from it. We need not
follow the argument further: enough has been said to show that there is strong *
evidence on the side of the view that the Wirral dolomite was deposited amidst
plant débris at the same time that the coal was being formed. When compared
with the “coal ball” formation in the lower seams, it becomes clear that the case is
not unique as Mr, SrraAHAN supposed, and that in fact it is quite a parallel develop-
ment to that which formed the coal balls. This case is a useful example to illustrate
