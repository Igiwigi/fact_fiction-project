based on the full pool of ensemble members (146 for CMIPS and 135 for CMIP6), unless the time period is denoted with an asterisk
(*), then only the reduced pool of 84 (CMIPS) and 56 (CMP6) members is considered.

While the CMIP5 models on average suggested a slowdown of the AMOC over the twentieth
century [24], the CMIP6 models indicate an increase in AMOC strength [37]. Looking at the
different time periods in detail, we can see that this difference mainly stems from the fact that
the CMIP6 models simulate a fairly strong increase in AMOC strength from 1950 to 1985, where
the CMIP5 models only simulate a slight increase. Studies found that these differences are likely
due to an on average stronger anthropogenic aerosol forcing in CMIP6 than CMIP5 [36,37]. They
also suggested, based on observational constraints, that the anthropogenic forcing and/or the
AMOC response in the CMIP6 models may be overestimated.

After approximately 1985, the AMOC started to decline in both the CMIP5 and CMIP6 models
with an increased slowdown after the year 2000. While the overall post-1950 trend is on average
negative for the CMIP5 models, it is basically zero for the CMIP6 models. The larger standard
deviation of the CMIP6 trends furthermore shows that the spread within these models is larger
than the one within the CMIP5 models (table 1). This could be seen as somewhat surprising as in
general, the CMIP6 models due to, for example, their higher spatial resolution and improved
