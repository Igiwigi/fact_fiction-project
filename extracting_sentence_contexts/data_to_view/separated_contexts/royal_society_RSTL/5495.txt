8 MAJOR-GENERAL SABINE ON THE DECENNIAL MAGNETIC INEQUALITY. In both classes of 807ar variations the years 1841, 1846, 1847 and 1848 are the years
of greatest range, and the years 1842, 1843, 1844 and 1845 those of least range. If
we unite in one curve the lunar results in the four first-named years, and in a 8econd
curve the results in the four last-named years, and compare these two curyes, we are 80
far from finding in the lunar variation an inequality corresponding to that in the solar
variation, that the difference between the curves, such as it is, is in fact in the opposite
direction. 'These curves are drawn in Plate 1. fig. 3, and are there shown in comparison
with a third curve, which is that of the mean lunar-diurnal variation in the entire period
of eight years.

"The Tables T. to IV. were prepared, under Mr. MaGratH's superintendence, by the
Non-Commissioned Officers of the Royal Artillery employed in my office, each entry
having been verified by two independent computers. 'The observations themselves are
printed in the first three volumes of the © Hobarton Observations.”
