Hence, according to this rough approximation, the deflection of the plumb-line
at Burleigh Moor to the sonth is 3”:660. It will be observed that the attraction of
the space B is much larger in its amount than that of any of the other spaces ; In

fact, it is 87 per cent. of the whole attraction, although it is of smaller dimensions
than those to the south of it. This arises from its proximity to the tation, its
distance being put down as 3 miles south of Burleigh Moor—that being the sup-
posed distance of that station from the average line of coast on the north.
