Hapalide.—The Hapales, or Marmosets have, to judge by the eye, been cor-
rectly placed by GApow in a separate sub-order. They have the fundus peculiar to
the strongly pigmented Old World Monkeys; but with a very large macula area—as
large in fact as Cercopithecus callitrichus, but with this difference, that the reflex ring
shows a play of prismatic colours—a peculiarity which I have only found in one other
animal, namely, in the Squirrel Monkey (Chrysothria sciureus), which occupies no doubt
the highest position in the next sub-order,

ce. Platyrhine, (Plate 4.) The Platyrhines do not differ from the Catarhines to anything like the extent I
would have expected.
