Experiments were made with the tank in the laboratory to discover how far stream-
: line motion could be carried under favourable conditions ;. the tank rests directly
upon the ground, and after water at the temperature of the room had been allowed
to stand therein for two or three days, stream-line motion in pipes could be maintained
at higher velocities than that given by the upper limit formula for the critical
velocity v,, viz. :

the units being metres and degrees centigrade, a result no doubt due to the complete
absence of vibration in the tank, which was founded on rock, and also the freedom of
the water from sediment. Moreover, it is easy to lower the critical velocity by subjecting the water to a
disturbing cause; thus fine matter in suspension in the water will lower the critical
velocity. Tapping the pipe or interposing therein a piece of wire gauze will also act
likewise; in fact, the point of break-down can be varied within wide limits
according to the circumstances. Whatever be the disturbing causes, however, if stream-line motion exists, the
