Movement suppression: brain mechanisms for Most of those who study the mechanisms in the brain that control movement
tend to concentrate on the movements themselves, which is understandable
enough. But in fact most of the time our limbs and bodies are not moving at
all, but keeping still. We are so used to this that we take it for granted, but
one only has to look at the birds on one’s lawn to be aware of the continual
alternation between rapid movement and long periods of ‘freezing’, a pattern

Keeping still is itself a challenging problem for the motor system, and cer-
tainly not just a matter of turning muscles off. This theme issue focuses on
what is known of stopping and keeping still, from behavioural, neurophysio-
