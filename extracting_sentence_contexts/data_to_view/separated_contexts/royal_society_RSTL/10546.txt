Probably 100 watts is the limit of
error in any of the measurements. Such an error would affect the determination of
the efficiency when the machines were working up to their full power to less than
+ per cent.

1t has been assumed that the sum of these losses is equally divided between the
two machines. This will not accurately represent the facts, as the intensities of the
fields and the currents passing through the armatures differ to some extent in the two
machines. The inequality, however, cannot amount to a great quantity, and if it
diminishes the efficiency of the generator it will increase the efficiency of the motor by
a like amount, and contrariwise. In No. 11 of the series the effect of the sparking at
the brushes of the generator is very marked, the power wasted amounting to at least
250 watts.
