various basis sets of Gaussian modes. LG modes are eigenmodes of the operator for the z-
component of orbital AM. In this case, the density of orbital AM is proportional to the energy
density of the mode. This suggests the picture of a local density of photons, each with a well-
defined value fim of the z-component of orbital AM. In this sense, this quantity could be termed
well defined [1]. However, this picture should be handled with care. The cylindrical modes are
also eigenmodes of the z-component of the total AM (orbital plus spin), but the density of this
AM component is not proportional to the energy density or to the energy flux density.

Finally, we recall that this paper is entirely based on classical Maxwell theory, even though the
description uses mode operators that are reminiscent of quantum mechanics. There is no quantum,
indeterminacy here, and each physical quantity has a well-defined value for any mode. This is
also true for the densities of the three components of spin and orbital AM and for their integral
values, in spite of the fact that the corresponding operators are non-commuting. The suggestive
expressions (2.11) for the integral values of conserved quantities are not taken as a starting point,
but they originate from well-known expressions for the densities in terms of the Maxwell fields.
In contrast, a quantum mechanical wave function in general does not define a local density of
physical quantities. The ladder operators introduced in ยง5 do not refer to photons, but merely
change the order of classical modes.
