Both methods indicate a diminished systolic discharge in Douvauas, and no consider-
able alteration in any of the others. Additional evidence that the systolic discharge is not considerably altered even by
prolonged residence at a high altitude is afforded by the three curves here reproduced
from Ropison, Russein, and Deviney, all three of whom live on the Peak for several
months each year. The curve from Deviney is, in fact, of somewhat less than
ordinary amplitude, which accords with the fact that the subject (a telegrapher) leads
a sedentary life and is of rather frail physique. Similar small curves were found by
YanpELL Henperson (Joc. cit.) in persons of similar constitution and habits at sea-level.
