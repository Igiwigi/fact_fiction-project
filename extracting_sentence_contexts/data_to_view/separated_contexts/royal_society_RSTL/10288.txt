The first experiments on the incomplete combustion of hydrogen and carbonic oxide
were made by Hrnry. In a memoir printed in these Transactions (1824), Hexry
compared the action of the electric spark and of platinum sponge on mixtures
of carbonic oxide and electrolytic gas. He discovered the fact that the lower the
temperature at which the reaction occurs the greater is the proportion of carbonic acid
produced,

He writes : Â© I made numerous experiments to ascertain whether the oxygen, under

these cireumstances of slow combustion, is divided between the carbonic oxide and
the hydrogen in proportions corresponding to the volumes of those two gases. The
combustible gases being in equal volumes, and the oxygen sufficient to saturate only
one of them, it was found that the oxygen which had united with the carbonie oxide
was to that which had combined with the hydrogen as about 5 to 1 in volume,
Increasing the carbonic oxide, a still larger proportion of oxygen was expended in
forming carbonic acid. On the contrary, when the hydrogen was increased, a greater
proportional quantity of oxygen went to the formation of water.
