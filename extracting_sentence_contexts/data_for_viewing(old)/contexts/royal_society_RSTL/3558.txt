seeming to forget entirely, that Dr. Wes maintains expressly, that wind and sbade
are alike obstacles to radiation ; and that consequently a body of moving water 50
deep as to be impervious to light, and particularly when covered, as in the case of the
Neva, with a sheet of ice three feet thick, and as much more snow, must present an
insurmountable obstacle to the radiation of heat from the bottom of the river,‚Äù

Now, in the first place, with respect to shade; I was 80 far from forgetting that it
is an obstacle to radiation, that, on the contrary, in my observations in 1835, I had
shown by very many instances, that shade had prevented the formation of ground
gru, just as it prevents dew. Whereyer shade intervened to prevent radiation from
the bottoms of the rivers Don and Leochal, there no ground ice was formed ; while
the unshaded parts of the bottoms were coated with it. My explanation thus mainly
rested upon the fact that shade prevents radiation. In the next place, with respect
to wind; the writer in the Cyclopzedia himself forgets the difference of the statical
conditions of air and water in connexion with temperature. Air becomes heayier by
diminution of temperature. Water under 39? Fans, becomes lighter by diminution

of temperature. During wind, on the land, the cold air at the surface of the earth
is continually mixed with, or displaced by, the warmer air above; and by this pro-
cess both the earth and air in contact with it are prevented from being reduced to a
very low temperature by radiation. But in a body of moving water, whose tempe-
rature is under 39?, the eddies of the current throw down the coldest parts, which
