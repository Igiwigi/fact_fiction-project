equations which express two oth theorems regarding the specific heats of any
fluid whatever, first publishedF in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
March 1851. The former (4) is the extension of a theorem on the specific heats of
gases originally given by Carxory, while the latter (5) is inconsistent with one of his
fundamental assumptions, and expresses in fact the opposed axiom of the Dynamical
Theory. The use of the absolute thermo-dynamic system of thermometry proposed
in Section IV., according to which the definition of temperature is
