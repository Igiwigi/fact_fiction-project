Proof of proposition 2.2. The proof of proposition 2.2 is classical, except for the new term u(x, ft) —
u(—x,t). In fact, Barles and Imbert give a related definition of viscosity solution and established
stability results for a general class of non-local operators in [9]. Here, we simply check this
property, proving that if for all functions v € F,, we have

v(x, f) — v(x, £) — w(x, 6) <0 (2.1)

in the viscosity sense, then u still satisfies (2.1) (the proof being similar for i). Indeed, by definition of u, there exists (Ye,Se,e) > (x,t,0) and ve €F, such that u(x,t)=
lime. ve(Ye, Se) aNd ve(Ye, Se) — Ve(—Ye, Se) — W(Ye, Se) < 0.
