however, taken place in the initial, and not extra-cambially, and it persists through all
subsequent sections. This new cell layer is now the peripheral layer of the ray, which
has increased in width, and it replaces the former peripheral layer, the cells of which
are undergoing further subdivisions, and becoming smaller. The newly added cells
are at first large, but they become smaller through the formation of transverse walls,
and ultimately assume much the same proportions as the cell row to which they were
added. Meanwhile, similar changes have been taking place in the lower part of the
ray. The shaded peripheral cells in the lower part of the ray have undergone sub-
division, and in section 307 a new initial is added to the ray in the lower storey,
and at the same time another initial is added to the opposite side of the ray. In
section 222 the lower part of the ray appears much narrower than it was in
section 144, which may possibly correspond with the change from erect to pro-
cumbent cells. It is not possible to check this fact, as it would necessitate being
able to see both radial and tangential sections of the same cell, but the slight shrinkage
in tangential area that is frequently seen in the initials at this stage of ray growth is
probably associated with extra-cambial radial elongation of the ray cells. It is quite
distinct from the swelling and shrinking in ray width that commonly occurs when a
ray is passing through a parenchymatous or fibrous layer in the wood respectively. The
decrease in width mentioned here occurs irrespective of the tissue which surrounds the
ray at the time. It will be seen that in both section 144 and section 222 the cells
adjacent to the ray are fibrous.

Fig. 19 shows a more general view of ray growth in the same wood. The sections
from which the drawings in fig. 18 were made occurred between fig. 19 (3) and (4)
in this figure. The whole range of diagrams in this figure represents sections at
