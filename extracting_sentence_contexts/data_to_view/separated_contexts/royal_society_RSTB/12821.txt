From a
biomedical perspective, such work has aimed to develop inter-
ventions that slow the pace of age-related declines and thus treat
or prevent a host of diseases and ailments associated with older
individuals—a central goal of geroscience. Short-lived labora-
tory organisms are limited, however, in their translational
impact owing to inherent biological dissimilarity stemming
from their wide evolutionary distance from humans. In fact,
therapeutics developed based on preclinical studies of short-
lived laboratory organisms encounter a high failure rate in clini-
cal trials, both in the ageing domain [2] and otherwise [3]. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are our closest living relatives
and are thus natural intermediate models bridging the
gap between rodents and clinical human trials. Owing to
their phylogenetic affinity, NHPs tend to resemble humans in
myriad anatomical, physiological, behavioural and life-history
traits.
