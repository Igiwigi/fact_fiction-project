Coorer's Observations on the

duced the destruction of the- membrane continues; 'should a
fungus arise on the periosteum of the tympanum,' or exfoliation
of the bones forming this cavity occur, and more especially should
the stapes separate, very considerable deafness will be the con-
sequence. When the membrane of one ear only is destroyed, a greater
degree of deafness takes place in that ear, than would happen
in either, were the membrane destroyed in both. This, as I
stated in my former Paper, probably arises from the disuse into
which the imperfect ear falls, from its being less quick in its
powers than the other; a conjecture which seems to be veritied
by the following fact. Mr. G , a merchant in the city, lost, at an early period
of life, 80 great a portion of the'membrana tympani of the le≈øt
ear, that no more of it remained- than appears in Fig. g; and,
as he heard somewhat better with his right-ear than with his
left, he was little in the habit of employing the latter, and con-
sidered himself at length as alinost totally deaf in it,, Becoming,
however, in the month of December last; deaf in- the right ear,
and being obliged, in consequence, to employ - the.,other, he
found that the left ear was by no means deprived of its powers;
although he could force air from his mouth through that ear,
and, if he suddenly thrust his finger into the meatus, the air was
heard to rush through his nostrils,

I feel a hope that the foregoing observations will, tend to
something more than merely to gratify curiosity, and will be
productive, in the end, of lasting benefit ; for they have induced
me, in one species of deafness, to try the effect of an operation,
which has, in several instances, proved successful.
