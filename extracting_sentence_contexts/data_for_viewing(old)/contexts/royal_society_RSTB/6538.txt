etc., have given excellent reviews on the pleuropodia of insects, and among more
recent works may be mentioned Hussry’s (1926) bulky but uncritical review. I shall
therefore give only a brief summary of our present knowledge regarding these
interesting structures. Since RaTHKE (1844) first discovered them in Gryllotalpa,
they have been recorded in eleven different orders. Among the Apterygota, the
ventral tube of the Collembola and the first abdominal appendages of the Protura
are probably homologous with them. Pleuropodia are best developed in the more
primitive Pterygotes like the Orthoptera, in all of which they are present. Among
the more specialized insects (Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera)
they are feebly developed, and their distribution is irregular. They are absent in
the Diptera. Their mode of origin is always similar and they arise, like the other
body appendages with which they are homologous, as evaginations of the body-wall.
But, notwithstanding the fact that they are temporary embryonic structures, their
development and final fate apparently varies considerably in different insects.
Thus, in the Orthoptera, they shrivel up during late embryonic life and are probably
(certainly in the Acrididae) mechanically cast off during hatching. A similar fate
has been recorded in some of the Coleoptera (Melolontha vulgaris, GRABER, 1888, 6) ;
the Cicadidae (WHEELER, 1890; Hrymons, 1899); Blatta (WHEELER, 1890) ; and
some of the Hymenoptera (Hylotoma, GRaBer, 1890 ; and ants, TANQUARAY, 1913).
In others it becomes partly [(Dpytiscus, Korcueit, 1912; Bruncx, 1914) ; and
(Tenebrio molitor, CARRERE, 1891)] or wholly [(Coleoptera (Doncaia, HirscHLer,
1909, a) ; Hemiptera-Heteroptera (Naucoris, Heymons, 1896 ; Belostoma, WHEELER,
