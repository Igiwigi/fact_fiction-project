exhibit the unrestrained influence of its posterior canals. The facts that its compen-
satory reactions to slow tilt are absent, that during stationary posture it may lean
markedly to one or other side and that, when dropped from a height, it fails to land
properly, are more direct indications of the loss of its gravity receptors. Through the frogâ€™s serviceableness for the study of posterior canal function the
following knowledge is gained. The posterior canals, whether inverted or in their
normal orientation, can be stimulated by adequate angular acceleration about a
vertical axis, the right canal being stimulated when the animal is rotated towards
its right, and vice versa.
