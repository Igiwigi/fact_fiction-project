have (A) <0. Here, dess and A(A), B(A),C(A), D(A): C \ cess > C are explicitly known and depend on
the system parameters and the impurities.

We refer to §3 for the details regarding Vig Ut + and the matrix \/(A). Observe that, as
for the scalar case, 4=0 being an eigenvalue is again related to the solution (vj, vz) of (1.8)
being degenerate. It is now straightforward to derive conditions on the system parameters and
impurities such that a pinned pulse solution of (1.7) can undergo a Hopf bifurcation, see §3b(i).

We end the manuscript with a discussion and outlook of future projects related to systems
with strong localized impurities.

Remark 1.4. In principle, we could have used an Evans function framework ([29], e.g.) to obtain
the stability results of theorems 1.2 and 1.3. In fact, (1.6) and (1.9) can be directly related to a
condition of the form €(4) =0, where €(A) is a—remarkably simple and very explicit—Evans-
function associated with the spectral stability problem. We decided not to pursue this direction
for the brevity and readability of the manuscript.

Remark 1.5. In this manuscript, we use the convention that it(./x) > 0 for x € C \ (—0o, 0].

Remark 1.6. While theorem 1.3 only entails pinned 1-pulse solutions of (1.7) (i.e. (1.3) with
N=2 and n=1), the geometrical singular perturbation framework presented in this manuscript
can also be used to study linear systems of RDEs of arbitrary size and with an arbitrary number
of impurities, i.e. (1.3) for arbitrary N and n. However, for algebraic simplicity and brevity, we
decided to focus on only the scalar case (i.e. N = 1) and the two-component case with one impurity
(ie. N=2 and n=1) in this manuscript.
