per second for P and 4'01 km. per second for 8. These are substantially higher than the values found for surface rocks, and emphasize
the fact that in using the term surface we do, on this view, imagine the heterogeneous
crust of the earth replaced by a purely ideal surface at which the speeds acquire the
values stated. The justification of this assumption and the determination of the true
effect of the crust will have to be undertaken before long. We have now to consider the magnitude of the ground movement experienced
when a wave is incident on the surface.
