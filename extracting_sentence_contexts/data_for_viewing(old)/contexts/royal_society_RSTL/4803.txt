plex form of a Pike's vertebra and its more simply constructed carpal bone, the two
are developed according to a common plan. Whilst the distinetion between chondri-
form and membraniform bone is maintained in both cases, the two tissues invariably
bear the same relation to each other.

Before leaving this portion of the subject, the close resemblance between the
general direction of the divergent segments of membraniform bone in the vertebra of
the Pike, fig. 41, and those of chondriform bone in the corresponding portion of the
Thornback Ray, fig. 28, deserves a passing notice. The chief difference arises from the
circumstance, that, whilst in the latter the two inferior plates (28 7) are separated by
an intervening prolongation of cartilage, in the former (41 d) they have been united
from the first. The substitution of the one kind of bone for the other in the two
cases is an interesting fact.

After baving thus acquainted myself with the structure and growth of the bones
of the Pike, I pursued the same plan in reference to the bones of a number of other
osseous fish, into the permanent composition of whose skeletons a much smaller

amount of cartilage enters.
In the skeleton of the Perch (Perca fluviatilis, L1NN.), 1 found that nearly all the
bones, excepting the vertebre, exhibited similar conditions to those existing in the
Pike, modified only by the greater extent to which the cancelli have encroached upon.
the respective cartilages. The epitympanic bone taken from each of these fish pre-
sents a good illustration of the difference between them ; on viewing their external
aspect, the two hones appear to be very similar; but on making vertical sections of
