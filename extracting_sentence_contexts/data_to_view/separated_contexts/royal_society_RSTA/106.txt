PARTS I AND II d 331 The method can only be used effectively if a boundary condition for the transform equation
can be found, corresponding to the condition for 0¢/dy over the surface of the aerofoil. In

so that the value of 04/y must be known for a given x and y for all values of z before 0¢/dy
can be found. This at once enables us to distinguish the problems which can be approached
directly by this operational method. In the first place all problems with boundary conditions
of the symmetrical type can be so approached, for in these cases it is clear that, except over
the plan of the aerofoil, 0¢/dy is zero everywhere over the plane y = 0.
