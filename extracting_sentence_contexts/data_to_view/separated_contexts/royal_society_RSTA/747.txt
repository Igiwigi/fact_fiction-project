Now the three steps (a),
(6), and (c) recommended to the practical statistician represent a random experiment
which may result in a correct statement concerning the value of 0,. This result may
be denoted by A, and if the calculations leading to the functions @ (E) and 6 (E) are
correct, the probability of A will be constantly equal to «. In fact, the statement (c)
concerning the value of 6, is only correct when 6 (E) falls below 0,° and 6 (E),

Sabove 6,°, and the probability of this is equal to« whenever 0,°is the true value of 6.
alt follows that if the practical statistician applies permanently the rules (a), (6) and
Bc) for purposes of estimating the value of the parameter 0,, in the long run he will be
correct in about 99 per cent. of all cases. & It is important to notice that for this conclusion to be true, it is not necessary that
Sthe problem of estimation should be the same in all the cases.
