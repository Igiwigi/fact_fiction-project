used a mouse strain in which only ENCCs express the cal-
cium indicator, they could not observe the calcium activity
in smooth muscle. I did not observe calcium transients in
enteric neurons. The Fluo4-AM fluorescence signal tended
to be saturated in enteric neurons (figure 1b,c), which could
have obscured readout of the calcium activity in these cells.
However, in ganglia where the signal was not saturated
(e.g. ganglia at 9.30, 10 and 11 o'clock in electronic sup-
plementary material, video $3) or just partially saturated
(e.g. ganglia at 8.30 oâ€™clock in electronic supplementary
material, video S3), I did not observe any fluorescence spikes.

The fact that gap-junctional communication is required
for contractile wave propagation/generation is consistent
with previous work on Ca** communication in smooth
muscle cell cultures [14,32] and adult gut motility [33].
Other small molecules that diffuse through gap junctions,
like ATP, may play a role in the propagation of the calcium
wave [31,34]. The blood vessels of a connexin-40 deficient
mouse mutant have been shown to exhibit peristalsis-like
activity [35]. This suggests that a gut and a vein may differ,
from the point of view of their dynamics, only by the
amount of gap-junctional coupling between adjacent circular
smooth cells: high coupling results in synchronized contrac-
tion over long distances, i.e. vasomotion, whereas low
