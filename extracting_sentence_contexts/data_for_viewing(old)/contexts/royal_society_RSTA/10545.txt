The mixtures most affected by the position of the spark among those experimented

_ the detonation is set up when electrolytic gas is diluted, confirms my previous

experiments on the rate of explosion of these mixtures.

of the tube, as in fig. 61, the explosion exhibits intense retonation-waves followed by
rapid cooling; but when the sound-waves are first reflected from the ends of the
