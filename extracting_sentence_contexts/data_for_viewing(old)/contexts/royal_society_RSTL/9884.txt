path is about 4 inches long, snfficient to strike across the exhausted tube. But it has
been shown by many experimentalists that at exhaustions 80 low that the contents
of the tube are certainly not in the ultra gaseous state, the phenomena of phospho-
rescence can be observed. This cireumstance had not escaped my notice. In my first

Molecules” * I drew attention to the fact that a molecular ray producing green
phosphorescence can be projected 102 millims. from the negative pole when the
pressure is as high as 0'324 millim. or 427 M. In this case the mean free path of the
molecules is 0'23 millim. ; and it is not surprising that with more powerful induction
discharges, and with special appliances for exalting the faint action to be detected, the
above-named phenomena can be produced at till higher pressures.

719. It must be remembered that we know nothing of the absolute length of the free
path or the absolute velocity of a molecule ; these may vary almost from zero to infinity.
We must limit ourselves to the mean free path and the mean velocity, and all that
these experiments show is that a few molecules can travel more than a hundred times
the mean free path, and with perhaps a corresponding increase over the mean velocity,
before they are stopped by collisions. With weak electrical power, the special phos-
