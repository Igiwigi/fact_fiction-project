1. LEST the title of this communication should induce an expectation of its con-
taining any regular and systematic series of researches developing definite laws, or
pointing to any distinct theory of photographic action, it may be as well to commence
it by stating its pretensions to be of a much lower kind, its object being simply to
place on record a number of insulated facts and observations respecting the relations
both of white light and of the differently refrangible rays to various chemical agents,
which have offered themselyes to my notice in the course of photographic experi-
ments originating in the announcement of M. Dacuerre's discovery. The facts
themselves, in the present state of our knowledge, will, I believe, be found by no
means devoid of interest, and may lead, in the hands of others more favourably situ-
ated for snch researches, and, I may add, in a better climate than ours, to inquiries
of the utmost interest.
