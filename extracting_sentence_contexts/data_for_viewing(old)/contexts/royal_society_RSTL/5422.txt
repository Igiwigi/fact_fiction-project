are quite independent of such analogy, and are true whatever may be the type of the
rippled surface at the front of the waves.

I may mention, by the way, that I think it arises from the existence of such a
rippled front of wave, that the fringes of interference, which border the margin of a
small aperture, upon which a conical pencil of light is incident, are found to vanish
when the aperture exceeds a very small limit ; in fact, when the aperture is enlarged
s0 as to admit a comparatively large chequered surface of the wave's front, the several
portions destroy each other's effect by interference ; but when the aperture is 80 small
as only to admit a portion which presents a uniformity of phase, then the fringes
present themselves and admit of the usual explanation. The hyporhesis of a rippled
front is therefore not only the most probable when we consider the origin of the
beam, but it accounts simultaneously for the non-spread of the wave and the disap-
pearance of the fringes when the aperture is large.

It may perhaps be urged in fayour of the hypothesis of uniformity of phase in the
