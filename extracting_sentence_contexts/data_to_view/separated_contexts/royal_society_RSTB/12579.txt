Finally, in the case of too high
affinity of both Cxcr4/Cxcr7 to SDFla, ie. of both af and
aS, cells almost completely sequester the chemical located
in their sensory regions, thereby leading to a steeper self-
generated gradient underlying the primordium which increases
primordium elongation. Referring again to figure 5, we can further note that a
decrease in both a%* and asf, does not affect the placode
elongation before migration (left panel), however, it results
in an excessive slowdown of primordium migration (right
panel). An extremely low affinity of SDFla receptors to
their ligand in fact implements an almost negligible internal-
ization of the local chemical by cells, quantified by Ws" ~ 1. It therefore prevents the emergence of the self-generated local
gradient of SDFla underlying primordium locomotion
despite the polarized expression of Cxcr4/Cxcr7 along the
placode. Conversely, in all the other cases, anomalies in
the initial elongation of the primordium result in an
abnormal locomotion of the placode.
