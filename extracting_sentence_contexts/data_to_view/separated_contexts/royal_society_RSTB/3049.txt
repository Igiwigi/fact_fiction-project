The older outgrowths
often eventually give rise to irregular perforations in the leaf. In Gmelina hystric and Cassia floribunda the individual outgrowths were very
small, but so numerous as to give to the surface of the leaves a warty roughness,
especially near the veins. Owing to the large number and small size of these outgrowths, and to the fact
that they were all on one side of the leaf, they caused the lamina to curl, or even to
roll up, as if they had been attacked by a parasitic animal or leaf-rolling caterpillar. In other respects the leaves did not appear to be injuriously affected. The species of Eucalyptus had rather small and somewhat irregularly disposed
outgrowths, which, when old, give rise to brown, slightly raised projections on the
leaves.
