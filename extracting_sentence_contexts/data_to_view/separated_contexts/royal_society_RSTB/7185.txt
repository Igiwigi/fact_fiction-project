Thus making this comparison we have 9 successes out of 15 as against 40 out of 51, for
which y?=2-16, P=0-15. The explanation of these results seems reasonably clear. It appears from experiments IV, 3 and IV, 5 that splenic and thyroid grafts from the
same donor are not intrinsically incompatible, i.e. they are able to survive side by side
without either affecting the other adversely, and the low survival rate of the thyroid grafts
in experiment IV, 4 must therefore be related to the fact that in this experiment the
thyroid and splenic grafts were from different donors, the former being a homograft and
the latter an autograft. The precise mechanism involved has not been established but
there would seem to be three possibilities, viz. that the splenic autograft functioned as
a source of lymphocytes and possibly other cells directly inimical to the thyroid homograft,
as a local source of antibodies or in both capacities.
