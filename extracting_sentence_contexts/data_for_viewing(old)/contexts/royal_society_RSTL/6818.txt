S that @(m, 2, p) must be symmetrical in regard to the curves m, 2, and p, we may write
S& @(m, n, p)=&mnp+B(Mnp+Nmp+Pmn)+y(mNP+1nMP+pMN)+3MNP,

and then

= NT(m, 2, p)=4S*—S+@(m, n, Þ)

S =2mnp(mup—1)+@(m, 1, p).

© But for p=1 this should reduce itself to the known value of N'T(1, m, n); this gives
Ss a=0, Þ=1, y=0; we in fact haye, as will be shown, post, Art. 55, =0; and hence

= NT(m, n, p)=4S$*—S +(Mnp+Nmp+Pmn)
z =2[mnpÞP+(Mnp+Nmp+Pmn).
EZ 52. Next, if om?) stand for @(m?, n), then @(m, m') stands for g(m, m', n), which is
* =Nmm+n(mM'+11M), and the equation is
Y e(m+m)—p(m?)—g(m?)=Nmm'+n(mM-+mM).

5 A particular solution is @(m?)=Z[m]N+2mM, and we haye therefore
a e(m?, n)=3[mPN+nmM+om+/3M ;

or obserying that @(12?, 2) considered as a function of 2, satisfies the equation
e(n+n')=8(n)+8(7'),
