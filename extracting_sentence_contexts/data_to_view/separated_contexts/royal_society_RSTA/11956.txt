There can be little doubt that these are due to impurities, principally
iron. With the exception of three the lines are all very faint. 'The measurements,
which are only approximations, owing to the indefinite character of the lines, are the

uncondensed spark yields a very beautiful band spectrum. The lines of silicon have
