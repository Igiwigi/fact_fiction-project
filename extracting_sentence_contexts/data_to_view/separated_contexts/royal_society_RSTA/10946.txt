or replacing « by the original Q,

U A = os !

(AB) = 41+ QU +8 + 8)tV1 = 258: = GL = 3h = a) } - + (7).
§ 24. The question arises, what is the meaning of the alternative sign in the

expression for (AB)? One of the values given is, as a matter of fact, only a numerical

solution, and is really impossible, so that the value of (AB) is not indeterminate. We
may write (7) in the form

(AB) |
(A) — rat + 4)

{1 + Q(1+5,; +4) + /1 — 2Qs,\8, — Q2(1 — 32 — a} (8),

and “ay must be less than 1 and greater than 0. The product of the two values given by the 4+ and — sign is
(1+ Q@ +)
2Q(1 + 5)

If Q be negative this is negative, and so the lower value is negative or impossible ;
we must consequently use the + sign.
