Still it may be aid that, notwithstanding all these points of resemblance, the
difference between Peneroplis and Dendritina is clearly marked out by the difference in
the modes of communication between the chambers of the two types; and that such a
difference is sufficiently important to constitute a valid generic character. I freely admit
that this would be the case, if the difference were constantly to present itself between
all the individuals of the same type, as it does between their characteristic examples
(Plate I. figs. 1, 2); but the fact is far otherwise. We have seen that among those
which would be unhesitatingly ranked under the designation Peneroplis, there is not
only a tendency to multiplication of the rows of separate pores, but also an occasional
fusion of two or more pores, 80 as to form a single large pore of irregular shape. On
the other hand, among the unquestioned Dendritine, we observe not merely that the
form of the single large dendritic aperture is extremely variable, but that it is frequently
s0 simple as to suggest the idea of having been formed by the coalescence of a linear
Series of pores.
