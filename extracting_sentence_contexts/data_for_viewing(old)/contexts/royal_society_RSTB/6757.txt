material. The first lava was followed by others which built up the great pile of basalts
(fig. 28, Plate 29) which now form the walls of Sirima Gorge.

The earth movements just after the end of the Middle Pleistocene fractured the
Barrier Range, and gave rise in the Sirima region to the scarps that fall away westward
to the lake. In the section faults 1 and 2 are inferred from the corresponding scarps.
Unfortunately they were not actually visible in the walls of the gorge because small
streams have cut along their strike. On the other hand, faults 3 and 4, though relatively
small with a throw of only about 10 ft., are clearly visible. That the small block between
these faults has been dropped down is shown by the position of the prominent band of
red tuff which occurs a few feet above the lake bed. The latter ends against the western
fault with a slight downward curve showing that here at least the movement of the
block between faults 3 and 4 was in a normal direction. Nevertheless, the curious fact
appears that the red bed is higher on the western side of the two faults than it is on the
east. This means that the east end of the fault block between faults 2 and 3 has been
elevated relative to the lavas east of fault 4. It follows that unless there is another fault
cutting the lavas east of fault 4 (and none was observed), the block between faults 2
