models lead to kinetic equations in the limit of large number of particles as derived in [54].
Some of the patterns that the simulation of these IBMs produce are the so-called flock patterns.
The flock solution corresponds to the case in which all particles move with the same velocity
vector vj = vg with |vg|? =a@/f while the positions X; € RN, i=1,...,M satisfy that the forces are
balanced, that is,

Yo VW = 8) =0.
iAi

The flocking solution corresponds then to the translational movement of the shape formed
by the positions &;€RN,i=1,...,M with velocity vector vg. When the number of particles
tends to infinity, these discrete flocking solutions are approximating continuum density profiles
p satisfying VW * 6 =0 at least over the support of /. In fact, the connection between the
second-order microscopic model (4.1) and the first-order model given by

dx;
a7 =- » VW(x; — xj) (4.2)
j#i

has been clarified in [55,56]. In these articles, it is shown that the stability of flock solutions for (4.1)
is equivalent to the stability of the spatial shape of the flock as steady solution to (4.2). A similar
result at the level of the continuum equations is lacking. However, it makes sense to find all the
spatial configurations leading to flocks or equivalently all stationary solutions to (4.2). Among
those, the most stable configurations are of special interest, in view of the connection through the
stability of the solutions at least at the discrete level. The system (4.2) has a natural energy that is
