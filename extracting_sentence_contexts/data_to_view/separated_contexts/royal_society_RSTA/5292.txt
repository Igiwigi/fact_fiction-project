A lower value of Ngigt will necessarily make digital
computation less robust and more probabilistic as we discuss in §3¢. Probabilistic ‘dithering’
converts digital black-and-white pixels in an image to greyscale pixels. Thus probabilistic digital
operation will have similarities to noisy analog operation, which is in fact noisy precisely because
many probabilistic digital Poisson events constitute its value [1,11].

Figure 2b shows that the costs of analog addition in total protein molecular number are also : es
significantly less than those of digital addition even at nearly 8 bits of precision. At this crossover 3
precision, a staggering 1 million protein molecules are involved in addition.
