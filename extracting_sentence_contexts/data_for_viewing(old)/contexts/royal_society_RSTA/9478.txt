Bor +226y. The observed secular change, +25°9 x 11 or +285y, exceeds this by only
509% suggesting the trifling instrumental drift of —5'4y per annum.
3 In the case of V, including the incomplete amongst the ordinary days, we have 3669
Fes these with an average n.c. change of —0°420y, giving a total of —1541y. The 209
6 disturbed days in the original list- contributed +209 x 2°7y or +564y, while the 139
© disturbed days on the subsidiary list contributed +304y. Thus for the whole 4017
days we have a balance of (—1541+564+304)y or —673y, as compared with a true
secular change of —22°6 x 11ly or —249y. This suggests an instrumental drift at the
average rate of —39y per annum, ~

The chief importance perhaps of these calculations is the light they throw on the
trustworthiness of the magnetic curves and measurements. It is unnecessary to
emphasise the fact that when instrumental creep is large it is a source of very

considerable uncertainty. The results obtained above are not put forward as exact

measures of the instrumental creep, but only as showing its order of magnitude and

the general fact that it was small. Most of the quiet day curves were measured
