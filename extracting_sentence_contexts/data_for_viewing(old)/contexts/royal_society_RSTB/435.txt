Beginning with this last, we mean that the same movement of symmetrical parts
of both sides of the body is represented in one point of the cortex of both hemi-
spheres, 7.¢., that excitation of such a point evokes simultaneous and identical move-
ment in the same part of both sides of the body.

In attempting to classify “ bilateral movements
that movements such as conjugate deviation of the eyes are not, strictly speaking,
examples of bilateral representation. For while it is true both eyeballs move, never-
theless one is rotated out, the other rotated in, and since this conjugate deviation
occurs as the result of a single idea, the movement of both eyeballs really corresponds
to that of one limb, and this is more especially the case since, as just said, the
muscles employed on each side are different. A final confirmation of this view lies
in the fact that excitation of one hemisphere produces conjugate deviation in one
direction only, while excitation of the other evokes an exactly opposite movement.
