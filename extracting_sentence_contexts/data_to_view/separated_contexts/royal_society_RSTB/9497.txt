To test alternative hypotheses about the tree
of life, a supertree-based version [68] of the approximately
unbiased (AU) [69] test was used to compare the PROK-minus
supertree against the generally accepted topology for the tree of
life. The latter was obtained by modifying the tree of Ciccarelli
et al. [52], which has arguably become the most widely used refer-
ence topology for the tree of life in both textbooks and the scientific
literature, to include all and only the species considered in our
study. Given that eukaryotes are not included in our dataset, the
fact that the Ciccarelli et al. [52] tree is outdated (in that it does
not display the eocyte topology) is not a problem for our analyses. The supertree-based AU test was calculated using L.USt. [68] to
obtain input-treewise likelihood values for all gene trees under
both compared supertrees. These values were then used as input
for CONSEL [70] that was used to perform the AU test.

(g) Identification of directional Eubacteria to
Archaebacteria gene imports

All gene trees in PROK-minus that included at least one archae-
bacterium (2887 trees) were visually inspected, and the same
strategy as used by Pisani et al. [5] to identify prokaryotic out-
groups of eukaryotic genes was used to identify eubacterial
outgroups of archaebacterial genes.
