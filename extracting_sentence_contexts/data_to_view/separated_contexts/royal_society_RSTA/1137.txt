When it comes to dissipation rates, they fit a quadratic trend 13
with respect to the wavenumber [Im()/v Â« K]and they are always negative. This means that the [3
dissipation of waves is even more important when their spatial frequency k is high. This translates 78
to the fact that viscosity impacts more small vortical structures than bigger ones. :3

(c) Linear behaviour of the D209 discrete velocity Boltzmann equation

In what follows, the linear behaviour of the D2Q9-DVBE is investigated by solving the eigenvalue
problem related to the perturbed equation (A 3). Hence, it is important to understand that V
waves will be evolving in the Fourier space, instead of the D + 1 waves encountered with the
isothermal NS equations. This is because the DVBE, and a fortiori the LBM, is a set of V equations
whose linear behaviour is entirely linked to V waves.
