same, the case of a ray going through a lens in which the front and back character of
the two surfaces have been interchanged. In fact 7, and 7, have been interchanged
and the sign of the thickness Â¢, has been reversed. This leads to a negative lens, of
the same numerical power as the original positive lens, and with the same mean
curvature, but a negative thickness. Such a lens, of course, is not physically
realisable, although a part of it can be physically obtained by rotating the wedge
beyond the intersection V of the two surfaces.
