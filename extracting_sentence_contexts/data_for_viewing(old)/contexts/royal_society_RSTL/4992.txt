* THE NEW NATIONAL STANDARD OF LENGTH, AND 1TS PRINCIPAL COPIES. 695

by the theory of probable errors from the observations of each observer taken
\separately. Thus, in the comparisons of Bronze 10 with Bronze 28, there is a discord-
ance between the results obtained by Mr. SHEEPSHANKs from 142 8ets of observations,
and by Mr. WiLLIiAM SIMMs, junior, from 24 sets of observations, amounting (in ten-
millionth parts of an inch) to 198; whereas the probable errors of the two determina-
tions, deduced in the usual way from the observations of each observer separately, are
only 15 and 26. In other words, each observer has a personal equation in the micro-
8copic observation of the engraved lines. The existence of discordances of similar cha-
racter between the astronomical observations of different observers has been long since
recognized. The origin of this personal peculiarity is very obscure, but the fact seems to
EY beyond doubt. There appeared to be no proper method of treating the results but, to
ke the means of the final results of the different observers, giving equal weight to each.
E «20. The expansions of these bars corresponding to a given change of temperature
Kad been sufficiently determined in the course of the experiments; and it was then judged
Epedient, instead of stating the difference in the length of the elected bars at the same
Famperature, to infer the difference of temperature which would cause all to represent
He same length, by the application of which it would be possible to assign the specific
Zmperature at which each bar represents precisely the length of one yard. Thus it
Fas found that the length of one yard, as given by the lost Imperial Standard, is repre-
nted with no sensible uncertainty, except in the measures of the Imperial Standard
If, by the following bars, at the temperatures placed opposite to them :—
