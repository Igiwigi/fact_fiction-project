particularly in view of the growing importance of hybrid and purely organic network materials.

2. Network flexibility

The simple Maxwell analysis applied to tetrahedral networks can be evaluated by treating each
tetrahedron as a rigid object.? Each tetrahedron has 6 d.f. (rotations and translations). Each shared
vertex has three constraint equations to place the vertices of the two tetrahedra at the same point,
meaning six constraints per tetrahedron. This exact balance actually can be broken by symmetry,
leading to F > C. The simple example of connected rods in two dimensions illustrates this point
well, described in the caption to figure 2.

The role of symmetry in enabling the existence of a non-zero number of RUMs is seen by
the fact that when a network structure can exist in several phases of different symmetry it has
always been found that there are more RUMs in the higher-symmetry phases [11]. The reason for
this is illustrated in the case of the squares. If the RUM generates a phase transition to a 2 x 2
structure through rotations of the squares, where we denote the rotation angle by 6, the crystal
will necessarily undergo a strain « x —6?. Given that harmonic phonon vibrations propagate with
constant strain, it is required that d¢/060 =0. This condition is only met at 6 =0, and thus in the
distorted structure as defined by 6 40 the phonon motion necessarily involves stretching of the
squares and thus has higher frequency corresponding to the energy cost of changing the bond
length. The prediction of the number of RUMs decreasing as symmetry changes has been seen in
neutron scattering measurements of the enhancement of the low-frequency vibrational spectrum

2The Phillips-Thorpe analysis [2-5] proceeds slightly differently but with the same result. These authors consider the atoms
to be the objects and the bonds to be the constraints. For a tetrahedral network of SiO» (say), we have 9 d.f. per formula
