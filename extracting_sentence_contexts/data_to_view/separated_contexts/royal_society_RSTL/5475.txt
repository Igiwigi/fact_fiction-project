PART THE FIRST. I 1. That the temperature of an animal is raised by muscular exercise, is a fact gene-
rally admitted and proved by common experience. M. BECQUEREL having introduced
the point of a thermo-electric pile into a muscle of the human body, found an increase
of temperature during contraction which amounted to a degree Centigrade : Mr. NewPorT
also discovered a remarkable increase in the temperature of insects while in movement. M. BxcqueRtL attributed this increase of temperature in muscles during contraction to
the greater activity of sanguineous circulation which apparently takes place in a muscle
in that state.
