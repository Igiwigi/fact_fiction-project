length, whose value is given at each point (x,y, z). We have

so that X, Y, Z can be considered as the direction cosines of the normal to a minimal

surface. The specification of X, Y, Z throughout space is equivalent to giving a
family of minimal surfaces, which we shall think of as a family of rays in the optical

throughout xyz-space and independent of the variables u, v, we have in mind the
analogue of a steady progressive wave-motion.* The phase difference between L,
and L, at the same epoch is the functional
