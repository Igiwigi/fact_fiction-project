that of the opposite side, as a purely commissural gystem. This of course is in
accordance with the fact indicated by GRaTIoLEr, MEyNERT, and others, that in the
Rodentia and Carnivora, where the olfactory apparatus is largely developed, the great
bulk of fibres proceeding from the anterior commissure communicate with the olfactory
lobe; whilst in Man and Apes, where its development is 8mall, the larger portion of
the commissure is distributed backwards to the occipital and to the temporo-8phenoidal
lobes. The central olfactory fasciculus behind the anterior commissure exhibits a
notable difference in its distribution in the Rabbit and the Rat, a divergence which has
an important bearing upon the functional relationships of the olfactory lobes. Tn the
Rat, as has jusb been stated, the fasciculus passes outwards through the corpus striatum,
and immediately upon reaching its outer border divides into a brush-like head of nerve
bundles, some of which probably unite with the projection fasciculi passing through
them up to the vault, but by far the most extensive portion turns back, and runs
towards the occipital pole of the hemisphere (Plate 49, fig. 9). In the Rabbit, on the
