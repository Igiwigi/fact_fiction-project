e Another famous case was the proof of Gauf’s 10th discriminant conjecture, when
Heegner’s original paper was considered defective and all credit went to Baker and
Stark. Here is what Stark himself [22] writes in merit: ‘Recently, Baker and Stark have
independently shown that there are only 9 complex quadratic fields of class-number one.

However, in 1952 Heegner had already proved the same thing. Unfortunately his proof : =

has been regarded as incorrect or at best, incomplete. We will show here that there is in : a

fact only a very minor gap in Heegner’s proof and we will fill this gap.’ : =

e In the opposite direction, one could mention many recent events, when top journals were : =
unwilling to publish errata or retractions even in the case of bad mistakes in the published 1B

papers, which invalidated their main results, or, sometimes, initiated such retractions : =

only after the case became public through other means, see [23], for instance. 8
