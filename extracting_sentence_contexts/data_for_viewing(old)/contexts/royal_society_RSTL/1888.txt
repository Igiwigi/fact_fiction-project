AND ON THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR SHELLS. 803

Fistulana by Lamarck, a calcareous case, partly constructed of 8wch frag-,
menith of $hells or stones as may be thrown within its reach. The granite,
indeed, appears completely to resist all the dissolving powers of the Mollusca,
Thus in some structures, as the Plymouth Breakwater, for instance, in which
limestone and granite are employed together, and placed side by side, the
Patelle form their rounded holes in the former; while they do not in the
slightest degree alter the surface of the latter, except in general by elearing
from off it any calcareous substance which may have previously grown upon
it, I have one specimen beautifully illustrating this latter fact, a young Patella
having aflixed itself to the shelly base remaining from a Barnacle, in which
it has dissolved only the part beneath its foot, leaving the rest forming a ring
around its shell.

Many of the boring Mollusca, especially the Lithodomi and Petricole, cover
the hinder part of their shells with a calcareous coat, which is often of a spongy
texture, and differs from the shell in internal structure. This is probably the
dissolved part of the rock again deposited. Many also of these animals, as the
Gastrochenw, Clavagelle, and Teredines, secrete constantly, and others, as the
Lithodomi, under particular circumstances, a calcareous depoxsition, with which
they line the inner surface of their holes.
