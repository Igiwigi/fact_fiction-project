The real parts (2, — 1, — 1) are the roots of the
cubic equation (z*'—gz+2=0). The imaginary, of the
equation (z' + gz + * = 0), or the roots of the s:imilar equa-
tion of the differences of the former, viz. (2*— gz + « =0),
drawn into the (Y/ — &); and, from their addition are formed
the roots of the pure cubic (z* = 8). In constructing which, it
is material to observe, each root of the first equation is joined to
the difference of the remaining pair; but it may be remembered,
that zbree quantities whose sum is nothing, are the same when
summed in pairs, z. e. each is (in quantity) the 8um of the other
two, therefore, each difference is in fact added to the $m of
the same quantities ; and, if the question were proposed to re-

duce the equation (uz — gz + 2 —= ©) to a pure cubic, the rule

furnished by this example would be, to find the equation of
the sum of its roots in pairs, which, by the last Article, is

by the quantities formed from the addition of the roots of the
one to those of the other multiplied into the imaginary surd
(/—+). The equation last found would, however, be of the
dimension of the gth power, at least: for, the addition of each
root of the second equation to every separate root of the first,
produces a separate quantity : thus,
