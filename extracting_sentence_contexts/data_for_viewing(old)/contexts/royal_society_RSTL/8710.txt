exterior, ET - +;x <4 6 is positive root of 1-3-. FRE ae R
interior, $-- + "1; 6 vanishes, viz. the limits in the integral are ,, 0;

g must be negative, 1+g positive as before, in order that the 7-integral may not be
infinite in regard to the element #=0.

It is assumed in the proof that m and 1+g are each of them positive; but, as appears
by the second example, the theorem is true for the extreme value m=0; it does not,
however, appear that the proof can be extended to include the extreme value q=—1.
The formula seems, however, to hold good for valnes of m, q beyond the foregoing limits ;
and it would seem that the only necessary conditions are 48+g, 1+m, and 1+q+m,
each of them positive. The theorem is in fact a particular case of the following one,
