He affords no proof of having known that the chylaqueous system of fluid is governed
physiologically and chemically by laws distinct from, though not less definite than
those which regulate that of the true blood. He has accumulated no individual ob-
servations il[ustrative of the histological characters of the morphotic elements, either
of the chylaqueous fluid, or the true blood. M, QuaTReracts appears also to bave
been totally unacquainted with the interesting fact announced in this paper, that in
histological structure, the corpuscles of the chylaqueous fluid are as definite and
constant as those of the blood of the higher animals. It thus appears that, although
the views of M. QUaTREFActs and those advocated in this paper proceed for a short
distance in parallelism, they s0on diverge towards two very different destinations*.
