For fuller development of the inner ends of the mesenteries demanded corre-
sponding accommodation within the polyp and a certain modification of the form
previously assumed by the aboral body-wall in the central part of the polyp. This

. might take place in various ways, such as the formation of several instead of only
one or two basal “ pits” (this T have observed in a Jurassic genus), the continuation
of the septal invaginations into the centre of the calyx and a general deepening of
the interseptal loculi (Astreids, Fungids, etc.), the formation of a styliform columella
in the middle of the calycinal base, leaving a circular trench between it and the
septa—the said circular trench being homologous with a ring of pits or fossule
(Stylinides, Cyathaxonia, Turbinolia, ete.). Whereas many Paleozoic coral species belonging to Cyathophyllum, Acervularia,
Phallipsastrea, and other genera of the Cyathophylloidea were precocious in the
matter of radial symmetry and its correlated features, there was considerable
tardiness on the part of the Zaphrentoid genera, Only this can explain the fact that
in the Jurassic coral fauna of Europe a very large number of bilaterally symmetrical
genera are present whose ealycinal structures have the characteristic features,
macroscopic and microscopic, of Zaphrentis and allied genera. The main advance
shown by these Jurassic genera is the loss of pinnate development of the septa,
although the septa strictly retain in most cases a definite arrangement with regard

to “main” and “ alar”

septa, A fossula is sometimes present, more often absent. Again colonial habit has largely been gained, each corallite, however, having a
distinct rugose epitheca of its own which invaginates inward and upwards to give
rise to septal structures.
