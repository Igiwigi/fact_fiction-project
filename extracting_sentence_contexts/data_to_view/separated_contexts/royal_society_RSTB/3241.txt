The resin-canals alternate with the veins, but occasionally
a canal is seen underneath a vascular bundle. The leaves of the seedling differ
from those on the older shoots chiefly in their softer texture, due to the comparatively
feeble development of mechanical elements. We noticed that the transfusion tracheids
in the apical region of a young leaf constituted nearly the whole of the xylem, a fact
in accordance with BERNARDâ€™s description of this tissue in the leaves of Agathis. The mature type of leaf is characterised by numerous short and broad ribs of
hypodermal fibres below the upper epidermis comparable to those in leaves of
Cordaites. The mesophyll in some leaves is almost uniform in structure, while
in others it exhibits a differentiation into palisade and loose parenchyma, the former
tissue being represented on both faces.
