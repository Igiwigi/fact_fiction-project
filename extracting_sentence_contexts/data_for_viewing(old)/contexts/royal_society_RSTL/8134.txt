and the lowest Mammal. On the Mammalian side of this empty space we must 8uppose
a form which should be general to the whole class; I need not say that no 8wch form
is extant, The extraordinary and unlooked-for morphological elevation of the adult
<« Anuran,” an eleyation in yery important structures attained by no Reptile or Bird,
and which brings it almost into contact at certain points with the Mammalian margin,
is very suggestive. Such a discoyery sheds a certain but feeble light, useful though
faint.

The fact that the higher Batrachia go on metamorphosing until seyeral of their
structures are 80 perfect as to require but the gentlest modification to make them fit for
the Mammal, does not require one to suppose that the 'Toad and the Frog lie in the
direct route from the Tchthyic to the Mammalian types. That such power of variation,
such aptitude for transformation exists in these essential but metamorphic Fish, suggests
the probability that some of the very earliest of the Amphibia, filial perhaps to forms
far lower than the Lamprey, did not stop at the last metamorphic stage of an Anuran,
but changed till further, and thus laid the foundation of the higher classes.

The formation of the amnion and the allantois in the early stage of an embryo may
have been a &udden variation; when once developed, however, the essentials were present.
for the development of a Reptile (* Sauropsidan”) as distinet from a mere Amphibian.
