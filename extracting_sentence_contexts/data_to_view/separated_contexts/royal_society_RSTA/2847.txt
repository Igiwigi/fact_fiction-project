The truncated fractional
power-law form of the creep compliance in (3.1) corresponds to a three-parameter fractional linear
solid [15].

4. Viscoelastic fictitious crack model

To analyse sea ice fracture tests in the presence of coupled creep and fracture deformations, it
proved necessary to first develop a viscoelastic-fictitious-crack-model (VFCM) [16]. The basis for
this approach is the fictitious crack model (FCM) [17] as well as the creep compliance function
in (3.1). In its unloaded state, the fabricated (sawn) crack may be viewed as having a well-defined
crack tip with a point-sized process zone. On being loaded, this through-the-thickness crack has =
no well-defined traction-free crack tip (figure 2a) but rather may be viewed as a traction-free 15
crack attached to a fracture process zone, within which the localized micro-cracking, bridging and : -
micro-crack coalescence accumulates at the same time as (normal to the crack plane) the tensile ae
closing stress decreases (while the separation of two adjacent points on either side of the crack :
plane increases).
