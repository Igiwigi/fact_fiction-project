148 MR. W. CROOKES ON THE ILLUMINATION OF LINES OF

tube ; if, however, e or F is one pole and c the other, the luminosity only occupies the
upper part of the tube, and if e and f are the two poles, the light keeps close to
the top. The whole appearance shows that both poles are at work in producing the

phenomena.
526. When, however, the vacuum is sufficiently high for the dark 8pace round the
negative pole to have s8wollen out to the dimensions of the tube, there is little dif-
ference in the phenomena of green phosphorescence and projection of the shadow of c
on b, whichever is the positive pole, provided e be made the negative. The appearances
are almost the ame, and the shadows projected from the negative pole e are just as
harp and intense whether T make F or Ã¾ the positive pole. The positive pole, in fact,
seems to have little or nothing to do with the phenomena. (519, 527, 549.)

527. The best and sharpest shadows are cast by the flat disks e and hk. The shadows
thrown by the pointed poles F and g are faint and undecided in outline. An aluminium
ring scarcely makes any shadow ; a spherical pole, owing to the rays from it diverging
