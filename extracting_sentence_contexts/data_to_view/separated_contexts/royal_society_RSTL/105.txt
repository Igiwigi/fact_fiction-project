wanted the Third. DEFINITION: |

The Angle called by Kepler the AnomaliaEccentri, |
is a fiftitious Angle in the Elliptic Orbit of a Planet; *
being analogous to the Area deſcribed by a Line frony ©
the Centre of the Orbit, and revolving with the *
Planet from» the Line of Apſides; in like: manner as ©
the Mean Anomaly is a fictitious Angle, analogous ta
the Arcadeſcribed by a Line from the Focus.

Otherwiſe, if C be the Centre, S the Focus of an
Elliptic Orbit deſcribed on the tranſverſe Axis AP,
and the Area NSP in the Circle be. taken in Pro-
portion to the whole, as the Area deſcribed-in the
Ellipſis about the Focus, to the whole ; Then is the. Arch of the Circle PN, or the Angle N CP, that:
which Kepler calls the Anomalia Eccentri.
