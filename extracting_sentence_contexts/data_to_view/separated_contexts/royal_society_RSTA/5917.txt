This is a direct application of theorem 2.12 on the symmetries 9; = u and 97 =. a

Remark 3.4. The statement in this corollary is well known. In fact, a is the Bernoulli function,
equal to a=p+ zu -u, where p is the pressure field. Moreover, when V x u=ku for some
keR this corollary does not apply, in the sense that a becomes a numerical constant. In this
case, the velocity field is known as a Beltrami field [28,29].
