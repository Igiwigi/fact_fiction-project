healed up to admit of the re-establighment of physiological continuity between the
previously discontinuous parts of the strip—contractile waves now coursing all the way
along from end to end of the strip. At this stage it might be observed that as each
wave of contraction passed across the line of incision, the parts of that line which had
not yet adhered together gaped away from each other. But the healing process rapidly
continuing, adherence rapidly extended along the whole line of incision, and generally
in from twelve to twenty hours this adherence was complete. By observing carefully,
however, there might still be seen a cicatrix marking out the line of previous incision,
though in the course of next, day this too disappeared, leaving no trace behind of the
previous injury.

It is an unfortunate circumstance that I found it impossible to procure any micro-
scopical preparations of these lines of incision, owing to the fact that all the hardening
and staining reagents immediately caused the newly-healed muscle-fibres again to
rupture. After many trials T was therefore at last obliged to satisfy myself with an
examination of the newly-healed tissues in their fresh state. I was particularly
anxious to ascertain whether the physiological continuity which was thus re-established
through narrow necks of tissue depended for its re-establishment upon the regeneration
