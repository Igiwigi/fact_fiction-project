This opinion is founded on the fact pointed out by him,—
and about the same time by myself,—that at least a large proportion of both roots,
after passing through various parts of the grey snbstance, pursue a longitudinal
course within the white columns. He further maintains, in opposition to VOLKMANN,
that these columns do really increase progressively towards the brain, and that the
nerve-fibres of which they mainly consist, do not recover their original diameter
which they lost in passing through the grey substance. From these facts he calcu-
lates that the white columns are sufficiently large in the cervical region to give
passage to all the spinal nerves, and that they form the channels of communication
to and from the brain. The results of my own obseryations are opposed to those of VoLKMANN, and partly
in favour of those of KGLuKER. In all the Mammalia examined by myself, I have
found the quantity of the white substance of the chord absolutely greater in the
cervical region than elsewhere.
