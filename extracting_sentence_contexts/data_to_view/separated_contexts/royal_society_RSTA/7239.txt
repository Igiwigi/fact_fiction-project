The special case K > 0, or k = —s’k,,,, is interesting. Equations (8-4) now reduce
to
du’ -
q a =—sin#, wu’ =cosf, (8-10)

and we always get either a straight line, or a semicircular path. The fact that we get,
for this value of K, singular solutions is associated with the range of validity of the
approximation for any value of K.

term xw’ in the third equation of motion (3-1) can be discarded in comparison with the
term sq’. We are thus left with the approximate equation

and since, by (4-9), 7s’ is of order —1 in normal condition, we get, in general, q’ = 0
as a first approximation.
