I could assume as to many a Himalayan plant that in
character it was European, and tabulate it in Region I. accordingly. Each tabulation
of a specimen made in this manner will be illusory; the thing to be proved is
assumed, and we are in a complete circle; tabulators have, however, sometimes
allocated specimens in this way, and such additions only serve to mask the conclusions
that could have been drawn from the resulting numbers had they been omitted. But
further, this way of tabulating causes some of the most striking facts of geographic
distribution to disappear. I may have, for instance, a Himalayan pine to tabulate,
and, as I do not know exactly which side of Wataceâ€™s line it comes from, I place it
in Region I. But it perhaps was a specimen of Pinus longifolia from the tropical
zone.
