In the Annales des Sciences Naturelles for December 1833, is published a valuable
report, by M. Is1bors GReorFRoy ST. HiLAairg, upon a memoir of M. H. Muxs
Epwarps, entitled © Observations sur les changemens de forme que les Crus-
tac6s 6prouvent dans le jeune age.” Passing over the more generalized views de-
duced by M. ST. HiLairs from the facts noticed by M. Epwasps, I shall merely state
the latter. The genus Cymothoa, and some other Isopodous genera, afforded to
M. Epwarps an easy opportunity of examining the development of the eggs and the
structure of the young, in consequence of their being inclosed within the large sub-
thoracic pouch. Hence he was enabled to ascertain that some organs which are fully
developed in the adult animal, are either rudimental or absolutely wanting in the early
state : thus, in the latter the animal has only six thoracic segments, and six pairs of
legs, although when adult it has seven segments and seven pairs of legs.
