Flowering plants typically have large genome sizes and contain many genes,
the majority of which evolved during the past 250-300 Myr through gene
duplication [1]. A particularly striking feature of plant genomes, also explaining
their large sizes, is the large number of whole genome duplications (WGDs)
that have been uncovered [2-4]. It is now commonly accepted that one WGD
plant evolution occurred in the ancestor of all seed plants, and an extra one in the ancestor of
all flowering plants, so that every extant angiosperm is in fact a palaeopoly-
ploid containing the remnants of at least two WGDs [5]. Furthermore, a
hexaploidy event pre-dates the origin of all core eudicots, which make up
approximately 75% of extant angiosperm diversity [6-8], whereas traces of a
WGD at the base of the monocots also suggest a WGD shared by most, if not
all, monocots [9]. In addition, several more recent independent WGDs have
been unveiled in many different plant lineages. As a result, the genomes of
some extant plant species carry the remains of up to six successive genome
duplications [10]. Here, we focus on the more ‘recent’ palaeopolyploidizations
that occurred in the past 100 Myr, a large fraction of which seemingly took place
around the Cretaceous—Palaeogene (K—Pg) extinction event at 66 Ma [11]. We
have an in-depth look at this wave of WGDs associated with the K-Pg boundary,
many of which pre-date lineage diversifications that resulted in some of the largest
