It will not be possible to deduce easily, by the results from
BRrADLEY's refractions, the results that the French refractions
would give.

For this purpose it will be necessary not only to know the
mean temperature at the observations of the star, whose
north polar distance is required, but also the temperature at
the observations of stars by which the index error is com-

puted, which'in fact is much the same as to recompute the

index error, -

I know not how far this may have been a source of inac-
curacy in the north polar distances (p. g88, Phil. Trans.
181;), from the French refractions.

They seem to have been merely deduced from the column
of N. P. D. by BrapLey's refraction, and the mean heights
of the barometer and thermometer, as given in page g86.
