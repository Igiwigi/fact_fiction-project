hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and cyanogen, though, in the case of the last two gases,
the steps of the processes are still more hypothetical.

It is a noteworthy fact that the coloration of flames by alkali salts extends up to,
and even beyond, the outer margin of the visible region of combustion, where the
flame gases are usually considered to be fully oxidised and where free atmospheric
oxygen exists. In such parts of a flame metals, much less oxidisable than the alkali
metals, are rapidly oxidised when in the massive state. A copper w.re, for example,
becomes incrusted with oxide in a region where yellow light is abundantly emitted
from a salted flame. A superoxygenated oxy-hydrogen flame is also coloured
yellow by salt.

In discussing these facts* one of us was led to consider whether an alternative
explanation might not be sought from some conclusions, derived by Professor
ARRHENTUS, from a study of the electrical conductivity of salt vapours in flames.t
