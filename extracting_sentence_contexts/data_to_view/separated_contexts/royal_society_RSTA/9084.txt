I have given careful attention to these competing systems
and have discussed some of them elsewhere (‘ Biometrika,’ vol. IV., pp. 169 to 212). My chief objections to them arise from the fact that they either (i.) cover far less
than the necessary area; or (ii.) involve constants the probable errors of which can be
indefinitely great ; or (ili.) involve constants the probable errors of which have not
been or possibly cannot be calculated. In no case that I know of have they syste-
matically been applied to extensive ranges of data, and the goodness of fit compared
with that of other systems. The existence of such competing systems is at any rate
