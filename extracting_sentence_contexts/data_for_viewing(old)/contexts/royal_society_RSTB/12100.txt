laws and remedies which relate to the prevention and abatement

confirmation of the presence of pathogen DNA by qPCR. of public nuisances.

Because of the high probability of false negatives, caused
by the variable interval between initial infection and the Thus, state law in California allows the state regulatory
time when CLas becomes widespread in a tree, increase in agency (ie. CDFA) to take action against noxious


organisms, or locations that may harbour them, when they
have been exposed to infestation or infection. It seems safely
arguable that ‘exposure’ concerns possibility rather than
confirmed fact.

Hypothetically, this interpretation allows a solution to the
resource limitation issue by reducing the need for a re-testing
programme on an ever-increasing number of trees. If a defi-
nition of ‘exposed to’ could be made along these lines, trees
within an exposure radius around confirmed positive detec-
tions could be removed (i.e. culled) without testing, freeing
up resources to allocate to the RBS or establishing new deli-
mitation surveys. There are also added potential benefits of
removing undetected sources of inoculum from the epidemic
and reducing the host density in high-risk areas. The question
posed by the CPDPC to the epidemiology team was whether
