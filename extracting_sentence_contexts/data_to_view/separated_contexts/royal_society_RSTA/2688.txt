As a result as one proceeds
from A to G the BS hole gradually migrates to the left. Similar behaviour takes place on the right,
this time involving a UV plateau: as one proceeds from H to B this plateau migrates to the right. In fact, a careful look shows the presence of two nearby Maxwell points, one associated with the
BS holes and the other with the UV plateaus. The branch repeatedly passes through this region
resulting in an oscillation between a hole and a plateau that injects new structure on one side and
eliminates similar structure on the other side resulting in the translation of the hole or plateau.
