are better constrained, it is not possible to distinguish between a twistup or twistdown, but the
excellent fits to the horizontal motion support the locking geometry proposed by Brooks ef al. [36]
and Weiss et al. [38].

The principal conclusion is that the Subandean Zone currently accommodates an overall
shortening of about 10mm/yr, or around 15% of the relative plate convergence. But, although
this potentially occurs by motion on numerous active surface faults that will rupture during
earthquakes, along with intense folding of the intervening rocks, it is not possible with the
short-term deformation to identify individually these faults or determine their slip rates—in
fact long-term shortening is likely to be principally accommodated by slip on the frontal thrust
(figure 11c, [36,38]). However, the short-term deformation constrains the geometry, locking and
rate of a slip of the deeper fault system that is driving this deformation, linked to underthrusting
of the Brazilian Shield beneath the Central Andes and most likely accommodated by a zone of
ductile shear in the deeper part of the lithosphere (figure 6, [31,34,36,55]). Thus, in the short term,
the relative motion of the Nazca and South American plates is accommodated at depth by slip
on two conjugate thrust faults—the megathrust in the forearc and a lithospheric decollement on
the eastern margin, and the surface strain represents elastic deformation determined by the depth
of locking on the major structures (figure 6). But in the long term, crustal deformation is mainly
accommodated in a fold and thrust belt, up to 150 km wide in the Subandes, along with slip on
the subduction zone megathrust (figures 5b and 6).
