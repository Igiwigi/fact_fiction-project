Now the loci of y and y/ are different curves, one similar to a conic hyperbola, the
other similar to a cubic; bat of some snch form when m=1, as SS' and TT. It is
A evident that the proportion of y : y can never be the same at any two points, and
consequently that the breadths of the fringes made by the action of one can never
5 bear the same proportion to the breadths of those made by the action of both, unless
we introduce some other power as an element in the equation, some power whereby
from both values, y and y\, z may disappear, else any given proportion of y : y can
EZ only exist at some one value of x. Thus suppose (which the fact is) y:y'::1:5
