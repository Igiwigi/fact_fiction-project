C. POCKLINGTON ON THE COMPLETE SYSTEM

The total electric charge is the surface integral of F/47. The terms involving the exponential will evidently vanish on integration, exce
the case when m and n are both zero, i.¢., except in the case of pulsations. “—

Hence, excluding pulsations, E has the same value as before, and

F= ion {1 + b(2L/ — 3) cos » — ( a +) ferortnetea}

In this equation the terms not involving the exponential cancel by (37) and (
The equation therefore can be satisfied by some value of p, which fact verifies :

If m= n= 0, this equation does not hold. In this case the equation to
