a dorsal direction the unpaired ventricle extends 80 as to separate the two posterior
cerebral lobes. Anteriorly the ventricle is prolonged into two horns, which penetrate
for a short distance, as the lateral ventricles, into the base of the anterior cerebral lobes,
The front part of each anterior cerebral lobe, as well as of the whole of the posterior
lobes, appears solid in our sections; but WiLbEgR describes the anterior horns of the
ventricle as being prolonged for the whole length of the anterior lobes. In the embryos of all Vertebrates the cerebrum is not at first divided into two lobes,
80 that the fact of the posterior part of the cerebrum in Lepidosteus and probably other
Ganoids remaining permanently in the undivided condition does not appear to us a
snfficient ground for giving to the lobes of this part of the cerebrum the special name
of prothalami, as proposxed by W1LpeR, or for regarding them as a section of the
brain peculiar to Fishes. The thalamencephalon (h.) contains the usual parts, but is in some respects peculiar. Its lateral walls, forming the optic thalami, are thick, and are not sharply separated in
front from the basal part of the cerebrum ; between them is placed the third ventricle.
