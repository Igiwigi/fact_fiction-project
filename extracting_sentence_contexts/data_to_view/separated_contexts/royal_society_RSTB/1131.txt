This is shown by the fact that the cord effect, 1
is in no way modified by an interruption in the anterior columns which involves their
complete severance, caused by a section between the entering nerve and the observed
region. Such a section is most easily made in the isolated fragment of cord near
its central attachment, since this portion is raised from its bed. This is in strict
accordance with the fact alluded to in Chapter VIII, that excitation of the one end
of the anterior column evokes no electrical effects in a distant portion of the cord. It is otherwise with the lateral columns which have distinct relations with
electrical effects in the cord, since, as shown in Chapter VIII., their stimulation
evokes marked cord effects. It does not follow, however, that this relation is one
which comprises the afferent nerves, for we know that the lateral column contains the
main path for the efferent cord tracts, as is shown by the results of cortical excitation,
as set forth in Chapter V., &c.
