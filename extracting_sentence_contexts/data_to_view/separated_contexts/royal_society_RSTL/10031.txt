The perithecium, when completely developed, is a globular or snb-globular body,
consisting of a shining black or brown external case, the outer thick walls of which
appear regularly embossed, and an internal mass composed of asci and spores, &c. The embossed pattern on the outer walls results from the thick-walled cells, of which
ib is composed, projecting at their free 8urfaces ; where the cells join each other
forming polygonal figures they do not 80 project.* What may be termed the base of
the perithecium is sessile on the mycelium: at the opposite pole, or apex, is frequently
a slight papilla, not obviously pierced by any pore. BoRNErT, noting this fact, ima-
gines that the dehiscence takes place below, the whole upper part of the perithecium
becoming broken away by a circular rupture at the base. In some forms, at least,
the spores escape through an opening at the apex : how far this is general I do nob
know (Plate 42, fig. 43), but facts exist to render it probable that a minute and
dilatable pore occurs in others. Vertical sections of the mature perithecium show that within the firm, deep-
coloured, external wall is a lining of softer cells, with swollen envelopes and of a more
or less flattened form : this inner lining of the perithecium extends two or three cell-
series deep, and is slightly yellow or pale-brown in colour (see Plate 44, fig. 33, and
Plate 42, fig. 34).
