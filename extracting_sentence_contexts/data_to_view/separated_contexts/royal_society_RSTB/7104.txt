In the
case of statistical variates conforming to the normal law one would expect the variance to
decrease inversely as the size (in this case, the area) of the sampling units or grids. It was
found, however, that the actual decrease was much smaller, so that the gain in precision
by increasing the size of individual grids was appreciably less than one would ordinarily
expect on the normal theory. This may be ascribed to the fact that the proportion of land
4, sown with a particular crop (or the yield of a crop) in plots in the same neighbourhood are
not statistically independent but are correlated. The absence or presence of such correlation
determines whether the variance would follow the normal law or would decrease more
slowly with increasing size of grids. In fact, this furnishes a convenient basis for the classi-
fication of fields into two distinct types, namely, (a) random type (in which the variance
function is normal) and (4) non-random type (in which the variance decreases more slowly).
