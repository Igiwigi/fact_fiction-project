divided longitudinally, the fish has continued to give shocks; when the brain has
been entirely extracted, the fish instantly lost this power, though the muscles gene-
rally continued to act powerfully ;‚Äù from which it appears that the electric power is
not like the muscular independent of the brain, but on the contrary immediately de-
pending on it ; proving that in this, as in all the other neryous functions, as appears
from the facts stated in a paper which the Royal Society did me the honour to
publish in 1829, and which was republished in my Inguiry into the Nature of Sleep
and Death, the nerves are merely the passive, the brain, one of the active parts of the
nervous sy8tem.

In the foregoing positions we here find, as in other similar instances, that when truth
is once arrived at, other facts, beside those which led to it, arise to give it their aid.

Dr. Davy made no experiments to determine hoy far the spinal marrow, the only
other part of the neryous system concerned in the formation of thenervous influence,
partakes of the function in question. Were we to reason from the analogy afforded
by all the other nervous functions properly 80 called, we should expect to find the
spinal marrow sharing it equally with the brain. It is not unlikely that the re-
moral either of the brain or spina] marrow would destroy this function, as is found
to be the case with respect to the more complicated functions properly termed nervous;
a point which can only be determined by an appeal to direct experiment ; or, like the
excitement of the muscles, it may belong to either organ separately, or, which is less
probable, it may, being a function of volition, belong to the brain alone,
