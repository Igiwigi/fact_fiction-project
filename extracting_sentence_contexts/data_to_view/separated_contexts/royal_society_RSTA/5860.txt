Thus, a constraint on the mean power (f-u) can be regarded as a constraint on the mean
enstrophy (|Vu|?). Having found an optimal u, we can then simply read off from (1.2) the
corresponding optimal f. This is not to say that every optimal velocity is dynamically stable—
in fact, in related problems involving extremal orbits the opposite situation holds [41,42]. Nevertheless, to get started, we set aside the momentum equation henceforth and focus solely
on optimizing advection—diffusion. Switching to non-dimensional variables, let x =R=1.
