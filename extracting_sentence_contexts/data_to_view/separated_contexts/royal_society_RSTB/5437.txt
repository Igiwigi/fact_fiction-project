The arches grow not only upwards but also extend their bases. With
their growth, the arches envelop the spinal cord completely and there forms a dorsal
projection which develops where the basidorsal of one side meets the basidorsal of the
other. These neural spines slant cranio-caudally owing to the fact that the arch itself

is a slanting structure. The neural arches also extend dorsolaterally connecting one arch with the extension
of the next arch. These extensions of two consecutive arch elements are continuous
procartilaginous rods slanting craniocaudally which we have termed dorsointer-
vertebrals.
