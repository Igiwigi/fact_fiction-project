DR. J. W. GREGORY ON THE IRISH ESKERS. 1838

The existence of this clay has been used as an argument for the glacial-canyon theory
of eskers. The esker in places shows the arched bedding, which is often claimed as
characteristic of true eskers. ‘The material is in places finer-grained on the western
slope, while the bedding is steepest on the eastern front. Some of the large lenticles
of gravel are coarsest to the south, but the included rocks indicate that the material
came from the north or north-west—a fact previously recorded by Carver Lewis
(1894, p. 149). Glacial strive are said to be not uncommon on the stones, and
Prof. Szymour and I noticed clear glacial grooves on the boulders in the lower part
of the esker.

One of the most conspicuous features in the constitution of this esker is the
abundance of laminated clay and loam, as in the deep pit at Airmont.* There the
loam had been cut away in steps, and the hollows thus formed occupied by a coarse
torrential gravel, which also forms the summit of the esker. ‘The gravel often occurs
in lenticular patches interstratified in the clays.

This esker is in some places a single narrow ridge, and in others a broad bank of
confused interstratified sand, gravel, and clay. The material does not, as a whole,
