It is usually more convenient to define the Poincaré sphere using the Stokes parameters:

So=l |Exl? + |Eyl” E*.o9-E,
$1 =Ip: — 1902 =|Exl*—|Eyl? = E*-03-E, eo.)
2.1
S2 = las: — ligase = EXEy + ExEy E*-o1-E
and $3 =IRH — In = —i(E{Ey — ExEy) =E*-02-E.

The first column of equalities indicates how the Stokes parameters can be found by intensity
measurements, with polarizer at the angle given in the subscript (0°, 90°, 45°, 135° and RH, LH
circular polarizations). The second column gives the Stokes parameters in terms of components
of E, which in fact are complex inner products of E with the Pauli spin matrices o9 =(}9),
o1=(9)), o2= (? me) and o3=() °,); the subscripts on the $; agree with the subscripts on
a; in the circular basis. They satisfy S} + $3 + $3 =$}, so we can define the normalized Stokes
vector s = (s1,$,83), where s; = S;/So, i=1,2,3, and all possible choices of s define a unit sphere.
Multiplying E by a complex phase factor (representing, for instance, the evolution of time) does
not change s.

The fact that the Pauli matrices appear in this classical setting suggests that the physics of
polarization may resemble that of quantum spin; if E were a quantum state of spin 1/2—rather
than a classical state of light—the Stokes vector s would represent the axis of rotation of the
quantum spin state on the Bloch sphere. However, three-dimensional Stokes space does not
directly correspond to real space (e.g. Stokes vectors (1,0, 0) and (—1,0,0) are 180° apart in Stokes
space, but represent orthogonal polarizations (1,0) and (0, 1)).
