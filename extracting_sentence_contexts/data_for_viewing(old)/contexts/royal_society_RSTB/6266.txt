Between May 20 and July 31 when all animals have presumably had their first
cestrus, 78 adult females were obtained of which 71, or almost 90°%, were pregnant.
Consequently during the earlier part of the breeding season they must become
pregnant normally at the post-partum oestrus and both gestation and lactation must
normally proceed pari passu in parous animals.

It must be concluded that the female shrew normally produces several successive
litters in a season. Barrett-Hamitron (1911) suggests that two or even three litters
are produced in a season, and Apams (1910) obtained pregnant females which had
suckled previously. MrppLeron (1931) considers it uncertain whether females have
more than one litter. The average size of litter is not known directly as no nests
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six nipples indicates that
the litter size will not be much in excess of this number. It can be estimated with
reasonable accuracy from the number of maturing follicles, of corpora lutea, and of
embryos in utero in post-implantation stages of pregnancy.

A group of maturing follicles, clearly defined from the small follicles, can be
identified in the ovaries of about one-third of the adult animals available for this
purpose. In the other animals the largest follicles are not defined as a group owing
to the presence of follicles of a size intermediate between them and the smaller
follicles. A difference of at least 32 » between the diameter of the largest of the
smaller follicles and the smallest of the larger ones was taken as sufficient to define
the group of maturing follicles. Using this criterion it was found that the number
of follicles maturing together varied from 4 to 16 in the 48 animals available while
