Flint (1919) has described a
muguru ceremony at Torobina, Damera. The mainland is low-lying and depressing. Beaver says (p. 228) that after you leave the mouth of the estuary there is scarcely a
single patch of cultivation, as the people live mainly on sago. * With a population living
in a semi-nomadic state and under pretty wretched housing conditions, one hardly
looks to find any artistic traits, but it is a fact that the upper Bamu is celebrated for its
fine drums and canoes... .Some rather good carving in relief is done on tobacco pipes,
representing Toto-opu, a man’s head design, which is found on all sorts of ornamenta-
tion in the Bamu.’ I have not seen the tobacco pipes referred to. Beaver also says that the most famous canoes in the west are built by the tribes of the
northern half of Aramia island and have been exported as far as Torres Straits. The
export trade is in the hands of the Waboda people, who make periodical trips for the
purpose.
