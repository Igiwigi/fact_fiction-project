wave function of the incident electron. For many problems this would certainly be an
adequate approximation. However, for the calculation of collision cross-sections (especially
if neutral atoms are involved) the effect of the actual instantaneous interaction is likely to be of
greater importance.} This unusual contingency arises because part of the integrand on the

right-hand side of (13) contains the factor i (r,, 1.) ; and it is precisely in the region where

1/r,) tends to infinity that the ‘’(r,, r,) assumed is most in error, its value there (no less with
distorted waves than with plane waves) being seriously overestimated. Apart from the

+ lonization of a neutral atom provides an obvious example of this. The average static potential of the
ejected electron is zero. Hence on the distorted wave approximation the potential acting on the scattered
electron would be that of the ion formed. In fact, the potential must be much less. For in general the ejected
electron has much lower velocity than the scattered electron (Mott & Massey 1949) and thus it cannot move
far in the effective duration of the collision. The Born approximation in contrast assumes that the Coulomb
potential of the ion is completely screened. This probably does not introduce significant error at high-impact
energies, but at low-impact energies (when the difference in the velocities of the ejected and scattered
electrons is least pronounced) the position is very uncertain.
