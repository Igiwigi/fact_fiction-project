fighting decoherence. In all current quantum computing attempts, the main difficulty results from 2 |
the fact that the thermal environment tends to thermalize a qubit, thereby causing decoherence. This has the unwanted consequence of information scrambling: during thermalization, quantum a
information encoded in the initial state will spread over the entire system and thereby become 8
inaccessible to local measurements. This may not be the case in MBL systems: as a localized is
environment fails to thermalize, the system can retain some local information about its initial 1S

state for indefinite amounts of time, opening up new possibilities for quantum technologies.
