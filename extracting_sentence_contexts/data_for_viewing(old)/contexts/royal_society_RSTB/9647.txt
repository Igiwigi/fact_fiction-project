[22]. These approaches, however, tend to be slow, which
motivated other approaches based on the consideration of a
set of candidate gene trees obtained using faster approaches
that do not consider a species tree. These approaches include
TreefixDTL [15], ALE [23,24] and TERA [16]. The latter two
approaches are extensions of an idea initially proposed in
[5] and formalized in [23] and are particularly fast and accur-
ate. They are based on the ‘amalgamation’ idea. Based on a
sample of gene trees, amalgamation is a dynamic program-
ming algorithm that allows the exhaustive exploration of a
large space of gene trees. In fact, based on a limited set of
gene trees, amalgamation allows consideration of a much
larger space of gene trees, because it can piece together
clades from several trees at a time to generate new trees,
not present in the initial sample of gene trees. This technique
is found to improve on competing approaches [16,23] in both
speed and accuracy.

Probabilistic gene tree-aware approaches can also be used
to date trees. In such cases, gene tree-aware models often
reconstruct ultrametric gene trees, a model describing the
