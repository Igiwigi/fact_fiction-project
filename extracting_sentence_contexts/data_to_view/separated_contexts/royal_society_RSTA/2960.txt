Now, it has been shown above that 55 x10“
els. unit of positive electricity is retained by the water of each drop after breaking,
and this amount agrees as well as could be expected with the 2°2x10-* els. unit
per drop found in the air; the difference is no doubt due to the fact that many of the

* This experiment does not indicate the nature of the ions produced : for instance, the positive ions

might be exceedingly fine water drops. Still it shows that something of the nature of ordinary ionisation
takes place and that the ions exist long enough to be separated by the Ebert instrument.
