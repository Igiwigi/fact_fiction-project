94. When the conductor was held against the edge as if fixed to it, and with
it moyed between the poles, eyen though but for a few degrees, the galvano-
meter needle moved and indicated a current of electricity, the same as that
which would have been produced if the wheel had revolved in the same
direction, the conductor remaining stationary.

95. When the galvanometer connexion with the axis was broken, and its
wires made fast to two conductors, both applied to the edge of the copper disc,
then currents of electricity were produced, presenting more complicated ap-
pearances, but in perfect harmony with the above results. Thus, if applied as
in fig. 11, a current of electricity through the galyanometer was produced; but
if their place was a little shifted, as in fig. 12, a current in the contrary direction
resulted; the fact being, that in the first instance the galvanometer indicated
the difference between a strong current through A and a weak one through B,
and in the second, of a weak current through A and a strong one through B
(92.), and therefore produced opposite deflections.

96. So also when the two conductors were equidistant from the magnetic
poles, as in fig. 13, no current at the galyanometer was perceived, whichever
way the disc was rotated, beyond what was momentarily produced by irre-
gularity of contact; because equal currents in the same direction tended to
pass into both. But when the two conductors were connected with one wire,
and the axis with the other wire, (fig. 14,) then the galyanometer showeda cur-
rent according with the direction of rotation (91.) ; both conductors now act-
ing consentaneously, and as a single conductor did before (88.).
