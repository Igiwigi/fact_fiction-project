This ex-
planation was suggested to me by my brother Sir H. Davy. There are some facts which T have observed agreeable to it,
but not more s0 than to the hypothesis of Dr. BLack. I have
found the stomach of the ox, the pyloric compartment, of a
higher temperature than the left ventricle itself; thus when
the latter immediately after death was 10g, the former full of
food was 104.5.
