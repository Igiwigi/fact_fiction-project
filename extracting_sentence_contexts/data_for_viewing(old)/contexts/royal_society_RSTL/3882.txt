again in regard to the nerves. Those which, in the anterior part of the cord, are given
from it at equal distances between the ganglia, are found nearer and nearer to the
ganglion next behind, until they at length cease to come from the cord, but are
derived directly from the ganglia, each of which then gives off two pairs of nerves,
instead of the single pair to the legs, as in the anterior 8egments. But although the
ganglia are thus closely collected together, this is not the result of aggregation in
this part of the body, but is consequent on the non-completion of changes which
take place in the formation of new ganglionic centres and nerves in this part of the
cord, during the successive periodic formation and addition of new segments to the
body in these animals, as I have heretofore shown in the Tulidzee*. These formations
always take place in all the Myriapoda between the penultimate and antepenulti-
mate segments, and in that part of the cord the new ganglia are produced to those
segments. This leads us to 8ome important facts in reference to the means by which
the nervous cord itself is developed by extension and elongation of its fibres during
the growth of the whole body, and the development of the new segments ; and it
shows that an elongation takes place in the longitudinal fibres of the cord in the new
segments, and that ganglia are developed in its structure while commissural and
lateral fibres of reinforcement are in the course of: formation. But the distribution
of the nerves from these ganglia, and the structure of the ganglia themselves, seem
to lead us to the facts. In Polydesmus maculatus (fig. 9.), Nob., each of the six pos-
terior ganglia gives off two pairs of nerves. In no instance in these posterior seg-
