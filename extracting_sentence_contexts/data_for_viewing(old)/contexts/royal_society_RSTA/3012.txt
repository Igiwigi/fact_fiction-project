say the ‘floor to the ceiling’ direction to the external z-direction, and if rotating the spin does not
produce too much of a back-reaction to the rocket to misalign it, the rotation along the internal
direction coincides with a rotation around the z-axis.

The central question is thus how to prepare and align the internal frame, which, for more
general unitaries, is not so obvious as in the case of spin rotations, and how to ensure it is robust
enough, so that it stays aligned under the kick-back. Building up from the WAY theorem, new
works have further explored complex mathematical constructions to devise internal frames. For
instance, a general version of this problem was also studied as the resource theory of asymmetry
[8,19,20]. Other approaches have further focused on the role of the particular symmetry group G
which, according to Noether’s theorem, comes with the conservation laws. As a consequence, the
internal reference frame that one can define following this approach is heavily group dependent.
This fact is clearly illustrated by the construction of the ‘model’ reference frame L(G): the square-
integrable functions on the group G (under the invariant Haar measure) equipped with the left
regular representation [8]. Hence, while this approach is mathematically very elegant, both in
its definition and its interaction with the system, the construction is very complex, and so is the
interaction required to implement the desired unitary on the system. Hence, one might wonder
what sort of complex physical system this frame actually represents, and how to physically
implement the necessary interaction.

In the next section, we show how one can construct instead a reference frame that is both
simple to implement and physically intuitive, and which will work for any extensive conserved
quantities.
