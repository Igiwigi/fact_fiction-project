F.R.S. Read, June 16, 1831.

1. WhiLsT engaged in some experiments with a thin plate of iron, em-

ployed as a screen to intercept the action of a magnet, the following curious
| fact presented itself to my notice. Although the single plate of iron, which
| was about the 7th of an inch in thickness, very effectually screened the action
| of a reyolying magnet on..a disc. of copper, the magnet and disc being placed
| - at a certain distance from each other ; yet the same effect did not follow when
the disc acted on by the magnet was also of iron: in the latter case it was
found requisite to increase the quantity of interyening iron very considerably. This was done by piling several plates similar to the first, one on the other, by
which the quantity of iron requisite to intercept completely the action of the
'S magnet could be in some measure estimated.
