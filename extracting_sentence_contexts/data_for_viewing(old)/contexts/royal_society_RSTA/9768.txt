164 MR. R. A. SAMPSON: A NEW TREATMENT OF OPTICAL ABERRATIONS.

in fact, it was by such a method that I found them; but their real significance is
contained in the proof given above.

We have thus found among the twelve aberrational coefficients six relations which
may be expressed in terms only of the focal length and other cardinal elements of the
normal system, or seven, if we include the Petzval expression as of that class.

Let us consider next what geometrical description can be given of the occurrence
or absence of the twelve coefficients. It must be remembered that for different
choice of origins. the coefficients do not preserve an identity. Thus if we shift O, the
original origin to the point (—d, 0, 0), the new set—d,G, ...—is given in terms of the
old set—é,9’, ...—-by writing in the equations of p. 160.
