The answer is, that the equation [(30), § 55] from which it is
derived, and which actually must, in every exact discussion, be taken in its place, is a
wholly unsuitable one for a solid, while equation (27), § 55, is a suitable one. Again it may be asked, Why not retain the stress equation in its original form
$ = — 2m7!Mly, for solids? The answer to this is, that the important fact that
the great majority of solids behave magnetically like a vacuum is not thereby readily
taken account of.

69. To compare these stresses and their effects with Maxwetv’s, it must first
be noted that Maxwett has only investigated the electrostatic part of his stress
for the case of a series of charged conductors surrounded by a dielectric that behaves
electrostatically like a vacuum. _
