Before designing these chambers, the relative advantages of solid metal and wire
winding were fully considered. The latter construction, if properly carried out, adds
considerably to the ultimate strength. A system of winding suitable for a spherical
enclosure is, however, not easy to devise, and this fact, together with the ever
important consideration of cost, led to the adoption of solid walls. Mild steel was chosen as the material best suited to withstand the sudden impact
of an explosion. â€˜The limit of elasticity, ultimate strength, and elongation of test
pieces cut perpendicular to the direction of rolling were carefully determined before
the forgings were machined.
