They tend to run alongside of the vascular strand, as is to be seen in
text-figs. 3 and 4, and Plate 22, fig. 1, at 7. They are more conspicuous in the
lower regions of the scales, because there the general ground-tissue cells are smaller,
as will be recognised on comparing text-figs. 3 and 4. These resin passages are definitely surrounded by a cell-wall, appearing to be, in
fact, single cells. Each of these cells is circular, and averages from 50-80 and
more » in diameter. They are generally partly or completely plugged by con-
spicuous black masses of “ resinous” material,

Though large irregularly running “ mucilage canals” are, of course, common in the
pith, petioles, etc., of all previously described species, such definite cells as those
described above, associated with the vascular strands of the interseminal scales, have
not, so far as I am aware, been described in any other species of Bennettites.
