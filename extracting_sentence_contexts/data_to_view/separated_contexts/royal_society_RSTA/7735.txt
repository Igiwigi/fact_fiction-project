But we can estimate, from considerations
of interatomic distances, the distance between the halogen atoms belonging to the
same molecule, and use that knowledge as a guide for properly pairing the halogen
atoms. It so happens that there are two alternative ways of so pairing, both of
which give the Cl-Cl or Br-Br distance looked for. Now the experimental fact that
the optical extinction directions in the (010) plane are very different for the two
crystals is used as the basis for choosing the pairs in one way for p-dichlorobenzene
and in the other way for p-dibromobenzene. The result is, the molecular planes
in the two crystals are assigned different orientations. On the other hand, as we
mentioned in an earlier section, we have definite reasons to believe that the orienta-
tions in the two crystals should be very similar.
