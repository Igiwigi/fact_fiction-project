wave-lengths, which may include a small residue of actual mistakes in recording the
rotations, was reduced to about one-half when it was realised that the spectrum of the
iron arc might contain a few of the strongest lines of some of the principal impurities of
metallic iron. In attempting to identify these unknown lines, however, we have limited
ourselves strictly to those lines which have already been recorded in the spectrum of the

iron arc, but have been attributed to foreign elements by the authors of the various
tables of wave-lengths. We then discovered that our readings included 10 lines due
to manganese, two ultra-violet copper lines, and one line each due to nickel and to
magnesium. The fact that the list of unidentified extinctions was approximately
halved by making use of a short list of known lines of known impurities, without
bringing in the complete wave-length tables for Cu, Mg, Mn or Ni, is a remarkable
vindication of the general correctness of the tabulated rotations, and suggests that
some of the other outstanding cases may perhaps be capable of a similar simple
interpretation.*

Duplicate readings of about 180 lines were available for the quartz before and after
regrinding. The rotations of the two series are slightly divergent, since the rotatory
power of the quartz was increased to the extent of about 1 part in 25,000 by regrinding.
In order to render available the long series of rotatory powers which were measured
before the quartz was reground, a smooth series of differences was deduced from the
formule which express the two series of readings, and these differences can be applied to
