VOL, COXXII.—B. 30


458 E. TREWAVAS ON THE HYOID AND LARYNX OF THE ANURA. Previous Work on Bufo. Dueis (1835) dissected Bufo vulgaris and B. calamita, but did not see a constrictor
eaternus (“ hyo-pré-glottique ”), and the fact that he described only one other con-
strictor muscle (“ hyo-post-glottique ”) loses its value since he missed the constrictor
posterior even in Rana esculenta. He knew that only two posterior petrohyoids are
present in Bufo. HeENuE (1839) gave a good description of the hyoid and larynx of B. palmarum,
and referred also to B. cinereus.
