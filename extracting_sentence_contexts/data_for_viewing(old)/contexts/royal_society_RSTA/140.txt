defect formation during fast symmetry-breaking transitions from the normal
Fermi-liquid phase of * *He to a superfluid phase, emphasizing in particular the
importance of the existence of two competing superfluid phases, A and B. In
general, the phase transition will not just lead to a single superfluid phase, but to a
patchwork of different phases, after which the regions of the more stable phase grow
at the expense of the other—a phenomenon that may well have an analogue in the
early Universe. He also reviewed the interesting and still controversial topic of the
nucleation of the (stable) B phase within the metastable A phase.

Bunkov also discussed the intriguing phenomenon of BEC of magnons in
superfluid * *He. The concept of BECs normally applies to systems with a conserved
particle number, but can also apply to sufficiently long-lived quasiparticles, such
as magnons. In fact, this intriguing phenomenon is closely analogous to BEC in
diffuse atomic gases, but in some respects richer: especially noteworthy is the
existence of several distinct condensed states of magnons, including stationary
spin waves and homogeneously precessing domains.

In particle physics models of the early Universe, based on fundamental
(super)string theory, an important role is played by ‘branes’, effectively higher
dimensional defects. One popular idea, discussed further below, is that of a brane
world in which our observable Universe is confined to a 3-brane, a three-
dimensional surface in the higher dimensional space required by string theory.
Here, inflation, the period of accelerating expansion that is believed to have
occurred shortly after the big bang (which is required to explain the near-flatness
and homogeneity of the Universe), is triggered by a collision between branes,
