curred to me as possible, that these organs may be designed for intromission and
retention like the penis of the Dog. On this idea, the abundant secretion of the gland,
as a lubricating fluid, would be of manifest use, and the action of the different parts
might admit of explanation. And, as the sacs connected with the appendages in
certain of the Sharks open appropriately, they may be supposed to be designed for
the same use*. In venturing to bring forward this conjecture, I beg to be understood,
that Tattach no kind of importance to it. I am fully aware that it is liable to objec-
tions. TI sball be satisfied should it lead to further inquiry, by which alone the true
use of these mysterious organs can be determined.

* After writing the above, on referring to AgrsrToTLE, that great and curious storehouse of natural history,
I found that a similar idea had been entertained in his time, and that there were some who declared they had
witnessed the fact. * Sunt qui se vidisse confirment nonnulla ex cartilagineis aversa modo canum terrestrium
