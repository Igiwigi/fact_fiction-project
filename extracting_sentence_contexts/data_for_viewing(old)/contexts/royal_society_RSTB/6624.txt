to its anterior end have no obvious homologues in other vertebrates. The posterior
basicranial bone must be of parachordal origin. There remains the middle basicranial
element. This lies too far back to represent polar cartilages. It is conceivable that it is
of acrochordal origin, but the structure seems to lie too ventral to be reasonably

interpreted in this way. It is therefore possible that it really represents a detached
anterior part of the parachordal, analogous to that found transiently in birds, and may
be a relique of an original segmentation of the parachordal cartilage.


D. M. 8S. WATSON ON THE ACANTHODIAN FISHES 125

The jaws of Acanthodians are remarkable for the fact that in all of them the lower
jaw is longer than the upper, exactly as the ventral part of each of the other visceral
arches is longer than its dorsal end. The jaws are also remarkable because both upper
and lower may be, and presumably at some stage of development always were, formed
of two cartilages which, as Reis and JAEKEL have shown, are directly comparable with
the corresponding elements of the branchial arches. (The bone supporting the otic
process of the palato-quadrate in Acanthodes is probably a neomorph.) It is improbable
that the palato-quadrate of Climatius had any articulation with the neural cranium,
but a palato-basal and an otic articulation exist in later forms.

The branchial arches have the primitive gnathostome four-part structure.

The teeth in primitive forms have what is no doubt a primitive Elasmobranch type
