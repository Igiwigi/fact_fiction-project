The central role played by particular ITMs in the pathophysiology of
cancer is indicated, in the first instance, by their appearance consistently in
all cancers studied thus far. Ion transport occurs throughout the multi-stage
cancer process, from the initial transformation of a normal cell into a cancer
cell to metastasis. In fact, all ‘hallmarks’ of cancer involve or can potentially
involve ITMs [2-4]. In this overall regard, ITMs possess some remarkable
characteristics. For example, a typical membrane potential is equivalent to a
voltage gradient of some |107Vm™'|, a huge force that can impact upon
every protein in the membrane.
