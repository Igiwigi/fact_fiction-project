One may write (we consider only three genuine
evolution equations, but not the spatial constraints 0,J, — d,J; =0)

Ie Jb — plo = Ie (xh Iu.) — Op(u"' Tu.) = uO, (X4 Tu) — Xf O.(u"Ty)- (2.21)
Then, using (2.18) and that anh = —x]} xha,€" , we can write (2.21) as
WJ — WI uxe 4, + aT =0, (2.22)

2Note that within (2.16), there are only four evolution equations for four unknowns J, and three pure spatial constraints
apa — dag =0.



which using the evolution equation for the configuration gradient wan “+68, d,u* =0 (see [44]),
can be rewritten as
uw d,Jv + Jndyu" = —ayT. (2.23)

Because the left-hand side is the Lie derivative of J,, along the 4-velocity, while the right-hand side
is the derivative of the proper scalar T = —u"J,,, we may replace the ordinary derivatives with the
covariant ones:

wWViJy + JuVyut = -VyT. (2.24)

Using (2.18), this equation can be equivalently written as u*(V,J, — VvJa) =0. Thus, the Eulerian 6
form of the relativistic heat conduction equations (in the absence of the irreversible processes) —
reads :§

Vulj,=0 and u*(VaJy — Von) =0. (225) 28

(iii) Energy-momentum and thermal stress =~

We now demonstrate that the energy-momentum tensor has a contribution due to thermal 15
impulse J,,. Thus, during the Lagrange-to-Euler transformation the energy-momentum tensor aia
density zy, = /-8T (2.10) transforms as nen

BY, = 1615 (ACS, Jo)) 4 = HELE (IEICE Ed), = LK — Let, — Jnl, 'g

xe
Therefore, in the presence of heat conduction, the energy-momentum tensor T/? = Z”,,/,/=8 is : gS
~T) = 84,840, + Iu, — EB, 22) 3S

where the term J,,4j, can be called the thermal stress.

(iv) Entropy

In this section, we introduce an entropy of our theory and rewrite the conservation law (2.25)1,
which is, in fact, the entropy conservation law, in a conventional form. For brevity, we shall not
consider the dependence of the energy potential on &“, in this section. First, we introduce the spatial projection w,, of the thermal impulse J,

y= Mf, = Jy — Tey. (2.27)

Let us also define total energy potentials (at the moment we use symbol E, while symbol &
will appear later on, after a Legendre transform in (2.30))

EUu) =E(T, J) =E(T, w), (2.28)
where E = £L/,/=g, T= —u"Ju, J = Jus“, w= wy,w" =] + T?, and, in particular,

Ey, =—Eru’ + Ew, a =—E pu’ +Ey,h? =—Eru’ + Ey,. (2.29)

Eventually, the entropy s can be introduced conventionally, i.e. as the Legendre conjugate to
the temperature T.
