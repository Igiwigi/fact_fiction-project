He
states that he was unable to find any trace of an oral aperture in Trichonympha, and
believes that solid food particles become enclosed by folds of the body, and entangled
in the cilia, and thereby become gradually engulfed within the cytoplasm of the
organism. He further adds that he never found any food particles in the anterior
nucleus-containing portion of the body. Gregarines he found to be very common,
and also Pyrsonympha vertens Leidy, which appears to be always attached to the
walls of its host's intestineâ€”an important fact overlooked by Lerpy. In 1904 Mlle. Foa (1904, p. 618) published some observations on the process of
division in Trichonymphu agilis, and she also studied, in conjunction with Grasst
(Grasst and Foa, 1904, p. 241), the same process in Jania annectens.
