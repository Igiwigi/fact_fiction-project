structure or of accreted or incorporated colour. The absence of nuclei or other structures
makes it difficult to regard the membrane as other than a part of the fibre itself; it appears,
in fact, to be an axiolemma. Myelinated fibres of vertebrates (Maximow & Bloom 1944)
and of cephalopods and crustacea among the invertebrates (Young 1936; Schmitt & Bear
1939; Holmes 1942) are said not to have a visible axiolemma though, as Young has observed,
they may have a superficial molecular orientation suggestive of a submicroscopical limiting
membrane. It is therefore not without interest that in the unmyelinated fibres of the
asteroid such a membrane is not only present but is optically visible.
