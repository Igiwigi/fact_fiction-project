One single specimen, Powrie 1891, 92, 334, Royal Scottish Museum, which is
certainly determinable from the character of its fin spines, shoulder girdle, scales and
mandibular splints, differs from all other specimens of D. striatus in that it has very
massive ossifications in the head skeleton, vertebral column and basals of the fins, and
possesses well-preserved dermal fin rays. Other specimens show slight traces of
ossification of the same nature in the branchial arches, thus confirming the identifica-
tion. The causes of this very extensive ossification in this individual are quite unknown.
The specimen is not of exceptionally large size.

The normal length is about 9 cm. The dozen specimens before me are preserved
dorso-ventrally flattened or in profile in almost equal numbers. This arrangement may
depend more on the fact that both the dorsal and ventral fin spines are very long
than on the real shape of the body of the fish, but when taken in conjunction with other
evidence derived from the shoulder girdle it goes to show that the height and width of
the fish at the shoulder were about equal, and that the animal possessed a flattened
ventral surface.

It is clear that the fish was rather abruptly truncated in front, the snout being
rounded from side to side and probably somewhat wedge-shaped dorso-ventrally ; the
exact profile is, however, impossible to determine. When allowance is made for the
widening due to crushing the fish is comparatively slender and stream-lined, though
the caudal pedicel is deep.

The caudal fin is heterocercal, its upper lobe appearing to turn upward somewhat
