to bring the genetics of nitrogen fixation before a wider scientific audience; the other, from
Dr Bergersen, was intended to celebrate this Centenary, with an emphasis on the plant
symbioses.

The Society asked us to get together and this is the published version of the hybrid product.
We did indeed celebrate the work of Hellriegel & Wilfarth with the Centenary Lecture which
started our proceedings. After that, as our title indicated, we attempted to illustrate, by selected
contributions, the present state of the subject as well as to look ahead at future prospects. That
is why there is a strong emphasis on molecular genetics, because no-one can dispute that this
area has been a major growth point in recent years. But I ask those who feel that more
physiological matters have been neglected to pay close attention to the actual content of what
might seem abstruse molecular biology; much of the research reported in these contributions
is in fact classical physiology approached with new and powerful tools. They are all about
how the genome and the cell biochemistry interact and that, in anyoneâ€™s book, has to be
physiology.

Much of the valuable discussion which followed the presentations is recorded in these
proceedings. What we were unable to record, though the Centenary Lecture includes some
examples, is an excellent exhibition of relevant material, modern and archival, which was
mounted for the occasion by Dr Phillip Nutman, Dr Janet Sprent and Dr Barry Smith. We
were also privileged to have, after the Centenary Lecture, a brief contribution (recorded
herein) from Professor G. Kratzsch, who is currently Director of the Cereals Research Institute
at Bernburg-Hadmersleben, the site of the Soil Science Research laboratories where Hellriegel
& Wilfarth did their seminal research.
