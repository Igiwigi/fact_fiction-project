250 MR. H, F. BAXTER'S EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY AS TO THE EXISTENCE

and 8 to the same cause? Let us take the simple fact, that, when the mucous mem-
brane of the small intestine and the blood flowing from it are formed into a circuit,
a deviation of the needle amounting to 3*, 4* or 5* is obtained, the intestine being
empty and therefore uninfluenced by the cireumstances we have just now mentioned ;
why did the effect not occur in experiment 11? the conditions appeared to be pre-
cisely similar; or in experiments 7 and 10, when the artery was wounded; or in expe-
riments 3 and 4, when blood flowing from a different part formed the circuit; or in
experiments 3, 5, 9, when a circuit was formed between the inside and outside of the
gut? Did not the failure arise in these instances in consequence of the absence of
one necessary condition, the flowing of the blood from the same part, the transmis-
sion of the carrying particles from one electrode to the other, as shown in experi-
ments 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7?

Without entering into any discussion as to the mode in which the effect may be
supposed to be brought about in the living animal, and the difference obseryed when
the stomach and other parts were formed into circuits in rabbits, and when the same
circuits were formed in cats, we may be justified in adding the following to.
