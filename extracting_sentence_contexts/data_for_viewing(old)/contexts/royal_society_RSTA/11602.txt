air at this stage, because the piston is slowly floating upwards, and the water filling
the narrow space round the piston has therefore a comparatively great downward
velocity. Diffusion of the air upwards through this water is thus prevented.

Then T, is closed, and some of the gas to be investigated drawn into B by lowering
R, and opening T,. It is then driven into A by opening T, and raising R,, T, being
closed. This pumping process is repeated till the pressure in A is rather in excess of
what is required.

The gas which remains in B is driven out through T;, which is then closed, and T,
opened for a moment, so that the narrow-bore tube and stop-cock are filled with
water. It is necessary, of course, for this purpose that R, should be raised high
enough to overcome the pressure in A; it is, in fact, now kept permanently fixed at
such a level throughout all subsequent operations.

The excess of water always remaining above the piston in A at this stage is now
allowed to escape by applying sufficient pressure below to drive the piston up a little.
The pressure is applied by pumping air into C, by means of the mercury compressing
pump shown at the extreme left of the diagram, The plug G is then pushed up and
the piston thus allowed to fly back into the constriction.

To prevent contamination of the gas, the glass taps T, T, T, are lubricated with
water only. The only one which requires to be used after the above operations are
completed is T,. Since this is filled with water under considerable pressure, there is
no danger of air gaining access through it.
