Z—W cot (u+-17)
cot (u-+7) +cot (A—r
(—W, Z) with respect to the axes (x”,z”) (figure 16) so that cot (7—A,) = Z/W, A, <r.
(50) can be put in a more convenient form if we write

where x’

> and the value of /, is given for a point with co-ordinates

= Ce tant for A>7,
z tang
ax tand
and eae aaa for A<r. We also denote tan7/tany = ¢,, so that p goes from +1 to —a, across the space M’z” and
o goes from g, to 1 across z’M. If then we put /,(A) = g,(c), etc., we find from (50) after
some reduction

#0) =20-o e+e’ aay. (51)

This expression in fact gives, over the aerofoil and to the left of it within the Mach cone, the
‘reflected’ wave corresponding to the wave g,(7) coming from the edge Oz’. The complete
solution can then be written, for points on the aerofoil surface

6Z r

where 1 denotes the plane wave, and successive g,’s are to be derived from the recurrence

relation (51). Also

The convergence of the series has not been investigated in detail.
