where y = T/27X. As

for R(a + B) > 0 and U > T/z, it follows that

as yO. In fact, this is an identity. Note that (2.1) is the limiting case when a, 6 > 0 of
this identity.

When we pass to higher moments, the corresponding identities will be consequences of
conjectures rather than facts. Thus, it is desirable to give a direct proof of this now, one that can
be imitated later.

Proof. Write =a + B. We can extend the integration in v down to v =0 as the integrand is 0
for 0 <v <y. We will show that
