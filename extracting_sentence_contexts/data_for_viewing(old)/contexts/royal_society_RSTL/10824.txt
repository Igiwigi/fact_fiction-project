45 centims. Even s8uch small jets are capable of transmitting speech loudly and
distinetly ; but it is difficult to get from them a good nappe, the liquid having a great
tendency to accumulate on the electrodes instead of flowing evenly away. When the
nappe is very small, the electrodes may therefore advantageously be formed by the
exposed ends of two fine platinum wires,

With these 8mall instruments it is easy to demonstrate all the principal properties
of jets; the absence of spontaneous vibrations, the dependence of the pitch of the
fundamental tone and of range of sensitiveness on the diameter of the orifice and
the pressure, the growth of disturbances along the jet path, &e.

There are two ways in which the jet may be supposed to act on the electric current.
It is a fact of observation that the diameter of a vibrating jet at any point is constantly
varying ; and we may suppose the successive protuberances and constrietions which
it exhibits, and which appear in the nappe as waves radiating from the point of
impact, to interpose a continually changing resistance in the circuit ; or again, the
interruptions to the electric flow may take place at the contact of the liquid with
the electrodes, being due to changes in the character of the motion, rectilinear or
rotatory, of the liquid particles. Probably, as I hope to show, the effect is a
compound one, due to both causes.

That the firs of these hypotheses is amply sufficient to account for the observed
