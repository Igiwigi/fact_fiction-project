Sthe engine, and the change of angle is, indeed, taken advantage of to close or open the

Ssteam-supply valve. Tn order to close the steam- (or throttle-) valve the angle of rotation

Zhas to be increased, which necessitates a corresponding increase of the engine's velocity ;

Aon the other hand, an increase of the yalve-orifice cannot be effected without a reduction
of the specd of the engine taking place.

Considering this dependence of the action of the instrument upon permanent change
of speed of the engine, the name of © governor” seems inappropriate, the insfrument
being, in fact, only a © moderator” of the amount of fluctuation to which the engine
would be 8ubjected without its agency. The amount of these fluctuations depends, in a
great measure, upon the mechanical construction of the instrument, which is, generally
peaking, very objectionable, inasmuch as the pendulous arms are mostly snspended at
points beside the common axis of rotation, giving rise to an increased variation of time
for a given change of angle; the reason being that the true pendulous length has to
be measured from the point of intersection of the pendulums or rods with the axis of
