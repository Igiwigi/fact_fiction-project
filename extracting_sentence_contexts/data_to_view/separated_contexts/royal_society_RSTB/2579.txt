I have explained under Zurbinaria how the development of the mural invagination
previously to the septal invaginations is correlated (1) with the introduction outside
the polyp of new costal invaginations not represented by septa, and (2) with the
invagination of those parts of the aboral body-wall of the eoenosare which correspond
to the mesenterial parts of the body-wall of the polyp. Tn these ccenosarcal invagina-
tions synapticular structures form, which are practically side-growths of the costal
structures (antea, p. 209). The same explanation may be extended to Madrepora,
with the additional fact ofa much more rapid tangential expansion of the polypal
and ccenosareal body-wall, and consequently the introduction at the mural part of the
polyp of a greater number of coste without relation to septa. . Unlike Hupsammia, no “area of divergence” is present between the septal and
costal parts of the radial structures (“septa”) in Turbinaria or Madrepora. Its
absence is another feature correlated with the contemporaneity or priority in develop-
ment of the wall-ring of calcification relative to the radial structures,
