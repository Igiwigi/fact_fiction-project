768 MR. BRODIE ON THE CONDITION OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS

In contact with strong hydrochloric acid hydrogen is evolved, and the protochloride
of copper, Cuy Cl, formed. Both substances are decomposed, and Wurz satisfied
himself, and gives the experiments, which show that the yolume of the hydrogen
evolved was the double of that due to the simple decomposition of the substance. - I
will add the remark which he makes on this experiment :—* On sait que Vacide
chlorhydrique n'attaque le cuivre qu'avec une extreme difficult6, et la presence de
Ihydrogene, loin de favoriser la reaction, devrait, Capres les lois de Taffinit6, y
ajouter un nouvel obstacle. La d6composition de Vhydrure de cuivre par Vacide
chlorhydrique parait done seffectuer en vertu d'une action de contact#,”

This fact, the conception of which offers these theoretical difficulties, becomes per-
fectly intelligible, and indeed might have been predicted from the principles I have laid
down. The decompoxsition is perfectly similar to that of the suboxide of copper under
analogous circumstances, arises from the same cause, and may be expressed thus—

+ = +=
Cu, H HCl=Cu, Cl+H,.

'This experiment enables us to see clearly the canse of a class of decompositions very
analogous to it, and which have presented similar theoretical difficulties. An alloy
of platinum and silver will dissolve in nitric acid, which will not act upon the plati-
num alone; acids will, in like manner, dissolve the alloy of copper and zinc}, which
