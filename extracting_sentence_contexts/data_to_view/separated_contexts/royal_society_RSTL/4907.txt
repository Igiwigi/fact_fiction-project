For some time after the emergence of the young from the ovum and
before the development of the branchial, pedal, and tentacular appendages, the chyl-
aqueous fluid is a limpid, transparent, non-corpusculated liquid. It bears not a trace
of floating corpuscles. This fact is full of interest. As the worm progresses in growth,
s0 the corpuscles slowly appear in the chylaqueous fluid. The blood and the blood-
system are produced before the floating cells are generated in the chylaqueous fluid.
