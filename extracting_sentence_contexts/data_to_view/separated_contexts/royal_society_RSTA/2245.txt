Furthermore, the direct influence on F4 is hidden: for A =1, a switch from context 3
to context 4 changes F4 from 1 to —1, whereas for A = —1 the same switch of context changes F4
from —1 to 1. These opposing influences cancel out in the margin. This situation illustrates the
general fact that causal models for contextual systems always exist, but they must include hidden
direct influences. The PR box is a partitionable system, and can be written as K = {1,2} and Q) = {1,3},
Qp = {2,4}. That is, observer 1 measures observable 1 or 3, and observer 2 measures observable
2 or 4.
