but the resemblances may not be wholly without significance. In the case of wood it
is held that the planes of slipping are not orientated in relation to any real crystallo-
graphic axes, but that they approximate to the planes of maximum shearing
according to the direction of the stress, ‘he orientation of these planes, however,
is never 45°, as for isotropic substances, but is modified for particular stresses by the
previous plastic deformations the wall-substance has undergone in the developmental
history of the cell-walls. The above explanation of the mechanical anisotropy of the
cell-walls of wood in my view, also satisfactorily explains the anisotropy in regard to
their other main physical properties. The hypothesis that the mechanical anisotropy,
as well as the double refraction and visible structure of the cell-walls may be explained
as a result of mechanical causes operating on the substance of the cell-wall in the
course of its development from a highly viscous fluid to a more rigid condition, has
been framed almost solely in relation to facts derived from the study of the mechanical
properties of wood. Further detailed investigation of the properties of the cell-wall

in plants over a wider and more varied field will show whether the hypothesis can
have a more generalised application. ;
