(s/o small), we may neglect the former as compared with the latter, and we have
thus the basis of a method of approximation very useful in some cases.

I have not yet succeeded in giving a geometrical interpretation to the above
formule, but have little doubt that it would be quite easy if the “ spherical ”
geometry of four dimensioned space were more familiar to me. It will suffice to

s in which the correlation of a non-directly

observe that it is easy to find case:
selected organ with a directly selected organ, or with another of its own class, can

be reduced, destroyed, increased, or reversed. In fact, all our previous warnings as
to the caution necessary in avoiding unintentional selection in collecting material for
testing correlation remain in force, and, indeed, are emphasised.

The following, illustrations will indicate the kind of problems which may be

attacked by such formule as the above :—

(8). Innusrration L—Jnfluence of « Selection of the Long Bones of the Leg on the
Long Bones of the Arm, and on the Relation of the Leg to the Arm.

A numerical example will throw light on the application of the above formule, and
effectively illustrate the manner in which a selection influences size, variation, and
