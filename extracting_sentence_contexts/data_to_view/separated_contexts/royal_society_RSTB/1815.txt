33, bear
out these results ; the sporogenous groups are easily distinguished at this stage, as
packets of 2 or 4 cells ; it is to be noted that neither at this, nor at any later stage,
is there any indication that the intervening tissue represents the fused walls of
confluent sporangia; the developmental evidence, though it does not directly dis-
prove, does not in any measure contribute to prove any hypothesis of coalescence
of distinct sporangia, either in this, or in other genera of Marattiacee. Later
stages (fig. 38) show that there is no exact type or form of segmentation of the
several sporogenous groups, a conclusion which might have been anticipated fiom
comparison of fig. 37, as well as of the mature sporangia, and of the facts relating to
Danea. Tangential sections of the sorus are difficult to obtain so as to give easily intel-
ligible results, owing to the curved form of the sporangium ; but if a section be cut
in the direction XX, fig. 34, the appearance presented will be as in fig. 39, in which
it is easy to see how the several tissues will correspond.
