A Man of Culture, but with no Special Knowledge of Spectroscopy. This case was in some respects unusual. The spectrum was not shortened, and
in fact, extended farther into the red beyond A and into the violet beyond K than
with most normal-sighted persons. But his description of the colours of the
spectrum was abnormal. It was as follows :—‘“ There are two principal colour-
changes, namely, from red to green (at 45905) and from green to blue (at 4810),
of which the latter is the more definite.” So far, both of these agree sufficiently
well with the normal junction of red with green and the effective end of the green
for him to pass as normal sighted.
