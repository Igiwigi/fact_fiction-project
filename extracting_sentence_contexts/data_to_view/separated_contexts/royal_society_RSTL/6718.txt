As regards the mucus, an exaggerated notion may be formed, respecting its amount and
importance, if an examination of the stomach be made when even a short time only has
been allowed to elapse after death. With the rabbit, for example, under such circum-
stances, on opening the stomach a more or less thick, pulpy, white pellicle is found to
adhere to the mass of food which the organ contains. 'This, however, consists of

digested mucous membrane; for, examined immediately after death, the stomach lifts
off from the food, leaving the latter uncovered by anything that is visible. 'The mucous
membrane itself, also, is firm in structure throughout. That the stomach cannot derive its protection from the epithelial layer, as suggested,
is proved by the fact, that a patch of mucous membrane may be removed, and food will
afterwards be digested without the slightest sign of attack being made upon the deeper
coats of the organ. LI have several times performed the experiment, to enable me to speak
safely on the point, and never have I had the slightest evidence, that depriving the
stomach of a portion of its mucous membrane has left the denuded part in a position of
greater insecurity than the rest, on the score of liability to digestive attack. It is upon
the dog that these experiments have been made; and, upon one occasion, after removing
the mucous membrane, and exposing the muscular fibres over a space of about an inch
and a half in diameter, the animal was allowed to live for ten days.
