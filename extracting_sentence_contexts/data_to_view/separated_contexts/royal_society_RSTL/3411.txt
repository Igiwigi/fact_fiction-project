By my
observations there was no dip at the northern extremity of St. Thomas in May
1822; and by Captain ALten's obseryations made at its southern extremity in 1833,
allowing for the twenty-five miles distance apart of the two places of observation,
the sonth dip at the northern extremity in December 1833 appears to have been
about 7* S., showing a secular change of 7* in 114 years, or on the average 39' in each
year. Taking into account the angle which the lines of dip in that quarter make with
the meridian, the intersection of the line of no dip and the geographical equator
should be transferred to the westward, by a secular change of that amount, at an
annual rate of half a degree. It would also follow, that in 1833 the line of no dip
should be found, in or near the meridian of St. Thomas, about 343® to the north of
the position it occupied in 1822; and that this was very nearly the fact we may infer
from Captain Aruex's observations at Fernando Po in 3* 45' N. latitude, which gave
in December 1833 a dip of 0* 48' N.

Messrs. DuxLoe and SULivan's intensity results in the Atlantic Ocean are shown
in Plate V., where also the isodynamic lines are drawn with the best approximation
afforded by the observations hitherto obtained, including the present. Mr. DuxLoe's
results are distinguished by inclined figures placed on the left of the station marks,
and Lieut. Sultvan's sea results by inclined figures placed on the right of the station
marks : his land results are shown by upright figures.
