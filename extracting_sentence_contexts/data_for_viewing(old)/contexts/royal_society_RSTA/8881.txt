on in obtaining this part of the curve. The numbers written alongside the points
marked © indicate the order in which these points were determined. It should be
mentioned that point 1 is unreliable owing to a very rapid change in the standard current
when it was determined.

The second series of points indicate a small but definite falling off in the saturation
currents with rising potentials. This may be due to some bias of chance errors, but
it does not seem likely to be, as the data for the first series also support it. There-is no
evidence of such an effect in the COCI, data for the spherical electrode plotted in fig. 4,
but it may be masked by the errors of observation. In fact, the experimental data
which look most reliable for this part of the curve point to a rising current with rising
negative voltages in those experiments. On the other hand, although the matter was
not explicitly tested at the time the experiments were made, the chlorine data which
form the basis of fig. 7 show, on re-examination, a distinct drooping tendency towards
higher voltages. The evidence is thus not clear that this tendency is peculiar to the
cylindrical anode. It may be illusory, but that is unlikely. It may be a general effect
present with the spherical electrodes, but masked by errors. There are several physical
effects which the electric field might exert on the drops which might give rise to such
a phenomenon.
