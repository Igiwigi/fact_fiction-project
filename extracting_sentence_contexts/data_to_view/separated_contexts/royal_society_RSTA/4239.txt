In support of this statement it may be
entioned that the deep blue ion of FrHLinc’s solution, which has as much right to be called copper as
as the deep blue ion of WHETHAM’S experiment, can be proved by direct observation to be a negative
Qion, which travels towards the anode while its associated K ions carry the current towards the cathode. This observation led the author, in conjunction with B. D. STEELE, to an investigation of the cupro-
tartrates, which they propose to communicate to the Chemical Society. Attention is there directed to
earlier evidence of the same fact adduced by others. * Some trials were made with agar-agar in place of gelatine.
