It must be assumed, also, that
prolonged or extreme augmentor action causes, as in the case of maximal contraction
of other muscles of the body, fatigue which will not only lessen the force of these
maximal contractions, but will in the case of the heart, for a time varying with the
nutrition of the individual, diminish the force of the ventricular contractions which
are carried on after the augmentors have ceased to be excited. We would expect,
therefore, that a heart whose powers had been oversirained, would remain dilated for
a varying time after the work thrown upon it had ceased to be increased. There is
nothing in this contradictory to the fact that, with repeated great augmentor action,
under favourable conditions, the heart becomes hypertrophied. This is only what
takes place in the case of all muscles of the body. In a healthy heart, whether there
be augmentor action or no, dilation and fatigue are synonymous terms.
