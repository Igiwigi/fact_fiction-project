With regard to the conclusion that syngamy is not a necessity for continued
existence (in Paramecium, or other Protozoa, for that matter), and that Ciliates are
able to live and multiply asexually for an indefinite number of generations, I think
the force and importance of this conclusion are very greatly minimised by the

a qualification which invariably has to be attached, namely, in fwrouwrable conditions.

process, in one form or another, is of widespread occurrence among the Protozoa, and
appears to be, in fact, practically speaking, a necessity. This is, indeed, at the present
day, almost a truism, but it is one which is badly in need of re-statement. In my
opinion, the most important deduction to be drawn from these Ciliate experiments is
not that under certain special circumstances they can exist without syngamy, but
that it is the ordinary conditions of the natural environment which are primarily
responsible for and necessitate the occurrence of syngamy in the Protozoa.
