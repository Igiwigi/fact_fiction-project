These I take
to be the openings for the venous stream. â€˜Text-fig. 11 (I.V.). Tt is, of course, impossible to speak with certainty, but the fact that the lining
layer alluded to in connection with the presumably arterial channels is in direct
continuity with the walls of the channels in the stroma, and nearly always shows a
very sharp boundary line between itself and the trophoblast, points to its being ot
maternal origin, and probably an ingrowth of cells along the channels of the arterial
stream,

These facts I have shown diagrammatically in text-fig. 11, page 185. This arrangement of blood supply is very usual in placentas, by means of which
the maternal arterial blood is taken at once to the foetal side of the placenta.
