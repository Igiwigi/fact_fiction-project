In the cross U2. biennis 2 x Gi. muricata ft, the
(2. biennis nucleus is said to be destroyed and its place taken by G2. muricata. Thus
the hybrids with G2. muricata cytoplasm have nothing but 2. biennzs chromatin,
while those with U2. biennis cytoplasm have nothing but 2. muricata chromatin. If confirmed, these facts would fall in line with the elimination described above,
with the difference that in this case the whole of the female portion of the zygote
would be eliminated, instead of a few chromosomes. We thus have a complete series from cases in which the male pronucleus degenerates
to a condition where the female substance is entirely eliminated :—

1. Echinus 3 x Mytilus ¢ —Kuretwirser (48).
