— aharmonic polynomial for Almgren’s monotonicity function;2

— global profiles for a free boundary problem, e.g. through Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman (ACF)-
monotonicity function, see §3.

It should be pointed out that uniqueness for the tangent cone in minimal surfaces was proved
by Simon [1], who treated the problem in a way that is reminiscent of convergence for time
tending to infinity in an evolution equation.?

For a minimal surface, the ratio E(r,S,z) = E(1,S;,0) grows from the plane configuration, Sp ~
plane, to a higher oscillatory surface S,.

Another simple monotonicity formula is given by the fact that if u is harmonic, |V(w)|/? is
subharmonic and thus its average in B, increases with r, i.e. the average energy of a subharmonic
function over B,(z) increases in r. This can also be written as the average of the square of the
H'/?.norm of the trace.

Ina similar vein, Almgren’s monotonicity formula A(r) (see [2]) the ratio, properly normalized
on the sphere of radius r, of the square of the H 1/2_norm of the trace over the square of the L2-
norm of the function, i.e for a harmonic function A(r) is the Rayleigh quotient of the H!/? norm
and it increases as we diverge from a point.

For the Signorini problem, once we look at convex solutions, there are three candidates:
the solution, the tangential derivative and the normal derivative. The solution changes sign,
so it is not a good choice. Between the normal and tangential derivative, we ask which one
