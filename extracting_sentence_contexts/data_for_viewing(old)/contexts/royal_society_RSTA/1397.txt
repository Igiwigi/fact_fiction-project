for super-CC behaviour of convective extremes [4,6,9,22,23]. Likewise, changes in atmospheric
conditions tied to the seasonal cycle have been proposed to influence scaling rates [14]. Finally, it
has been proposed that super-CC scaling may be due to the use of percentiles conditional on



the occurrence of rain [16,24]. Given these potential caveats, one may question the relevance
of apparent scaling in understanding future changes to precipitation extremes. Sensitivities to
short-term variability, called apparent scaling, may not be representative of long-term changes to
precipitation extremes due to climate change, hereafter called climate scaling.

We believe that a considerable part of the criticism on the usefulness of apparent scaling is
related to the fact that most papers on scaling use dry bulb temperature as the scaling variable
[12,13,25,26]. The majority of published scaling studies use dry bulb temperature—often because
humidity data is lacking—and with dry bulb temperature widely varying scaling behaviour has
been obtained, highly dependent on location and season. The fundamental problem with (dry
bulb) temperature scaling—as opposed to dew point temperature scaling—is that temperature
alone is not a reliable indicator of the actual humidity of the air. Therefore, if higher temperatures
are not associated with higher moisture content (roughly following the CC rate), it is hard to see
what one could learn from temperature scaling in a climate change context; indeed it is the actual
moisture increase of the atmosphere which is responsible for the expected increase in precipitation

extremes, not the temperature itself [3]. : =
