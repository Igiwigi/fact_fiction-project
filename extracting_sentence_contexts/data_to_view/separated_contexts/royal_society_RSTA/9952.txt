P. 0. PEDERSEN ON THE SURFACE-TENSION OF LIQUIDS

Grunmacn’s results. I cannot, however, omit to draw attention to the fact that the
mutual agreement between GruNMACH'S values is only small. Within the first group
of measurements the deviation amounts up to 16 per cent., and for the last to 3°9

per cent. The lowest of GRUNMACH’s values in the two cases are

Ts = 70°4 dyne/em. and T,; = 74'2 dyne/cm.
