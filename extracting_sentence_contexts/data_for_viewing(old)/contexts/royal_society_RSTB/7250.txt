X. Errects OF HUMIDITY ON THE GROWTH OF FLEA LARVAE AND PUPAE

The water requirements of larvae of the three species of rat-fleas are fairly high, for they
cannot be maintained at lower than 50% R.H., at which they died of dehydration without
any signs of growth (table 4). A fairly wide range of optimum and high humidities, at the
same temperature, did not influence their active larval and combined larval and pupal
durations (figures 1 to 4), although in many cases slight but significant differences were
observed at different favourable humidities (table 24),

The humidity range for the development of rat-flea larvae, being dependent on their
water requirements, varies in different species ; it was slightly wider in X. cheopis (figures 1, 2)
but much narrower in X, astia (figure 4) than in X. brasiliensis (figure 3). This fact contra-
dicts the assumption of Hirst (1926, p. 250) that ‘Y. cheopis is somewhat less adapted to

survive extremes of dryness than X. astia’. The range of effective humidities for these larvae
also varied with the temperature; it was wide at 27° C, and gradually narrowed, as
a temperature departed from it on either side; at 38° C the larvae of X. astia (tables 4, 31)
only grew with 80 and 90% r.u. This should not happen, if a particular saturation
deficiency is essential for their growth. I cannot agree with Buxton (1938, p. 527) that ‘at
higher temperatures the larvae will be found to tolerate drier air because they develop
more quickly, and are therefore exposed for a shorter time’. At higher temperatures the
