DNA bar-
coding also has a strong role in species discovery, especially in
little-studied groups, because it can rapidly screen collections
for presumptive species, which can then be targeted for taxo-
nomic study [103]. DNA barcodes are additionally being
employed to streamline and expedite species descriptions
[104]. In fact, in hyperdiverse groups, the BIN registry may
be the terminal taxonomic system, one allowing the assembly
of morphological, ecological and distributional data for the
members of each barcode cluster.

(b) Probing species assemblages

DNA barcoding is a powerful tool for advancing knowledge of
species interactions and distributions [98,99]. It is often the sole
way to clarify dietary preferences in taxa where direct obser-
vation of feeding behaviour is impossible [105,106]. It can also
provide new details on hostâ€”parasitoid interactions [107], on
pollination syndromes [108,109] and on symbiotic associations
[110,111].
