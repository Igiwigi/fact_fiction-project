cannot under ordinary cireumstances be the same on any two days,—the disturbing
influence of unusually large or often repeated quantities of a substance, and lastly, the
unknown influence of other articles of food, varying in quantity and quality,—it is easy
to sce how difficult it would be for M. Borker to eliminate the normal and true effect
of the article under inquiry. He found that sugar, coffee, and alcohol lessened the
respiratory changes, and that in their principles of action they are identical ; but he
then inquires how it is, if this be 80, that they act as antidotes to each other? It will
be shown that my results do not accord with his. Mr. M1xERQ, Surgeon to the
Government Prison at Wakefield, in a paper which he recently read before the British
Axociation, states that he had proved by experiment that tea given to the prisoners,
whether in lieu of, or in addition to their ordinary food, caused them to lose weight at

an increasing rate,—a fact which supports my results on the action of that substance.
My experiments have been made chiefly upon myself, wt. 39, and upon Mr. Movr, wt. 48
(a gentleman whose devotion to the inquiry in the interests of science is beyond all
praise), but in a few instances upon others alsv. The plan pursued was as follows :—
A quantity of the substance under inquiry, not greatly different from that ordinarily
taken by mankind, was administered apart from any other food. 'The experiments were
nearly all made from 7 to 9 4.M., before breakfast ; but some were made at 2 P.M., after
the influence of the breakfast had passed over. All were made in the sitting posture,
and in the absence of all exertion and mental and bodily excitement. Hence we isolated
the influence of the substance, and made one long series of experiments under precisely
