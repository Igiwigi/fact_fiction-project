306 MR. GRAY ON TESTACEOUS MOLLUSCA,

2. Of Species belonging to the same natural Genus, inhabiting essentially different
Situations,

The general belief that all the species of the same genus inhabit the same kind of
Situation, undoubtedly holds good with reference to most of the genera of shells;
but many exceptions have already been observed, and we may anticipate that many
inore will be discoyered as the natural habits of the different species become better
known. In bringing together a number of these exceptions, I have been under the
necessity of placing considerable reliance on the observations of others, who have
noted in foreign countries facts similar to those which I have myself witnessed at
home; but these observations have been chiefly collected from the works of Pro-
fessor Nits80Nn of Sweden, of Mr. Say of the United States of North America, and
of MM. Lzss0N, Quoy, and Rane of Paris, writers who, from their extensive know-
ledge of conchology, are fully capable of accurately recording their observations, and
whose statements may therefore Ã¾e received as deserying of the most implicit confi-
dence. It is moreoyer to be observed, that all their observations on this subject were
made simply with the view of extending the knowledge of the history of the species
to which they refer, and without reference to the establishment of any preconceived
theory.

These obseryations may be classed under the four following subdivisions : 1st, where
species of the same genus are found in more than one kind of situation, as on land,
