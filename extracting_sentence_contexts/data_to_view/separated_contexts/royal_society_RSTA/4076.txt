After including the in situ geometrical imperfections and the fibre crookedness in the
FE model (model II), the predicted elastic moduli reduced the respective model I values (e.g.
warp-directional modulus 34.12 GPa and weft-directional modulus 39.95 GPa) by only 2.2% in
the warp and 2.3% in the weft directions. As we can see, there is a reduction in stiffness after
including the geometric imperfections. For this hybrid configuration, the weft direction is stiffer
than the warp direction due to the fact that there is one additional glass fibre tow layer in the weft
direction, as summarized in table 7. The weft direction tensile strength was found to be 467.61 MPa and the warp direction strength
was 446.81 MPa, as reported in table 8 for model I; the former is 4.7% larger due to a 5.8% higher
