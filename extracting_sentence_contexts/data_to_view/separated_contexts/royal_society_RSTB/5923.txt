To it
there is still adherent in places evident traces of the matrix in which it was originally
imbedded, and the latter also resembles in all respects the travertine of Sinanthropus
Locus B.

Up to 1930, when the Geological Survey finally acquired title to the Choukoutien site,
considerable difficulty had at times been experienced in preventing access of unauthorized
persons to the areas of our Locality 1 excavations ; and on not a few occasions material
certainly derived from the latter was subsequently brought in for sale, with the story
that it had been found elsewhere. Up to the present, during our own extensive exca-
vations of Locality 3 and other fossiliferous Choukoutien deposits, no Sinanthropus
material of any kind has been encountered except in Locality 1. We are therefore
inclined to believe it to be highly improbable that this fossilized radius fragment was,
in fact, originally derived from Locality 3. On the other hand, in view of the circum-
stantial evidence of its history, the specimen cannot certainly be ascribed to Locality 1,
so that its true origin remains obscure. Lower Extremity of Sinanthropus.
