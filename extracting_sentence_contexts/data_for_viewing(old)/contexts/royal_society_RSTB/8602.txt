Insect vectors are responsible for almost 20 per cent of all infectious diseases
affecting people in developing countries [1]. This review focuses on mosquitoes
as they are the commonest disease carriers for a host of parasites such as bac-

virus and other viral encephalitides. Their medical importance is reflected by
the fact that they were among the first wave of genomes to be sequenced,

[4]. This has revealed an extensive repertoire of P450s (more than 100) allowing
the development of new tools for investigating the functional role of mosquito
P450s and their relationships with insecticide metabolism.

The fight against diseases spread by mosquitoes has enormous environ-
mental, economic and social consequences. Chemical insecticides remain the
first line of defence but the control of disease is being undermined by resistance.
P450s have been fundamental to the successful adaptation of insects to diverse
habitats [5,6], thus the highly evolved P450 repertoire of mosquitoes provides
excellent protection against insecticides and other xenobiotics, a subject that
has been well reviewed [5,7,8]. However, there is limited knowledge about
