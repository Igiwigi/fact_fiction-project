with little jerks, before the object was finally bisected, the error just described
was obviated. It would perhaps, however, be preferable, instead of giving
motion to the instrument by means of a tangent screw acting on the cireum-
ference of the circle, to have a bar, connected at one end with a tangent
screw, and a collar at the other end passing round the axis, to which it might
be clamped at pleasure. The axis would then be the first part moved, and
the probable error arising from dragging the instrument round by the limb
would be ayoided. This arrangement seems to be particularly called for in
cireles of large dimensions.

The errors which may arise from lateral refraction have often been sus-
pected but never clearly ascertained. In the course of our work, however, we
had snch eyidence of the fact as to leave no doubt of its existence. The angle
between the same objects would differ under the most favourable circum-
stances about five seconds on different days, and perhaps a second and a half
or two 8econds may be considered as the error which may affect an angle
from lateral refraction in an ordinary state of the atmosphere. During the
obseryations at Stede Hill one fine day, the telescope being directed to the
staff at Wrotham, a shower rapidly approached from the left, and the staff
gradually receded from the cross wires until it was obscured by the inter-
vening haze. At Leith Hill, after unfavourable weather, it cleared up in the
evening, and though there was no wind, very extraordinary differences were
perceived in the angles, for which it would have been difficult to assign any
other cause than lateral refraction, varying considerably at short intervals.
