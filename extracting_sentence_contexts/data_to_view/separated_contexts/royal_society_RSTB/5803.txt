In the Negro, however (BRopMANN, loc. cit. swpra), and also as it seems in the
Egyptian and Australian, the lunate frequently extends rather far on the convexity
(to the lambdoid suture, SHELLSHEAR)}, and the same has been observed in Egyptian
Fellaheen by Exxior Smrrx (1904) and in the Madurese by Van Noort (loc. cit. infra). Although a larger number of brains is necessary for reliable statistical figures, such
facts—not generally correlated with skull form, or even the reverse of what might be
expected in such skulls—are the most valuable ones for anthropological studies on
the brain. The question becomes much more difficult if a primitive arrangement may be corre-
lated with the primitive frontally sloping skull alone as well as with a primitive encephalic
relation, as is the case with the frontal and temporal sulci. In order to trace the latter we have to start with the brains of extinct human races.
