The length of exposure required was found to be equivalent to about 35 minutes
of continuous sparking, or on the average from 4 to 5 hours, intermittent exposure. In these initial experiments the results obtained were far from satisfactory. This was
due to the fact that the grating employed was an old one and badly tarnished, and also
to the fact that it was not ruled according to the special method required for very short
wave-lengths. The shortest wave-length recorded was about 900 A.U. Due to the kindness of Prof.
