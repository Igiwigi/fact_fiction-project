Here, therefore, is represented the *follicular* stage of the development of a mammalian
tooth ; but the © eruptive ' stage takes place without previous inclosure of the follicle and
matrix in the substance of the jawbone.” (Anatomy of Vertebrates, vol. i. P: 382.) A much more accurate account of the process as it occurs in the mackerel is em-
bodied in Professor Huxrer's paper, already several times alluded to; the fact that the
Papilla is never free and that it is surmounted by an enamel-organ derived from and
continuous with the oral epithelium is clearly laid down ; and KotykeR mentions that
the teeth of all osseous fish are developed. in sacs not altogether from free papille. Nevertheless the exact nature of the process has not, 80 far as I know, been described
by any previous author.
