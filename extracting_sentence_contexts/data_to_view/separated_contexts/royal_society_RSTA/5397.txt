Sphere uses the same basic idea, but extends this paradigm to wide-area
distributed computing. Many of the GPGPU algorithms and applications can be
adapted and run in a distributed fashion using Sphere. In fact, it is this analogue to
GPGPU which inspired our work on Sphere. There are some important differences though: Sphere uses heterogeneous
distributed computers connected by high-speed, wide-area networks instead of the
identical ALUs integrated in a GPU; Sphere supports more flexible movement of
data, but also requires load balancing and fault tolerance; finally, the bandwidth
setween Sphereâ€™s SPEs, although it may be up to 10 Gbs* |, is not even close to

he bandwidth within a GPU. Owing to these differences, Sphere runs a complete
orocessing function or program on each SPE, rather than one instruction.
