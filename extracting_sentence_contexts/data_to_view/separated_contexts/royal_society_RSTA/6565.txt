The numbers of Table 27 are curved in dotted lines in fig. 49, and on the same
form are curved, in thin lines, the observed lunar diurnal variations of horizontal
force, taken from Column 2 of Tables 5 to 8, for each of the eight phases of the moon. Here again the comparison of observation, as indicated by the thin-line curves, with the
formula, through its representative dotted curves, shows remarkably close agreement.

23. That in their more prominent inflexions the dotted curves of fig. 48 are generally
of smaller range than the thin-line curves is sufficiently explained by the fact that
the typical variations for each phase are averages for three or four consecutive days,
whilst the thin-line curves represent variations for first days, second days, third days,
&e., after new moon—all single days of the moon’s age. Indeed, it is easy to
show that the typical variations /,,(h), fi(h) should have been multiplied by
