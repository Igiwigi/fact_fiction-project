Received May 10,—Read June 6, 1901. As early as 1853 Herrorr (‘ Pogg. Ann.,’ vol.'89, 181, 1853), discussing the results of
his experiments, emphasised the fact, that a more detailed study of the movements of
the ions during electrolysis would result in an increased knowledge of the constitu-
tion of salts in solution. He himself, in a research extending over a number of years, (ibid., 89, 177, 1853 ;
98, 1, 1856; 106, 337 and 513, 1859,) determined the ratio of the velocities of the
two ions for a large number of salts, and the series of measurements has been further
extended by later investigators. (For the original literature on transport number
determination, see Bern, ‘ Zeitschrift fiir Phys.
