meristem.

Both leaf and bud primordia arise from equivalent groups of superficial meristematic
cells. In fact, the initial stages of bud and leaf formation are difficult to distinguish; each
begins as an outgrowth or mound of tissue in which, at an early stage, a centrally placed
apical cell is formed, all subsequent growth of the primordium being referable to this
apical cell. The chief differences between leaf and bud primordia are these: (i) leaf
primordia are formed on an organized apical meristem and nowhere else, whereas bud
primordia arise from a group of isolated meristematic cells lower down on the shoot,
i.e. there need not be a pre-existing organized meristem; (ii) leaves have dorsiventral
symmetry whereas buds have radial symmetry; and (iii) leaf formation and development
are not inhibited by an active apical cell whereas bud formation and development are.
These are among the facts of organ formation which await explanation.

Leaf primordia are formed on the sides or flanks of the conical apical meristem. As a consequence
of the distribution of growth at the apex (§§5(a) and 10(a)), the lower or abaxial side of
a primordium grows more rapidly than the upper or adaxial side, both in the transverse
and longitudinal planes. From the outset, therefore, there is a distinction of upper and
lower sides, i.e. dorsiventral symmetry is established. It is suggested that, as a consequence
of the different rates of growth on the upper and lower sides, a system of stresses is set up
in the young, plastic primordium, which determines the characteristic shape and orienta-
tion of its apical cell. This apical initial is lens-shaped—the so-called ‘two-sided’ apical cell
—and is disposed with one edge facing obliquely towards the apical cell of the shoot. In
this view, the shape and symmetry of the leaf primordium, and the character and dis-
position of its apical cell on which the subsequent development depends, are determined
