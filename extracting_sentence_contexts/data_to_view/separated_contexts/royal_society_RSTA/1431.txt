In the
case of FOSS, anyone who has a copy of a computer program can decide whether to distribute

copies of the program, and whether and how much to charge for them (§3bii). In the case of [=
proprietary software, the proprietor has sole discretion as to whether copies of the program can be : a
distributed, and under what conditions (the proprietor is the ‘owner’ of the software—technically, 73
the holder of the copyright or, equivalently, the licensor; §3bi). iy

Therefore, it is incorrect to juxtapose FOSS and commercial software as mutually exclusive fo
concepts: there is commercial software that is FOSS, and there is non-commercial software that : S
is proprietary ([28], p. 74). In fact, large fortunes have been accumulated over the past three : &
decades from the commercial distribution of FOSS, together with provision of related services : Ss
(e.g. support). 1S

Confusion linked to ‘open (source)’

A relevant notion here is the distinction between distribution of software with or without source
code. In one case, users have access to a human-readable version of the software; in the other,
access is restricted to the executable machine code compiled from the source code. The term
source-available designates any computer program for which the source code is available to view.
