plateau viscosity. So to derive the effective viscosity value, the magnitude of the shear rate is
defined as follows [59,60]:

lvl =V2Dn, (2.12)

with Dy being the double dot product of tensor E:
Dy =E:E. (2.13)

When referring to LBM many authors use the non-equilibrium distribution function for the
evaluation of the strain tensor [26,27,32,61]. Nevertheless, in a previous work the macroscopic
velocity gradients approach has been used for its stability in a wide number of conditions [60].
In this application, special treatment has to be used at interface where there is no possibility to
correctly evaluate the velocity gradient. In fact, at every interface node there is at least one gas
neighbour (not resolved as stated in §2c), thus, in this condition, velocity at neighbour gas node is
assumed to be equal to the value at donor interface cell—assuming a zero gradient approximation.
