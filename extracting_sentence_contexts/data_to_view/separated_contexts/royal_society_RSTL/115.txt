I generally make uſe of
thoſe, which hold ſeven or eight Ounces, and fill
them about four Fifths with Water ; and the Stroke
from one of theſe, under the fame Circumſtances, is
equally firong with that of a Florence Flask held in
the Hand, which I have ſometimes made_ uſe of;
though the Glaſs of this laſt is equally thin with that
of the Phial, and the Quantity of Water four times
as much. That the Stroke therefore is not as the
Quantity of Water electrified, is eyident from this
Experiment. This Fact does not depend upon my
Judgment alone, but likewiſe upon the Opinions of
ſeveral learned Members of this Society, who have
experienced the greater and leſs Quantity of Water.

F In this Experiment, and in others, wherein we alert, that the
Stroke is not increaſed in proportion to the Quantity of eleErified Mat-
ter ; it muſt always be underitood, that the excited Non-eleAtrics them-
ſelves are touched, without being contained in Originally eleQrics, as
Water in the Glaſs; for otherwiſe (as will hereafter be ſpecified) the
Effects of different Quantities of Matter will be very different.
