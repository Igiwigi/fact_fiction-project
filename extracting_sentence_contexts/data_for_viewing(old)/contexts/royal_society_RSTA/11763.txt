Electrical Distribution on an Equilibrium Surface.

17. The surface density at any point of a charged surface on which the electricity
is in equilibrium is found from the fact that the surface-integral of the normal electric
displacement taken over- any closed surface is equal to the quantity of electricity
within ‘that surface. Hence, if E, denote the electric force normal to the surface,
and o the surface density, we have, just as in electrostatics, when there are no
charges inside the surface,

vs KE, =o . . ae” . . . . . (79),

since by § 16 the electric force vanishes inside the surface.
The above statement refers to the case in which 0 = 0,
When 2 does not vanish, we have instead,
