Making these substitutions, and evaluating as usual, we get

Considering now the two parts of SS for given w, we see that the amplitudes are in the
ratio | ,¥|/|¥,| = 82(A+-2z)/2,*, which is small when (h+-z)/x is small. The phase of yz
exceeds that of —y, by +-4$7 according as #(w) = 0, so that the amplitude of the sum of
—y,and ,, differs from | y, | by a small quantity of the second order if (4 + z)/xis first order.
This corresponds to the fact that with plane waves for angles near grazing incidence no
energy goes into SP, SS being reflected with unchanged amplitude but changed phase
(Jeffreys 19265).

The above evaluation of ,y-, differs in one important respect from previous approximations
on I’,. Whereas approximations obtained from I’, hold (subject to the conditions stated)
as w approaches and crosses the imaginary axis of w, (11-27) holds only as long as I’, is not
too near I,. If Py lies so near to I’, that contributions to the contour integral in the neigh-
bourhood of «x, from I’, have to be taken into account, (11-27) breaks down. The same
condition holds near —x, when #(w) <0. In other words, (11-27) holds only as long as
arg lies outside — 47 -+-¢, where ¢ is a small angle determined by the nature of the integrand
in (11-24). Across this small sector there takes place a continuous transition between the
two expressions given in (11-27). We therefore obtain the response to H(#) as described in
