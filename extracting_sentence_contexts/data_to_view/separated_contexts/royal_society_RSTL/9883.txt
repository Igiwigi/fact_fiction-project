To determine 7, about five complete turns in either direction were given to the

upper end of the fibre. The difference of reading for one turn was found to be in
June 2:58, and in Augnst 2:45, If we take as the mean 2:51, we get

= —2 =-000075
Ein x 2670 {hs

Value of GK corrected for level and torsion. Calling the corrected value GK, we have

GK(1+ tan 1) __ 1:00019
GR=- 1+T —1-000075

GK

80 that
log GR=8-17686

The corrections are in fact almost insensible. Cateutation of U.

In this we take for GK the value just found. For L we take the mean of the
values found by @ priori calculation and by direct experiment, 1.e.,

1=2:4026 X 108.
