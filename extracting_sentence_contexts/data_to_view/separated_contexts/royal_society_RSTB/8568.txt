Mimic conditions provide a baseline that approximates what would happen during rivalry if perceptual suppression completely eradicated neural pro-
cessing of the suppressed image. A limitation of mimic conditions is that the perceptual match with real rivalry is only approximate. Notably, the dynamically
changing perceptual experiences accompanying wave-like dominance transitions are not captured by standard mimic conditions. (Online version in colour.)

In a related vein, the alternating monocular stimulation the build-up of pattern adaptation produced by rival gratings.

sufficient for that purpose. First, neural events associated with a consequence of the saturating contrast dependence of pattern
suppression of a stimulus are certainly not equivalent to adaptation [38].
