Thus, Hill’s generalization of the von Mises criterion is simply
a mathematical generalization. Still, one can argue that it is relevant to yielding of metals. Hill,
in fact, motivated his criterion from the need to describe yielding in metals that develop texture
from sheet forming by rolling, resulting in orthotropic symmetry. The Azzi-Tsai adaptation of
the Hill criterion to UD composites was motivated by assumed similarity of the rolling direction
in metal sheets and the reinforcing direction in UD composites. The final equation, referred to
as the Tsai—Hill criterion, was derived by equating the six yield stresses in the Hill criterion to
the corresponding ‘strengths’ of a UD composite, and further assuming transverse isotropy in
the composite cross-sectional plane.
