season,

tubes showed no signs of congestion, and the uteri were in the normal condition (the
resting stage). Ovaries from ewes killed in the middle of October showed that
the follicles were approaching ripeness, this being indicated by their increasing pro-
trusion. Near the end of the same month discharged follicles were first noticed.
Through the remainder of the year recently discharged follicles in sheepsâ€™ ovaries
were very commonly found. It was during the same period that the uterine stages
which characterise the sheep's dicestrous cycle were obtained.

The ancestrum of the summer months, then, is followed in the sheep belonging to
the above-mentioned breeds by a procestrum, and this is rapidly succeeded by the
period of cestrus (or period of desire).* In fact so rapidly does the cestrus follow the
procestrum, that in some cases where the changes characterising the procestrum are
slighter than usual, the two stages of the cycle seem almost to become one stage.
This subject will be dealt with more fully in the section of this paper describing the
histological changes through which the uterus of the sheep passes during the
dicestrous cycle. If a sheep is not permitted to be served by a ram, or fails to

* As far as I am able to judge, the prowstrum and cestrus together do not usually last for more than
two days with half-bred or pure-bred Scotch Black-faced ewes kept under fairly favourable conditions.
