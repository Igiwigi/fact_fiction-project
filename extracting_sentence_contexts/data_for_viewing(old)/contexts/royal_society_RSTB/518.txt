The authors call attention to the facts, which are clearly brought to view in the
above arrangement of their results, that the amounts, both of ammonia, and of soluble
amide obtained, increase with the strength of the acid, the time of contact, and the
temperature. They point out that these are products of the action of the acid on
certain insoluble nitrogenous bodies in the soil, and that the reaction is similar to that
which they have observed in the case of urea, asparagin, and oxamid—that is with
well defined amides. The insoluble nitrogenous compounds in the soil are in fact, as
previously supposed, amide bodies. They also call attention to the fact that when the
clear, filtered, acid extract is exactly neutralised by potash, one portion of the amide
still remains soluble, whilst another is precipitated, showing that the amides rendered
soluble constitute two groups. The fact of such re-precipitation is quite in accordance
with the results obtained in our own experiments, in which less nitrogen remained
dissolved after 24 than after only 1 hour’s contact, when, with the longer contact, the
acidity of the extract became neutralised.

A special point of interest in these results, as compared with those of Loss, is in
