The spatio-temporal c-index ranged from 72% to 88%

the amount of exposure. However, it takes into account only the
isolated effect from one predictor, while there are likely inter-
actions between the impacts of different aspects of climate
change. As an overall indicator of climate change impact, that sim-
ultaneously considers all predictors as well as their interactions,
we used the full IBM to generate abundance projections under
two scenarios: the factual, observed climate scenario and a coun-

(table 2), indicating moderate to excellent model fit depend-
ing on the species. The two measures ranked models in a
different order but the model for alpine accentor scored
best in both. Separately considering the spatial and temporal
predictive accuracy (electronic supplementary material, table
A.3) showed that all models had good to excellent accuracy in

ter-factual no-climate-change scenario, which consisted of trend- the spatial predictions, as the spatial AUC ranged from 74%
corrected predictors to simulate a stationary climate.
