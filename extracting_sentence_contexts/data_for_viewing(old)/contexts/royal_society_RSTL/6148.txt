the distance of the point from the pole of the line. The distance of a pole and polar is
therefore the complement of zero, that is, it is the quadrant.
S 215. It has, by means of the preceding assumption as to the quadrant, been possible
establish the notion of distance, without the assistance of the circle, but this figure
ust now be considered. A. conic inscribed in the Absolute is termed a circle; the
Lentre of inscription (or point of intersection of the common tangents) and the axis of
Anscription (or line of junction of the common ineunts) are the centre and axis of the
Sirele. All the points of a circle are equidistant from the centre; all the tangents are
-Squidistant from the axis, and this distance is the complement of the former distance,
= 216. These properties of the circle lead immediately to the analytical expressions for

For the point-equation of the Absolute ; its od will be

Ei he point-equation of the circle having the point (x, y/, 2') for its centre, is

Follows that the distance of the points (a, y, 2), (a, y', 2') is
