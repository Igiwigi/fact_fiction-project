Consider a positive lens (fig. 4), the initial ray converging to
I, and the final ray to I,. If now we interchange the full and dotted portions of the
initial and final rays in fig. 4, we obtain, since here the initial and final media are the

same, the case of a ray going through a lens in which the front and back character of
the two surfaces have been interchanged. In fact 7, and 7, have been interchanged
and the sign of the thickness Â¢, has been reversed. This leads to a negative lens, of
the same numerical power as the original positive lens, and with the same mean
curvature, but a negative thickness. Such a lens, of course, is not physically
realisable, although a part of it can be physically obtained by rotating the wedge
beyond the intersection V of the two surfaces.
