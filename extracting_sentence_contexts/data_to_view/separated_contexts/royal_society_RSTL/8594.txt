Approximate Theory of the Experiments. The exact theory of these experiments is rendered still more difficult by the fact that
the water-jet has a different radius at different places. But to obtain at least an
approximate s0lution of the problem we will assume a cylindrical form of the jet. In
accordance with our smoke-experiments, we assume further that all particles of air flow
through the aspirating tube in straight lines parallel to the tube's axis, which we take
for the axis of xy.
