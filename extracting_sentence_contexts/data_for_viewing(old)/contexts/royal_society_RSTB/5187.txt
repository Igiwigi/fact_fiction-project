colours alone remain visible, the red, orange, and yellow colours becoming dark purple,
grey and black, and so more or lessinvisible. This law, known as PURKINJE’s phenomenon,
can be observed by every one, and according to my experience holds true for the pan-
chromatic or colour-photographic plate as well. One would imagine that night animals
ought to possess eyes with green and prussian-blue backgrounds, such as we find in the
Ichneumon’s eye, instead of the red and orange fundi peculiar to the dusk- and night-
feeding animals.

4. Geckonidee.—Three out of the four genera of the Geckonide examined, viz. :
Hemidactylus, Pachydactylus, and Uroplates, have eyes with a red background.
They are all nocturnal. The day-feeding Gecko, Phleuma madagascariensis (Green
Gecko), has a grey fundus, which is rendered a still lighter grey by a dense layer of
superimposed nerve fibres. This fact lends additional support to the above statement.
All the Geckos have a large conical pecten which covers the entire disc. The background
is mottled with dark red spots. No trace of blood vessels is perceptible.

5. Lacertee.—(a) Iguanidee.—The background varies greatly in colour. In Anolis
the fundus is slate-grey, faintly mottled with light grey patches. The disc is circular,
white, and covered with a deep black cushion-like pecten. In Conolophus ecristatus, the

* The statement first made by Prof. Owen, and since then copied in innumerable text-books, to the

effect that the Apteryx does not possess a pecten, I proved to be erroneous in my “ Comp. Anat. of the
Mammalian Eye” (° Phil. Trans. R.S.’ (1901) ). See plate at the end of the work.
