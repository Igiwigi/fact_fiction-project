Induction of DNA damage by TFO-CPT or scPvull after transfection. A2780 cells were treated with 2 ..M of the hTFO-CPT conjugate (and hTFO for
control) or 1 jxg of scPvull. After 3 h, cells were collected and stained for phos-
phorylated H2AX (yH2AX) and analyzed by FACS. Transfections were performed
in duplicate for three independent experiments. Data are represented as means of
the means + s.e.m.
