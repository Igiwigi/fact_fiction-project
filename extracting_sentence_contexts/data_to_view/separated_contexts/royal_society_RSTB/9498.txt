The size of the thin anvils presents minimal variability,
Damage caused by flaking is determined by scars on the sur- expressed in all three dimensions of length, width and thick-

faces of the artefacts (figure 6). Six types of flaking damage were ness (table 2). The fact that the large majority of anvils

removal and the plane from which it originates (figure 7): ments broken on all sides makes their uniformity of size

even more notable. The thickness presents an even greater

homogeneity, as it is not influenced by breakage. As we
