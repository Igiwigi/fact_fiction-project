genome size and gene number in eukaryotes. The first, and through a direct cut-and-paste mechanism. Within the major

simplest, is that this reflects a legacy of relatively common categories (Class I, or retrotransposons and Class II, or DNA


transposons) there are multiple lineages with very different
evolutionary histories and propensities. These lineages can
be further classified into superfamilies and families. In
many genomes (e.g. human), TEs may be very numerous
but largely inactive. In others (e.g. pufferfish), each type of
TE may be present in low copy numbers but remain active.

Some early comparisons suggested that there may in fact be
an inverse correlation between genome size and TE diversity.
For example, the pufferfish genome contains far more types of
TEs than the human genome, despite being only one-tenth as
large [9]. However, a recent large-scale comparison by the pres-
ent authors revealed that any relationship between genome size
and TE diversity is much more complex [47]. The results of that
analysis suggest that there is an increase in TE diversity with
genome size up to a point (approx. 500 Mbp), a peak in
the range and maximum of TE diversity in genomes around
500-1500 Mbp in size, and then a lower level of TE diversity
in genomes larger than this. The explanation for this pattern is
not yet clear, but it may indicate that larger genomes evolve
