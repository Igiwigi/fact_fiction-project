Remarkably, . Strutt found a reduction of close to eight orders of magnitude in electrical resistance for saturated
mercury vapour at high temperatures and pressures as compared with its resistance at room
pressure, even though experimentally he could not fully approach the critical temperature
(1751 K) and pressure (1673 bar) at that time. Such a metal to non-metal transition at finite temperature, in fact, raises fundamental questions
of definition of both of these canonical states of matter [7]. As Landau & Zeldovich [11]
and Mott (e.g. [12]) pointed out, there is a fundamental difficulty—theoretically and indeed
experimentally—in drawing a distinction between a metal and a non-metal except at the absolute
zero of temperature [7]. We now recognize that, at the absolute zero of temperature, a metal sharply
and fundamentally differs from a non-metal with respect to its accessible spectrum of electronic
energy levels.
