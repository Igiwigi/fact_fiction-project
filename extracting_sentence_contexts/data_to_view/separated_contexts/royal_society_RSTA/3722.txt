A test, however, of the practical justifica-
tion for grouping is that the divergencies between the two methods ought to be of
the order of the probable errors of the results. If this be so, then we may safely
group. The fact that my grouped observations did not satisfy the relation cited
above, led me to think it worth while that a comparison should at any rate be once
made between ungrouped and grouped results on a large series of actual errors of
observation. At the same time it gave me a means of verifying the accuracy of our
very long arithmetical reductions by an independent investigation. The ungrouped
observations were dealt with in the case of nine series involving 500 or 519 observa-
tions each.
