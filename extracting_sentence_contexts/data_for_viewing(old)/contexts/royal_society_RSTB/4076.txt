in ungulate hearts. The left division breaks into two chief strands, and these
proceed, completely enwrapped by endocardium, to basketworks around the anterior
and posterior muscles (Plate 9, fig. 22). Other and smaller branches run down the
septum branching and anastomosing freely. The network over the whole apical half
of the ventricle is extremely dense and similar in its general constitution to that
found in the other ventricle. A sheet of interlacing strands passes deep to the
unattached portion of each papillary muscle ; the whole subendocardial space is
richly lined except for a small area immediately beneath the aortic valves on each
side of the main left division.

It is most important for our purposes that the general and wide distribution of the
Purkinje system should be grasped, and that certain special features should be remem-
bered, for these features serve to explain some of the experimental facts presently
to be detailed. In particular we would emphasise the course and relation of the right
division to the chief papillary muscle of the right ventricle (see Plates 8-10, figs. 21, 22,
and 23); the presence of a complex system of large free or bridging strands in the right
chamber ; the fan-shaped distribution in the left chamber; and lastly, the presence
of two areas which are comparatively free from fibres, the first and largest being
on the'right side of the septum in the region of the septal segment of the tricuspid
valve, the second immediately beneath the aortic valves. It is also of importance to
