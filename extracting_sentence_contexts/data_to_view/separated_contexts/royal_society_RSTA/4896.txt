For example, in his 1922 paper he corrects his error and introduces a new term to clarify things:
‘I must indeed plead guilty in my original statement of the Method of the Maximum Likelihood
to having based my argument upon the principle of inverse probability ... Upon consideration,
therefore, I perceive that the word probability is wrongly used in such a connection: probability
is a ratio of frequencies, and about the frequencies of such values we can know nothing whatever. We must return to the actual fact that one value of p, of the frequency of which we know nothing,
would yield the observed result three times as frequently as would another value of p ... Isuggest
that we may speak without confusion of the likelihood of one value of p being thrice the likelihood
of another’ [1, p. 326]. Again, the gradual refinement of his ideas is apparent in his other papers.
