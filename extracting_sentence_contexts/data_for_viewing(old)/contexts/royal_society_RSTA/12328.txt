there seems to have been little or no vigorous spirit of investigation into the signi-
ficances or the relative merits of the speculations which had been propounded, or of
effort to amend the existing theories, or to discover new truths on the subject. In
confirmation of this it may be noticed that we find that 58 years after the publication
of Haptey’s paper, Dauron arrived independently at substantially the same theory
as that part of Hapuey’s which dealt with the equatorial Trade Winds, and in his
book entitled “ Meteorological Observations and Essays,”* which in 1793 he was
preparing for publication, he gave an account of his theory, supposing it to be
original, but he discovered, before the book was issued to the public, that he had
been completely anticipated by Hapiry’s paper, of the existence of which he had not
been previously aware. In his preface to that book, after making recognition of
Hantey’s priority, he goes on to say :—“I cannot help observing here, that the
following fact appears to be one of the most remarkable that the history of the
progress of natural philosophy could furnish.--Dr. Haury published in the ‘ Philo-
sophical Transactions’ a theory of the trade-winds which was quite inadequate and
immechanical, as will be shown, and yet the same has been almost universally
adopted; at least I could name several modern productions of great repute in
which it is found and do not know of one that contains any other.” . . . “ On the
other hand G. Hapuey, Esq., published in a subsequent volume of the said
‘Transactions’ a rational and satisfactory explanation of the trade-winds, but where
else shall we find it ?” :

It is right here to remark further that Datron in his own speculations did not touch
at all upon the prevalence of west winds in extra-tropical regions, either as to its
explanation or even as to its existence: and that he does not seem to have noticed or
