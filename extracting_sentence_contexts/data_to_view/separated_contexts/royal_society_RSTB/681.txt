The largest branch of LZ, Harcourtii yet met with is 34 inches in diameter, apart
from its leaves. I have specimens of the Arran plant of yet larger size, equally
devoid of all traces of secondary xylem; but when we come to stems of the latter
plant 2 feet in diameter, we find in them the most magnificent examples of a
secondary zone of wood that I have yet met with. This fact has only become
known to us through a rare and fortunate accident. We find in our Coal-Measures
very many, even large, Lepidodendroid and Sigillarian Trees, but unfortunately these
are all mere casts of the outer surface of the cortex, each interior being only a mass
of inorganic clay or sand. Hence we know nothing of what the internal organization
of these arborescent forms was.
