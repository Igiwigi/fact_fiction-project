Now qg-!=|dz/dw|, and therefore a transformation of the type
dz/dw = f(w) will give as part of the boundary a possible free stream-line if there
is a part of the range w real for which | f(w)| is constant. The simplest example of this is presented by the curve-factor @, ; since the modulus
of this, within its linear range, is constant, a transformation in which f(w) consists
solely of a power of @, gives a free stream-line as part of the boundary. In fact, the
transformation

dz=A{w+(w—cy*}*dw . . . . 1... (90)
gives a configuration of the general character indicated by fig. 1, with this special
fedture that on the curved part of the boundary there indicated the velocity is
constant. Thus, so far as the ordinary theory of discontinuous fluid motion is
concerned, the curved part of the boundary may be a free stream-line.

35. Other cases of free stream-lines across finite gaps in boundaries which are
otherwise rectilineal may be built up from curve-factors of the types @, and @,,.
