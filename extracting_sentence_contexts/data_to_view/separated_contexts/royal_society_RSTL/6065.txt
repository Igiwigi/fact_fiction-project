This opinion is very agreeable to the phenomena,
which ſeem plainly to point out ſomething of that

cauſe of ſuch an exploſion, have not been yet, I think,
ſufficiently ſupported by facts; nor have the more
particular effets, which will arife from it, been

phznomena explained. To do this, is the intent of
the following pages; and this we are now the better
enabled to do, as the late dreadful earthquake of the

appear to be any ſuch certain and regular connexion
between earthquakes and the ſtate of the air, when
they happen, as is ſuppoſed by thoſe who hold this
opinion.
