Within the myodocopan ostracod suborder
Myodocopina, many species possess a well-developed pair of compound eyes in addition to
naupliar eyes, which occupy up to a quarter of the body size in some species (e.g. Lowrya
(Cypridinidae) males; [1]). In fact, vision has played an important role in the evolution of at least
the family Cypridinidae, over a period of around 350 Myr, during which bioluminescence and
iridescence have provided significant behavioural functions [2,3]. However, these ostracods face
a challenge not common to animals and not previously considered in the literature—they must
see through their shells. The cypridinid genus Macrocypridina represents ostracods that are unusual for their size and
lifestyle—they are large (about 5-10 mm long), pelagic and active predators.
