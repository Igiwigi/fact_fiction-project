of its former electric charge, before I proceeded to accymulate
another.

Some observations which I made some time ago, induced
me to suspect that air, by being vitiated even in a small de-
gree in various ways, as by respiration, putrefaction, &c. lost
a portion of its natural electricity, and became thereby elec-
trified negatively: the following facts seem to substantiate
this supposition. The room I usually inhabit being of small
dimensions, is on that account more liable to suffer a change
in the electrical state of its air than a larger one ; and having
been often struck with the constancy of the doubler charging
negatively in it, whereas in the open air, and often in the ad-
Joining room, which is larger, the doubler would give positive
electricity ; I saw nothing to occasion this difference between
the two rooms besides what could he attributed to the respira-
tion and to the usual effluvium of my body. I was therefore
curious to try on the gth of July, 179g, whether a change
could be effected in the electrical state of the air in the large
room by the same means. The weather being very hot and
