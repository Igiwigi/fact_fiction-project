'g ables at two different points P(x;) and P’(x;) in the medium. In general, such correlations
S are vectors or tensors which require for their definitions a number of scalar functions. The
2 number of such scalar functions required can be reduced considerably by assuming that
the turbulent field is statistically homogeneous and further satisfies certain invariance
properties for reflexion and rotation. For example, in homogeneous isotropic turbulence
the number of scalars required for the definition of a general second-order tensor is two
(cf. Robertson 1940) ; the number is further reduced to one if the tensor (like u,u;) is solen-
oidal in its indices. In discussing turbulence in the framework of equations (17) to (19),
we clearly cannot assume that it is homogeneous and isotropic: the explicit appearance of

a preferential direction (A) in the basic equations would already make this impossible. On

* The ratio 16 in the numerical factors of equations (2) and (29) arises from the fact that when a layer of
liquid of height, H, is considered the lowest ‘mode’ (compatible with the top and bottom surfaces being free)
is obtained when the fluctuation in the z-direction is given by sin (7z/H), ie. when a =7/H; on the other
hand, we have set a =2z/A as the definition of the wave-length.

the other hand, the assumption of axisymmetry in the sense described by Batchelor (1946)
and Chandrasekhar (19504, referred to hereafter as A.T.) would be compatible with the
equations though it cannot be concluded on that account that the assumption of axi-
symmetry is necessarily justified. Indeed, one can object to regarding the various correla-
tions as axisymmetric vectors and tensors (when they are not scalars) with representations
