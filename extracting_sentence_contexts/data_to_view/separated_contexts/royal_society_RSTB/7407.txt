If the
densities, p,, p, and p;, of the top, middle and bottom layers (of thickness h,, h, and hj
respectively) are very near unity—as in lakes—this equation may be put into a more
convenient form:

FP (hy +h +hs) + H[hyho(p2— Pp) + hghs(3— Po) +hyhs(os—1)]
+ hyhghs(o2—p,) (P3—P2) =9.* (6)
This was used to obtain the results presented in Table 2. (It may be noted that if we set
h,=0, one of the roots of (6) is zero and the other is —hyhg(p,—p,)/(h, +43). With this
inserted in (5) we obtain an equivalent of equation (2) for the two-layered case.)

The displacements experienced by both interfaces, and the free surface, are the result of
superposition of all three modes in the proportions governed by equation (A13), In lakes,
the displacement of the free surface is small enough to neglect in comparison with the
displacements of the internal interfaces, and then the ratio of displacement of the upper
interface to that of the lower is given for the second and third modes by equation (A14). The degree to which either mode is excited, i.e. the initial displacement from which
oscillation starts, clearly depends on the history of the wind disturbance, and the picture
is further complicated by the fact that any number of harmonics of both modes may be
excited as well. The model experiment, illustrated in figure 20, provides an example of
this. It will be discussed in more detail later.
