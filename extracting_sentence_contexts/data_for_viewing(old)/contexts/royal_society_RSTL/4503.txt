the Belemnite belonged.

In fine, the Belemnite is characterized by its rostrum and the investing capsule,
and its phragmocone chambered to the extreme apex and having a pair of testaceous
processes at the basilar margin of the peristome*; while the Belemnoteuthis has
simply an osselet of a radiated fibrous structure, inclosing a conical chambered shell
that terminates distally in a solid obtuse point. Whether the Belemnite resembled
the Belemnoteuthis in possessing an ink-bag, and having a body with eight uncinated
arms and a pair of long tentacula, future discoveries can alone determine.

Although this communication may be devoid of interest to those who do not espe-
cially cultivate the department of natural science to which this inquiry belongs, it will
not I trust be deemed unimportant by the palzeontologist, since the new facts herein
described tend to remove in some degree the obscurity which veils the original strue-
ture of a race of highly organized beings, that swarmed in the seas of eyery part of
the globeF during the secondary geological periods, from the Lias to the Chalk in-
clusive, and which appears to have become extinct with the contemporary Cephalo-
poda, the Ammonites, at the close of the cretaceous epoch \.
