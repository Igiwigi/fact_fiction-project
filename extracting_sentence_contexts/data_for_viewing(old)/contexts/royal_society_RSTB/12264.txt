embryonisationâ€™ [13,14]. Evidence for an early onset of JH
appearance in holometabolous embryos is isolated [29],
while a role for JH, particularly in holometabolous embryo-
genesis, remains elusive [34].

In contrast, the well-established function of JH signalling
during postembryonic development grants strong genetic
support to the alternative hypothesis for stage homology
[10] (figure 2). Defining the holometabolous pupa as all
hemimetabolous larval instars compressed to one contradicts
the expression profiles, common to both types of metamor-
phosis, of genes determining the juvenile (Kr-h1) and the
adult (E93) states [21-25,38,52] (figure 4). The fact that
the pupal stage can be omitted when Kr-h1 is experimentally
removed is difficult to reconcile considering the pupa as
being equivalent to all rather than just one or two juvenile
instars.

Together, the findings from the complementary insect
models characterize the pupa as a late juvenile stage most
similar to the last-instar hemimetabolous larva in a sense pro-
posed by Hinton [1,10] (figure 2). Recent work covered in this
issue [52] suggests that the pupa may be equivalent to the
last two pre-adult instars in crickets, illustrating that a
simple one-to-one homology cannot be applied to hemi- and
