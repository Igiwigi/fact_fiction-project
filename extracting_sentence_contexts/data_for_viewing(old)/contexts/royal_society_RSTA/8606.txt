size do increase in such a manner as to give rise to the large disturbances observed in
cases of turbulent motion.

So far all attempts to calculate the speed at which any type of flow would become
unstable have failed. The most promising perhaps was that of OssorNe ReyNoLps
who assumed an arbitrary disturbance in the flow and determined whether it would
tend to increase or decrease initially. As applied by Reynoxps himself this method
does not lead to any definite result. It does not determine an upper limit to the speed
of flow which must be stable because some other type of disturbance might exist which
would increase initially at a lower speed of the fluid. Neither does it determine a lower
limit to the speeds at which the flow must be unstable, because the assumed disturbance
which initially increases might decrease indefinitely at some later stage of the motion.
It has been shown in fact that certain types of initial disturbance exist for which this
actually is the case.*

The method of OssornE ReyNo.ps has been modified by Orr, who has determined
in two cases} the highest speed of flow at which all small disturbances initially decrease.
At this speed evidently any initial small disturbance will decrease indefinitely.

Orr’s method gives the only definite result which has yet been obtained in the
subject. The result, however, is merely a negative one, in that it affords no indication as
to whether flow at high speeds would be unstable. Orr’s result, for instance, in the case
of flow through a pipe of circular cross-section is that when the mean speed, W, of the
fluid is less than the value given by W = 180,/D, D being the diameter of the pipe
and » the kinematic viscosity, the motion will be stable. The value of W so obtained
