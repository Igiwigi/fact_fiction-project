But this inhibition
seems to have faded sooner than that from a normal leaf centre, since J, arose with its
centre close to the new central strand of P,. This rapid fading may be correlated with the
absence of a bud from the axil of the new centre of P,, which seems accordingly to have
been imperfect in some way. On the other hand, the fact that in four other experiments,
for instance, no. 4, figure 3, a bud did arise in the axil of a P, with its centre removed,
may be explained by its having been already determined. Finally, the problem of leaf asymmetry remains to be considered. As stated in the
introduction, Schumann at first considered leaf asymmetry to be the determining factor of
the phyllotaxis, but later abandoned this view.
