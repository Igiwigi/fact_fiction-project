For precipitation, the relative importance of internal
variability is even greater (i.e. the signal to noise for precipitation change is lower [43]), with the
result that local trends of many decades’ duration may be dominated by internal variability rather
than the forced response [19,30,43]. The value of GMST as a predictor of local climate has relevance to detection and attribution of
climate change [34]. As was noted in §2, the fact that GMST accounts for a large fraction (greater
than 60%) of the observed variance in local SAT on decadal and longer timescales over most of the
planet, is not an obvious result. Comparing figure 2 with figure 4 shows that GMST accounts for a
much larger fraction of the observed variance in local SAT than would be expected if changes were
governed entirely by internal variability. This result implies that decadal changes in SAT over the
instrumental record have been substantially shaped by a forced response (figure 5).
