« joining Castor and Polluz in the heavens, seen by the naked
je:

Dr. MA$SKELYNE informs me, that the observation must have
been made about the year 1759; and also mentions, that he
himself verified the fact, as to the line joining the two stars ap-
pearing through the telescope parallel to the line joining Castor
and Pollux, in 1760 or 1761; but that he did not examine it at
various times of the year.

The advantage of having an angle of position observed in
1759 by Dr. BxaDLEy, and so s0on after verified by Dr. Mas-
KELYNE, Will give us an addition of 20 years to our period. On
calculating the right ascension and polar distance of Castor and
Pollux for November 5, 1759, it appears, that a line drawn
from Pollux through Castor, must have made an angle of
56* g2' north preceding with the parallel of that star; and, this
being also the position of our double star, we have an interval
