aand thus by equation (92) the integral is zero and equation (91) gives zero F(Y,?) for the
Interval r<t—Y<r+1. Thus if equation (92) is true for 7 it is true for r+1 and since it is
rue for r = 0 by equation (89) it follows by induction that it is true for any r. The additional
olution F is thus always zero and our solution is therefore the unique solution of the problem.
By a similar argument it can be shown that our first form of solution, involving the pressure
‘opradient y(y, t) is also unique. In either form, once y or F is determined uniquely, the field
everywhere is then determined uniquely by equations (1) and either (7) or (9).
