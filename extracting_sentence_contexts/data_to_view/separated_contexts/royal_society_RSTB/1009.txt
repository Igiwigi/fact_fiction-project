c. We can, however, go further than this, for the experiments in Section XY, g
that the effect of persistence of the metabolic waste-products in the p
increase the amount of cedema. These considerations give a satisfactory explanation of the facts stated a
heemostatic anzemia is so much more effective as a cause of cedema than
prolonged anemia, and that an increase of venous pressure after either heme
anzemia is more effective than active congestion alone. The demand of the tissues under these conditions is too great for the 1
supply it immediately, even with active dilatation, and hence cedema oceurs, at)
possibility of its meeting that demand is still less if the active congestion, wl
the utmost that can be done by the vascular system, be hampered by the pr
of an increase of venous pressure. Here, not only is the rapidity of the blood
which is so essential a part of active congestion, impeded, but also the am
waste-products that can be removed in the blood is diminished, and hence the de:
of the tissues, instead of lessening, as it should do, becomes more and more
tive, with the result that the amount that leaves the blood-vessels is in
an indefinite period, and consequently the amount of cedema increases.
