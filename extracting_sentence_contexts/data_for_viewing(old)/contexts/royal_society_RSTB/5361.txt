By its very nature the Coral Rag here cannot have been a continuous deposit. In the
channels between the coral islands and on the seaward side of the reefs would have
accumulated the débris formed as the product of their reduction by the waves. We
should expect the character of this débris to vary according to the distance from the
origin, the amount of pounding to which the waves had subjected it, the nature of the
prevailing currents and the amount of subsequent cementation. Messrs. Bhake and
Huptxston long ago realised these fundamental facts, which are in danger of being
overlooked by the more ardent of the modern zoning paleontologists. In 1877 these
authors wrote of the old quarry at Stanton St. John [6, p. 310], “ We see here the spot
where the corals did not grow, as at Headington we saw where they did. Here we have
the débris of the ground-up, variably hardened reef, along with the Echinoderms that
lived in the neighbourhood.” In fact, of that part of BLake and HupiEston’s paper
devoted to our area, it is the pages dealing with these higher beds near Oxford that
are the most valuable, and I shall often quote from them in the following account.

Carried out with this idea in mind, the detailed investigation of all the present sections
has led, not to increased complexity, but to remarkable simplification. It has produced
the conviction that the recent attempts at complicated interpretations of these rocks
are without foundation and misleading. Particularly does this apply to that which,
based on doubtful diagnosis of fragmentary and hopelessly uncertain Perisphinctids,
introduces non-sequences into those quarries in which the true Coral Rag in its reef
form is not present, or again into those from which the limestones of Wheatley are
missing [9, pp. 52, 53]. There can be no doubt in the mind of one who carefully traverses
the ground and maps the exposures of the various types of coralline deposits about to
