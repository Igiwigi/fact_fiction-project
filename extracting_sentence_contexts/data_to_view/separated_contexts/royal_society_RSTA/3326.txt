On September 30th, with an air-temperature of
—6° C., a bright rainbow was observed. Then again, on descending the high banks
of the river, one felt at once the cold air collected in the river basin, and the Lapps
stated that it was seldom as cold on the hills as in the valleys. Then, again, the fact
that a wind was always accompanied by mild weather also points to the cold of still
weather being confined to a layer of air of no considerable depth lying over the surface. This condition of things almost entirely prevented the formation of ascending currents
of air, so causing very small values of the amount of precipitation and almost entirely
preventing the formation of low clouds during the winter. It also had a very marked
effect on the electrical condition of the atmosphere, to which reference will be made
later.
