all vectors x1,...,XN are pairwise e-orthogonal with probability P > 1— 0 [46].

There are two consequences of this statement: (i) in high dimension there exist exponentially
many pairwise almost orthogonal vectors in R" and (ii) N random vectors are ¢-orthogonal
with high probability P > 1 — % even for exponentially large N (2.1). Existence of exponentially
large e-orthogonal systems in high-dimensional spaces was discovered in 1993 by Kainen &
Kurkova [47]. They introduced the notion of quasiorthogonal dimension, which was immediately
used in the problem of random indexing of high-dimensional data [21]. The fact that an
exponentially large random set consists of pairwise ¢-orthogonal vectors with high probability
was demonstrated in [46] and used for analysis of the data approximation problem in random


bases. We show that not only do such ¢-orthogonal sets exist, but also that they are typical in
some sense.

N randomly generated vectors x; will be almost orthogonal to a given data vector y (the angle
between x and y will be close to 2/2 with probability close to 1). Therefore, the coefficients in the
approximation of y by a linear combination of x; could be arbitrarily large and the approximation
problem will be ill-conditioned, with high probability. The following alternative is proved for
approximation by random bases.
