of Arctic and Antarctic ice covers to climate change [26]. However, the MIZ is yet to have a
substantial influence on the IPCC’s findings. The relevant sections of the full reports (in ch. 3
of [21] and ch. 9 of [20]) contain only isolated indirect references to MIZ processes. There is an
indication of the positive feedback (discussed by Horvat [16]) in a comment that the thinning of
Arctic sea ice leaves it more vulnerable to the increasing swell conditions [27], which contributes
to further ice extent reductions. Two MIZ-focused studies [28,29] are cited when correlating
regional trends in Antarctic ice coverage to winds, indicating the importance of MIZ dynamics
on ice extents. The statement that the importance of changing wave activity on sea ice is unclear due to
limited process understanding [30-32] is the most direct reference to the MIZ.

The last comment should be heeded by the MIZ community, as it expresses the opinion that
there is not yet sufficient confidence in understanding of the MIZ and its trends for it to influence
policy. In fact, there are very few studies that connect the MIZ to climate-scale behaviours of
either the Arctic or Antarctic ice covers, with the most notable exception being by Kohout et
al.’s [30] correlation of trends in the location of the Antarctic ice edge and trends in local wave
energy. Integration of MIZ dynamics in Earth system models is the most accessible path to


impact climate studies. It has been described as the holy grail for MIZ research by Squire [33], and
there is considerable momentum towards the goal, as is evident from articles in the theme issue
[9,11]. However, MIZ model components will potentially incur a considerable computational cost,
including the need to couple wave and sea ice models. To ensure uptake by climate modellers, the
MIZ community will have to provide evidence of the importance of the MIZ to model predictions.
The evidence may be direct, e.g. showing the MIZ model has a major effect on ice predictions, as
in Bennetts et al. [31], who showed 10-20% reductions in Antarctic sea ice volume during summer
