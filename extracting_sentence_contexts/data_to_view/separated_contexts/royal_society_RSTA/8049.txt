The wax spheres move with great ease on the smooth surface of the glass,
so that the slightest disturbance will impair the straightness of a ridge. The great
straightness of the cork ridges may be due to the friction, which undoubtedly exists
in the case of cork particles, having a stabilising influence, or it may be that the
irregularly shaped particles in the ridge become partly entangled, and so form a flexible
strip which tends to behave as a whole. Be that as it may, the extreme mobility of
the wax spheres has as a result that the ridges react to the slightest irregularity in
the motion, and present the appearance shown in fig. 40, Plate 25. (It is to be
regretted that two better photographs of ridges of wax spheres, which showed greater
regularity and were used for the measurements of fig. 3, were destroyed in an accident
before prints were made.) In spite of the fact that the ridges are not quite straight,
consistent measurements of the spacing can be made by measuring at places where the
ridges run for some little distance parallel. The results so obtained show a much greater

regularity than any of those obtained with cork, either by the present writer or by
previous workers. SOLID PARTICLES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF AIR VIBRATIONS IN TUBES. 435

Fig. 3 shows the spacing of the ridges plotted against the distance measured along
the tube.
