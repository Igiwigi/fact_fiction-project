molars, on the other hand, show a less close agreement, the length of the three in Balu-
chitherium being approximately 240 mm., in Paraceratherium from 200 to 220.*

Ospornjf states that the premolar transformation of Baluchitherium differs from that
of the two Oligocene Aceratheres, A. occidentale and tridactylum, and that it approaches,
but is more advanced than, that of A. platycephalum (with which it has already been com-
pared in the present paper), and that it resembles most closely of all the condition of the
European A. filholi. Paraceratherium agrees in differing from the first two forms, in
fact in them the premolars are so molarised as to make a comparison barely possible. It agrees more with A. filholi except that the third premolar of Paraceratheriwm is a
little more advanced in the division between the protoloph and tetartocone. As for the comparison with A. platycephalum that form seems itself to have been in a
variable state.
