By contrast, simu-
lations from positions that lie above the unstable equilibrium
(i.e. within the coral-dominated basin) would always exhibit an
increase in coral cover. Theoretically, the state of a reef would
remain unchanged for all 100 years if it lays precisely at the
unstable equilibrium. However, the existence of stochastic eco-
logical processes means that the unstable equilibrium is in fact
probabilistic. We captured this variability in our calculation of
the phase portrait by determining the percentage of 100 simu-
lations that exhibited coral recovery for each initial starting
position. A reef near the unstable equilibrium will follow the
coral attractor 50% of the time and the algal attractor 50% of
the time.
