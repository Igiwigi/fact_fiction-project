BREEDING INTO THE POLYMORPHISM OF PAPILIO POLYTES. 249

The next point to be dealt with concerns the possible effects of selection on such a
species as P. polytes. Granting that the scheme proposed is correct as a generalisa-
tion, and that there are no disturbing forces, it is possible to show mathematically
that certain results must follow; of these, the most important is that adverse
selection of the cyrus 2 will ultimately cause its disappearance, in spite of the fact
that all the males are alike,* and that this will be equally true whether the selection
is stringent or not, while finally no stable condition is reached until all the population
is homozygous for H. In Ceylon and South India there are two “distasteful”
models, each of which is common, and there are two mimetic forms of polytes to
correspond ; in this region, then, selection should be most in favour of the mimetic
forms, and the cyrus % ought to be in process of disappearance. Actual results,
however, show that in no part of the range of polytes is the cyrus 2 more common, and
it can only be supposed that selection due to mimicry is effective, if it has come into
action very recently among a population which consisted in the main of the cyrus
form.
