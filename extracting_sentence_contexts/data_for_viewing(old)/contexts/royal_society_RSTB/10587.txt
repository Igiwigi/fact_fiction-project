To the memory of our late friend and vertebrate rhodopsin rods with absorbance maximum in the green part of the
colleague Dr Vadim V. Maximov (1937-2015), spectrum at approximately 500 nm. The traditional nomenclature is hopelessly

know about neurophysiology of vision and (GS) rods. The presence of photoreceptors that have different spectral sensitivities

and are functional at the same light levels is mandatory for colour vision (see [6]
fora review), and the fact that rods are active in dim light, when cones do not con-
tribute to vision, led Denton and Wyllie to suggest ‘that frogs could have
