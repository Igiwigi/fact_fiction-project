In discussing the effect of temperature on dissipation it was stated that the
absence of wind at low temperatures might account for the decreased dissipation ;
but we now see that the smallness of the dissipation is more likely caused by the low
ionization at low temperatures.

Potential Gradient and Temperature.—It has already been shown that the
potential gradient varies very greatly with the ionization and dissipation. As we
have also seen that the ionization and dissipation depend greatly on the temperature,
we should expect the temperature to have an effect on the potential gradient. That
such is the case can be seen from Table XV. The potential gradient is high with
low temperatures and low with high temperatures. This fact has often been noticed
and recorded before,
