elaborate investigations on the occurrence of starch in various foliage leaves, and
stated as a general conclusion that Dicotyledons store stareh plentifully in their
leaves, while Monocotyledons store little or none. He attempted to explain the
absence of starch in these plants, and considered that it might be due to too rapid
translocation of the assimilated products from the mesophyll as compared with the
energy of assimilation, Experiments were made by exposing detached leaves to the
most favourable conditions for assimilation, in order that the products might accumu-
late in the leaf, but the leaves of plants which did not form starch under ordinary
circumstances also failed to do so here, with only two exceptions, viz., Hemerocallis
flava and Muscari moschatum. He considered, therefore, that the temporary reserve
in the leaf assumes some other form. Muyer also attempted to investigate the
nature and amount of sugars in such Monocotyledons as well as in some Dicotyledons,
and obtained results indicating the interesting fact that the leaves of plants which
store starch abundantly, contain comparatively little of the reducing and non-
reducing soluble carbohydrates, whilst those which form no starch, such as Iris
germanica, Allium Cepa, Asphodelus luteus, &e., accumulate large quantities of
soluble reducing substances, probably hexoses. The appearance and disappearance
of these carbohydrates seem to depend on the same causes which regulate the
appearance and disappearance of starch in other leaves. Another important discovery
made by Mryer is the occurrence of a fructose-producing carbohydrate, which he
termed Sinistrin, in the leaf of Yueca filamentosa, and which is probably an Inulin.

Scuimper} confirmed Mryerâ€™s results as regards the greater quantity of sugar in
leaves which do not normally produce starch. He found in the plants investigated
that the amount of starch is in inverse proportion to the amount of glucose.
