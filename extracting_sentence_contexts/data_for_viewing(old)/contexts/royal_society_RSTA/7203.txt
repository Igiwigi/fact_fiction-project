any one edge starting a further wave when it reaches the farther edge and so on.

Moreover, we note that by virtue of equation (64) that the solution obtained by stopping

at any term y, in equation (55) is in fact the exact solution for ¢<r+1+y. Conversely for

any finite time our solution consists only ofa finite number of terms corresponding physically
to a finite number of ‘reflexions’ of the original diffraction wave from each edge. We may
also note that by virtue of equation (64) the range of integration in equation (61) is in fact
finite.

Equations (55), (62) and (61) thus give an explicit formal solution for y(y,t) which is
the distribution of —dp/dn on AB in figure 1 and by symmetry this gives also the distribution
on CD in figure 1, whilst on BC we have y = 0 by virtue of the boundary condition.

We have thus obtained the solution for the distribution of ¢ over the whole plane x = 0
and hence from equation (13) the pressure at any point to the rear can be obtained whilst,
finally, equation (1) will then give the pressure field in front of the plane x = 0 containing
the strip.
