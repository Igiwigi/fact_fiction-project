9. Voltaic currents of less than z3gth second duration, though of moderate strength,
do not excite Dionzea, Weaker currents cease to act when their duration is less than
Tooth 8econd. But the relation between strength and duration has not been
ascertained,

10. Opening induction currents such as are yielded by pu Bots-REyMoxD's 8maller

* It cannot be concluded either from tho result stated above or from the preceding ones that in Dionza,
as in muscle and nerve, the excited part becomes negative to other parts. For it is as consistent with the

facts observed to say that the upper surface becomes positive as the immediate result of excitation, as to

primary, may for many purposes be used more advantageously than any other mode of
excitation, for by means of them a leaf may be snbjected to repeated excitations for
everal hours without failure or appreciable exhanstion.

The minimum effectual strength of an opening induction current depends on its
direction, weaker currents being responded to when they are directed downwards than
in the contrary cage. Induction currents which are inadequate to evoke a response
