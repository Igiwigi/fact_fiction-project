386 W. G. BICKLEY ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF STRESS

where only the cyclic terms in the displacement formule have been written down. To
ensure that the displacement is single-valued, we must have :—

B,/By = $(1 —o); Ai/Ap = — 3 (1 —8)

The formuls for the displacements have now served our purpose, and will not be
further dealt with. A simple calculation, or indeed the known facts, will show that
in any practical case, the displacements are very small.

(4) Normal pressure varying as cos 0 over the internal circular boundary of an otherwise
infinite plate.

As a first example, before embarking upon the general solution, we solve the problem
for a normal pressure varying as cos 0 applied to the boundary. This is of more practical
importance than the fact that the traction is of opposite sign upon the two halves of
the boundary would, at first sight, indicate. In conjunction with the known and
very simple distribution of stress due to a uniform pressure on the boundary, it will
