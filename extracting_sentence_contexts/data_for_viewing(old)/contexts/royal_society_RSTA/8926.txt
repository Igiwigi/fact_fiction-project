The spectrum of the neutral atom of manganese corresponds with that of the divalent

manganese, which, having Ã©wo electrons in the outermost ring, gives a spectrum containing
triplets. When this atom loses an electron from the outermost ring, thus becoming
ionised, it seems possible that one electron from the next ring, which possesses five,
comes out to take its place, and hence the spectrum of the manganese ionised
atom, having two electrons in the outermost ring, would also show triplets as actually
observed.
_ It is also to be noted that the Mn* atom has a structure quite analogous to that of
neutral Cr, the only difference being that the atom has a positive charge. The spectra
of ionised manganese and neutral chromium would thus be closely similar, in accordance
with the observed facts.

The preceding considerations are aon erie amen in fig. 7.
