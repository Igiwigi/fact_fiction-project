An examination of the
oes at the growing edge, such as is represented in fig. 5, shows that new tubes
riginate as small triangular cavities, usually in the spaces where the walls common
Ao three contiguous chambers unite together, and that they end blindly below. They
are, in fact, intercalations between, and are not (with few exceptions), branches of
Pre-existing tubes. Although in the absence of any positive evidence, such as would be afforded by a
Series of growing colonies from their first formation onwards, any attempt to explain
the growth and formation of Heliopora must be open to correction, I believe that
the following account: is justified by a study of the architecture and mode of increase
the colony. In a flattened explanate frond there may be seen in vertical section
central core, composed, as I have already shown, of numerous polygonal tubes, having

thin walls and a generally vertical ascending course.
