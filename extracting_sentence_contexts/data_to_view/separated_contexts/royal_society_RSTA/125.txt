As these limits are arbitrarily near to 2/,/(28) if A and y are arbitrarily small, the inequality
(104) certainly cannot be isolated unless we exclude the possibility that (X?-+ Â¥2) Z is
equivalent to (106). We shall, however, prove that the inequality (104) is in fact isolated, if the above possi-
bility is excluded, and that this isolation still applies if an infinity of solutions are required. For this we need three lemmas. We denote by K the body in three-dimensional space
defined by | (x2-+y2)z]<1.
