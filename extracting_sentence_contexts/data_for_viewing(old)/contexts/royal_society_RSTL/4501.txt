determined with precision ; the specimens recently obtained show that there were
but two,—one on each side the aperture or peristome,—and these were situated nearer
to the dorsal than to the ventral aspect. The siphunculus always occupies the median
and ventral side of the phragmocone; and its excentric apex is directed towards the
same region, in which is also situated the sulcus of the guard (se Plate XXIS. fig. 5).

In the fragment of a large uncompressed belemnital phragmocone from Lyme
Regis, for the loan of which I am indebted to Mr. Moms, the relative position of
the parts above described is distinctly exhibited, Plate XXIX. : fig. 3, ff, the remains
of the lateral processes; g, the siphunculus, occupying the ventral aspect; þ, the
dorsal line.

The outline, Plate XXIX. fig. 4, is intended to express concisely the facts described.

With regard to the osselet (the distal solid part of which is generally termed the
guard or rostrum), I would remark, that since my former communication I have in-
spected many hundred specimens from various localities, and have ascertained that
although in detached examples (the ordinary condition in which thege fossils occur)
the rostrum appears to terminate by a well-defined line at the upper part, yet this is
not really the case; for the sume radiated structure- originally extended upwards,
and surrounded and protected the phragmocone as a sheath, and gradually became
confluent with the investing capsule or periostricum ; probably terminating in a
horny flexible integument. A fragment of the receptacle taken from the upper part
of a specimen, and which is not thicker than stout paper, is delineated under a mag-
