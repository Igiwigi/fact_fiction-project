not always, 7 s$hould be taken an intermediate value between
the two; and when the term is not very long, it will answer
a good purpose to take it about the middle between them,
inclining generally, though perhaps not always, rather
nearer the last than the first, as the first terms are generally
of more consequence than the last. If the aid assurance be
