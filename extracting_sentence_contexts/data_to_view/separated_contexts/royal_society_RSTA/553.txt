In our paper, we explored two archetypal systems used widely in the literature to test
methods for community detection in complex networks. In particular, we found that our method
is useful to detect communities in sparse networks such as the metabolic network discussed
above. In fact we found that weighting dissimilarities perform better than several of the methods
recently published [8-18]. An analysis of larger networks would offer further insights into the
dissimilarityâ€™s performance; however, such an analysis is outside the scope of this work and is left
for a future publication. However, we analysed a number of different networks.
