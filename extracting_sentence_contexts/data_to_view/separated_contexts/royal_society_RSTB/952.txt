of methyl, causes a gradual decrease in the chemical stability of the nitrites, the hi
nitrites being more susceptible to decomposition than those lower in the series, Itis:
tendency to decompose, which appears to govern the physiological action of h
compounds, those bodies which most readily decompose being the most active, and 4
versd. The conclusion that the connection between instability and physiological ac
is a causal one, receives support from the behaviour of corresponding primary, seconda
and tertiary nitrites. The secondary and tertiary bodies are the most active, aj
are also the most unstable; in fact, on this account it is very difficult to pre
them, and impossible to retain them in a pure state. Here, again, the great incre
in physiological power which attends the attachment of one or two methyl groups
the carbon atom directly bound to nitrogen seems to be principally due, not to t
direct physiological influence of the substituted methyl group, but to the chem
instability which the introduetion of this group confers on the molecule. What t
exact nature of the chemical change is which accompanies the manifestation of t
physiological action it is impossible to assert for want of experimental data.
