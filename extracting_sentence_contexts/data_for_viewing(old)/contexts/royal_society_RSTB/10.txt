thousands, of them in all stages of germination.

To describe a concrete case. The conidium (a, fig. 23) was sown in the morning
about 8 o'clock, and remained almost unaltered for 24 hours; next day, at 2 P.m.—
i.e., 30 hours after sowing—it had commenced to germinate (b), throwing out a delicate
tube at either end; at about 10 p.m. (the same night) the stage’ was reached, the
germinal tube at the one end had grown to a short length only, and then its end had
swollen up into a secondary conidium, taking the protoplasm from the rest. It will be
noticed that the thin tail-like germinal tube at the other end of the conidium became
empty, and that three septa appeared—one cutting off this empty tail-like tube,
another dividing the main body of the conidium, and the third cutting off the
successful germinal tube (as we may term it) from the now empty conidium. I
mention these facts because it will be seen that these septa—usually three in number
-—constantly recur, and the tail-like unsuccessful appendage seems to be always formed
and emptied as described. At 9 A.M. on the third day—i.e., 49 hours after sowing-—
the secondary conidium (fig. 23, d) had commenced to put forth a short lateral hypha,
which by 2 p.m. (e) had grown out as a thin, feebly-coiled, and very delicate hypha,
while a second similar hypha was forming above. These thin hyphe grew a little
longer, and then stopped (/).

In fig. 24 are shown other conidia germinating in the same way, under the same
conditions ; the slight variations in detail do not affect the general conformity to the
