That he was incapable of this I have satisfied myself by repeated
experiments, which have led me to the conclusion that his belief that he really saw
objects resulted solely from his imagination, combined with his power of reasoning. In feeling an object and bringing it in contact with the eyelids and the cheek, while
holding it close before his eye, by his refined sense of touch an idea of the object was
produced, which was judged of and corrected according to the experience he had
gained by constant practice. This opinion is confirmed by the obseryations of those
who have known and watched him for years, and also by a fact which I have myself
frequently observed, viz. that all well-educated blind persons, who are not absolutely
amaurotic, endeavour to persuade others that they see more than they really can, in
order to conceal as much as possible their deficiency in the noblest of the senses,
and from a reluctance to be regarded as objects of compassion. On terminating this inquiry into the condition of the visual organ and the actual
state of vision, I may here be allowed to mention that the patient's sense of touch
had attained an extraordinary degree of perfection, and that in order to examine an
object minutely he conveyed it to his lips.
