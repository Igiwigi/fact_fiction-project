the base is generally of a reticulated texture.

The amphibia are provided with columelle, in their form
and adaptations resembling those of birds; the cartilage is
here, however, united to the under surface of the: true skin,
without any-apparent application of muscles to alter its tension.
The substance of the columella is even less hard than in birds:
andits basis/ is considerably smaller than the fenestra vesti-
buli. The- cavity of the tympanum has no Iateral cells, and the
Eustachian tube is short, and wide, seemingly for the purpose
of receiving sounds conveyed through the medium of air:

From the evidence of these facts, together with the com-

parative view exhibited in the Plate, I am led to the following
conclusions. In man, and the most numerous orders of the
mammalia, the figure of the stapes is an accommodation to that
degree of lightness which, throughout the series of ossicles,
Seems a requisite condition. It is also a conductor of vibrations
in common with the other ossicles: but most especially it is
designed to press on the fluid contained in the labyrinth by that
action which it receives from the stapedeus muscle, and the
