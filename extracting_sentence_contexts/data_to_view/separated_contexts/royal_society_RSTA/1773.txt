For the short-time use transient signal that has the form of exponential


damping (as in our case), we can use the Stehfest algorithm which involves specific time instances. The time response is computed by a sum that involves weighted values of the Laplace function:

f(t) m2 Yo ViF (1), (3.3)
i=1

where the weights V; are determined by

min(i,(1/2))
Yep

am
eS

k/2 (2h)!
(n/2 — WIK(K — DIG — Wk —

(3.4)

An optimal choice for the number of terms n in the summation of (3.3) is 10 <n < 14, here
we are using 14. Note that (3.4) is incorrectly written in [18], which can be attributed to the fact
that the same expression is also incorrectly written in [11] from which it was taken. The Stehfest
algorithm gives very good results in the short-time domain. In §4 we will study its reliable use by
comparing its results with the universal numerical method.

(c) Pole extraction

The residue theorem is an alternative method for Laplace inversion and involves the computation
of poles of the function to be inverted.
