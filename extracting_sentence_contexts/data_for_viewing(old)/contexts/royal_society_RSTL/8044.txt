upward or positive shearing-force has a maximum value of 45 tons; and as the excess of

weight between R* R* and R* R* has been reduced to 40 tons, the shearing-force at R* R*

will still act upward, and have there a maximum value of 5 tons. Afﬀter passing through

this minimum yalue, the shearing-force gradually increases again until it passes through

a maximum value at R* R* of 230 tons, and then decreases to its zero value at B. Hence

it will be seen that the chief differences between the curves of hearing in Plate XVII,

figs. 11 & 12 consist in the facts that the latter has only Zhree instead of five 8ections of
water-borne division, and that at R* R* a minimum positive shearing-force takes the Place
of a 8mall maximum negative shearing-force.

It is interesting to remark, further, that by another slight alteration in the distribution
of the weight we can convert the small positive maximum shearing-force at R* (fig. 12)
into a 8mall negative minimum shearing-force, doing away at the same time with the
two sections of water-borne division @ a and 64. For example, if the excess of weight
(40 tons) till remaining between R* R* and R* R* be diminished by one half, and 8 tons
be placed before R' R' while 12 tons are placed abaft Ry Ry in such a manner as to pro-
duce equal moments and keep the trim unaltered, we shall have the following values
for the shearing-forces at the balanced sections:—at R' R' a force of 183 tons acting
downwards, being a maximum value, at R, a minimum shearing-force of 3 tons, also
