On the other hand, in the case of the seven most refrangible lines, the error in the rotations
of Series A, and B, is increased from 0-005 to 0-019 by adopting ScuumacHER’s waye-
lengths, the individual differences (> 1000) being as follows :—

ScHUMACHER as .. —23 —19 — 12 — 26 — 20 —18 — 16. Mean diff. = 19.
ExNER—
(Series A, and B,) -.- +9 +3 +8 —4 —3 —1 +3. Meandiff.=5.
(Series C,) a8 eot +) +8. Mean diff. = 1.

Exner’s values, therefore, appear to be more exact than Schumacumr’s for the seven
shortest wave-lengths covered by our observations, and this conclusion becomes almost
a certainty in view of the fact that Exner’s values give an average error of only
+ 0-001°/mm. in the rotations for the three shortest wave-lengths of Series C. It
would, indeed, have been possible in this portion of the spectrum to give a new table of
wave-lengths based upon our observations of rotatory dispersion, thus using the DrupE
equation as a means of extrapolation from the standard wave-lengths determined with
the help of the interferometer ; but since these wave-lengths will presumably be measured
in due course with the interferometer, we have preferred to limit ourselves to expressing
a preference for one or other of the values already published, and are content to await
the vindication by later direct measurements of the choice that we have made.

In this section the rotations are in remarkably good agreement with the values
