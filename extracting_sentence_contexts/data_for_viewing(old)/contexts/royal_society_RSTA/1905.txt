the more important earlier studies are summarized in table 1. As can be seen, in a few cases the : =
kinetic energies of conversion electrons were also measured. Where these can be linked to the 13
energy of the y-decay, this allows the characteristic atomic energy levels to be determined on an : =
absolute scale, as was the case for the lighter elements combining results from X-ray photoelectron DR
spectroscopy with X-ray emission and absorption energies [141]. It should also be noted that : o
shallow core binding energies accessible to Al Ka radiation have been measured directly for Np, : a
Pu, Am, Cm, Bk and Cf, in some cases with samples amounting to only a few micrograms [142— : 3

(and in some cases core atomic energy levels) for all elements up to and including fermium i

(Z=100). In fact the data are in some senses more complete for many of the actinides than for
elements elsewhere in the periodic table in that values are listed for different isotopes of the same
element in the cases of U (A = 233, 238), Pu (A = 239, 244), Am (A = 241, 243), Cm (A = 245, 248),
Bk (A =249, 250) and Cf (A =249, 250, 251) [121].

9. Beyond Z = 100

Elements beyond fermium (Z=100) cannot be produced by neutron capture and instead
nucleosynthesis involves fusion reactions [6]. This means that the amount of the new element
produced must be counted in atoms rather than grams. Coupled with half-lives that become
shorter and shorter as the atomic number increases, this makes detection of characteristic
X-rays progressively more difficult. The 73°Md isotope of mendelevium (half-life 77min) was
first produced in 1955 by a-particle bombardment of 10° atoms of 23°Es in the Berkeley
