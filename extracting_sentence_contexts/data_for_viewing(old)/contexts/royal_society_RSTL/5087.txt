all the cases which I have observed, differ broadly from the rings formed by the bare
needle or wire, not having the interposed spaces of perfectly bright silver; and in all
the cases the difference of effect produced by the coated and the bare wire is very
marked ; in by far the greater number of experiments, when proper precantions are
taken, not the slightest formation of rings takes place with the coated wire; with
the bare wire, in the gaseons mixture last mentioned, I have always seen them
formed.

Thus there are three systems of rings which may be formed by the discharge.
First, rings such as those seen in the ordinary cases of thin plates ; these I have only
observed with olefiant gas, though probably there are many other conditions in
which they may be produced. Secondly, rings formed by the snperposition of layers
of oxides, possibly arising from the fact that at certain definite periods portions of
the plate become by oxidation inferior conductors, and other portions are attacked,
and being at a different distance undergo a different molecular change by oxidation.
Thirdly, and to me far the most interesting set of phenomena are presented by the
rings alternately bright and oxidated, showing effects of oxidation and reduction by
the same current on the same plate, and which only take place in certain gaseons
mixtures, of which, up to this time, one volume oxygen+five volumes hydrogen is
the most efficient which I have obtained.

I cannot at present see any better mode of explaining these phenomena than by
regarding them as analogous to the phenomena of interference in light, though
doubtless if this be a right view, the very different modes of action of light and elec-
tricity would present very numerons phenomenal distinctions. Alternations of
