uncoupled stochastic simulation, the fluxes are fixed, and therefore the atmosphere is prevented
from adjusting and hence reducing the amount of sea ice production in open water areas. This Dk
unrealistically large productivity outweighs the effect of reduced sea ice growth in the western :
Arctic owing to increased sea ice thickness. In the coupled model, the incorporation of the [4
stochastic scheme also leads to increased sea ice production in open waters; the magnitude of DN
this ice growth, however, is much reduced owing to the adjustment of the overlying atmosphere. [DB
The adjustment of the atmosphere helps to reduce the sea ice production increase and, hence, the 18
reduction of growth rates in the western Arctic owing to thicker sea ice becomes comparable or ,
even larger than the increase in growth rates owing to the generation of open water through the
stochastic sea ice parametrization.

The remote response of the climate system in non-polar regions to the incorporation of the
stochastic sea ice strength scheme turns out to be rather weak. This may be a result of the fact
that the mean response in the polar regions to the stochastic sea ice parametrization is relatively
low and that the level of natural variability is high. However, it is also possible that the mean
influence on the Atlantic overturning circulation is relatively weak, because the coupled model
ECHAM6-FESOM is relatively insensitive to buoyancy anomalies in the Labrador Sea region [42].

Given that Labrador Sea convection is believed to be strongly affected by freshwater anomalies
of Arctic origin [48] a stronger response of the overturning might be found in other more
sensitive models.

While the impact of the stochastic sea ice strength parametrization on the mean climate of the

coupled model seems to be somewhat reduced when compared to the impact in the uncoupled
