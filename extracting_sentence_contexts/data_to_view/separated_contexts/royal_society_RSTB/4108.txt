We believe that the
confusion is cleared up by our results. A study of the curves in figs. 8 and 9 reveals
the fact that the law of Ossornge Reynoups for turbulent motion is roughly true for
a range up to about 1°5 metres per second (about 3°5 miles per hour), and, with a
different set of constants, it also applies over the range included between 1°5 metres
per second and 20 metres per second (7.¢,, from 3°5 to 4°5 miles per hour). But, by trial,
we find that the equation H/@ = 0°27 +0°'36\/V covers all cases up to about 35 metres
per second (7.e., about 80 miles an hour). This means that an extended form of
BoussrvEsq’s law, owing to the inclusion of the first term, or an amended form of the
law of OsBorNE Reynoups where the index of V is 0°5, covers all cases one is likely
to meet with in practice.
