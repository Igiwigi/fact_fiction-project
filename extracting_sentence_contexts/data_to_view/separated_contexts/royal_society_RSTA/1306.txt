In deriving this expression, it was recognized that any change in the crack surface
area Ar in the current material space can only occur due to motion of the crack front. Assuming
that no dissipation of energy occurs within the volume of the body (i.e. restricted to the creation
of new crack surfaces) and given that dV = Vx - WdV, the change of the specific free energy can


be expressed as:

The spatial conservation law of linear momentum balance is repeated here:
