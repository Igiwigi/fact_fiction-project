by IstporE Grorrroy Sarnt-Hinarre, to the effect, that it is agreed to fix the
duration of the gestation of apes at about seven months. He himself does not,
however, appear to agree with this view, for after detailing the observations of other
naturalists, he asserts that the period of gestation varies in different species, a
conclusion which it seems to me he is justified in drawing.

With regard to Macacus, he remarks that FripEric Cuvier believed it possible to
determine the gestation of “ Maimon” (JZ. nemestrinus) at seven months, twenty days.

Brescuer shows that, unlike many of the lower mammals, monkeys frequently
indulge in sexual intercourse, not only at the breeding season, but also during
pregnancy ; and further he records F, Cuvier’s observation, that menstruation takes
place not infrequently during pregnancy. These facts make it doubly difficult to
determine accurately the duration of gestation, and undoubtedly further investigations
are required on this point.

Branprorp (No. 1) states for the genus Macacus that the period of gestation is
about seven months, and that the gestation of M. nemestrinus has been ascertained
to be seven months and twenty days, but he gives no reference to the source from
whence he got his information.

The account Dr. ArrcHison gives me of M. rhesus, at Simla, deals only generally
with the breeding season and the time of bearing young ; but, from his observations, it
would seem to be not improbable that the gestation of this animal occupies consider-
ably more than seven months’ time.
