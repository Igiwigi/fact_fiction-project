which give the coordinates of a point of the caustic in terms of the angle 08, which Aeter-
mines the position of the point of incidence. The values in question satisfy, as they
$hould do, the equation

{(4@—1N(a*+1)—20ar—}—2T&f (a +1 —fY=0. We have, in fact, P
4a (cos) —a)
BY —EZ(7=32 con 0+ 20)

(4—1N&+#)—2ar—a*= 77 124%(cos 6— a)?

—3a cos 20 + 24)”

from which it is easy to derive the equation in question,

XX. If we represent the equation of the reflected ray by »
Xax+Yy+a=0,

then we have
X=—24 cos 0+1
Y —2008 29— cos 9
ES 8g *
and thence
(X—1)*—44@=—4# 8in* 0

K+ Y==h (1—2%a cos 0+)

X+4=1—24 cos 0+@,
and consequently

(X*+Y*){((X>1)— 449} +4@X+44*=0,
or, what is the same thing,

{X(X—1)—20}?+Y*{(X—1Y—44} =0,
which may be considered as the tangential equation of the caustic by reflexion of a circle ;
or if we consider X, Y as the coordinates of a point, then the equation may be considered
as that of the polar of the caustic. -The polar is therefore a curve of the fourth order,
having two double points defined by the equations X(X—1)—24=0, Y=0, and a third
double point at infinity on the axis of Y, 5. e. three double points in all; the number of
cusps is therefore 0, and there are consequently 4 double tangents and 6 inflections, and
the curye is of the class 6. And as Y is given as an explicit function of X, there is of
course no difficulty in tracing the curve.
