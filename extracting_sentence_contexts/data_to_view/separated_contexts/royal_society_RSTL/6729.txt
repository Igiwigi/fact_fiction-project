Of the connexion of the ganglion-cells with each other. Â£ In figs. 5, 15, & 16, which represent ganglion-cells at an early period of development,

Z 8everal are scen connected together; in fact, the matter of which the several cells are

2 composed is continuous. This must be the case, at least for a certain time, because a

5 number of cells may be formed by the division of one (figs. 5, 11, 12, & 15).

Q After a time, as the new cells separate further and further from each other, the inter-
vening matter which connects them becomes thinner and thinner, and forms what would
be properly termed. a fibre, figs. 15 & 16; and as the cells move away from the line
where their formation commenced, these connecting fibres become finer and finer, and
at last could not be distinguished from fibres of connective tissxue.
