This means that the product of
the standard deviation of the amplitude quadrature and the standard deviation of the phase
quadrature is minimized, i.e. (here) equal to 1. It is actually more common to quantify the
uncertainty of a variable X in terms of its variance A?X, which is the square of the standard
deviation AX. For a coherent state, the size of the variance of the amplitude and the phase
quadrature is identical, shown by the fact that the uncertainty distribution is spherically
symmetric. This is somewhat of a special case. The product of the variances of two non-commuting variables can be larger than or equal
to 1, but never smaller.
