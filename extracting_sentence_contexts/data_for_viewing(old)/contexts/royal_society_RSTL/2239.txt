traction of the iron on its two poles or extremities, or on an
imaginary needle pa3sing through the- piyot in the line of
the dip.

In adopting the hypothesis of induced magnetism in the
Second Edition of my Essay, I only attempted the calculation
for an indefinitely short needle, or magnetic particle. Since
this M. Potss0x has, by means-of the powerful analysis he
knows 80 well how to apply, obtained a general formula for
a needle of any length ; and I haye little doubt, if we pos-
sessed the means of estimating the amount of deterioration,
or the actual inequality of magnetism in the two branches of
the needle, that all the facts I have stated would become by
his formula a subject for calculation,

The following experiments may perhaps in some measure
assist towards rendering the results numerical : they were
undertaken after the preceding part of the paper had been
written on the suggestion of Captain BEAvroRT.

Three needles were procured from Messrs. W. and T.
G11zeRT, as nearly equal in weight, length, and power as
possible, all applicable to the same pivot and compass-box.
The radius of each was three inches, and the number of
