Still more puzzling are the data on the effect of temperature on the excised
skin of this species, SmrrH (1929). We have already referred to this work as constituting
the only clear evidence for the expansion of reptilian melanophores at low temperatures
under conditions of illumination that promote melanophore contraction. Now if in
this species the proximal position of the pigment is the resting (7.e., relaxed) state of
the melanophore, as must be inferred from the fact that the denervated skin is green
in the absence of photic stimulation, it appears from Smrrxâ€™s data that heat induces
@ state of relaxation, and cold promotes the opposite state (excitation). It is not
unreasonable to assume, on purely theoretical grounds, that an independent effector
which is found to respond to photic and thermal stimulation, should respond to both
kinds of stimuli in the same way. With the melanophores of A. equestris this is
apparently not so; they expand in light and are contracted by heat.
