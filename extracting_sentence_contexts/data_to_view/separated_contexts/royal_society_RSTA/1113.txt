4. Biphenyl and Dibenzyl. We next consider biphenyl and dibenzyl, which, in view of the fact that the
X-ray measurements at present available are not sufficiently precise to determine the

* In the previous article, we have assumed the orientations of anthracene molecules given by X-ray
measurements and calculated the K’s. On the other hand, if complete X-ray analysis of the crystal had

not been made, we could still have deduced the K’s either from structural considerations, as for naphthalene,
or preferably from the relation
