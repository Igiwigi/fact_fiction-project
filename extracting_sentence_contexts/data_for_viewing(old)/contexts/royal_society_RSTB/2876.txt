It is thus seen that the Ferns, notwithstanding their apparent divergence of
character from other Pteridophytes, may be regarded as essentially strobiloid forms
which have undergone great elaboration of their appendicular organs ; also that the
more primitive soral conditions resemble in a measure those groups of sporangia borne
on sporangiophores in certain other Pteridophytes, the more complicated soral
conditions were probably derived from these, as a result of later evolution, the chief
feature of which was the interpolation of new sporangia; and, lastly, that the
suggested steps are in accordance with biological probability, as well] as with the
palzontological record.

The position at which we have arrived then is this: that though the mode of origin
of the various forms of Pteridophyta cannot in the nature of the case be proved, it
has been shown that the structural facts for their sporophyte are compatible with a
theory of progressive sterilisation of the tissues; that from comparison with Algze and
Bryophytes a suggestion is given how the earlier steps may have been taken in
producing a vegetative system by sterilisation of an enlarging sporophyte, and that in
the case of single cells, tissue-tracts, sporangia, and even whole sporophylls and their
appendages, facts are numerous in the Pteridophyta which are readily explained as
instances of such sterilisation. Correlatively increased vegetative growth is seen
in many cases, and as a result spore-production may be indefinitely delayed.

But the vegetative system, which thus takes its place first in the ontogeny, is
naturally liable to great modification, in accordance with its function, indeed it seems
not improbable that the vegetative and sporogenous systems, when once differentiated,
may vary independently of one another; this comes out with special clearness in the
