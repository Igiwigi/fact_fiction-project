At the experimental level, numerous demonstrations of roll patterns
(e.g. [21]) and solitons [22] have been reported in the literature. In the normal dispersion case, dissipative patterns can only be generated in a very limited area
of the parameter space. In fact, Turing rolls only arise marginally here, in a very narrow band
just above the Hamiltonianâ€”Hopf bifurcation when a is strongly detuned (> 1). As displayed
in figure 4, there is another narrow band in the hysteresis area where solitonic solutions are


stable, and more precisely, dark solitons and platicons/flaticons [18,23]. These patterns have been
experimentally demonstrated in [24].
