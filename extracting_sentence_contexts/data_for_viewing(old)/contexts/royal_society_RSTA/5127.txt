In this context, another crucial question is how the usher is able to discern which subunit
to start the assembly process with and in which order to incorporate the subsequent different
subunits, because there is only minimal interaction between the NTD and the different pilin
subunits.

Initial work on the type 1 pilus assembly suggested a possible basis for subunit ordering: the
ordered region of the usher NTD (aa 25-125) interacts only with the chaperone, the disordered
region (aa 1-24) folds upon binding to the subunit in the chaperone-subunit complex and could
be therefore responsible for the discrimination of the different FimC-subunit complexes by the
assembly platform [45]. Indeed, FimD binds to different FimC-subunit complexes with different
affinities, which would be a key element for correct initiation of pilus assembly and for the correct
ordering of the subunit incorporation into the pilus. Consistent with this is the fact that, among
all chaperone-subunit complexes, the chaperone-adhesin complex exhibits the highest affinity for
the usher NTD [49]. However, the rank order of NTD-binding affinities for the other tip fibrillum
subunits does not match the incorporation order as observed in the mature pilus [40,45-47],
suggesting that other factors play a role (see below).

Di Yu et al. [34] determined the surface of the adhesin in contact with the NTD in the
usherNTD-chaperone-subunit complex of the F1 pilus system to be only 3% of the total surface
and argue that this is not significant enough to determine the subunit ordering. Instead, an
alternative subunit ordering mechanism is suggested: the interaction with the different subunits
affects the conformation of the chaperoneâ€™s UBS in a differentiated manner, resulting in different
affinities of the chaperone towards the usher NTD depending on the subunit it is in DSC with.
