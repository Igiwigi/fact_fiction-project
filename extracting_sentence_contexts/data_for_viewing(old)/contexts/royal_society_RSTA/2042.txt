Introducing the non-dimensional variables as t= 1t/ty, Y=y/g, equation (2.26) will take the
following form:
Tf OUp at" up _ a7 up

(2.32)

The coefficient in the first term on the left-hand side of equation (2.32) is equal to t/t, and can
be estimated using formulae (2.30) and (2.31). Asa result, t¢/ta = O(e2¥/1-)), Accounting for this
estimate and for the fact that ry < €o, the first term on the left-hand side of equation (2.32) can be
ignored. Dropping this term in (2.32) and returning to the variables t, y, equation (2.26) can be
rewritten in the following form:

ay D up 2.33

where Din = Dp/b.

Taking fractional derivative 0”/dt” defined in [26] of both sides of equation (2.33), it leads to
