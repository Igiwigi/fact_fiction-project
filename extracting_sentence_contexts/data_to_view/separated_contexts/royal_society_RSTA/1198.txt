size or asymmetry of the particle, and not in the movement of the air itself. Once more
we have an example of the fact that smoke particles are tracing points, while fine cork
particles behave in a very complicated manner, largely conditioned by the relative
motion of the fluid. Certain leading features of the behaviour of the cork particles will be described
here. Many peculiarities which will not be cited have been explained, but add little
to our knowledge of the motion.
