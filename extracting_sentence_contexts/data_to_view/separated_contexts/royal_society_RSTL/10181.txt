No such duplex leaf-bundle
appears to have been detected in any of the fine examples of Cordaites and their allies
discovered by M. Granp-'Eury in the St. Etienne deposits. This Salisburian form
8eems to be confined to our British Dadozylons. That this similarity of contour in
the arrangement of the leaf-bundles is not merely accidental is rendered the more
probable by the fact that transverse sections of young twigs of the ancient and modern
plants display corresponding identities. Thus a section of the bark of a young
Dadozylont corresponds closely with the similar section of a Salisburia, fig. 28, in
both of which the bark is separated into an outer coarsely cellular periderm and an

inner one compozed of much more delicate elements.
