Antihydrogen will tend to be deflected vertically by the additional
gravitational dependence, which in principle can be measured with our position-sensitive
detector. The gravitational analysis involved calculating the reverse cumulative averages (RCA) (x|t)
and (y|t) for antihydrogen annihilation positions as a function of time f during the trap ramp-
down. This choice of measure aimed to weigh the fact that events occurring at later times during
the magnet ramp, though fewer in number, will deflect more by the gravitational potential as they
possess a lower energy. A detailed comparison between the experimental distribution measured
in ALPHA-1 against extensive simulations for different test values of F was made. Figure 3 shows
an example of the RCA of annihilation positions compared against simulations for F = +150.
