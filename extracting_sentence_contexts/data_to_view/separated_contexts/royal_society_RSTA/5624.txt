The QUBO is constructed by combining hit doublets into triplets. The terms in
the objective function depend on the angles separating the tracks and include a bias term to
favour high momentum tracks. The algorithm also exploits the fact that tracks are expected to
have originated from the beam spot. Penalties are added for bifurcated tracks in which the hits
are not aligned along a potential trajectory and for edges that are not aligned appropriately in the
plane parallel to the beam direction. The TrackML dataset is preprocessed by dividing the event into 32 overlapping sectors in
the plane perpendicular to the beam.
