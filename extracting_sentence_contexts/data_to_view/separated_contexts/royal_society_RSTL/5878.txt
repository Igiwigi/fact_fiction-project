To this Annelid no further reference will be necessary, Since in every particular the
sexual system conforms with the type of that of Nais. In the young of this worm the
ordinary segmental organ exhibits the form shown at fig. 3, B.

It seems to the author that a candid review of the preceding facts must inevitably
conduct to the conclusion that, in this species (which is evidently intermediate between
Nais and the common Earth-worm), the ovaries on the one side and the testes on the
other are not, only organically connected with, but are ingrafted upon, and developed
from, the standard or normal segmental organ. In the course of his researches the author has accidentally fallen upon other species
of Lumbrici. more or less favourable to the study of this question.
