Putting, then,

we shall generally in the future speak only of v. It may be conveniently called the
potential, though, as we shall see later, this is not in accordance with MaxweE i's
usage of the term; and, what is perhaps of more importance, there is something
arbitrary about it apart from the arbitrary additive constant which every potential
involves, i


THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM. 723

The second thing to notice is that the E of equation (29) is not what is usually
known as the electromotive force. The physical fact that is usually stated by saying
that E = RK, must with the present notation be stated by saying that E = 0, since
— RK appears on the right of equation (29) as a part of the term — ,Vx. This, of
course, is due to the fact that E of equation (29) is physically defined as the part of
the electromotive force not depending on friction,
