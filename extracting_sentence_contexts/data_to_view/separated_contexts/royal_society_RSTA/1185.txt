2. The Older Dust Phenomena. The observations hitherto published on the dust groupings in a sounding tube suffer
first of all from a lack of system, and secondly, from the fact that the observations
have all been made with intermittent sounds produced by stroking a rod. Not only
does this procedure meanâ€™ that the observations and measurements are nearly all
carried out after the sound has ceased, but also the conditions which produce the
groupings are never maintained long enough for it to be certain that the final stable
arrangement, corresponding to the particular vibration of the air, has been reached. Again, the intensity of the sound so produced grows to a maximum and dies down
again within the short duration of the stroking of the rod, so that, even in a rough and
qualitative way, it is hard to estimate the intensity to which the grouping corresponds.
