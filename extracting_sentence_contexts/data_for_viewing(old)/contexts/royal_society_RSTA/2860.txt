to Jurassic interval, when massive volcanic eruptions triggered sharp global warming, produce a I
series of perhaps predictable effects. For organisms in the sea, killers were the combined effects
of extreme warming acting from above and euxinia from below to produce a narrow to absent
habitable depth zone [31]. On land, the killing cocktail was rather different, with an emphasis
on acid rain destroying habitats, associated with drought and extreme warming, which halved
the habitable area. Wildfires and breakdown of the ozone layer might have contributed to the
terrestrial extinctions, or might have had negligible effects. In both cases, hypoxia may have been
less of a stressor than had been suggested because of the likely slow rates of change of atmospheric
and oceanic oxygen levels.

Hyperthermals have been identified as killers during many Phanerozoic events, especially
from the Permian, Mesozoic and Palaeogene. It is important, however, to consider each event
in the context of longer-term conditions. The fact that the Permian-Triassic was already a
hothouse world may have been significant. In fact, the PTME events exacerbated certain long-
term processes, as noted, including increasing temperatures, increasing aridification and reducing
atmospheric oxygen throughout the Permian, and continuing into the Triassic [16]. When
hyperthermals strike during ice-house conditions, the effects and impacts on life might be
different.

Further, some of the consequences of major eruption at the PTB, including global warming,
acid rain, mass wasting and marine anoxia, may have been repeated two or three times during the
Early Triassic when comparable isotopic perturbations occurred [67]. Certainly, there is evidence
for repeated episodes of mass wasting and input of siliciclastic debris into the sea during the Early
Triassic, so suggesting repeated episodes of acid rain [27].
