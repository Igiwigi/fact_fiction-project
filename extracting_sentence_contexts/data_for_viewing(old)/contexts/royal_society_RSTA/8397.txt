Suppose a bar is divided into « parts all nominally equal. Let the integers 0, 1,2...2
be abscissee and plot as ordinates the difference between the various distances 0 to

and their ideal values . times 0/a, 7.e., they are errors in position of the various

graduations relative to 0/+ as correct, or the quantities ,(0/n), of the notation in
paragraph A.

Tn fig. 2 such a graph for an imaginary bar calibrated into # equal parts is shown by
the full circles. The end points of the graph are necessarily zero, for »(0/0), and 9(0/z),
are by definition equal to zero. This does not imply that in making readings on the two
end graduations no errors of observation have been made, and in actual fact, by forcing

Referring to the definition of (m/n),, it will be seen from the graph that the vertical
