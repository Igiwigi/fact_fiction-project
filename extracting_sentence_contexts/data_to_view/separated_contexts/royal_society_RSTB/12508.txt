In particular, one might
reasonably suppose that the debate over the importance of
‘group selection’ in nature can be interpreted as a debate
about whether, in actual biological populations, the term
Cov(W,, Z;) is substantial or not. This appears to be what
Price [4] and Hamilton [5] thought, and it is still a widely
held view today. In fact, however, this interpretation of equation (3.2) is ques-
tionable. For it is quite possible that the term Cov(Wj, Z,) be
non-zero, even in the absence of what would ordinarily be
