arbitrary level, [36,37] use the conjecture for representations of level two and arbitrary weight. To


see that the gates of [36,37] are optimally covering (compared with random ones), one needs to
bound 1 aC) for general ¢; we refer the reader to [20] for a full account, which addresses also the
P

approximation problem for these gates by the Ross-Selinger algorithm [38].

As Ramanujan graphs appear when studying PU(2), one expects Ramanujan complexes to
appear when moving to general PU(n). This is indeed so, but the direction taken in §4, of replacing
Qby F,(#), cannot be used anymore, since the latter does not embed in R. The task also becomes
more complicated due to the fact that the naive generalization of RP conjecture to PGL, fails, due
to the appearance of functorial lifts (cf. [39]). For general 1, this is still work in progress, but for
PU(3) (which corresponds to quantum computation on a single qutrit), a complete solution exists:

Theorem 6.3 ([16]). For p=1 (mod 4), there is an explicit Golden Gate set Sy C PU3(Q), such that
(Sp) acts simply transitively on the Bruhat—Tits building of PGL3(Qp).

The compiling problem for these gates is solved by studying their action on the two-
dimensional building of PGL3(Qp). The optimal covering rate is obtained by showing that
the spectral bound As, is the same as the maximal non-trivial adjacency eigenvalue of a two-
dimensional Ramanujan complex! Let us mention that the proof of this bound uses Rogawski’s
work [40], as well as some state-of-the-art results of the Langlands program, in particular, Ng6’s
proof of the Fundamental Lemma, which enabled Shin to prove the RP conjecture for cuspidal
