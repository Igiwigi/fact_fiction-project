various hues and tints of colour. But the perception of colour by the eye differs in
one respect from the purely physical production of colours. In the latter case yellow is
produced by the mixture of red and green in certain proportions. In the eye, however,
yellow is a distinct colour sensation, for we can readily match a pure yellow (such as is
obtained by transmitting a narrow strip of the spectrum around the D line) with a mixture
obtained by transmitting a red and a green beam and superposing them. Moreover,
we can certainly perceive a yellow flower, or the yellow tints of the sky at sunrise,
neither of which contain a trace of green.

Lastly, | have demonstrated that the fovea and the greater part of the macula region,
both im man and all the true monkeys, is of a pure canary-yellow colour. I discovered
this by examining the macula through the ophthalmoscope when illuminated by light
filtered through a pure spectrum-blue glass, a fact that has since been independently
rediscovered by Prof. Voart by the same method of experiment. Kine demon-
strated the same thing by the chrome-alum method as long ago as 1890.

I think I am therefore justified in stating that in the eye there are four primary
colour sensations, and from what I have stated above we have reason to believe that

colour sensations can be perceived in a more or less perfect degree in all Vertebrate
animals, although to a less degree in the Fishes than in the Amphibia and Reptiles,
and considerably less in the latter than in Birds and Mammals.
