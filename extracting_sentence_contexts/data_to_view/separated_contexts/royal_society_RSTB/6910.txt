Thus, while the last two, three or four leaf primordia to be
formed show no gaps, small gaps relating to the next older group of primordia are present. Hence, in specimens where the vertical incisions are made outside the basiscopic margin
of the apical meristem, incipient leaf-gaps may be cut through. During the subsequent
growth of the isolated meristem, these incipient leaf-gaps undergo further development:
hence the somewhat irregular distribution of vascular tissue seen in figures 5 and 6 the
parenchymatous gaps being, in fact, the acropetal extension of gaps which were a the
course of formation at the time of dissection. These gaps, therefore, indicate the positio
of leaf primordia round the shoot apex prior to the growth of the â€˜adlatcd esidee

Two questions relating to leaf arrangement may be considered here: (i) does the h llo-
taxis of an isolated terminal region differ from that of a normal apex? and Gi) is th
phyllotaxis in continuity with the arrangement in the parental shoot?
