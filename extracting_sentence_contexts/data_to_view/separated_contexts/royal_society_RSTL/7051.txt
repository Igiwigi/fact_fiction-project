Throughout the posterior two-thirds of its length, the palate is slightly and evenly
concave from side to side; but, from the third alveolus forwards, its middle part rises to
form a median convexity, which ends by a rough, abruptly truncated ridge (Plate IV.
fig. 3, @), behind the premaxillary fisxure. It forms, in fact, the posterior boundary of
a transverse fissure ending in a notch, or short canal, at each extremity, which represents
the anterior palatine foramen, and which, taken together with the intermaxillary fissure,
simulates very closely the form of a 'T. A deep groove (6) separates the raised part of
the palate from the alveolar margin, and ends, behind, in a canal which burrows into
the substance of the bone opposite the anterior edge of the third tooth on both sides. On the left side, however, the hinder part of the groove is bridged over by a bar of bone. Large foramina are situated, along a line continuing the groove, opposite the third and
fourth alveoli ; but no such apertures appear in the posterior part of the palate until
quite its hinder extremity is reached, when, on each side, two crescentic foss (Plate IV.
