motor plans according to sensorimotor information we
read from other participants in the interaction and the sur-
rounding context. For these reasons, music ensembles have
been considered a valuable model to investigate the complex
dynamics of sensorimotor communication during joint
action [3]. In fact, music ensemble performance constitutes
a special example of joint action that possesses critical advan-
tages. Most notably, music possesses important constraints
that allow better experimental control such as the fact that
performers move in a complex but yet formalized manner,
following musical conventions and, in most cases, a musical
score. With respect to other experimental scenarios, such con-
straints are an ecological way to both reduce the number of
experimental variables and overcome technical issues. For
example, the fact that performers strictly follow a musical
score allows for comparisons between different ensembles,
something that would be more difficult in analysing, for
instance, teamwork at a meeting, where discussion and
