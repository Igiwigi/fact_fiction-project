velocities of the varying gas, but to a uniform gas moving with the halves of the
mean component velocities of all the molecules which cross a unit of s8urface in @ unit
of time—whach pass through an element in a unit of time.

I had no till then apprehended, nor do I know that ib has anywhere been pointed
out, that the mean component velocities of the molecules which pass through an
element in a given time are not in the case of a varying gas, as they would be in that of
a uniform gas (neglecting the squares of the mean component velocities), the doubles
of the component velocities of the gas. But it turns out to be 80 (ﬆe Art. 77). And
what is more, these mean component velocities are the very velocities U, V, W, which
had been found to be necessary as already described.

The recognition of this fact therefore removed all fundamental difficulty as regarded
the velocities U, V, W.

There still, however, remained the question as to whether the molecules might be
considered to arrive in all respects to the same degree of approximation as from the
same uniform gas—whether the molecules would arrive in respect to density from the
same uniform gas as in respect to mean velocity, &c. ; or whether severally in respect of
density, mean velocity, &c., the uniform gas would correspond to different values of s ?
The answer to this question depends on the law of action between the molecules, and
hence it is of necessity left for such light as accrues from the experiments and other
known properties of gas.

It is, however, now proved (not altogether from first principles, but on certain
