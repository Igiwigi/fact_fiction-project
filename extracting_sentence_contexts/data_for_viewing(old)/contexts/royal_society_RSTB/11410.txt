would be precluded to species devoid of language [43-45].
As previously argued [31], this perspective is highly proble-
matic, because neuroscientific evidence shows that non-
human primates, that is, creatures devoid of language,
show evidence of conceptual-like mapping, although we con-
tend that a full-fledged conceptual system also relies on
language in ways that will be further discussed in the rest
of this paper. An extensive amount of empirical data has
shown that cortical premotor areas in non-human primates
are endowed with sensory properties. They contain neurons
that respond to visual, somatosensory and auditory stimuli.
On the other hand, posterior parietal areas, traditionally con-
sidered to associate purely sensory information, in fact, play
a major role in motor control. The premotor and parietal
areas, rather than having separate and independent functions,
are neurally integrated not only to control action, but also to
serve the function of constructing an integrated representation
of actions together with objects acted on and locations towards
which actions are directed. This functional organization sup-
ports two important functions: (i) providing coherent frames


of reference for actions of various types and (ii) providing gen- set by bodily action. For example, when using a verb like ‘to | 4 |

eralized characterizations of agent—action—object relations that give’, they initially apply it only to things that can be literally
