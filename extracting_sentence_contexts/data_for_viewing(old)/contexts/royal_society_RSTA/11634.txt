An equilibrium-theory will only be applicable when the rate of dissipation of such
motions is so rapid that they practically disappear in a time which is short compared
with the period of the disturbing force. Now in an ocean whose depth is equal
to the mean depth of the actual ocean, it seems highly improbable that such
currents would be appreciably affected by viscosity in the course of a few months.
Hence it appears that the present theory in which the effects of viscosity are totally
disregarded will almost certainly give a far better representation of the lunar long-
period tides than the equilibrium theory, and most probably also of the long-period
solar tides,

§ 14. Free Steady Motions.

In the last section we have called attention to the fact that free oscillations of
infinite period are possible, or that the system with which we are concerned is
capable of free steady motions. We proceed in the present section to examine the
nature of these steady motions.

Referring back to §§ 2-4, we see that the general equations of motion of the ocean
when free from external disturbing influence, and at the same time supposed steady,
so that } = 0, can be expressed in the form
