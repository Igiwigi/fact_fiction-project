two to one, the two particles will naturally arrange themselves
at opposite poles of that to which they unite. If there be
three, they might. be. arranged with regularity, at the angles
of an equilateral, triangle ina great circle surrounding the
single spherule ; but in this arrangement; for want of similar
matter at the poles of this circle, the equilibrium would be
unstable, and would. be liable to be deranged by the slightest
force of adjacent combinations ; but when the number of one
set of particles exceeds in the proportion of four to one, then,
on the contrary, a stable equilibrium may again take place, if
the four particles are situated at the angles of the four equi=
lateral triangles composing a regular tetrahedron. But as this geometrical arrangement of the primary ele-
ments of matter is altogether; conjectural, and must rely for
its confirmation.or rejection upon future inquiry, I am desirous
that it should not be confounded with the results of the facts
and observations related aboye, which are sufficiently distinct
and satisfactory, with respect ;to, the existence of the law of
simple multiples, , It is perhaps. too much. to hope, that the
geometrical arrangement of primary particles will ever be
perfectly known ; since even admitting that a very small
number of these atoms combining together would have a
tendency to arrange themselves in the manner I have ima=-
gined ; yet, until it is ascertained how small a proportion the
primary particles themselves bear to the interval between
them, it .may, be supposed that surrounding combinations,
although themselves analogous, might disturb that arrange-
ment, and in that case, the effect of such interference must
also be taken into the account, before any theory of chemical
combination can be rendered complete.
