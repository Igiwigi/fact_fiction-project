the combinations which take place in a new order, the only one
which can exist among the substances now present. It is, there-
fore, to the disposing affinity, * caused by the presence of the
phosphoric acid, which seeks to combine with black oxide of
copper, that the reduction of 42 per cent. of this ore is entirely

* As the term predisposing affinity has been objected to, I have used the term dis-
posing, which I trust will not bethought improper. When in two bodies which, while
together, remain in their original tate, the equilibrium of their principles comes to
be broken by the presence of a third, we cannot but allow, that it is this third which

producing the same change, but in a manner, perhaps, not quite

From the foregoing experiments it appears, that copper ex-
ists in this ore in a state hitherto unknown in nature ; and that
it contains much less oxygen than has ever been suspected in any
