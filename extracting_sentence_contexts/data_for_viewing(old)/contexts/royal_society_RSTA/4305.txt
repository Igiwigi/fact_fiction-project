MEEMD techniques.

To have a better understanding of the true performance of these different post-processing
methods, we can compare directly the classifications depicted in figures 2b and 4a,b with the
ground truth shown in figure 1b. From this comparison, it is evident that when using the wavelet
transform, while the noise is removed in a reasonable way, the shape of the plume is partially lost
due to excessive blunting. Since in this context it is very important to identify the boundaries of
the plume with high accuracy, the wavelet transform proves not to be the best option as a post-
processing technique. More in general, in all the examples we tested, standard techniques for
noise removal, such as Fourier or wavelets transform, tend to have problems producing accurate
boundaries. This is due to two reasons: these kinds of signals are in general non-stationary,
and the standard transformations often use bases that are determined a priori. Both limitations
are overcome by the use of the MIF method as a post-processing technique. In fact, the MIF
technique can handle a non-stationary signal and does not require any a priori assumption or
knowledge of it, as confirmed in this example by the shape of the plume and its boundary after
MIF post-processing (figure 2b).

Regarding the results obtained via MEEMD we point out that, even if the results are
comparable with that produced with the proposed method, this approach has disadvantages.
