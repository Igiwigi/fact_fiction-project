Hence very approximately indeed we have

REC. PÞ= py cos Y

Simnularly

mA+Hh
q=" — 08 y

Thus, by observing deflections right and left and taking the mean, we get a value
for the ratio of p/q which is independent of an error in the azimuth of the scale, much
greater than anything possible in the actual experiments. If the magnet be not parallel to the mirror the angle turned through by the mirror
is 8t1ll that turned through by the magnet ; the fact that the magnet and mirror were
very nearly parallel afforded a ready means of setting the plane of the coils in the
magnetic meridian,
