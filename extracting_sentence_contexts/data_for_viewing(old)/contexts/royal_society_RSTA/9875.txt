between molecules (it being always understood that these are spherically symmetrical).
Although these formule indicate certain general laws, which require no knowledge
of the nature of the encounters, for the most part the equations can be reduced to a
useful form only when the quantities symbolically denoted by P’,, P’., BR’, &, k,, and
k, are properly evaluated. This can be done only in certain special cases; and in
Part II. these calculations have been performed for three kinds of molecules, viz.,
rigid elastic spheres, point centres of force repelling or attracting one another
according to the inverse 7“ power law, and rigid elastic spheres surrounded by fields
of attractive force. The results of these calculations are given in equations (44)-(46),
(48), and (52) respectively.

When the formule are thus completed, by comparison with experimental data we
may find which of these three representations of the molecules best explains the facts,
though, as all of them are somewhat artificial and ideal, it is not necessary that any
one should excel the others in all respects. We shall find, however, that the third
hypothesis (that the molecules are rigid elastic attracting spheres) is, on the whole,
much the best of the three. It is, indeed, remarkable that so simple a mechanism can
explain so much.

As it might be considered that the choice of formula allowed by the general
nature of our theory may possibly conceal errors due to some weakness in the
foundations of the analysis, I shall first consider the cases wherein this latitude of
choice is least, beginning with the case where there is none at all. I refer to
equation (34), viz.,
