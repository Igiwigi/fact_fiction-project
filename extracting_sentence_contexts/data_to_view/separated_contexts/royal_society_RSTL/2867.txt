$882 Dr. waTSON's Experiments and i
A little tin added to a mixture of lead and biſmuth, or to
a mixture of filver and lead, immediately takes away
from the reſpective mixtures the faculty of forming
coloured pellicles. This quality of tin has hitherto, as far asI know, been
unobſerved; but every new fact, relative to the actions
of bodies one upon another, ought to be recorded, The
change produced in lead by the admixture of a ſmall
portion of tin is much felt by the plumbers, as it makes
the metal ſo hard and harſh, that it is not without diffi-
culty they can caſt it into ſheet lead, Tf their old lead
does not work ſo willingly, nor exhibit colours ſo readily,
as new lead, they may refer the difference to the ſmall
quantity of tin contained in the folder, from which old
lead can ſeldom be thoroughly freed. With reſpe&t to the order in which the colours ſucceed
one another upon the ſurface of melted lead, it ſeems to
be the following one; yellow, purple, blue, yellow, pur-
- Ple, green, pink, green, pink, green. Upon exhibiting
the bright ſurface of melted lead to the air, I have often
obſerved theſe ten changes to follow one another in a
more or leſs rapid ſucceſſion, according to the degree of
heat prevailing in the lead.
