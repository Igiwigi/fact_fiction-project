M,(q,4) = | * avin —M(Ay,)} dy, (36)

and apply the Laplace transformation to equation (35) to obtain

aN att ee Oe
oa) = Ey. (31)

By substituting from equation (31) in the second of equations (36) we find in fact that

=; am]fa
B= ae (38)
so that equation (37) becomes

aga) =£ (2) Wea,a). (39)

Now it is interesting to note that the corresponding Laplace transform of yo(ly,) as
defined by

Holga) =f “e-eryo(dyn) dy (40)
is found, after substitution from equation (27), to integrate out in the simple form
