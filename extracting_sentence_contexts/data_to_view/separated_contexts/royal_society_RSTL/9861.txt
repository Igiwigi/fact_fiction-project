Sin following paper contains (1) a discussion of the vibrations which take place in the
ai of the core of a vortex ring whose section is very small in comparison with its
aÞrture when the axis is made to deviate slightly from the circular form; and (2) a
dezcussion of the action upon each other of two vortex rings which move in such a
way that they never approach nearer than a large multiple of the diameter of either. ZThe fluid in which these vortices exist is supposed to be frictionless and incom-

e method which I have employed is the same in both cases, and is purely kine-
nAtical. It is merely the application of the fact that if F(z, y, z, t)=0 be any

a vortex ring. TI have found that this condition, joined to the ordinary expressions

in this paper.
