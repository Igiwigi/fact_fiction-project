1. Introduction

For over a decade, researchers have exploited the fact that environmental DNA
(eDNA) derives not just from microbes, but from a wide range of organisms,
including plants and vertebrates. A large proportion of the ancient flora and
fauna do not fossilize, but leave extracellular DNA traces in the sediments. In a
pioneering 2003 study, sediments from Siberia and New Zealand were found
to contain traces of DNA from extinct animals, such as the woolly mammoth
and moa birds [1]. The study showed that modern plant DNA could also be recov-
ered from surface soil. The same year, another team reported the retrieval of DNA
from the extinct giant ground sloth and other Pleistocene animals from a dry cave
in the southwest US [2]. Since then, several studies of both past and present
biodiversity have been published using eukaryotic eDNA recovered from a var-
iety of settings including basal ice [3-5] and lake cores [6-10], surface soils
[11], cave sediments [12,13], and water from lakes, streams [14-16] and oceans
