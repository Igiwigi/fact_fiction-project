Now on the question as to
which of these conditions is the more primitive the history of the posterior collector is
of importance. Here we have a collector formed in the embryo from which in later
stages the component nerves separate and run singly into the fin. Such a fact points
very strongly to the collector condition being the more primitive of the two. This, however, is not the only lesson which the posterior collector has to teach. Its
formation has some further bearing on the question whether the existence of a collector
is due to contraction of the fin area or to migration of the fin.
