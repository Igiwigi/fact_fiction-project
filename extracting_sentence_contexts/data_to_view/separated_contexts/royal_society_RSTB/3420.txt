and their presence in the female cone axis should only be used as an argument
‘for proliferation in general; it may lend support to the theory that the ovule is
cauline, not foliar as the stamen appears to be, but even on that point this
class of evidence seems to me to be questionable, and the cone homologies are not
affected. Indeed it appears to me that the occurrence of the anomalous megaspores
is a character so aberrant that it is dangerous to base on it any argument concerning
morphology. All the other facts disclosed in this investigation have also led me to regard the
separate axillary male and female flowers as homologous. Firstly, the method of
vascular supply of the peduncles, cone axes and bracts in both sexes, also of the
axes of both male and female flowers, is essentially similar; such close similarity
would hardly be expected if the structures were not homologous. Secondly, the
vascular structure of the flowers themselves is clearly comparable ; the aborted
ovule of the male flower has a double system of vascular bundles derived from the
axis of the flower in exactly the same way as those supplying the fertile ovule of the
female flower.
