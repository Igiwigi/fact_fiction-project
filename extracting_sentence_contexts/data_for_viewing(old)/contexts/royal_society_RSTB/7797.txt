molecular research to remain extremely cohesive.

Perhaps the most striking example of this attraction into HD research of people with different skills has
been the one that has given rise to the present issue and the discussion meeting that generated it: the invol-
vement of Dr Max Perutz. It has already been noted that the initial focus of research after isolation of the
HD gene was on relating the mutation to the genetic features of the disorder, but it was not long before it
became clear that within the broader grouping of trinucleotide repeat disorders a subgroup could be defined
in which the expanded repeat sequence was CAG, where in all cases the repeat appeared in the protein
sequence, and where the clinical features represented progressive degenerations of the central nervous
system of a closely similar nature. Kennedy’s disease (spinobulbar muscular atrophy) has already been
mentioned, but HD was closely followed by other disorders including dentatorubral-—pallidoluysian atrophy
(DRPLA) and a series of dominantly inherited spinocerebellar ataxias (see table 1) (Orr et al. 1993; Koide et
al. 1994). The fact that all these disorders, despite widely different genes and protein sequences, shared a
CAG repeat expansion suggested that the expanded polyglutamine sequence in the various proteins might
be of direct relevance in the pathogenesis of the neurodegeneration of this group of disorders, something
that greatly increased the interaction of people working primarily on different disorders in this group, whose
research had often previously had little contact with the ideas and experimental work being done on the
other polyglutamine repeat disorders.

That this concept of a common pathogenetic process turned from being an unfocused idea into a hypoth-
esis with a clear molecular basis that could be tested experimentally can undoubtedly be attributed to Max
Perutz’s entry into the HD field, and can best be illustrated by quoting from his review of the topic (Perutz
1996): “These remarkable discoveries posed a great challenge to biomedical research. What is the molecular
mechanism of CAG expansion? Can it be prevented? What is the structure and function of the normal
glutamine repeats? How does expansion affect them? Why is it toxic to spec
