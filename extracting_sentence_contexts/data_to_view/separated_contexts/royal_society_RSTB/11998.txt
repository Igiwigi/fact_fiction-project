This requires that more trials per stimuli be collected
(at least two) and even more if the trials are to be averaged
before analysis. It also assumes no difference in similarity
amongst the stimuli. That is, if the stimuli consist of animals
and tools, the classifier is unaware of the fact that animals
are more similar to other animals than to tools. There are If the correlation of properly matched vectors is greater, the
many classification algorithms; support vector machine 2 versus 2 test is said to have passed. There is one test per
