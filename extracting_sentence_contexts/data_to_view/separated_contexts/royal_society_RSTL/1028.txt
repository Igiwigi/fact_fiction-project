Now it appears to me to be extremely improbable, if not ab-
solutely impossible, that a grain of gunpowder actually in the
chamber of the piece, and completely surrounded by- flame,
Should, by the action of that very flame, be blown out of it,
without being at the same time set on fire. But if these grains
of powder are actually on fire when they come out of the piece,

and are afterwards found at a' distance from it unconsumed,


282 Count Rumrony's Experiments to determine

this is, in my opinion, a most decisive proof, not only that the

combustion of gunpowder is by no means $0 rapid as it has ge-

nerally been thought to be, but also (what will doubtless ap-

pear quite incredible), that if a grain of gunpowder, actually

on fire, and burning with the utmost violence over the whole/
extent of its surface, be projected with a very great velocity into

a cold atmosphere, the fire will be extinguished, and the re-

mains of the grain will fall to the ground unchanged, and as
inflammable as before. This extraordinary fact was ascertained beyond all possibility
of doubt by the following experiments. Having procured from
a powder-mill in the neighbourhood of the city of Munich a
quantity of gunpowder, all of the same mass, but formed into
grains of very different sizes, s0me as small as the grains of
the finest Battel powder, and the largest of them nearly as big
as large pease, I placed a number of vertical screens of very
thin paper, one behind another, at the distance of 12 inches \
from each other; and loading a common musket repeatedly
with this powder, sometimes without, and sometimes with a
wad, I fired it against the foremost screen, and observed the
quantity and effects of the unconsumed grains of powder which
impinged against it. The screens were 80 contrived, by means of double frames
united by hinges, that the paper could be changed with very
little trouble, and it was actually changed after every experi-
ment.
