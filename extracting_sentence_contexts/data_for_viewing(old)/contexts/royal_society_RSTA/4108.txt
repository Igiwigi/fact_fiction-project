Figure 7. Enlarged virtual CT sections showing the ROI containing crack A. Examining strategies | (increasing the magnification)
((q) versus (6)) and II (applying a crack opening load) ((a(i),b(i)) versus (a(ii),b(ii))). A greyscale line profile across the location
of the crack is shown below each image.

segment the crack, it does improve the visibility of the crack. Compared with the resin-rich region,
the relatively poor detectability of cracks in the fibre-rich region is also worth noting. In fact,
crack A has cut through the entire transverse yarns (shown in the SEM observation in figure 6).
However, none of the three scans has shown any evidence of it in the region of the transverse
fibres because of the more uneven background contrast against which to detect the crack.
Strategy IV. Contrast agent. The effects of using contrast agent at both moderate magnification
(9 um pixel size) and high magnification (2 um pixel size) are shown in figure 9. The distinctive
heavy element contrast is clearly observed at both magnifications. Given that at 1 x magnification
(9 um pixels) the FOV (10.4 mm) essentially covers the whole gauge, one can expect with staining
it can yield reasonably clear imaging of the overall larger-scale damage in the sample. However,
owing to the lower image resolution in scan 3, the morphology of the cracks tends to lose some
details relative to that in scan 6. Another significant difference between the ROI in figure 9 and
those in figure 7 and figure 8 is that the longitudinally oriented defects are clearly resolved.
Combining phase contrast and contrast agents (figure 10). Comparison of the ROI containing
