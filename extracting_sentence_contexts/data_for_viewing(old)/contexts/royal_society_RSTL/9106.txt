Among them the gymnoblastic hydroids are represented by a single species only,
a Coryne or Syncoryne, whose nearer determination in the absence of the gonosome
is impossIble.

The new calyptoblastic forms are represented by five species. Of these one con-
stitutes the type of a new genus (Hypanthea). The others belong to the genera
Sertularella, Halecium, and Campanularia (provisional), all of which are well re-
presented by other species in our own latitudes,

The species which has been referred to Campanularia (though in the absence of
a fuller knowledge of its gonosome, only provisionally) cannot he specifically dis-
tinguished from a hydroid obtained last autumn by H.M.S. © Valorous” in Baffin's
Bay. It belongs to a common. group of campanularian forms; but yet the fact
of identical forms occurring in such widely separated localities, though under con-
ditions probably very similar, is one of great interest and significance, more
especially as the distribution can hardly be explained, as in certain other cases, by
the transporting ageney of ships' bottoms.

On the whole the hydroid fauna of Kerguelen Island, s0 far as it is represented
by this collection, exhibits little which can be referred to as impressing on it any-
thing of a special or characteristic facies. The only unusual type is offered by the
form for which I have constituted the new genus Zypanthea. All the others,
notwithstanding the specific peculiarities by which most of them are distinguished
from forms occurring elsewhere, belong to well-known and widely distributed types.
