Now, viewed in this manner, I think that the strietly rhythmic action of the
paralyzed swimming-bell of Aurelia in answer to constant stimulation is a fact of the
highest significance ; for here we have a tissue wholly, or almost wholly, deprived of
its centres of spontaneity, yet pulsating as rhythmically in answer to artificial stimula-
tion as it previously did in answer to ganglionic stimulation.* Does not this tend to
show that for the production of the natural rhythm the presence of the ganglionic
element is non-essential ; that if we merely suppose the function of this element to be
that of supplying a coustant stimulus of a low intensity without in addition supposing
the presence of any special resistance mechanism to regulate the discharges, the
periodic sequence of systole and diastole would assuredly result ; and, therefore, that
the rhythmical character of the natural swimming motions is dependent, not on the
peculiar relations of the 'ganglionic, but on the primary qualities of the contractile
tissne ? Or, if we do not go 80 far as this (and, as I shall conclude by explaining, I
am not myself inclined to go 80 far), musb we not at least conclude that the natural
rhythm of these tissues is nob exclusively due to any mechanism whereby the discharges
of the ganglia are interrupted at regular intervals ; but that whether these discharges
are supposed to be interrupted or continuous, the natural rhythm is probably in a
large measure due to the same cause as the artificial rlythmâ€”viz. : in accordance with
our previous hypothesis, to the alternate exhaustion and recovery of the excitable
tissnes ? This much, at least, must be allowed even by the most cautious of critics,
viz. : that if, as current views respecting the theory of rhythm would suppose, it is
exclusively the ganglionic element which in the unmutilated Aurelia causes the
rhythm of the swimming-motions by intermittent stimulation, surely it becomes
a most unexpected and unaccountable fact, that after the remoyal of this element
the contractile tissues should still persis in their display of rhythm under the
influence of constant stimulation. At any rate, no one, I think, will dispute that the

* Tt will not be forgotten that there are a multitude of ganglion-cells distributed throughout the
contractile tissnes of the Meduse, but forasmnch as these are comparatively rarely instramental in
originating stimulation, I think it is probable that artificial stimulation acts directly on the contractile
tissues, and not through the medinm of these xcattered cells. MR.
