to represent the beginning of the recovery curve. The essential result is that, in this
case, the initial value of dM/dt is zero. A recovery curve of such a type is observed so
rarely after a distant discharge that it is clear that such a picture must be far from the
truth.

The effects of continuous dissipation of the charges merits somewhat closer con-
sideration. The processes involved at the top and base of the cloud are very different,
and thus the two charges may become very unequal unless or until the process is
interrupted by a discharge to earth. The effects on the field at the ground will be most
striking near the distance at which the sign of the field-change due to a flash between
charges in the cloud reverses. At this point the effect of a flash in the cloud vanishes
and the primary regeneration of the charges has no effect on the field. We have, in
fact, if g, and —q, be the charges at the top and base of the region of the cloud under
consideration,

Moreover, o (as —q») will be represented approximately by an expression of the form

bq. —aq,, where a and b are constants. Immediately after a complete discharge of the
cloud, the rate of regeneration of the field at this critical distance will be zero, it will
later become appreciable and finally die away. There will, moreover, be a whole
range of distances where the initial recovery rate of the field, after such a process, will
be small.
