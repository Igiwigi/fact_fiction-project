A little while ago the theory was in advance of obser-
vation ; at present observation is in advance of theory. A very few years since, the
equilibrium-theory and the Laplacian theory were in a condition to assign laws regu-
lating the changes of the times and heights under given astronomical circumstances,
and it had not been shown from observation whether these laws were obeyed. We
can now state what the agreement and disagreement is between such theoretical laws
and the facts; and we call upon the mathematician to substitute for these two theo-
ries, both confessedly false, some other, which shall come nearer to the true state of
the case, and, by that means, nearer to the laws of the phenomena. The performance
of this task is requisite for the completion of the Newtonian theory of the universe. I 2.
