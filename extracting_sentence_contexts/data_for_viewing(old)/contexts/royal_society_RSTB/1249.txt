Vascular Cryptogams ; and that these might throw some light upon the que
transition from the Bryophytes to the more complex vascular plants. Four qu
relating to this subject were put forward (p. 494), and we shall now see h
answers may be found to them from the observations and comparisons above desi

(1.) Are sterile cells distributed among the sporogenous cells in any Vi
Cryptogams ?

In answer to this we find sterile cells in large numbers distributed thro
sporogenous masses in Hquisetum, Tmesipteris, and Psilotum. The criticism m
advanced that this is merely a physiological phenomenon depending on nutr
but in this I see no real objection, for such physiological phenomena have |:
affected the course of evolution, and, in fact, morphology should be looked up
little more than the study of stereotyped physiology. In view of the facts
tained from the Hepaticee, we cannot pass over the existence of these sterile cell
matter of no morphological importance. It is true they do not form firm y
develop into cells such as the elaters: they are to be compared rather witl
sterile cells in the sporogonium of Oaymitra (Lerraks, loc. cit., Heft 4, p- 48).
whatever comparisons be drawn, the fact remains that sterile cells in large nu
are present in the sporangia of the plants above named.*

(2.) Do any Vascular Cryptogams show distinct parts which may be correlat
position, structure, development, and function with the sporogonial head of Bryop

The strobilus of Hguisetum is in function the counterpart of the sporo
