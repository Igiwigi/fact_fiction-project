diversity of the tail among the intermediate Teleosts speaks in its favour. The
diphycereal form changes to many variations of the heterocercal ; one lobe longer than
the other like a boat with a single scull behind ; long filamentous rays attached to the
upper or lower lobe; both lobes large, sub-equal; or development of dermal plates
along the body and loss of caudal fin; all attributable to unequal growth Slowing
upon uneqal tensions or flexions,

Retaining the primitive tail, however, the rotating tendency reveals itself in other
ways, for example, in the unequal development of the dorsal and anal fins. One fin
may be greatly reduced (Macruridee) or absent (Halosauridee); here the dorsal fin is
affected. Or the anal fin may not develop, the dorsal fin remaining very large and
reaching to the head (Trachypterus, fig. 99). Here we have one-half of the. Flat-fish
condition and, as a matter of fact, the fish is said to swim obliquely in the water and
lie on its side at the bottom like a Flat-fish. But the skull has just managed to
escape the final deflections by being bent down so far, that the compression of the
jaws acts on the dorsal surface, with the result that the mouth is very protractile. In
the Flat-fishes the anterior end of the skull is bent upwards again.

The Macrurids also begin with a close resemblance to the Symphwrus type; long
rays on head, pedunclated pectorals, long pelvics with pubic bars, elongated body and
diphycereal tail; thus, a very similar balance. They end without the dorsal fin and
with overhung mouth like the Soles. At the other end of the Acanthines the
Gadoids retain a curious relict in the early stages; the coiled gut with anterior air-
bladder does not end at the margin of the fin, but laterally at its base ; thus, a higher
centre of balance. Consequently, the flexions of the body are shorter and more
