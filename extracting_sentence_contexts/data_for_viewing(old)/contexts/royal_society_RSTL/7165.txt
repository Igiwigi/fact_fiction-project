especially as there can be little doubt of the specific identity of the new specimen
with the animal to which the skull ascribed by Professor Owen to Glyptodon clavipes
belongs.

I have thus been enabled to add to what was already known of Glyptodon clavipes,
descriptions of the most essential peculiarities of the fore part of the skull, the entire
palate, the mandible, the greater part of the spinal column, the pelvis, and the com-
plete fore and hind feet, and to announce the existence, in this animal, of a conforma-
tion of the spinal column hitherto unknown in the Mammalian, and, indeed, in the
Vertebrate series—the last cervical and two anterior dorsal vertebre being anchylosed
together into a single osseous mass articulated by ginglymi with the rest of the yertebral
column. As another very remarkable peculiarity of this genus, I have pointed out the
extraordinary characters of the pelvis, and the fact that the cuneiform bone in the carpus
articulates with two metacarpal bones, the fourth and fifth, while the unciform does not

articulate with the fifth at all.

Þ Since the appearance of my paper in the © Proceedings of the Royal Society,” and in-
deed not until the months of May and June 1863, M. SerRgs, apparently unacquainted
with what had been done in these matters, has redescribed the joint between the second
and third dorsal yertebre, though he appears to be still unaware of the existence of the
* trivertebral bone,” In addition, M. SERREs makes known the interesting cireumstance,
that the posterior edge of the manubrium of the sternum, anchylosed (as M. Nopor had
pointed out, though M. SgrRes does not refer to. him) with the first pair of ribs, pre-
: gents two concave articular facets, by which it was united with the rest of the sternum,
