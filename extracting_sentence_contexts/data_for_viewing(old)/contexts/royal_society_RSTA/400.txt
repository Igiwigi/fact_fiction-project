container air. The opening of a membrane with a current pulse was first described in Roth et al.
[18,19]. The air flow forced by the cooling unit from a container causes the mould spores to scatter
inside the container. The mould sensor system samples the mould spores from the forced air flow
(figure 3). Due to the fact that the sampling is done by gathering the sample from the air flow,
other biomasses potentially polluting the sampling medium can largely be avoided.

For an automated evaluation of the mould contamination, only a few mould species are
interesting. Which mould species are dominant in a container strongly depends on the country of
origin and the perishable goods that are transported. The growth of the dominant mould can be
accelerated with an optimized culture medium but at the same time the growth of other mould
species can be inhibited. Besides a specific growth rate, the right culture medium can be used to
benefit particular behaviour of some mould species. One example is creatine agar (CREA) that
is shown in figure 4. In figure 4a, three different mould species are shown which have different
growth rates on CREA. One species changes the pH value that causes discoloration of CREA.
Figure 4b shows the different colony appearance of one mould species on two different culture
media. Other examples can be found in Samson et al. [20].
