around us, the functions of which are also excited by an agent of the same description.
And these inferences are in no slight degree strengthened by another and distinct set
of experiments, to which I referred in an early part of this paper, namely, those relating
to the order in which the functions cease in the act of dying ; for the whole of the phe-
nomena traced by these experiments, as will more clearly appear from what I shall
have ocecasion to say a little lower, tend to the same conclusions. Why do the nervous
and muscular survive the sensorial functions? Why are the failing powers of life
maintained in the organs of the two former classes of functions, after all trace of them
is lost in the last class?

To the same conclusions, also, I cannot help thinking the following very simple
train of reasoning might, without the aid of experiment, have led us. Although a
Single fact is often sufficient to establish the truth, when it is once arrived at, we
almost always find others ready to give it their aid.

The phenomena of the three classes of functions above enumerated, namely, those
by which our bodies are maintained, those by which the sensorial organs are in-
fluenced by the external world, and those by which they influence it, appear themselyes
snfficient to evince that the agents employed in their production partake of the nature
of that world. Were not this the case, is it possible that the analogy between them
and its phenomena could be such as we find it? Can we conceive a stronger analogy
than the phenomena of inanimate nature bear to the propagation of an impulse along
a nerve? Do not a thousand inanimate agents excite the muscular fibre in precisely
the same way as the nervous influence does*? and it would be difficult to believe that
