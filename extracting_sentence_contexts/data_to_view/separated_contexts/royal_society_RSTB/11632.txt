Recent advances to predict future habitat suitability
include mechanistic SDMs that explicitly integrate physi-
ology, demographics, dispersal and biotic interactions
[12,13]. Mechanistic SDMs simulate processes hypothesized
via rules or equations that have biologically meaningful par-
ameters to represent the fundamental niche of a species [13]. While mechanistic SDMs are considered by some authors to
be more robust and theoretically defensible than correlative
SDMs for predicting speciesâ€™ responses to global change,
extensive application is currently precluded by the fact that
they require detailed data that are lacking for most species
[14]. The main sources of uncertainty in mechanistic SDMs
relate to model parameters, and to combining data collected
at different spatial resolution [12,13]. Mechanistic SDMs, for
example, can overcome traditional correlative SDM limit-
ations for species that have naturally restricted distributions
[21] and when making predictions under novel climates [22].
