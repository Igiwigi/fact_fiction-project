This, with some other impressions, I mentioned in a letter to
my friend Dr. Scn6xBE1N, not intended for publication, but which shortly afterwards
found its way into print*. Though by no means thinking that this explanation was in every respect satis-
factory, there were many arguments in its favour, and the fact strongly impressed
my mind as evincing a very striking difference in character between the effect of
the discharge at the positive and negative terminals, and as presenting, as far as it
went, a distant analogy to the effect of electrolysis. In the year 1848, while experimenting with Mr. Gass10T with a nitric acid battery
consisting of 500 well insulated cells, I made the following experiment :â€”Two wires
of platinum Z;th of an inch in diameter, forming the terminals of the battery, were
immersed in distilled water ; the negative wire was then gradually withdrawn until it
reached a point a quarter of an inch distant from the surface of the water.
