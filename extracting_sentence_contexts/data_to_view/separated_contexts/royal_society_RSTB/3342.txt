Amongst whites the illegitimate conceptions are but a small proportion of the
whole ; in the case of these people illegitimate unions are almost certainly mainly
effected by young people, and yet these records show a difference of only 3°05 M.
per 100 F. less than legitimate unions,

The figures for coloured people, on the other hand, show a majority of illegitimate
conceptions, while the range of age of the parents is almost certainly much wider
than it is among whites (wde Census 1899), and yet there is a much greater
difference, viz., of 9°82 M. per 100 F. less than results from legitimate unions for
these people (Table TV). But a still more potent argument against the theory that the age alone of the
parents affects the proportion of the sexes produced is to be found in the statistical
evidence of the tendency of primiparwe to produce an excess of M., and this I have
already referred to in connection with my figures. It is necessary to draw attention to the fact that there is, very usually, one
important difference between the begetting of illegitimate and legitimate children. In the case of the former the time for sexual intercourse is determined by the woman,
by the intensity of her sexual vigour, while for the latter this is not so. It seems to me, then, reasonable to suppose that a considerable proportion of
