Yet, the fact that fluorescence comes in discrete quantities, molecules and molecular states and
switching between them, is something that is clearly exploited in single-molecule localization
methods (SMLM). But in SMLM the purpose of switching is separation, to be able to assign
many emitted photons to the same entity, i.e. to separate individual emitters [24]. In SMLM and
MINFLUx, the superresolution comes from the fact that multiple detection events (or also ‘not-
detection’ events in the case of MINFLUX) can be assigned to the same entity (molecule) with
(hopefully) still the same position. The superresolution stems from the multiple photons being
observed (or not observed), and the prior knowledge about the single-molecule condition. The
state switching is used here to separate emitters, but the resolution increase is achieved by the
prior knowledge about multiple measurements being performed on the same emitter and jointly
evaluating all the detected (or non-detected) photons.
