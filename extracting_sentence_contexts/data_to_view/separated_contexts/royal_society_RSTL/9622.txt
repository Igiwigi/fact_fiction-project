With this hypothesis it is easy to find approximate values of «, and «,, and then by
some easy, but rather tedious analysis, ib may be shown that (250) reduce to the
following —

These equations would give the secular changes of J and I, when the solar influence
is very 8mall compared with that of the moon. Of course if G be replaced by 8,
they are applicable to the case of small viscosity. It is remarkable that the changes of I are independent of the viscosity ; they depend
in fact solely on the secular change in the permanent ellipticity of the earth. K 1h
