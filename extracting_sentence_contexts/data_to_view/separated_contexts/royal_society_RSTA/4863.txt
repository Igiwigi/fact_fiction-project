By the Lefschetz Trace Formula, this is equivalent to

2n
S\(-1)'Trace(Frobr, AR F@F*’))=q".
i=0

Already the trace on the H2" is q”. This suggests that Hi(A! , F @ F”) vanishes for i # 2n. We will

now show that this is in fact the case. Here is an equivalent formulation. The sheaf F @ FY = End(F) has a direct sum decomposition

End(F) = Qe @ End°(F),

in which End°(F) is the subsheaf of endomorphisms of trace zero.
