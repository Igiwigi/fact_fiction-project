These sudden and well-marked contractions occur at intervals of many
seconds, and show a decided tendency to rhythmic periodicity, though the rhythm
is not always perfectly exact, This intensely slow rhythm as the resnlt of injury
may continue for a long time, particularly if the injury has been of a severe character. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the mechanical (or other) injury in this case
acts as a source of constant irritation ; 80 that here again we have evidence of rhythmic
action independent of ganglia and caused by the alternate exhaustion and recovery of
contractile tissues. *

With regard to artificial rhythm caused by chemical stimuli, by far the most
conspicuous instance that I have observed is that of the paralyzed nectocalyx of
Sarsia, Tt will be remembered that in my firss paper, under the heading
* STIMULATION,” I drew prominent attention to © a highly peculiar motion of a
flurried, shivering character,” which is manifested by this organ when its marginal
ganglia have been removed and it is exposed to the influence of faintly acidulated
water, As previously remarked, at the time when this description was published T
had not observed the phenomena of artificial rhythm in any of the other cases in
which I subsequently observed it, and I was therefore completely at a loss to interpret
the facts in the case which I described. TI was thus under the necessity of stating the
fact merely as © a highly remarkable phenomenon, and one which T was quite unable
to explain, though I was persuaded that it was a phenomenon well meriting the
attention of physiologists.” Now, however, when read in the light of the foregoing
facts, there can be no doubt that the present one falls into its place very satisfactorily ;
ib is an additional and very valuable instance of the display of artificial rhythm under
the influence of a constant stimulus of low intensity.
