Thus for Doveas the true respiratory
quotient, as given by the bag experiments on Pike’s Peak, averaged 0°833, whereas
the alveolar quotients averaged only ‘791. From numerous experiments, which will
be described more fully elsewhere, we have convinced ourselves that the ratio of
deficiency of oxygen to excess of CO, is higher in the alveolar than in the expired
air. The cause of this phenomenon is doubtless the fact that in the smaller
bronchioles and so-called “respiratory bronchioles” the conditions for giving off of
CO, are, on account of its greater solubility, more favourable than for the absorption
of oxygen when these parts are filled with pure air at each inspiration. The want of
correspondence between the true and the “alveolar” respiratory quotient must, of
course, add to the other sources of error, already mentioned, in the method of
calculating the alveolar oxygen percentage from the composition of the expired air. Experiments on the alveolar air during and after exertion were made as follows.
