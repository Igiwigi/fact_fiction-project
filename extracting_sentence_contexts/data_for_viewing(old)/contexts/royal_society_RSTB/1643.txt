Of the Hypostomatinw about which any reliable evidence exists as to the structure
and relations of the air-bladder and Weberian mechanism, we may first of all refer
to a series of genera which in future we shall term the Loricaroid types ; wader this
head we include Lomeuia, Plecostomus, and Calhehthys, There ore certain points with
regarl to these types which are still obscure, and wiore particularly the structure of
that portion of the internul ear which is specially related to the Weberian mechanism,
bot certain facts may, nevertheless, be nretrtioned ax affording a basis for comparison,
on the one hand, with such 8. abniormales as we have been able to examine, and on
the other, with such extremely modified forms as Acanthieus and Hypophihalmus.

From Hutsswur's observations on Loricaria, Plecostomus, and Calliohtiys, and
from certain facts which onr own investigations have enabled us to add, it may be
inferred that in all these types au airbladder is present in the forin of two laterally
situated sacs with structurally complete, but extremely thin walls, and connected by
an intermediate narrow tubular portion, supported in Cal/rehthys and Plecostomus, and
possibly in Lorieciie also, by an arch-shaped spicule of bone, similar to what Ressver
has termed the * processus bijugus" in Acenthicus. So far as Plecostomus is concerned
we could detech no trace of a ducts pneumaticus, and of the remaining genera our
limited material was too badly preserved to admit of the point being determined,
The sir-sace ave completely enclosed within osseous cipsules formed by the so-called
dorsal and ventral lamin of the transverse processes of the fourth vertebra,
precisely as described by Ramsay Waricn in the case of Hypoplithalmus, and the
lateral or distal apertures of the two capsules are almost completely closed by the
post-temporals. All the anterior vertebra: in front of the fifth, with, perhaps, the
