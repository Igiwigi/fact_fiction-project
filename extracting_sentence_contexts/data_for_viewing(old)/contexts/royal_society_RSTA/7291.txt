ON THE FIRST SPECTRUM OF COPPER (Cu1) 299

measurements, though the majority of them have been previously observed. Especially
valuable has been the list of faint lines given by Milbourn (1943), very few of which have
been rejected.

It has been remarked above that the wave-length measurements are not very satisfactory
because of diffuseness and asymmetry of the lines. A special example of the latter difficulty
is the following. The combination m?D,,-6p?Pj is the line at A2392, which has a strong
reversal that can be used to obtain an accurate value for the level 6pP?. The combination
4s?Sâ€”6p2P? at A1817 can then be calculated, and it is found that the observed wave-number
is too large by about 2cm.~!. The explanation lies in the fact that the centre of gravity of
2392 is this same amount longer than the reversal. Probably there is a reversal in 1817
at the correct position at one side of the emission, but it is not observable with the means
available. Both measured and calculated wave-lengths of A1817 are given in the table.

The wave-lengths of a number of lines in the ultra-violet are marked with a C to indicate
that they have been computed. They are quite accurately calculable from easily observed
and accurately measured combinations, and they form an excellent set of standards down
to 41703. They were so used in the present work, together with the copper spark lines at
41472 and A1358. In no case should the error in wave-length of the computed lines exceed

+0-002, and most of them can be trusted to + 0-001.
