The fact just stated, namely, that our theorem-con-
tains within itself the requisite conditions for investigating the
limits, or presumptive impossibility, of the roots, demonstrates
its sufficiency for effecting the developement of the 'real
roots, independently of any previous knowledge of R. For this
purpose, we might assumeR =0;7, 7, &c. = 1 or, 1 &c. and
adopt, as most suitable to these conditions, the algorithm of
Theorem 1I, until we had arrived at R*, an unambiguous
limiting value of z. But since these initiatory researches

equations of all orders, by continuous approwimation. g19

seem more naturally to depend on the simple derivees, a, b, &c.
than on A, B, &c. their aggregates ; and since, in fact, as long
as 7is assumptive orindependent of R, our system of derivation
offers no peculiar advantage ; I should prefer applying the
limiting formule in the usual way ; passing however from
column to column (Woop, F 318.) of the results, at first by
means of the neat algorithm suggested in the note on Art. 7,
and afterwards by differencing, &c, as recommended by La-
GRANGE, (Res. des Eq. Num. $ 13g), when the number of co-
lumns has exceeded the dimensions of the equation. (Vide
Addendum.)

If, during this process the observyation of Dr Gua be kept

in view, that whenever all the roots of $z are real, D””" oz

and D”+* oz will have contrary signs when D*gz is made
to vanish, we shall seldom be under the necessity of resorting
to more recondite criteria of impossibility. Every column in
which o appears between results affected with like signs, will
apprize us of a distinct pair of imaginary roots; and even a
horizontal change of signs, occurring between two horizontal
permanences of an identical sign, will induce a suspicion,
which it will in general be easy, in regard of the existing
case, either to confirm or to overthrow.
