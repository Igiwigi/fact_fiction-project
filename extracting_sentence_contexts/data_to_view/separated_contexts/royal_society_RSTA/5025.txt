For example, antiferromagnetic AgSO, exhibits a strong quasi-one-dimensional superex-
change along the infinite [Ag(SO,)] chains characterized by a superexchange constant, J, of
—18.7 meV [25].5 This number is impressive while taking into account that the superexchange
pathway formally consists of three atoms, i.e. of the OSO bridge. Note that similar J value
(—19meV) is observed for antiferromagnetic NiO, with the monoatomic bridge (O atom)
between the Ni centres, and as many as two unpaired electrons per site (Ni(II) in high-spin
d® configuration). Closer inspection of the calculated spin density in AgSO, shows that the
superexchange pathway in fact omits the sulfur atom as it polarizes the O- --O bridge. This is
peculiar, since no chemical bond exists between the neighbouring O atoms of the sulfate anion. Clearly, Ag(II) cation is capable of spin-polarizing the adjacent anion so strongly that it induces a
fractional chemical bonding between O atoms.
