This is a fact of so0me interest, because it is opposed to the hypothesis that a
nascent body possesses a chemical activity not belonging to it in its ordinary free con-
dition ; for here is. basylous hydrogen, at the -moment of its liberation, exerting no
action on the nitrate, although zinc and other metals x0 readily reduce it under various

a fact, however, which may be due to the amalgam not being really a compound of ammonium. 376 ON THE UNION OF AMMONIA NITRATE WITH AMMONIA /
