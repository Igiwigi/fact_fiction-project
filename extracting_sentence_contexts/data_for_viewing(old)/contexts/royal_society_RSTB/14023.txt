However, a second and more compelling reason is that
olfaction remains mysterious, despite its universal importance
in animals and its deep evolutionary history [25,26]. Many of
the most fundamental questions in olfactory neuroscience
remain unanswered [27,28], including the olfactory code. We
lack essential models to predict the ‘smell’ of a chemical struc-
ture: the relationship between structure, olfactory receptors
(ORs) and perception [29]. Thus, except for a few classic studies
listed above, most experiments on murine spatial orientation
use visual cues. As these experiments also demonstrate,
visual cues are important even in the presence of olfactory
cues. In fact, the two modalities may have clearly matched
complementary advantages and disadvantages [30], but at
the very least, our experiments should be designed in the expli-
cit knowledge of the natural statistics of the sensory cues in the
study species’s environment.

Fortunately, we are in the midst of a conceptual crisis that
threatens our complacency with the status quo, offering hope
that future species will be chosen based on scientific prin-
ciples [3,4]. The crisis comes from unexpected results that
question the hegemony of visual cues in the study of hippo-
campal function. This is a series of prominent studies
demonstrating that nasal respiration profoundly influences
