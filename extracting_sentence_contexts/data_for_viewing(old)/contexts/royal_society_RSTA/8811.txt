gravity. The total reaction between the air and the shell would then, as required,
take the form of a single force, called the drag, acting by symmetry tangentially to the
path of the centre of gravity, and depending only on the velocity and shape of the
shell and the state of the medium. The equations of motion resulting in this simple
case are insoluble in finite terms for the actual law of resistance of the air; in
practice they are capable of rapid numerical solution to any desired degree of
accuracy, by a variety of methods of step-by-step integration, when the drag has
been specified with corresponding accuracy.

In order to specify the drag completely it is necessary to consider with some care
what are the variables on which the drag for a given shell can depend to an
appreciable extent. This question is, as yet, by no means settled, and a few of the
more important considerations are summarised in ยง 1.01. This fact does not concern
us here to a very serious extent; an incomplete specification of the variables on
which the drag (or, in the general case, the complete force system) depends will only
invalidate the results of observation when an attempt is made to apply them to
widely different conditions of the state of the resisting medium, or of the motion of
the shell. The validity is unaffected when the experimental conditions are
approximately repeated. It may be assumed that, in this case of symmetry, a fairly
adequate expression for the drag is given by the equation

(1.001) R = pvr*f,. (v/a),

where R is the total drag, p the density of the air (or other medium), 7 the radius of
the shell, 7 the velocity of the shell, and a the velocity of sound in the undisturbed
