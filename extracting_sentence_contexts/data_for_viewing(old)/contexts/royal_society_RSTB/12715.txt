[25-27], and in Akdeniz & van Veelen [10], we show that it
can also exist at the group level.

In this case, the relevant variables that determine an individ-
ualâ€™s fitness are not just whether or not the individual itself is a
cooperator and how many others in the group are cooperators,
but also how many cooperators there are in nearby groups.
The first two variables determine fitness in the linear public
goods game model we started with, which implicitly assumes
global between-group competition, while the third plays no
role there. For a model with local between-group competition,
the first term on the right-hand side of equation (2.5) now not
only reflects the fact that cooperative groups do better than
defecting ones, as it did without local between-group compe-
tition, but also absorbs the cancellation effect at the group

possible or impossible, while any modelling exercise would = =
come down to deriving properties concerning the relative
likelihood of transitions from one population state to the
other, given the assumptions of the model. We also argued

that no assumptions go into the Price equation, so no predic-

tions can come out.
