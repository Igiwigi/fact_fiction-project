from solution in hydrochloric acid (2N) by dilution with distilled water, dialyzed against
distilled water and dried to a solid of the consistency of gutta percha. They used an
immersion method for the determination of refractive index. Méhring’s data showing the
relation between path difference and refractive index of the medium, for the decalcified
inner layer of a lobster carapace, both in blue (A=435my) and green (A=546my) light,
show clearly that the point of inflexion of the curve, at which the negative intrinsic bire-
fringence is maximal, is at 1-61 in blue light and 1-64 in the green.

On general grounds one would expect the mean refractive index to be less in red light
than in blue, and, in fact, Sollas’s values are lower than the mean refractive index implicit
in Mohring’s results. The displacement of Méhring’s curves away from the origin along
the abscissa with increasing wave-length (at first sight contrary to the rule that the
refractive index diminishes with increasing wave-length) may be connected with the fact
that a birefringent substance will probably have different absorption spectra for fast and
slow directions; according to the position of the absorption bands the mean refractive index
may increase or decrease with increasing wave-length in certain regions of the visible
spectrum.

In a recent paper, Anderson & Richards (1942) found that the transparent vanes
composing the ridges of the iridescent scales of Morpho cypris Westwood have a refractive
index of 1-53 (this refers, presumably, to the untreated vanes). They were led to believe
that the scales are not composed of ‘chitin’, since they disintegrate completely in concen-
