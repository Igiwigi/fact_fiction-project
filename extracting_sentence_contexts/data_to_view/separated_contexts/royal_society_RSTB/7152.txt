This is at variance, however,
with the observation of Medawar (1944, 1945) that in man and the rabbit a homograft of
skin to a raw area normally becomes vascularized but is subsequently destroyed, apparently
as the result of a general immunological reaction, since it would seem likely that a graft in
the anterior chamber when once vascularized would be just as open to humoral attack as
a vascularized graft in any other situation. In so far as cellular attack is responsible for the destruction of homografts the favourable
properties of the anterior chamber can only be explained by supposing that for some
unknown reason lymphocytes do not accumulate so readily in this situation as elsewhere. This seems at first sight unlikely, but it gains some support from the fact that, even when
an anterior chamber graft of thyroid degenerated because the recipient was not subjected
to thyroidectomy (experiment I, 2 (i) (d)), large accumulations of lymphocytes were
rarely seen. It is apparent that much more work must be undertaken before any final solution of the
many problems relating to tissue transplantation is reached. Various future experiments
have been planned and the nature of some of these has been indicated already, but one
further matter requires mention.
