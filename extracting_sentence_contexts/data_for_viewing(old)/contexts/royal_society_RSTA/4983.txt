If k is even, y consists of k/2 pairs of elements which are distinct or distinct modulo the special
involution if it exists, and for each such pair (yj, yj), one of oj is the identity and the other is c, then
n(y,o) =1. Otherwise, m(y,) is bounded in terms of k and r only.

The proofs of theorem 1.5, corollaries 1.6 and 1.7 will be found in §4, after we develop a more
general framework in §2. Many examples of (trace functions of) bountiful sheaves, and also of
the more general situation of the next section, together with more statements of the resulting
estimates, are found in §3. Readers may wish to first read through this last section in order to see
more examples of the estimates we obtain.

There is a certain inevitable tension in this paper between the fact that, on the one hand, we
deal with rather general phenomena, and on the other hand most applications involve extremely
concrete special cases. We hope to write a fuller book-length account of trace functions over finite
fields that will resolve this conflict by providing much more detailed explanations and examples,
but in the meantime, the current text should provide precise references for many applications.
Any reader ina state of doubt concerning sums of the type considered here is welcome to contact
the authors. We also mention that the arXiv version of this text contains some more details and
examples.

Notation and conventions. (1) An ¢-adic sheaf over an algebraic variety X defined over F, will
always mean a constructible Qy-sheaf for some ¢ 4 p; whenever the trace function of such sheaves
are mentioned, it is assumed that an isomorphism: : Q —> Chas been chosen once and for all,
and that the trace function is seen as complex-valued through this isomorphism.
