capillary tube. I heated this tube till it began to melt, and
then slowly passed the mixture through it into the flame of
a spirit lamp, when» it took fire and burned with its own
peculiar explosive light beyond the flame of the lamp, and
when withdrawn, though the aperture was quite white hot,
it continued to burn vividly.

That the compression in one part of an explosive mixture
produced by the sudden expansion of another part by heat,
or the elestric spark, is not the cause of combination, as has
been supposed by Dr. Hi6Gins, M. BERTHOLLET, and others,
appears to be evident from what has been stated, and it is
rendered «till more so by the following facts. A mixture of

hydro-phosphoric gas ( bi-phosphuretted hydrogene gas) and
oxygene, which explode at a heat a little aboye that of boiling
water, was confined by mercury, and very gradually heated
on a sand bath : when the temperature of the mercury was
242*, the mixture exploded.
