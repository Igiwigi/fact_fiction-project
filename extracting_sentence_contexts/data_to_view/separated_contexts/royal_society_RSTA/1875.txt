known to this audience, I will spend more words on the tree than the table. The extra detail on : =

Virtually all science classrooms and many lecture halls display the periodic table at the front :R
of the room, over the top of the blackboard, sometimes to be referred to in lectures, but always : 3
as an icon of truth. The factual nature of the rows and columns of this table or the information 18

of a better term’ [1]. While the table does not represent a theory, it has been the foundation for ‘S

the development of theory and embodies the properties attributed to the dictionary definition
of theory, so there is sufficient basis for comparing what the periodic table and the theory of
evolution have in common.
