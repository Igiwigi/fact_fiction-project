It is possible that they occur in the
d sequence and not in the links themselves. For this reason and because the actual
D (4) lines may be considerably in error, displacements have not been introduced into
the formule, and errors up to d\ = ‘1 or "2 have been admitted, whilst changes from
the satellite sequence d, to the chief line sequence d, have been allowed. But as a
fact there does not seem to be much demand for these displacements either in D (4)
or D(5), and the linkages are distinguished from those for the P and $8 linkages by . their absence. In No. 2 there is an example of a link acting as a pure displacement
so that the three lines (A) D(4), D(4), (—A) D(4) exist.
