Once the
“presphenoid” became attached to the basisphenoid there would no longer be any
need of a parasphenoid for support, and it might be expected to disappear. It is not argued that this interpretation provides good evidence for the prevomer-
vomer homology. It is made to show that the Ictidosauria provide no evidence which
supports the parasphenoid-vomer homology, and can, in fact, be interpreted just as
easily to support the original view. It will be seen from the foregoing account that the palaeontological evidence shows
the gradual evolution of a skull which is very similar to that of a generalized mammal,
the outstanding difference (apart from the structure of the ear) being the relatively
small brain case of the Theriodont. There is general agreement about the identity
of the bones in terms of those of more primitive forms, and the late Theriodonts were
contemporaneous with Tyritylodon longaevus Owen, the first known mammal.
