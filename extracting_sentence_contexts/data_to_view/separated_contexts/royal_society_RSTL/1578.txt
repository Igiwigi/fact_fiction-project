I chose for
the experiment the head of the sheep, in which these cavities
are large, the openings by which they communicate with the
atmosphere small, and the membrane with, which they are
covered,.an active secreting surface. collected the air by
perforating the. cavities under water about. 15 minutes after
the death of the animal: {n two different instances the re-
sults of the examination of'the air were the following : the
air fromthe antrum maxillare-in one\instance. consisted of

4-3 carbonic, acid gas,
13.0 0xygene,
82.7 azote ;
from the frontal sinus of
13.5 0xygene,
86.5 azote,
without any carbonic. acid gas,:the absence. of which ,may
have been. owing, to the presence. of ia good: deal; of mucus/ in
the cavity, by whichit-might have been.absorbed. (In ano-
ther instance the air from-the antrum maxillare-consisted of
4+2 carbonic acid gas,
13.8 oxygene,
82.0. azote ;


on air found in the pleura, &c. 515

from the frontal sinus of
4.5 carbonic acid gas,
9.5 oxygene,
86.0 azote. On the supposition that the air, previous to its entering
these cavities, had undergone a partial change from respira-
tion, the results described seem to indicate an absorption of
oxygene. Other facts might be adduced, which, like the preceding,
though not conclusive, tend to support the idea; that mucous
membranes are capable of absorbing air. Of this Kind, I
conceive, are the results of the experiments of Messrs, MAa-
GENDIE and CHEVREUL, on the composition of the air con-
tained in the human stomach and intestines ;# and very
recently, I have met with a fact, the bearing of which
appears to be similar. In examining the body of a soldier,
who had died of complicated disease, I found the head of the
colon and the ccecum exceedingly distended with air, and of
a bright red colour, as if highly inflamed, whilst the ascend-
ing colon was unusually contracted.
