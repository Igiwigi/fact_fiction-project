Selection on a mutant that
reduces mortality may therefore become stronger as its effects
get closer to age at maturity. These well-known results lay the
basis of the evolution of life-history traits, especially of senes-
cence [49,89,91], and are relevant to age-specific social
behaviour (e.g. [92]). Less well-trodden is disruptive selection in an age-
structured population, which in fact we have not seen any-
where expressed as equation (3.4), together with

(electronic supplementary material, appendix B.2.3 for deri-
vation; e.g. [93] for other approaches to disruptive selection
in age-structured populations). The term /w(z*) depends on
how age-specific fitness components change nonlinearly
with trait (with age-specific effects weighted accordingly, as
in equation (3.7)). The second term h,(z*) depends on how
fecundity and mortality change with trait expression at a
given age a (the term within square brackets), multiplied
to the trait effect on the probability of surviving till that age -
(l,(Zm, Z)/(0Zm)).
