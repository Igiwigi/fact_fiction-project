F be a retarding force applied to a mass whose weight =W, placed on a plane whose
inclination is s, Then will W sin ;—f be the moving force along the plane; and since
the mass will require only the smallest force to move it, a force f very nearly equal to
W sin - will be necessary to hold the mass at rest. If f be remoyed, the ice will begin
to move with a moving force nearly = W sin ;, the motion being permitted by the lique-
faction of successive indefinitely thin layers of ice, but then it will be retarded by the
solid mass coming in contact with the surface on which it slides. A melting of another
indefinitely thin layer will then take place, and the above process will be repeated, the
velocity increasing till the continuous action of the plane on the mass becomes equal to
the weight resolved in the direction of the plane. During this time (probably too short
to be estimated) the motion will be an accelerated one, but will thenceforward become
uniform, the action of the plane becoming equal to the resolved part of the weight along
it. The uniform velocity is, in fact, a terminal velocity, similar to that of a stone
descending in water, when it s00n approximates to a nearly uniform motion. The
action of the inclined plane on the moving mass, like that of the resistance of the water
on the stone, has this property—that, while it is incapable of exerting any but the
smallest force to hold the body absolutely at rest, it exerts a retarding force upon it in
uniform motion, equal to that of gravity. The objections above mentioned against the
sliding of glaciers have arisen from an entire misconception of this kind of mechanical
action.

9. At the period when the preceding experiment was published, I was disposed to
think that the greater part of the observed motion of the surface of a glacier was due
to the general motion, by sliding, of the whole mass, while it was contended by other
glacialists that it was principally due to an excess of the velocity of the upper strata
