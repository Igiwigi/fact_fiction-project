The agreement between the numbers in this and the
preceding table, will convey an idea of the accuracy with
which the law accommodates itself to all the capricious
changes of the tints. I have compared it also with numerous
experiments made on nztre, mica, topaz, sulphate of iron, &c.
embracing all the varieties in the inclination of the resultant
axes, and have found it equally accurate in all these crystals. The projection of the calculated results, indeed, compared
with the system of rings where their curvature is the most
variable, may be considered as an ocular demonstration of the
correctness of the law.

* It is a curious fact, that sulphate of lime is the only crystal, out of a great
number, in which the principal axis does not coincide with any of the prominent

lines in its primitive form, as ascertained by Hauy. Does not this prove incontestibly
that its primitive form is at present undetermined ? Dr.
