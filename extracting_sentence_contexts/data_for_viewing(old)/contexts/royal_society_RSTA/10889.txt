SOUFRIERE, AND ON A VISIT TO MON'TAGNE PELEE, IN 1902. 547

APPENDIX. III.

ON account of the discrepancy (see p. 396) between the narratives given by Dr. Hovey and in this Report,
in respect of what happened in the cellar at Orange Hill on the afternoon of May 7th, we thought
it advisable to write to Mr. F. W. Grirritus, Kingstown, to ascertain, if possible, what were the actual
facts. We are much indebted to him for making further inquiries, and sending us the following
statement :— ‘

Letter from Mr, F. W. Griffiths, Government Office, St. Vincent, December 29th, 1902.

“The constable from Georgetown, who was of the first to visit Orange Hill cellar after the terrible
catastrophe, states that he counted 37 dead bodies, and that this was verified afterwards. He further
states that 18 people were in the cellar alive when he arrived, but cannot say how many were saved,
as they had nearly all come out, and their ideas were so confused, in consequence of the terrible
experiences they had passed through, that there were few, if any, able to give coherent accounts
of what occurred. He is certain of one thing, however, and that is that the people were killed in
consequence of the door being open. Only those at the door were killed.
