able in its class, and the details of its anatomy agreeing with this characteristic—
Sr. Rimy has shown lately that alone among Myriapods, Scutigera has its nervous
system permeated by bloodvessels (10)—indicate an unusual need for perfect aération
of the blood. Now, if I can show that an examination of the organ in question affords
good ground for regarding it as respiratory, it seems to me that the absence of any
other organ that can possibly be supposed to be respiratory affords a strong presump-
tion in favour of my views.

Next, we have the structure of the tubes themselves, They are of chitin, and are
of considerable length. The chitin grows thin and membranous towards the end,
affording a good opportunity for the interchange of gases.

Then there is the fact that the tubes are full of air. I satisfied myself on this
point by killing the living animal by a drop of chloroform, immediately cutting out
the organ, and teasing out the tubes in a drop of glycerine. When the tubes so
treated are placed beneath the microscope they have the peculiar shining appearance
which tracheal tubes usually have when placed in fluid beneath the microscope.

Next, we may consider the position of the tube ends with regard to the pericardium.
I have shown that the tube ends are actually within the pericardium, and as has been
pointed out by Lanxesrer, in Arthropods the pericardium is filled with blood,
therefore the tube ends are in such a position that they are continually bathed by
blood. I was able by carefully cutting out the organ and surrounding tissues from an
animal which had just been killed, and placing them in salt solution beneath the
microscope, to watch the blood coagulating and corpuscles collecting round the tube
