In order to remove any undecomposed
nitrate, it was boiled with water, whereby the undecomposed nitrate was dissolved,
and the peroxide converted into a hydrate. This bydrate, after having been washed
and dried at the temperature of the air, was of an extremely beautiful yellow colour,
and was I suppose the hydrate U* O*+2HO described in chemical treatises. It was
tolerably sensitive, in fact for an inorganic substance extremely s0, though the sensI-
bility was much less than that of nitrate of uranium, yellow uranite, or canary glass. The derived spectrum consisted as before of separate bright bands. A small portion
of the powder was attached by water to blotting-paper, and dried before a fire.
