The two emanations and the products, UrX and ThX, lose their
activity according to an exponential law with the time, and at a rate that is
independent—as far as observation has gone—of the chemical and physical agents at
our disposal. The time taken for the radioactivity of each of these products to fall
to half its value is thus a definite physical constant, which serves to distinguish it
from all other products. On the other hand, the ‘ excited activity’ produced in bodies by exposure in the
presence of the thorium and radium and actinium emanations does not decay according
to a simple exponential law, The variation of the excited activity with time is very
complicated, especially in the case of radium, and is dependent on the time of exposure
of the body in the presence of the emanation.

« It will be shown in the paper that the complicated rate of decay of the excited
activity of the thorium, radium, and actinium is due to the fact that the deposited



SUCCESSION OF CHANGES IN RADIOACTIVE BODIES. 171

matter undergoes two successive changes in thorium and actinium and at least four
successive changes in radium. The changes occurring present several points of interest and importance and will
be considered in some detail. In the course of this paper the following subjects
will be considered :—

(1) Nomenclature ;

(2) Rate of decay of the excited activity of thorium and radium for different
times of exposure to the emanation, and for the different types of
radiation ;

(3) Mathematical theory of successive changes ;

(4) Application of the theory to explain the changes in (a) thorium,
(6) actinium, (¢) radium ;

(5) Matter of slow rate of change produced by radium: comparison of the
matter with the radio-tellurium of MArcKWALD ;

(6) Apparent radioactivity of ordinary matter, due in part to an active deposit
of slow rate of change from the atmosphere ;
(7) Comparison of the successive changes in uranium, thorium, actinium, and

radium ;
Table of active products ;

(8) Discussion of the significance of ‘ rayless’ changes in the radio-elements.

(9) Radiations from the active products ;
Significance of the appearance of 8 and y rays in the last rapid change in
the radio-elements ;

(10) Difference between radioactive and chemical change ;

(11) Discussion of experiments made to measure the charge carried off by the
a rays ;

(12) Magnitude of the changes occurring in the radio-elements ;

(18) Origin of the radio-elements.
