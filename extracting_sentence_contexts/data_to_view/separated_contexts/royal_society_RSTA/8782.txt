Tt appears then that such a heterogeneous composition of celluloid will account for
the facts observed. This heterogeneity may be conceived as distributed uniformly
throughout the material ; the latter would then consist of a fine-grained elastic skeleton,
of which thé interstices are filled by a plastic or viscous magma. Or we may take the view that the elastic and plastic parts are definitely separated
from one another, e.g. the specimen may be looked upon as consisting of a plastic core
enclosed in an elastic skin, That a skin where the optical effects are quite different from
what they are in the core exists in celluloid is asserted by Coker and CuaKko (loc. cit.),
