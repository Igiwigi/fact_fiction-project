274 PROF. A. DENDY ON THE STRUCTURE, ETC., OF THE PINEAL ORGANS AND

eranules found in the innermost portion of the retina of the pineal eye, and I believe
that in both cases the rods are in some way derived from the more or less spherical
granules which lie externally to them.

The parallelism between the lateral and pineal eyes with regard to the pigment is
very interesting, and seems to me to support BERNARD'S views on the subject. The
difference between the two consists in the fact that in the lateral eye the spherical
granules do not appear to penetrate (as such) into the retina at all, while in the
pineal eye they do, and in the latter the spherical and rod-shaped granules cannot be
sharply separated into two categories and the rods are much less elongated ; indeed
the shortness of the rod-like granules in the pineal eye suggests that they may really
be flattened discs seen edge on rather than true rods.

I shall have to return to the question of the pigment later on in discussing how
far the pineal eye of Sphenodon can really be considered as degenerate.

(0) Accessory Cavities in the Retina.—I have already had occasion to observe that
the pigment tends to accumulate to an unusual extent around the margin of the
retinal cup. It does so both in the inner and outer layers of the retina, being
