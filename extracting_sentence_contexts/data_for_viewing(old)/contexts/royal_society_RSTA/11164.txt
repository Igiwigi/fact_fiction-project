out on examining them under a high power. Although under low powers there is no
obvious difference in definition between the genuine and pseudo-boundaries, under
greater magnifications it becomes impossible to focus the pseudo-boundaries at all—
they are seen to be more or less ill-defined slopes or changes of level, whereas the real
boundaries are sharply defined. In general the real boundaries show some
accumulation of gas bubbles along them, and they are never crossed by slip-bands.
The pseudo-boundaries are found to consist in small variations of level in the surfaces
of the grains in which they occur. Fig. 44 is a high-power photograph of a set of
real and pseudo-boundaries showing slip-bands.

It will be noticed that on the two sides of a real boundary the slip-bands are
independent of one another, whereas the slip-bands cross a pseudo-boundary with
only a slight change of inclination, which is to be ascribed to the fact that the
surface under examination is not a true plane. There is a slight slope on each side
of the pseudo-boundary, and the lines are consequently more or less inclined to one
another. Again, as we have noticed in other examples, the slope is not as a rule
constant and hence the lines are slightly curved.

An explanation of this appearance of pseudo-boundaries is, we think, to be found
in the strains set up by contraction on cooling. If we suppose the outer layer of
crystals to cool more rapidly than the inner ones, the resulting contraction will drive
the projecting edges of the lower layer into the outside grains and thus cause slight
local deformation, which will project itself on the surface, probably by means of twin
bands running through the grains and appearing on the surface. The effect
resembles that of a Japanese “magic” mirror, in which slight inequalities of the
