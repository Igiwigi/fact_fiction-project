As both hosts and parasite are restricted in
distribution by climatic and other factors, the behaviour of Compsilura and host A,
host B (not any caterpillar) is tolerably determinate. In this respect it is interesting
to note that Flanders (1937) has found that with the polyphagous egg parasite, T7vicho-
gramma, the natural hosts of the different species were fewer than the suitable hosts
(determined in artificial conditions) and that the groupings of hosts found in different
habitats—arboreal, field and marsh—were usually parasitized by only one species of
Trichogramma; if a species was transferred to a habitat to which it was not adapted it
soon disappeared even when suitable hosts were present. A further difficulty in a mechanical interpretation concerns the fact that in the
preceding experiments one host was chosen in contrast to another. In the selection of
hosts parasitized with an Ovencyrtus egg rather than those parasitized with early larvae
as a deciding factor in the egg laying response, the relation between the hosts is as
significant as the conditions between which the relation holds. To say that the ovi-
position of the female is attributable to a chain of reflexes and that hosts containing,
say, a parasite egg are attacked because they possess one more stimulus than the
alternate host, seems to be an incomplete description of the behaviour.
