This film is quite well shown in
figure specimens B.M.N.H.,* P 22404 (B.C.F., figure 16, plate 24) and B.M.N.H.
P 22392 A (C.CF. figure 17, plate 24). In some especially well-preserved specimens the dark film appears granular, which
suggests it to be in part formed by a shagreen of very small scales or denticles, similar
to that found in rare cases on the body of the Arthrodire Coccosteus from the same rocks
(Heintz 1938). One of the most important facts still to be discovered about Palaeospondylus is the
nature of the microscopic structure of the skeleton. The question was discussed in
detail but with little positive result by the Sollases, who concluded that it must have
been bone or calcified cartilage. The state of preservation of the material makes it
impossible to add to their work, but as there is so great a similarity between the
appearance of the skeleton of Palaeospondylus and the bone of other fishes like Coccosteus
in the same rocks, the skeleton of Palaeospondylus will here be referred to as bone.
