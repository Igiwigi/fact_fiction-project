But
in the main the graph is wonderfully smooth, and its departures from true periodicity,
which have troubled all previous analysts of the data, are precisely those found in fig. 2—
great variation in amplitude and continual changes of phase. If this interpretation is correct, it seems desirable to break away from the periodogram
method: the problem is, in fact, no longer one merely of determining the period, but
also of determining the values of ¢, the “ disturbances,” as I term them for short. It is
natural, then, to approach the problem from the standpoint of the equation relating
U, tO U,_1, Uz», ete. Starting also, as I did, with the conception of periodogram analysis
and harmonic periodicities in my mind, it was natural to assume an equation of the
form (6), and an equation of corresponding form for two periodicities.
