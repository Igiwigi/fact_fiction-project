where one identifies the first term in the braces in equation (5.5) as (Ge. DN
Now, the conceptual difference between the averaged Hamiltonians in equations (5.4) and (5.5) a

is that in terms of the function 6 (t), the first corresponds to the limit of localization, and the second aes]

to the limit of delocalization. Thus the two constitute the two limit cases and given also the fact ,

that the first is an infimum, one can argue that the true Hamiltonian for localization conditions

should be bounded by the two expressions. In terms of form, the only difference between the two

Hamiltonians is in the prefactor of ,f1. We will denote this prefactor (without the minus) by €.
