were collected during four separate sessions: a control block before muscimol injection (‘Pre’, dashed curves and cross symbols), a block immediately after inac-
tivation (‘0 h’, orange), a block 12 h after inactivation (‘12 h’, red) and a recovery block 36h after inactivation (‘36 h’, black solid curves and open symbols).

Because of this weak vestibular tuning, microstimulation also been shown to respond to tactile and auditory stimuli, as
may have failed to activate sufficiently large clusters of MSTd well as visual inputs [123-125].
