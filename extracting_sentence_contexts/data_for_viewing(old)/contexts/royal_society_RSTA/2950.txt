particle velocity at the leading stationary solitary wave, established at a distance of about 100 =

non-stationary wave V"*t with an established stationary leading solitary wave can be derived 1

It is clear that speed V"*t of the non-dissipative, non-stationary wave is not equal to the speed of
stationary shock-like stress wave V.} (equation (2.15)) despite the fact that, in both cases, the final
particle velocity uf is the same. Also the shock-like stationary stress wave, predicted in continuum
approximation at weak dissipation, has the ratio of particle velocity in the leading peak to uy
equal to (5/ 4), being less than 2. Detailed analysis of the structure of a stationary shock-like
stress wave in sonic vacuum in a discrete system in comparison with the continuum approach in
case of viscous dissipation and the criterion for the transition from oscillatory to the monotonous
wave profiles are presented in [62,63].

Dissipation in some strongly nonlinear metamaterials may be neglected because the discrete
nature of metamaterials and strong nonlinearity dominate when waves travel relatively short
distances. At the same time decay of waves can be essential due to viscoplastic deformation
between particles (spheres or cylinders) [81,82], friction between particles and the holder,
expulsion of fluid between interacting particles [63] or energy leaking from the main pulse due to
