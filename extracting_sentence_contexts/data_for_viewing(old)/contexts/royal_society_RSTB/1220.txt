most readily illustrated by reference to the Bryophyta (see below, p. 485, &e.),a
plants in which progressive sterilization of the tissues of the sporophyte app
have been closely connected with its increasing size and structural complexi
series is, however, characterized by the simple external form of the sporoph
by the further fact that the sporogenous tissue of each individual sporop

Progressive sterilization seems also to have played an important part in the
tion of the Vascular Cryptogams; in these, as we see them at the prese
the proportion of sporogenous tissue to vegetative tissue is comparatively sm
sporogenous cells are commonly separated into small masses, or are distributed
in fact, the sterilization appears to have progressed much further in the Vi
Cryptogams than in the Bryophyta; the external form, also, is much more Â¢
owing to the presence of appendicular organs. But though it may be more
to trace the steps of sterilization in the living Vascular Cryptogams, o
process having been more completely carried out, the experience gained from st
the Algee and Bryophyta should direct the line of observation into this chann

The adoption of the foliar habit as seen in the sporophyte of Vascular Cryp'
together with the elaboration of a subterranean system for absorption, brough'
it very great advantages; the physiological independence of the sporophyt
thereby secured, and it accordingly assumed a more permanent character and
life. Considering the greatness of the advantage thus gained, and the remote
of the past at which the step must have been taken in any one of the severa
