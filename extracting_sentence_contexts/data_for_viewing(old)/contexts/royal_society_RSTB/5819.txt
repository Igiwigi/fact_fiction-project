Apparently the cambium was active only along a very restricted line on either flank of
the primary wood. A curious point of resemblance with Botrychioxylon paradoxum is
the unusually large size of the outer tracheids (Scorr, 1912, p. 382, fig. 16, Plate 40),
which may have served, as Scorr suggests, for the storage rather than conduction of
water.} The thickenings are like those in the secondary xylem of the stem, even the
protoxylem elements being scalariform.

As a rule the cortex is badly crushed, and no root-hairs can be made out. Fig. 21,
Plate 7, shows a young diarch root, with only primary tissues; there is a wide paren-
chymatous cortex, with a dark zone near the periphery. The same kind of cortex is
seen in many roots with secondary growth like those described above (fig. 20, Plate 7).

Diagnosis.—In view of the facts now described we may re-define the genus Zygopteris
as follows :—

Genus Zygopteris, Corpa, emend. SAHNI.

Stele cylindrical, with a stellate core of primary xylem and a thick outer zone of
secondary wood. Leaf-trace at first mesarch, with a complete sheath of secondary
wood (which may extend into the petiole) ; then a tangentially extended band with a

* The Matoniaceous resemblance here strongly hinted need not be seriously considered till we know the
facts better.

+ Diarch roots, with steles almost identical in structure with those here shown in figs. 19, 24, Plate 7,
