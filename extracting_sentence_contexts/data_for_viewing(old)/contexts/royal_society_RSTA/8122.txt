Specification of Stress —The mathematical specification of stress in a solid is discussed
in all books on elasticity. Tt can most simply be represented by means of a stress quadric*
which is so placed that its principal axes are in the direction of the principal stresses,
so that the components of shear stress parallel to the principal planes are zero. The
principal shear stresses +, zzz, are defined ag the shear stresses parallel to the planes
which pass through one of the principal stress axes and are at 45° to the other two.
The stress acts in the direction at right angles to the principal stress axis which lies in
the plane concerned. If 6, 6a, ¢3 are the principal stresses then

™% = $ (a, — 53), tT: =} (53 — 9), Tt =3(4 = Ga).

The importance of the principal shear stresses lies in the fact that it is found experi-
mentally that the addition of a total hydrostatic pressure to any stress system does not
produce any plastic strain. This depends only on the shear stresses. The addition of
a constant pressure to o,, o, and cy leaves 7, +, and 73 unaffected so that >,

Ta, Ts are
sufficient to define the stress system so far

as plastic distortion is concerned ; and since
