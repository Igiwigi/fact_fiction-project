This salt has all the properties enumerated as belonging to the
genus of hyperoxygenized muriates ; and, with heat, the acid is
expelled by all acids above the benzoic. I had hoped that, without
distillation, I could procure the acid from the salt by means of
sulphuric acid, which would have left an insoluble salt with
barytes ; but hyperoxygenized muriatic acid is 80 easily decom-
posed by light, that I have not yet obtained it, to my satisfaction,
disengaged and pure. A fact well worthy of attention is, that
the stronger acids disengage this acid with a flash of light,

more frequently from the earthy than from the alkaline hyper-

oxygenized muriates; a phenomenon which, I suppose, depends

upon the relative proportionate affinities, and consequently the

greater rapidity of the disengagement. But, where all is hypo-

thesis, it is useless to draw any inference from a single fact. The proportions of this salt are,
