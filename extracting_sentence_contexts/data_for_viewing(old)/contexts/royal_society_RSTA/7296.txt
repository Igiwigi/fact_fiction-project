For a point of very large R the approximation (86) will become valid when ¢— R becomes
large and will in fact remain valid thereafter. However, in the early stages of its validity it
will be simpler to use the form (87), whilst ultimately the more convenient solution (73)
becomes valid.

It will be noted that the form (86) and its special case (87) involve arguments of Q from
0 to t—R, but, in general, these forms are only strictly valid when the contributions from
large arguments predominate. The asymptotic solution for Q could thus be used over the
whole range of integration, but rather better accuracy is to be expected if we use the exact
forms (57) and (66) for the relevant arguments of Q and the asymptotic form ( 81) for greater
arguments only.

For the special case of a point at a large distance to the rear which is on or near the plane
of symmetry y = } bisecting the slit, the forms (86) and (87) become valid at relatively
