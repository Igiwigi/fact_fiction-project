When segmentation took place in these fully impregnated eggs, their yelks seemed
to contract more powerfully, and the clear space, or respiratory chamber, formed in
each became much Jarger than in others from the same mass in which but a few
spermatozoa were detected ; s0 that the inference deducible from the fact seemed to
be, that a plurality of spermatozoa is necessary for the full impregnation of the egg,
and the production of the robust and healthy embryo—although simple fecundation
may result from the influence of only a very few spermatozoa, especially when such
influence is aided by a considerable increase in the temperature of the surrounding
medium,

Mode of Penetration by the Spermatozoon.—The preceding observations on natu-
rally fecundated eggs were s0 decisive of the fact of penetration by the spermatozoa
into at least the envelopes of the egg, and of the arrival at, and partial imbedment of
these bodies in the vitellary membrane, that it seemed desirable to make further
observations, by the artificial method, with a view to ascertain more directly the
mode and circumstances of their entry; and these it was hoped might be learned
through the facility with which the egg may be impregnated by direct application
of spermatozoa to almost any part of its surface. Accordingly, on the following
day, I placed an egg in a glass cell, beneath the microscope, and quickly afterwards
applied to one side'of it, by means of a pin-head, a quantity of spermatic fluid, ob-
tained from the male only a few minutes before, and immediately filled the cell with
water, and commenced the observation. 'The fluid was applied four times to the
same part of the egg, the pin-head being loaded for each application, in order that a
full sufficieney of spermatozoa might be furnished, before the water was added. The
