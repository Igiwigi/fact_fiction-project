are of slightly different sizes, that to the left being 3 mm. and that to the right 3 mm.
across. ‘Their vertical height is about 1 mm., but on the right-hand side of the
specimen is 1} mm. Spores were recognizable by reflected light in the sporangia.
The counterpart was incomplete, only showing the axis and the basal region of the
larger sporangium. ‘Two successive film-pulls removed all the organic material
of the fossil ; both showed numerous spores in the sporangial region. The spores
ranged in size from 25 p-37-+5 », had clear yellow walls, and in some cases showed
the tri-radiate marking, though in many it was not evident. Fig. 13, Plate 8,
shows a number of the spores lying against the black fragments of the sporangial
wall.

Observations which corroborate and extend the facts ascertained from the
three specimens described above were made on other preparations from Perton
Quarry. Thus as regards size an axis about } mm. or less in width, bearing a
sporangium 1}-2 mm. across by 1 mm. in height, may be taken as usual dimensions
for the distal portions of the plant. More slender axes bearing smaller sporangia
have been seen. On the other hand, the specimen in fig. 12, which there seems
no reason to treat separately, shows that the axis may attain a width of 1-5 mm.
and the sporangium of 3} mm. Pieces of stem not bearing sporangia and branched
or unbranched are often about $ mm, wide, but specimens over 1} mm. have been
seen which may have come from the lower regions of the small plant. Unfortunately,
no connected branch-system representing this in any completeness has been found.
As regards the spores, confirmation of their presence within sporangia borne on
pieces of the axis has been obtained from a number of additional specimens.
