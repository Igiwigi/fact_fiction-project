Leaf Traces.—A group of protoxylem moves out through the secondary wood to
supply each leaf. One can be seen in Phot. 35,1.t., Plate 6, on its way out. The
trace enters the leaf undivided.

The Leaves.—The leaves were simple pointed structures, diamond shaped in cross
section, as is seen on the diagrams in text-fig. 18, and Phot. 38, Plate 6, and were
sessile, with no differentiation of a special base. The leat base is almost as great as
the whole diameter of the axis. The external appearance of the leaf, as is seen in
fig. 11, Plate 1 (magnified by two diameters), is quite similar to that of a pressed
specimen of Cryptomeria, Taiwama, or Araucaria, ~The shape of the leaf in
transverse section is seen in text-fig. 18 and Phot. 38, Plate 6. There is considerable
variety among the different leaf sections owing to the slightly varying directions in
which the sections were cut, and also to the fact that at the base the leaves appear to
have been more grooved (see Phot. 38), while they became more smoothly oval at the
tip (see Phot. 39).

The Epidermis cells ave, like those of normal Gymnosperms, small celled with thick
outer walls.
z:.The Stomates are particularly well preserved and numerous. In surface view they
are seen in a number of leaves which are cut slightly obliquely. They are of the

* The anatomy of /'aiwania, except for a few details of the leaf, is as yet undescribed. The kindness
of Dr. HAYATA, its discoverer, put us in possession of some material, from which we cut sections for our
comparison with the fossil. Zaiwania (see HayATA, 1907) belongs to the Taxodinez, and comes near to
Cryptomeria in several respects, and to Cunninghamia in others,
