For, on differentiating the firs: equation
of (6), we obtain
d,(Qz—Ry) : m=d,A+muA,+mUd.A.. But, on reference to (5), it is clear that at the points in question (D,, ©,, ©., 0,)A=0,
or more generally

Soo) Babl Go RhQH=0 mlwMiC. - O)

Hence
d,(Qz—Ry) : u=dy(Qz—Ry) : v=d,(Qz—Ry) : w=d,(Qz—Ry) : k=mmA,;

in other words, the surface Qz—Ry touches U at the principal points of the system. Still more generally, we may write, for the whole group, the following formula, viz.

(ds Ds d,y Ds 91s 2, 7 | V3 re AE
P,Q,R,S
=mm (u, v, W, k)(A,, B,, Co Fr> On H,),

which expresses the fact that, at the principal points of the system, each of the surfaces
(T) has a two-branch contact with U. Tt remains to show that the same is the case
with each of the surfaces P, Q, R, S. Since each of the expressions for P, Q, R, S
vanishes at the points under consideration, we have

©.(Rv—Pz )=ad,R— 20,P =mmB,u,

d.(Py —Qz)=y9,P —xd,Q=mmC, uv.
