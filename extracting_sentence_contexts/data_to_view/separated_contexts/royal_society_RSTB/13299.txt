NCP was suggested as an alternative framing to ‘ecosystem
services,’ in part to engage a wider range of scholarship from the social sciences
and humanities and a larger discussion of values around ecosystems, and 18
broad categories of NCP have been proposed [2]. This paper for the special
issue on ‘The role of soils in delivering NCP’ reviews literature on three different
but related NCP categories: those of NCP 15—Learning and Inspiration, NCP
16—Physical and Psychological Experiences, and NCP 17—Supporting Identi-
ties. For each case, while the use of the term ‘NCP’ is not yet widespread in
iterature discussing soils, there are in fact numerous examples of how humans
have imagined, understood and experienced soil that represent the types of
benefits the term NCP tries to capture. Soils have inspired art, literature and
film; contributed to mental and physical health benefits from a variety of rec-
reational and livelihood activities; and shaped cultural identities and practices. The three NCP reviewed here are unique.
