In these circumstances, ignorant popularisers and journalists started to speak about ‘loss of
certainty’ and even ‘death of proof’. However, for the reasons I’m going to sketch in this article,
lam inclined to believe that the status of all results mentioned above—and of their proofs!—is not
significantly different from the status of deep mathematical results of previous centuries. In fact,
I am ready to contend that mathematical proofs never—from the times of Greeks!—satisfied the
declared standards. The claim of Bourbaki is utterly wrong in all of its parts, and, in particular,
none of the arguments in the first (geometric) books of Euclid would stand as a proof ‘a nos
yeux’—the proof is in the eyes of the beholder! The real wonder of Greek Mathematics is that
some of the proofs in the subsequent (arithmetic) books of Euclid still are proofs in our eyes, to
such an extent that we are still telling them to our students!
