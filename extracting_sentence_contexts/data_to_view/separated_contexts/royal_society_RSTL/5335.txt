His reafon for doing this, as he fays in his introduc-
tion, was not merely that his reader might not have
the trouble of ſearching elſewhere for the principles
on which he has argued, but becauſe he did not know
whither to refer him for a clear demonſtration of
them. He has alſo made an apology for the peculiar
definition he has given of the word chance or Pome
bility. His deſign herein was to cut off all diſpute
about the meaning of the word, which in common
language is uſed in different ſenſes by perſons of dif-
ferent opinions, and according as it 1s applied to paſt
or future facts. But whatever different ſenſes it may
have, all (he obſerves) will allow that an expeQtation
depending on the truth of any pa/t fat, or the hap-
pening of any ſuture event, ought to be eſtimated: ſo
much the more valuable as the tact is more likely to
be true, or the event more likely to happen. Inſtead
therefore, of the proper ſenſe of the word probabi-
lity, he has given that which all will allow to be its
proper meaſure in every caſe where the word is uſed.
