There is an @ priori probability that the pelvis in some Labyrinthodonts
may have been attached in the same way; but, in the absence of knowledge of the
pelvic structures of the larger Labyrinthodonts, it may be unsafe to attribute much
importance to resemblances of an isolated kind to certain existing Amphibia. There-
fore the coincidence of anterior direction of the ilium and a certain correspondence in
its form between Pareiasawrus and anurous Amphibia need only be noticed for what
they are worth ; but the support of the ilium by a single sacral vertebra, through the
intervention of a large sacral rib, is a character which implies Amphibian rather than
Reptilian affinity. But that it is not the character of an Amphibian may be inferred
from its presence in several genera of Anomodonts, and from the fact that in
Platypodosaurus, which is of Anomodont type, the character is lost, and the pelvis is
supported by a sacrum of several vertebrae in the manner seen in Dinosauria and
certain Mammalia. The inter-clavicles and clavicle are less markedly Labyrinthodont than other parts
of the skeleton, and yet offer a sufficiently close resemblance in plan to show that the
Labyrinthodont type has been modified, but not lost. The divergence which they
show is rather towards the corresponding bones of the Nothosauria than to the
clavicular arch of the Ichthyopterygia.
