multiple areas (e.g. different countries in the European interconnected system) while the grid
becomes increasingly low-carbon. In fact, with more and more renewables in the system, the
associated variability and forecast uncertainty create more challenges in terms of how power
flows across different areas under the jurisdiction of different transmission system operators
(TSOs). These flows need to be managed to preserve system security. The paper argues that,
in order to fully exploit the value of existing grid flexibility to economically support security
management across several interconnected areas, multi-TSO coordination could be achieved by
adopting a new approach inspired by the principles of cooperative game theory. More specifically,
the authors’ proposed approach aims to evaluate how and to what extent each control area
impacts in a positive or negative way on the common security performance of the multi-area
system, so that clear and transparent economic incentives could be provided to achieve optimal
coordination. Notably, while driven by economic principles, the approach facilitates the inclusion
of more detailed physical modelling (e.g. non-convexities of power system operation) in the
inter-TSO settlement of the security management cost of the interconnected system. This further
