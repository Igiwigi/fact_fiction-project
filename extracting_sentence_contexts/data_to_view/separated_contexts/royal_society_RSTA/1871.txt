Darwin organized these facts to propose a process, natural selection, to explain how
species change over time. It is not mere speculation about how species form. The facts behind
natural selection are: (1) all organisms produce many more offspring than are required to replace
themselves in the next generation. This ‘overproduction’ of offspring means that all populations
have the capacity for rapid increase in the number of individuals, that they will soon pack
their environment to capacity and that there will be an ensuing struggle for existence to obtain


the resources required for survival and reproduction, (2) within every population of organisms ls |
one can find differences among individuals in characters that affect their ability to use their

environment, (3) these individual variations may influence the ability of individuals to survive 3
and reproduce, and may enable some individuals to occupy new ecological niches, and (4) these oS
variations are heritable, meaning that they are faithfully transmitted from parent to offspring. : gS
All organisms appear to share these properties. When these conditions are satisfied, evolution by 13
natural selection is inevitable [3].
