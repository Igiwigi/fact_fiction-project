The origin of heredity is perhaps the first major innovation in biology. Most
research has linked the emergence of heredity with the appearance of genetic
replicators such as RNA [1-4]. The idea of an RNA world goes back to the
late 1960s [5-7] and pleasingly solves the chicken-and-egg problem of which
came first, DNA (which is mostly inert and cannot copy itself) or protein
(which is catalytic, but has properties that are specified by DNA). Because
RNA is capable of both catalysis and replication, it could theoretically have
been central to the origins of heredity, and so life itself [5-7]. The fact that
RNA remains the crucial intermediary between DNA and proteins reinforces
this view. Plainly RNA was central to early evolution and the origin of the
genetic code.

But there are some practical difficulties with the RNA-world hypothesis in
its strongest form—the idea that ribozymes ‘invented’ metabolism as well as the
genetic code. It has proved challenging to synthesize nucleotides via prebiotic
chemistry [8—10]. The first successful synthesis of activated pyrimidine nucleo-
tides was achieved as recently as 2009 [11], while purine nucleotides have yet to
be produced by abiotic chemistry [10]. Even successful syntheses have required
radically different conditions for separate reaction steps [10]. Nucleotide syn-
thesis at the origin of life was presumably not facile. Even if synthesized at
