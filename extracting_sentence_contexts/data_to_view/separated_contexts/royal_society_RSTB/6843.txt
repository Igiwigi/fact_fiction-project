It is convenient to deal first with the use of centres of ossification as criteria in
determining the independence, or the dual or single nature, of a bone. This is because,
though widely held to be most unreliable by embryologists, it has constantly cropped
up in discussions of this particular problem and has reappeared even in the most
recent comments (Olson 1938). First, the fact that the palatine processes of some mammals ossify from separate
centres was the reason for regarding them as separate bones and the basis on which
they were homologized with the prevomers. But de Beer (1937) says:

The attempt might be made to define a bone according to embryological criteria as the
product of a single embryonic centre of ossification, but this leads into serious difficulties. In
the first place, many single bones may arise from more than one centre of ossification.
