the operation; secondly, the centre of P, had been removed and its inhibiting influence on
the formation of new leaf centres had consequently diminished.

The position of J, in this group was located by its angle from Ps, since the original
centres of P, and P, were lacking. The normal angle P,;—/, may be taken as three times the
mean normal divergence angle or 457°-9. The angles are recorded in table 2. I this
group in which P, had regenerated a new centre, J, showed a kathodic displacement of
2°-2 in no. 9 and 11°-9 in no. 10, and its centre was approximately opposite to the supposed
median strand of the new P,. It therefore seems probable that the new centre of P,
exerted a repulsive effect on J,. This effect, however, cannot have lasted as long as in
a normal leaf, since the centre of J, was close above the centre of P,, the angle /—J, being

170° and 167° in the two experiments. The fact that /, occupies the smaller angle P,-J,
in both these experiments raises the question whether any leaf other than the regenerated
P, and J, was effective in determining J,. It is suggested that P, was effective in doing so, since
its centre lies on the same side of the apex as the larger angle between P, and J, (figure 7B,
no. 9). Ps would thus play the same part in these experiments in determining J, as did P, in
three experiments of group I (nos. 3, 7 and 8) in determining J,, for in both experiments
a leaf arose in the smaller angle between the last two leaves, and the centre of a leaf four
plastochrons older (P, or P3) lay beneath the larger angle, while the centre of the leaf
(P, or P,) underlying the smaller angle had been removed. As this situation occurred in
