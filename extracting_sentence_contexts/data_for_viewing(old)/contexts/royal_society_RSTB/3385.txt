From this table it is seen, in as convincing a manner as from our own results, that
our formula, B = W'/k, represents the experimental facts in a very satisfactory
manner, while the same facts are quite distorted if we look upon the blood volume
as a function of the body weight. In the one case the average deviation between
the observed and calculated figures is 4°79 per cent., and in the other about
13°3 per cent.

In Tables X and XI we give the results obtained. by SHERRINGTON and CopEMAN
on rabbits, by intravenous injection of a known quantity of normal saline solution,
and determining the change produced in the specific gravity of the blood.
