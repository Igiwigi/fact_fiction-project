This motion bears s0 great a resemblance to' that of the
grinding teeth of ruminating animals,”in which the' teeth of
the under jaw slide upwards, within” those of the upper,
pressing the food between them; and- fitting it by this peculiar
kind of trituration for being digested ; that itis fair to.conclude,
it is for the same purpose, more especially, when we only
find it in those birds that graze:

The gizzard of the goose is evidently fitted for a harsher
kind of grass than that of the swan, and we find that the
goose prefers the common grass of the fields, while the swan
is partial to the- soft weed found in ponds and rivers, and
only grazes occasionally,

The bill of the goose breaks off the grass short from the
ground, nearly in the same manner as the fore teeth of rumi-
nants. In like manner as ruminants have only teeth in the
under jaw, 80 has the goose 8mall pointed cuticular teeth in
the lower portion of the bill, which, when the bill is closed,
fit into grooves in the upper one, $0 that the grass inclosed
in the space between the teeth and grooves, is nipped off;

There is a swell in the lower part of the cesophagus 'in
these birds, which is peculiar to them: this answers'the pur-
pose of a reservoir, in which the grass is retained, macerated,

and mixed with the secretions poured out by the glandular
surfaces surrounding it, in this respect corresponding to the
first and second stomach of ruminating animals, in which the
grass is prepared for mastication. These facts, as they account for the goose and swan living
upon a species of food not fitted for birds in general, proves
that in this class of animals, a peculiar conformation of the
digestive organs is required, as well as in quadrupeds, when
they are intended by nature to live intirely upon grass. This fact being ascertained, is not without its importance in
elucidating this branch of physiological inquiry. EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE.
