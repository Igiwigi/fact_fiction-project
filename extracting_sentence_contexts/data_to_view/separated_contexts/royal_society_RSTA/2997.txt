Each state provides ontological support
for our subjective perception of existing in the present and the ordered sequence of states provides
ontological support for our perception of progressing through time from the past to the future. The theory may thus appear to be at odds with the block universe for which events at all times
coexist as one entity. However, I argue below that the new theory is, in fact, consistent with the
block universe view. I show that the ordered sequence of states provides a physical basis for some
of our subjective notions about time to be incorporated into the block universe view. It resolves,


therefore, the open problem of how to square the human perspective of time within the block
universe [14].
