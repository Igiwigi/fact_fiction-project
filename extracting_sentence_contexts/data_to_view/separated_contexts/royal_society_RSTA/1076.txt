Another example is the Tugurahua eruption on 6 February 2008. This is shown in figure 13b. The
agreement is good considering the fact that the temperature, the size, the exhaust velocity and

the materials of volcanic plume are so different from those of laboratory jets. Needless to say, the
result is amazing.
