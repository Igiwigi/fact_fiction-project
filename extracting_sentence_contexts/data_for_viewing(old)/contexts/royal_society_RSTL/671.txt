treous humour, and kept the short tube erect, in its natural
Situation.

I mention this circumstance, to prevent, as much as I am
able, other anatomists from being disappointed in not finding

= it; which may readily happen, if the search be not made with
2 considerable attention.

= In the sheep, there is no appearance of a zone surrounding
= the tube.

Bd These facts, although few in number, are sufficient to prove,
S that this orifice is not peculiar to the retina of the human eye;
Z and that its situation in man and in the monkey is the same: in
Z them, it is placed at some distance from the optic nerve ; but,
T in some other animals, its situation is close to that nerve, and
2 it puts on the appearance of a tube, instead of an orifice.

by There is one circumstance which is curious, and which-it
= will require further information upon this subject to explain;
i the yellow zone, found in the human eye and that of the mon-
EZ key, is not met with in any other animal which I have exa-
S mined.
