term which contains #, we have

the series on the right-hand side being continued up to the term in R*. This formula

. . q f—1
is, in fact, true if R, instead of being restricted to denote =, denotes any function

whatever of the form 1+bt+cf+&c., and it is true not only for the term in #, but for
all the powers of t not higher than #. And, moreover, R-" may denote any positive or
negative integral or fractional power of R. In fact, the formula (assuming for a moment
the truth of it) hows that the expansion of any power whatever of a series of the form
in question, can be obtained by means of the expansions of the successive positive
integer powers of the same series: the existence of such a formula (at least for negative
powers) was indicated by EISENSTEIN, Crelle, t. xxxix. p. 181 (1850), and the formula
itself, in a slightly different form, was obtained in a very simple manner by Professor
SYLVESTER in his paper, © Development of an idea of EIsENSTEIN,” Quart. Math. Journ.
t. 1. p. 199 (18559); the demonstration was in fact as follows, viz. writing

R*=(1+R=I)=1+7 (R—=1)+Z5" (R—1)+&e::
if we attend only to the terms involving powers of # not higher than #*, the series on the
right-hand side need only be continued up to the term involving (R—1)*, and the right
side being thus converted into a rational and integral function of R, it may be developed
