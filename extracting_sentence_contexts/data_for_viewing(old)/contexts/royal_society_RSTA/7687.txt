ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENT OF RESISTANCE 469

of publication in the Collected Researches of the National Physical Laboratory, but
it may be stated that the result was

1 International Ohm (as realized at the N.P.L.) = 1-000 50 + 2 « 10° ohms.

The two methods therefore agree perfectly within their estimated errors, a most
satisfactory state of affairs. An important point in connexion with this agreement
is that the two systems of electrical measurements involved are entirely different, for
Lorenz method employs direct current technique, while the Campbell method
depends entirely on the technique of alternating-current bridge-measurements. It
is very satisfactory to have established the fact that the two systems of measurement
are consistent to such a high accuracy. The above two results have been stated
in terms of the value accepted for the International Ohm at the National Physical
Laboratory in 1936. ‘This value was based on measurements made with columns of
mercury in 1912, and in 1924, and on assumptions regarding the constancy of
certain standard resistance coils. The values obtained for the coils from the
experiments with mercury-tubes in 1924 differed by 25 parts per million from those
obtained in 1912. As the estimated experimental error was of this order, there was
no evidence of change of value of the coils. They were therefore assumed to have
remained constant and the mean of the 1912 and 1924 values taken. They have
also been assumed to have remained constant since 1924. The relative constancy
of coils of different ages over the whole period, together with the measurements with
mercury tubes in 1912 and 1924, and absolute measurements in 1914 and 1936
