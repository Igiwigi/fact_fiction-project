Only from the
narrow medial strip of the archenteric plate is such a definitive chorda formed as is
shown in fig. 103. The remaining lateral strips of the original archenteric plate are
converted into gastral mesoderm, as formerly described. The marked attenuation of the definitive chorda, illustrated in fig. 103, harmonises
with the fact of its derivation from the narrow “ chorda-plate” only, 7.e., the median
strip of the original wide archenteric plate. The manner of transformation of
“chorda-plate” into definitive chorda is illustrated in the series of figs. 104-107,
Plate 3,

These figures are drawn from serial sections of the anterior region of Specimen ZZ,
which was slightly less advanced than Specimen H, but in which the process of neural
differentiation had begun (cf. figs. 73 and 74, Plate 3). Tn fig. 104 the chorda-plate is shown as a flat cell-plate of no great width.
