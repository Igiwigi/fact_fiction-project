These procedures are
effective, but time consuming and tedious. Emboldened by this new understanding, the group then
went on to transfer nuclei from cultured cells derived from
embryos. ES cells have not been derived from ungulate
embryos despite the fact that a considerable effort has been
made. During attempts to derive such lines, it was common
experience that after a few passages there were no cells
which resembled ES cells. The initial objective of the exper-
iment was to transfer nuclei from the culture as this
happened.
