The strength of the inhibi-
tion thus decreases with the age of the leaf from which it comes and also with the distance from the
inhibiting centre. The asymmetries of the leaves that arose after the operations are reported and discussed in
comparison with those of the normal leaves. Many of the facts can be explained if it is supposed that
the same influences from existing leaves which tend to inhibit the formation of leaf centres

promote the extension of leaf flanks round the apex. But the asymmetry of J, in most of the
experiments is at present not explained on this hypothesis.
