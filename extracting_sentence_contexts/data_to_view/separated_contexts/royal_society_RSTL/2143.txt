When a strong solution of the pure acid was poured into
a strong solution of muriate of baryta, a precipitate was
formed, in consequence of the production of this salt. It was
re-dissolved by the addition of water. The fact indicates
that the affinity of this acid for baryta is stronger than that
of muriatic acid.


and naphthaline, and on a new acid produced. 153

The second, or glowing salt of baryta, was obtained in small
crystalline groups. The crystals were prismatic, colourless,
and transparent: they were almost tasteless, and by no
means $0 soluble either in hot or cold water as the former
salts.
