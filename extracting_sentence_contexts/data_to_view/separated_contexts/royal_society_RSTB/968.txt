The occurrence of an
égsed number of these cells in the deeper vessels would indicate that the increased
in the superficial tissues is brought about by an increased supply from other
HRof the body; on the other hand, the occurrence of small leucocytes together
nea ones suggests local increase (fig. 38). Vg regard to the proportion of leucocytes to red blood corpuscles, there are 2 per
tof leucocytes in vessels which are full of blood, while in ruptured vessels out of
i& blood has escaped there are 18°75 per cent. of leucocytes. This fact shows very
‘ky that, since they do not migrate in any numbers from the vessels, the business
i leucocytes lies within the vessels and not directly with the degenerating tissues
(Be mucosa.
[Be probability of the accuracy of this view is substantially increased by an
Bination of the percentages in Stage VIII, a record of which will be found in
section. A further change now takes place in the superficial stroma and in the epithelial
ls (figs. 20, 21). Some of the superficial stroma retains the appearance observed
‘Stage IV. (figs. 18, 24, &c.), but a large proportion now consists of nuclei much
rivelled and surrounded by little or no appreciable protoplasm.
