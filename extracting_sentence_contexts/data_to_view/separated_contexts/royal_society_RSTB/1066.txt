(Plate 66, fig. 3.) Svould again call attention to the fact that in the case of complete cerebellar

ation no such tract of degeneration was discoverable in the spinal cord, and the

‘Derrers’ nucleus were normal ; and a similar healthy appearance was observ-

in another case of extirpation of the lateral lobe (Exp. 5). (Plate 66, fig. 2.)

svidence, therefore, is in favour of the tract in question being dependent upon

tion of the cells of Derrers’ nucleus.
