evidently laminated appearance, particularly the blue variety,
which is brought to us either from Canada or ſrom the East
Indies; but never yet was an appearance of this nature perceived
in any kind of calcedony.

Many celebrated mineralogists, amongst whom may be men-
tioned the Abbe Havy, seem to explain this want of crystalli-
zation in calcedony, by considering that substance as nothing
more than quartz in a concrete state. This is, in fact, supposing
it a sort of irregular crystallization, which bears the same ana»
logy to quartz, that calcareous alabaster bears to crystallized
carbonate of lime. I cannot, however, by any means adopt this
opinion, as it does not appear to me to agree with those facts
which nature permits us to observe; for, not to mention those
kinds of quartz which are produced by a disturbed crystallization,

for instance, granulated quartz, both of a fine and of a coarse
grain, quartz in stalactites, &c. we are acquainted with several
kinds of trueconerete quartz, which forms veins in primitive rocks,
in the same manner as carbonate of lime forms veins in secondary
rocks. All these substances have the appearance peculiar to
quartz, and show nothing that is at all analogous to that appear-
