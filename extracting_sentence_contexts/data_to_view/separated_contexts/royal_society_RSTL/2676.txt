They are dispersed through so many publications,
> eleven papers in the Philosophical Transactions, published in the course of twenty years, an Inquiry into the
= Laws of the Vital Functions, a Treatise on the Influence of Minute Doses of Mercury in restoring the Fune-
7 tions of Health, my Gulstonian Lectures on the more obscure affections of the Brain, &c., that although they
= are frequently referred to, it has almost always been, more or less, under mistaken views; because the
2 writer, in commenting on one part, has been unacquainted with others with which it is intimately con-
S nected, for in 80 protracted an investigation, few will take the trouble to keep pace with the inquirer. y It will appear from the references in the following paper how each of the various facts, dispersed through
p51] 50 many publications, has contributed to fill up the great outline of the laws that regulate the animal fune-
© tions, which has been the object of my labours, and from which the topics of the day have never induced me to
5 swerve. It is evident that this outline must be ascertained, before the functions of particular organs can be
© uccessfully investigated ; all of which more or less depend on the general laws of our frame. The following I believe is the first attempt which has been made to ascertain experimentally the seat, the
functions and the nature of all the powers of the more perfect animal, and the various relations they bear to
each other, by which, several and in some functions all of these powers being enabled to cooperate, their more
complicated results are effected.
