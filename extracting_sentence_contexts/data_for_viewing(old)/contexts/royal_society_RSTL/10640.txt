20 render it probable that the prefrontal lobes have essentially the same physiological
relations as the electrically effective postfrontal centres. 1

In Experiments 19 and 20, notwithstanding the extensive destruction of the post-
frontal centres, the paralysis of the lateral movements of the head and eyes was very
transitory, and in Experiment 23 the destruction of the prefrontal regions subsequent
to the recovery from the lesions of the post-frontal centres re-induced similar
symptoms. Hence it would appear that so long as portions of the frontal centres
remain intact, the movements of the head and eyes are not permanently paralysed.

The prefrontal and postfrontal regions are shown by the secondary degenerative
changes demonstrated in Experiments 22 and 23, to be anatomically related to the
same tracts of the internal capsule and- crus cerebri. 'This fact also would indicate
community in their physiological relationships. Though the prefrontal regions did
not react, or very doubtfully, to electrical stimulation, yet this would nob militate
against their being considered part of the same physiological centre as the postfrontal
regions. For it was found that the occipital lobes did nob respond like the angular
gyri to electrical stimulation, and yet formed an integral portion of the visual centres.
As to the psychical effects of the frontal lesions it is difficult to speak at all definitely.
In some cases there was no very marked change, yet in others, as in Experiment 2,
previously carefully studied, there was a very manifest alteration in the character of
the animal.

On the whole there seemed mental deterioration, characterised by general apathetic
indifference or purposeless unrest : effects which, in comparison with those of other
