In such cases the acces
8ibility is advantageous, especially for purposes of experiment. Tt is well, however,
to avoid such a large excess of salt as was present in this case, By alternate
melting and crystallisation as the temperature rises and falls, there is a tendency :
to aggregation, of which the cell above referred to affords an extreme example. In the construction of cells with solid zinc electrodes, I have fallen back upoy
a simplified patternâ€”nothing more in fact than a small tube with a platinum
wire sealed through its closed end. See figure. :
