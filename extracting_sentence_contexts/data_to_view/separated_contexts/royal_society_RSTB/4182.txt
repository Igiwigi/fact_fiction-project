They also retain their old articulation with the
palatines. Both of these may be regarded as ancient characteristics, which are
retained by the more primitive of Mammals. The articulation of the exoccipitals and the atlas is also of interest, owing to she
fact that articulation is continuous between the condyles. The confluence of the optic
foramen with the foramen lacerum anterius is in itself an indication of the Reptilian
ancestry of the Marsupialia, It is a condition which is to be observed only in the
lower Mammals.

(b) Comparison with the Prototheria. The skull of Perameles, as depicted in the sections available for examination,
occupies in many ways an intermediary position, in point of view of development,
between those of Trichosurus and Dasyurus.
