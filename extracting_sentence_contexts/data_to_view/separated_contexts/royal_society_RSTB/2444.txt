for the two other plots not sampled in the
earlier years. In the second depths of 9 inches, however, at none of the periods do we find more
eitric-acid-soluble phosphoric acid than in the totally unmanured Plot 3. In fact, we
find actually less in every instance but one. In the third depths, too, there is a slight excess, on the whole, in the 1865
samples ; and in the 1893 samples an excess only in three cases, and in only two of
these is the excess a fairly tangible one. Now it has already been seen that there is reason to suppose that there has been
a descent of manurial phosphoric acid below the first 9 inches.
