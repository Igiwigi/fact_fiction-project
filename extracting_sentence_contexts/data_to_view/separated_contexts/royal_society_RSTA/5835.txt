Indeed, the critical exponent associated
with a is very close to 0.5, the known value for O, the order parameter in the opinion dynamics
model (or Ising model) in the mean-field case. We also observed a discontinuity in the value of o at p = pc. In fact, the behaviour of o is quite
similar to that of the specific heat of the mean-field Ising model with the critical exponent equal to
zero and a jump discontinuity [32]. Note that both o and specific heat are measures of fluctuation. So we claim that from these walks, not only the transition point can be detected, one can also
obtain an estimate of the static critical points.
