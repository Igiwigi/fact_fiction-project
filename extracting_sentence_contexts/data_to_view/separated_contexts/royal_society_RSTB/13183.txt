If proved correct, this
would provide information on how cues such as temperature
are transduced. However, it could also be tested in other cir-
cumstances, e.g. cues such as population density or
population sex ratio driving sex change in sequential hermaph-
rodites. In any case, the CERS and CaRe models are compatible
and complementary because in fact they concern different
parts and aspects of the pathway, from the initial environ-
mental cue to the ultimate sexual fate. Histone modifications
may be induced before methylation changes that then
serve as more stable epigenetic marks [58]. The proposed
mechanistic models linking environmental signals and sex-
determination pathways can be useful to direct further
research.
