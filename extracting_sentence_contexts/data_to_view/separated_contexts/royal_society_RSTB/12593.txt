As already com-
mented in ยง2a, for the sake of simplicity, Fgf/Wnt signalling,
as well as Delta-Notch pathways, involved in rosette for-
mation, were not included in this work. In fact, we have here
opted for a simplified characterization of both cell phenotypes
and relative pseudo-mesenchymal-to-epithelial transitions reg-
ulating rosette formation which allow us to neglect complex
processes occurring at subcellular scales. It in fact allows us
to focus on the dynamic expression of different receptors
within the primordium and the consequent onset of its direc-
tional locomotion. In more detail, the underlying hypothesis
of the proposed approach is that the progressive organization
of PMs into rosette-like clusters regulates both the polarization
of receptors Cxcr4/Cxcr7 along the primordium, and the sub-
division of the placode in a leading portion of PM cell
secreting FGF10 and a trailing portion mainly comprising
cells expressing the receptor fgfrl. Another relevant aspect of
the proposed approach with respect to previous mathematical
works is that, according to experimental observations in,
among others, [5,8,10], it takes into account that the expression
of SDFla-receptor Cxcr4 is not limited to the leading PM cells
secreting FGF10 only.
