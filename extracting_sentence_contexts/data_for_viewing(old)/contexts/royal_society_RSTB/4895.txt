that no such phenomena have been observed. “ Though undeniable as possibilities ”
Dr. Barrson wrote in a review of ‘ Age and Area’ (‘Nature,’ January 13th, 1923)
‘we have to consider what warrant for such guesses” (as Coleus elongatus being the
immediate parent of C. barbatus, and so forth) “can be drawn from the observed facts
of variation. The answer is quite clear that up to the present scarcely anything com-
parable has been observed.” To such an argument the reply seems to me to be that
we are not likely to observe the actual occurrence of a viable specific mutation—it is

far too rare an event—unless or until we discover how to stimulate such mutations
artificially. This is in fact the answer already given by Dr. Wrtxis (‘ Age and Area,’
p. 212): “Lord RayzxieH has estimated the period since the Eocene alone, which
covers but a portion of that occupied in the evolution of the higher plants, at 30,000,000
years. But if we suppose one mutation in 50 years to survive, we should get the whole
of the existing 160,000 species of flowering plants in 8,000,000 years, which is only
26 per cent. of that time.”

Let us look at the matter more closely. In the above illustration Dr. Wiiu1s has
taken the mutations as occurring uniformly throughout the period of evolution, so that
the total number of species would increase in arithmetic progression. But we concluded
that the total number of species increases, not in arithmetic progression, but according
to a law which gradually approximates to geometric progression (equations 21 and 24,
p. 50).
