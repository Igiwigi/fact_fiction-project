the remaining portion of the surface vanish in comparison with that of the disk, But
without entering into the question I assume that the prepotential of the remaining
portion does thus vanish ; the prepotential of the whole snrface in regard to the inde-
finitely near point P is thus equal to the prepotential of the disk; viz. its value is

which, observe, is infinite for a point P on the surface.

5. Considering the prepotential V of an arbitrary point (@. . . c, e) as a given function
of (@...c, e) the coordinates of this point, and taking (z. . . z, w) for the coordinates
of the point N, which is, in fact, an arbitrary point on the surface, then the value of V
at the point P indefinitely near to N will be =W, if W denote the same function of
(v...z, w) that Vis of (@...c, e). The result just obtained is therefore
