m, § 2). A comparatively simple proof of Markoff’s theorem
is given in Cassels (1949). t For the fact that Q,,(u, v) assumes both 1 and —1, see, for example, Dickson (1930, last clause of theorem
74). The rest of our assertion follows by the classical theory of the periodic chain of reduced forms equivalent
to a given form. § Two irrational numbers 4, @’ are said to be equivalent if 6 = (a0’+b)/(c0’+d), where a, 6, c, d are
integers with ad—be = +1; or, what is the same thing, if the continued fractions for and 6’ have the same
‘tails’.
