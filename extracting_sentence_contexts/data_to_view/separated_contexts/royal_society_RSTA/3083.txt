Here, q is the position observable and p is the canonically conjugate momentum observable of a
particle localizable in one dimension, and h is Planck’s constant, whose value in mks units is h =
6.6261103 x 10-4. Despite the smallness of this number, in order to harmonize some probabilistic
conventions with physics, we will find it convenient to take h = 47 and to define a canonical pair
as a pair of self-adjoint operators (p,q) satisfying the commutation relation

[p,q] = —2i (2.1)

in the sense that the corresponding families of unitary operators (e? ver, (elM)yer satisfy the
formally equivalent but mathematically rigorous Weyl commutation relations

e BY el? @l7 = ePY el elt? (2.2)

An example of such a pair, called the Schrédinger pair (pschr, 4schr), can be constructed in the
Hilbert space L?.(R) by defining the two families of operators

Py) =fy + V2x) and (eVS"A(x) =eVF(0),

having first verified that the families of unitary operators defined by these actions are indeed both
continuous unitary representations of the group (R, +), so that by Stone’s theorem they determine
unique self-adjoint operators pschr and qgchr, and that (2.2) holds. In fact, by the Stone-von Neumann uniqueness theorem [4-6], the Schrédinger pair is
essentially unique. More precisely given an arbitrary canonical pair (p,q) acting in a Hilbert space
HH, there exists a Hilbert space K and a Hilbert space isomorphism (i.e. a unitary transformation) U
from L2(R) ® K to H, which intertwines each e#? with e*?s6 @ Ix. and each e? with ee @ I. Another useful canonical pair is in the Hilbert space I2.(Z>9) of square-summable complex
sequences, which it is convenient to regard as the Fock space over the Hilbert space C, in the
sense of the following definition.
