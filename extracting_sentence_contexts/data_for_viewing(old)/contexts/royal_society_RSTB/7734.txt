We can recognize two broad categories of form among modular organisms: that in which
the modules remain attached to each other, and that in which modules or groups of modules
become separated — organisms that fall to pieces as they grow. In situations in which modules
remain attached to each other the form of the whole organism may depend on the accumulation
of dead modules from the past. Quite unlike any unitary organisms, a large part of the body
of some modular organisms is the accumulated ‘necromass’ of dead modules. It is this feature
that gives trees, corals and mosses their peculiar role in creating structure in a community:
forests, coral reefs and peat bogs have a community architecture that is an accumulation of
dead modules bearing a thin skin of active feeding modules (polyps or leaves). The fact that
most modular organisms occupy fixed positions in space means that they give a continuity to
the spatial structure of communities that mobile unitary organisms cannot do.

An organism that is fixed in position in its habitat depletes resources locally. It cannot escape
from the resource depletion zones that is creates except by growing away from them.
Competition between individuals will commonly occur where such organisms are close enough
to enter into each other’s resource depletion zones. One effect is that different parts of a single
genet may meet quite different environments — a neighbour on one side and none on the other,
or a neighbour of one species on one side and a different species on the other. The fitness of
a single genet is then simultaneously tested in a variety of environments. The progeny that
it leaves may derive almost entirely from a single branch that grows into an open space or into
the territory of a weaker neighbour. Modular organisms of this sort allow the interaction
