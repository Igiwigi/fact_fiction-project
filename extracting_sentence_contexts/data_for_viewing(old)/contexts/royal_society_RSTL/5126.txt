the circumstance that an epipolized beam, when subjected to prismatic analysis with
a low magnifying power, exhibited no bands of absorption in the region to which, as
regards their refrangibility, the dispersed rays principally belong ; s0 that altogether
this theory bore not the slightest semblance of truth.

6. I found myself thus fairly driven to suppose that the change of nature consisted
in a change of refrangibility, From the time of Nzwrox it had been believed that
light retains its refrangibility through all the modifications which it may undergo.
Nevertheless it seemed to me less improbable that the refrangibility should have
changed, than that the undulatory theory should have been found at fault. And
when I reflected onthe extreme simplicity of the whole explanation if only this one
supposition be admitted, I could not help feeling a strong expectation that it would
turn out to be true. In fact, we have only to suppose that the invisible rays beyond
the extreme violet give rise by internal dispersion to others which fall within the limits
of refrangibility between which the retina of the human eye is affected, and the expla-
nation is obvious. The narrowness of the blue band observed by Sir Joux Herscner
would merely indicate that the fluid, though highly transparent with regard to the
visible rays, was nearly opake with regard to the invisible. According to the law of
continuity, the passage from almost perfect transparency to a high degree of opacity
would not take place abruptly ; and thus rays of intermediate refrangibilities might
produce the blue gleam noticed by Sir Joan Herscnsr, or the blue cylinder, or
rather cone, observed by Sir Davip BrewsTeErR. We should thus, too, have an imme-
diate explanation of a remarkable circumstance connected with the blue band, namely
that it can hardly be een by strong candle-light, though readily seen by even weak
daylight. For candle-light, as is well known, is deficient in the chemical rays situ-
