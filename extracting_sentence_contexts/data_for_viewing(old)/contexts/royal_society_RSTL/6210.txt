by means of the lincar equations p
(#, y, 2)=(AXR; Y, 2),

where A is a matrix, then using the same letter A to represent the determinant formed

out, of this matrix, or determinant of substitution, we have

3
J=xP
s that the equation in 9 is one that presents itself in the question of the reduction of

the cubic to its canonical form.
In fact the linear transformation gives
SA =—I+,
TA%= 1—20P—87,
and thence
(T*—648)A?=(1+8P)*,
which, writing B* in the place of T?—648*, becomes
B*A'*=(1+8PY, or
BA'= 1+8?P , or 87=BA*—1T,

whence also
S8TA%= 8—20(BA*—1)—(BA'—1)

=27—18 BA* — BA,
