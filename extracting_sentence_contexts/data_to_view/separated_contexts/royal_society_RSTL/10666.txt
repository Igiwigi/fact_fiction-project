symmetrically ; corresponding, in fact, to the case where a conic is inverted on a point
in one of its axes. :

If the radii of both principal circles are infinite the centre of inversion is the centre ©
of the conic : e.g., the lemniscate, whose equation would be of the form 2=aAa? +).

103. If one of the principal circles, in the last section, becomes a straight line, and
one of the two foci coincide with the centre of the principal circle, the nodes at infinity
become cusps.
