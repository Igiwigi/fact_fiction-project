Bohr
adjusted, sometimes significantly, his interpretation. This requires one to specify to which version
of his interpretation one refers, which I shall do, while focusing on his ultimate, strong RWR,
interpretation.> As, however, Bohr argued already in the so-called Como lecture of 1927, which
presented his first interpretation of QM, in classical physics and relativity ‘our... description
of physical phenomena [is] based of the idea that the phenomena concerned may be observed
without disturbing them appreciably’ [6] (v. 1, p. 53; emphasis added). Bohr is careful to refer to the
idea and hence the assumption rather than saying that such is in fact the case. This assumption
is, however, workable in these theories for all practical purposes. By contrast, ‘any observation
of atomic phenomena will involve an interaction [of the object under investigation] with the agency of
observation not to be neglected’ [6] (v. 1, p. 54; emphasis added).
