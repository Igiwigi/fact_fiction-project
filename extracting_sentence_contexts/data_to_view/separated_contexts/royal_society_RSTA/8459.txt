Although as stated above the law of optical retardation is generally assumed to
follow a linear law of stress difference, yet there is no apparent reason why it should
not follow some other law, as for example a linear strain law or possibly contain terms
involving squares of stress or strain. Some attempt has been made to find if the
latter assumptions have any foundation, but if so the effects are within the limit of
experimental error, and too small to be of any significance with the effect produced
by a linear relation. As regards the question whether this relation should be expressed in terms of stress
or strain, it may be pointed out that an attempt is made here to test this with
materials under direct stress, and that the validity of the law for combined stresses
and strains still remains for consideration (apart from lateral strains, which are
presumed to have no effect beyond altering the length of the path in which retardation
takes place), but as in this case, if the standard, not stressed beyond the elastic limit
is compared with another in which this condition is passed the experiments do in fact
provide a means of discrimination, since in the standard, stress and strain are
proportional; but are not so in general for the tension member. Hence if the form
of the law of optical effect is assumed in terms of stress it does not exclude the
possibility of finding from the experimental evidence whether it should not be
expressed in terms of strain. We may, therefore, without loss of generality, take as
an assumption the usual relation that relative retardation R = C (P—Q) ¢ as a con-
venient expression where (P—Q) is the difference of principal stress = f,¢ is the
thickness of the material and C is the stress-optical coefticient.
