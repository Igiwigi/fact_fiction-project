where the sum of the edge weights for edges leaving node i is divided by the sum of edge 8

weights over the entire network. This is a very close to but not exactly equivalent to counting the :

occurrences of ordinal symbols in S due to the fact that equation (3.4) counts occurrences based

on the transition from one symbol to the next, and therefore does not count the final symbol in

(b) Measures of transitional complexity

An inherent property of any measure of the stationary distribution of a Markov chain, including
permutation entropy, is that for an appropriate choice of partition the result will be the same for
both periodic dynamics and uniformly distributed noise, and this may be undesirable in certain
applications. Permutation entropy will only be minimized for fixed points and strictly monotonic
signals. On the other hand, measures of transitional complexity quantify the local uncertainty of
each state in the model and can therefore reveal additional information about the dynamics. For
