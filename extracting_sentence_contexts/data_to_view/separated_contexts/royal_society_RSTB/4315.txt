This latter tooth was, in all probability, a large tooth. There is no
reason whatever to support the view that in a dentition composed of such extremely
large teeth with an abnormally large upper canine, there existed an abnormally small
lower canine, nor could an originally large lower canine have been reduced in size by
wear, considering the age of the skull and the character and position of the facet
caused by it on its maxillary opponent. The only conclusion to be drawn, therefore, from these facts is that, notwithstanding
that there is no true diastema in the maxilla to receive the lower canine, the method
of articulation present in the Talgai teeth must have been similar to that observed in

the young Orang skulls. K1aarscu (14), in investigating the teeth of Australians,
was keenly alive to the possibility of discovering some trace of a diastema in the
upper jaw or some modification in the lower premolar in adaptation to a large upper
canine, but he very definitely states that he was unable to detect either of these
features in all the skulls examined by him.
