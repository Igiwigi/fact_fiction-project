tables, at the concentrations indicated in the second column, and those reduced from
the author's measurements.

Since the sum of the velocities is proportional to the conductivities, the sum of
U and V must show the same agreement with the sum of U and V from
Koutravscn’s figures, as is shown in columns 3 and 4; that U and V singly do not

show such an agreement is due to the fact that the velocity U = . p, and henee if

the Hittorfian p is used in the calculation, a different value for U will be obtained
than if the author's p is used. In columns 5 and 7 the p that is used is Hrrrorr'’s;
in columns 6 and 8 that obtained during the present research, and hence the want of
agreement. The fact that by the use of the latter the figures in question would be
brought into much greater concordance, speaks strongly in favour of their greater
accuracy.

The Existence of Complex Ions.

With the three electrolytic measurements that have been considered, it has been
found that it is only in the case of a few salts of the most simple type that
experiment and theory are in agreement. In the case of all other salts, in the first
place the transport number, whether measured by the older method of Hrrrorr or
by the direct method, described in the present paper, is not independent of the
concentration ; secondly, from the measurements of the conductivity it is not possible
to assign any specific ionic velocity to such ions as Mg, which is constant in different
