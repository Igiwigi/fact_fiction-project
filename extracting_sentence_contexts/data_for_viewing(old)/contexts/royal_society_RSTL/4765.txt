the only objects that can be said to have been satisfactorily observed, if the delicate
nature of the investigation be considered.

2ndly. These discordances are the more remarkable, when we view them in connec-
tion with the large ratios which some of. the differences bear to their probable errors.
Indeed a bare inspection of the measured angles of position given in Table I. in
connexion with the computed weights and errors, will convince us that the differ-
ences of the results obtained on different evenings are greater in many instances
than those of the separate measures obtained on the same evening. This circum-
stance, which, it is believed, is not unfrequent in observations requiring the same
delicacy of estimation as those under consideration, renders the application of the
calculus of probabilities embarrassing and its conclusions uncertain. It is certain, in
fact, that in the greater number of instances given in this paper, the computed pro-
bable errors of the results on which the parallaxes depend, form no probable crite-
rion of the magnitude or even of the existence of parallax. The only probable ex-
planation that can be given in 8nuch cases, where purely instrumental errors can
scarcely have place, must arise from an unsuspected bias of the observer in the selec-
tion of the line of direction passing through the centres of the stars, which canses an
estimation constant on the same evening, but differing on different nights. The
weight of each evening's result, calculated according to the amount of discordance of
the individual measures, may till be an adequate representative of the degree of
dependence to be placed on it, as far as the steadiness of the atmosphere and other
favourable circumstances are concerned; but the probable errors of combined and
final results, calculated on ordinary principles, will not form a good criterion of the
accuracy of snch results. Supposing, however, the bias of the observer on different
