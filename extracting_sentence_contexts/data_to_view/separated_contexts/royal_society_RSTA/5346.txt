diligence, perseverance and creativity, become equally or even more important. In his book Contrary Imaginations: A Psychological Study of the English Schoolboy, Liam Hudson

can tell, the relation at lower levels of IQ holds quite well. Higher up, however, it dwindles;
and above a certain point, a high IQ is of little advantage.
