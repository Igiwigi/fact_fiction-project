characteristics) is replaced by an argument based on the physical reality of the
passing of time and the fact that no communication or transfer of resources is
possible between the parallel universes introduced by Fermat.

(a) The economic context

To repeat, the quantity in equation (3.1) is accurately interpreted as follows:
imagine a world of parallel universes defined such that every chance event splits
our current universe into an ensemble containing member-universes for every
possible outcome of the chance event. We further require that the proportion of
members of the ensemble corresponding to a particular outcome is the probability
of that outcome. In this case, if we give the same weight to every member-universe,
then equation (3.1) is the ensemble average over all possible future states of the
universe (i.e. states after the game).
