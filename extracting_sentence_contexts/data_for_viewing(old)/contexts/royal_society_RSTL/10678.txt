1se of Wight. —Notwithstanding the thickness of the lower greensand strata in
the Isle of Wight, sponge-remains do not appear to be present in them.

Faringdon, Berkshire.—Though somewhat beyond the area of which this paper
treats, it is desirable to make a brief mention of the remarkable deposit at this place,
which has long been known under the name of the © sponge gravel.” The character
of its deposition, and the nature of the sponges in it are altogether different from
those of the beds of the same geological horizon in the Wealden area. It is a thick
bed of unconsolidated quartz-sand and pebbles, with numerous sponges and other
foxsils. Sponges predominate, and they are present in astonishing profusion. They
differ from those of the lower greensand of the Wealden area; not only in retaining
their complete entire forms, but in the fact that they are exclusively calcisponges.
Not a single siliceous sponge has as yet to my knowledge been meb with in this
gravel, though these calcisxponges have been described by various authors as originally
slliceous. They thus present a striking contrast to the sponge-beds in other areas, in
which the sponges have been entirely disintegrated, and are also exclusively of
Siliceous origin.

SPoxGe-BeDs OF THE UPPER GREENSAND.

Accepting as a typical section that shown in the Undercliff of the Isle of Wight, I
propose to include in this term the strata there present between the base of the
80-called chloritic marl and the blue micaceous sands, which, in common with Captain
IBersoxt and Mr. ParkINg&ox,f I regard as the upper portion of the gault. Thus
