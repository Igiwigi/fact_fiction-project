SOUFRIERE, AND ON A VISIT TO MONTAGNE PELEE, IN 1902. 533

On July 9th, at 8.20 p.m, Montagne Pelée broke again into activity. That
afternoon there were several earthquakes in St. Vincent, so severe as to cause great
apprehension.

In the end of August there was renewed activity at Pelée, and on the 15th, 28th,
and 30th of that month and September 3rd there were eruptions. On September Ist
and September 3rd the Soufriére was active, the latter especially being one of the
greater eruptions of this year.

These facts are sufficient to show that a distinct connection exists between the
outbursts of these two mountains during the present year. The eruptions of the
Soufritre have sometimes followed, sometimes preceded, those in Martinique, but, as
a rule, the greater eruptions of the one volcano have been accompanied by eruptions
at the other within a period of one or two days. The outbursts of Pelée have been
more numerous than those of the Soufriére. In particular, those of the end of
May, of June, and of July had no corresponding eruptions in the sister island,
but though more frequent they have been of less magnitude, and have produced
less widespread effects. Pelée has also been more constantly in action of a
subordinate kind during the intervals between the major eruptions.

Some general cause underlying the volcanic activity is required to explain the
synchronism in the superficial phenomena. It is to be found in the existence of
