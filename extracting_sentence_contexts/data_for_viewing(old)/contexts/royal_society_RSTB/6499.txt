the Senni beds, and the Cosheston beds, which there are more or less clear reasons
to think were somewhat later in geological time than the Downtonian and the
Carmyllie and Cairnconnan beds.

The plant-remains in the Downtonian, from the uniformity of their association
in the various exposures, would seem to have accumulated at no great distance
from the place of growth of the plants, under conditions which on the whole favoured
their maceration and decay. At certain levels they accumulated in quantity and
partially escaped destruction, and have been preserved as the debris of larger pieces
on the bedding planes of the rock. It is, however, not within the scope of this
paper to enter into the question of the conditions of accumulation of the Downtonian
strata which have yielded the fossil plants under consideration here. This is a
general geological problem which is beyond my competence. The facts ascertained
regarding the flora will doubtless be included by geologists along with the palaeonto-
logical and other evidence. It need only be remarked that the transitional nature
of the formation which has often been emphasized by geologists is indicated by
the persistence of a few marine animals in the lower beds and by their general
absence in the higher plant-containing beds.* But the uniformity of the flora
throughout renders any view that it could be of marine origin in the lower beds and
of continental origin in the later beds out of the question. The statements of most
geologists who have touched on the conditions of deposition of the Downtonian
strata would appear to allow of the vegetable remains being derived from the land,
in part or altogether. With this remark the geological question can be left, and
the evidence afforded by the plants themselves considered.
