Phase c¢ continues to show oak and elm in the proportions of phase , but here lime
appears as a continuous curve which steadily rises into the following period: at the end
of phase c lime pollen may exceed that of oak or elm. The alder values begin to rise
during phase ¢, and rise rapidly at the end. Pine, however, shows a strong tendency to
a secondary maximum in this phase, a fact probably attributable to a local dryness of

the bog surfaces which allowed pines to grow upon them. If this is so we may expect
the horizon sometimes to show other maxima, e.g. birch or even alder, or to have
pollen spectra obscured by pollen destruction. It seems reasonable to recognize this
phase as the “Boreal Wasserstandminimum” of continental writers.
