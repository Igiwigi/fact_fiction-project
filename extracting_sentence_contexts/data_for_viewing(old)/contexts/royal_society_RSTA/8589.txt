152 PROF. E.G. COKER AND MR. K, C. CHAKKO: THE STRESS-STRAIN PROPERTIES

Somewhat similar results are obtained on plates 4%; inch thick, but in both
experiments, fig. 9, the curves of f,/e have a rather higher linear limit than the
corresponding f/e curve, but here again the ratio f/f, is still linear to about the
same range as in previous cases.

The case of plates } inch thick, fig. 10, is more especially interesting from the fact
that the stress-strain curve there shown is, at a later stage, obtained entirely from
the optical effects observed from an analysis of the spectrum of a beam under
uniform bending moment. It is sufficient to remark here that the f/f, curve shows
a somewhat lower limit of linearity, although both the other curves have
corresponding limits of 2000 Ibs. per sq. inch.

When these curves are corrected for the change of cross-section which occurs
as the test proceeds it is found, as fig. 10 shows, that the stress-strain curve fJe is
perceptibly raised beyond the elastic limit and therefore tends more towards linearity,
and the equivalent stress/strain curve is lowered and diverges still more from the
linear relation. The stress/equivalent-stress curve has therefore a somewhat higher
linear limit when this correction is made. Owing to the defective optical properties
