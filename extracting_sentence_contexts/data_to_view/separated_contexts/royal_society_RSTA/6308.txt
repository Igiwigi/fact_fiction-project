Despite these successes, I felt that the analysis in Wright et al. [14] and Wright et al. [15
left a fundamental gap. To the best of my understanding, they never returned to (2.1), the
zonally averaged equation for the zonal momentum balance. But there was, and still is, the
observational fact that all large-scale oceanic flow below the Ekman layer is in geostrophic balance
to an accuracy beyond observational capabilities (e.g. [16,17]); furthermore, by the observational
knowledge of the 1990s, all analyses of hydrographic sections gave a stable result of northward
integrated transport above 1000m depth in the subtropical North Atlantic (e.g. [18,19]). Hence
there ought to be a robust relationship between the pressures (or densities) at the eastern and
western boundaries of the North Atlantic. A strong northward THC should be reflected in a
definitive relationship between the pressure terms in (2.1), and any satisfactory dynamical closure
for the THC should speak to this relationship.
