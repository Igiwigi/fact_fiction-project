+ T have great pleasure in $tating that my friend Mr. Towss, three years ago, during his examination of
numerous kidneys that, he had injected, saw two or three examples of this escape of the injection along the
tube; of one of which he has preserved a rough outline. Not being able to see it again he gave up the search. I have no doubt that he communicated this fact to me in conyersation at the time, though I cannot now recol-
lect his doing 80. The first drawing I made of the tube expanded over the tuft, I find dated February 17, 1841 ;
about which time my interest in the subject was first excited. t Of course this neyer occurs in Birds, where the Malpighian vezsel is a coiled ampulla,
