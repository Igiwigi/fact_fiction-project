Bh atom has not an intrinsic heat capacity which it carries with it unchanged into any
— molecule of which it forms part, but that it is affected by its neighbours. In
Bther words f is not an additive quantity, for the configuration of the molecule plays
@part in the distribution of energy.
My experiments would not be inconsistent with the supposition that the configura-

tion is the sole feature that fixes the distribution, but until more definite evidence is
obtained—especially with regard to the physical significance of radicles—this must

| _ It was pointed out many years ago by NAuMANN, when experimental evidence was
‘Seanty, that 8 divided by the number of atoms in the molecule was nearly equal
to 33. If this held generally, it would be an important fact, for it would point to
