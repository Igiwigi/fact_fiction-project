The table below shows the approximate ranges of values which some of these variables
take in the case of the propagation of a whistler through the ionosphere:

variable range of values
i 0-5 to LO ke/s
i 0 to 10 Mc/s
fu 1:5 to 0-1 Me/s
x 0 to 4xÂ« 108
? 10 to 8000
x[p 0 to 10,

It will be noted that the last three variables attain values much larger than those normally
met with in ionospheric work. This fact will shortly enable us to make a number of simplifying
approximations in the formulae for the refractive index.

Now according to our theory most of the path of a whistler is at very great heights where
collisions are so rare that their effect on the refractive indices can be neglected. They are
only of importance below a height of about 80 km, and although this part of the ionosphere
doubtless produces considerable attenuation of the whistlers during the daytime, it makes
no appreciable contribution to their dispersion. We shall therefore assume that vy = 0in the
ion for the refractive index is still rather

magneto-ionic equations. Even so the general expres
complicated, but fortunately there is a simple approximation to it, known as the quasi-
longitudinal (Q.L.) approximation, which at low frequencies holds good at all levels and for
