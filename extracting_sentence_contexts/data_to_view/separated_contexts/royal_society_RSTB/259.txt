5 On the ninth day the epithelium of the hydrocele is very high, and its lumen small ;
‘S but the lumen steadily increases at the expense of the epithelium, until by the
4 fourteenth day the latter has become quite flat, while other changes have taken place,
@ which will be described later. The tentacles long retain a more columnar epithelium. = As soon as ever the cystid form is reached the anterior blind end of the hydrocele
= (see fig. 61) grows aborally and outwards in the oral (left) longitudinal mesentery ; in
@ fact, since it is present before the latter is fully formed, it may be looked upon as
& determining the position of this mesentery, The tube thus formed, which is the
® equivalent of the “ stone-canal” of other Echinoderms, has the same high epithelium
as the rest of the hydrocele ring, and it retains this character throughout, instead of
3 sharing in the changes which the main part of the hydrocele subsequently undergoes. AQ After entering the body-wall it turns slightly towards the oral surface, and on about
the tenth day opens into the parietal canal (anterior body-cavity) (fig. 30). The
course of the communication thus established between the hydrovele and the exterior
is somewhat complicated, but can be traced in figs.
