sparse spatial distribution. This is probably due to the fact that reduced observations frequencies
challenge the validity of the linear superposition assumption more than large observational noise
(see the discussion in Appendix of [40]). We then applied the method to the low-order coupled
ocean-atmosphere model MAOOAM [35] which contains multiple temporal scales. Forecast
skill and global statistics were significantly improved by the hybrid model compared with the
truncated model encouraging further studies in high-dimensional and more realistic scenarios.
Notably, the hybrid model derived from noisy observations has comparable forecast skill on the
oceanic variables to that of the hybrid model derived from perfect observations.

In view of operational systems, it should be noted that the proposed algorithm relies on two
existing DA and NNs training techniques that both scale well to high-dimensions (e.g. [41,42]).
In principle, the present algorithm can be applied to larger and more realistic problems. In
particular, the fact that the method does not rely on the adjoint of the truncated model is an
advantage in terms of code maintenance. However, we foresee some practical challenges: for
instance, the computational architecture and the data types used for physics-based numerical
models and for ML algorithms can be very different (e.g. multi-core supercomputers and graphics
processing units). Training and running hybrid models efficiently imposes heavy requirements
on both the hardware and software and may come with an overhead even if some tools are very
promising [43].

The approach presented here can also accommodate the additional representation of the
remaining model error (i.e. the model error of the hybrid model): it could either be done within
the numerical model by parameterizing the model error [21], or by training stochastic NNs [44].
