seems most unlikely that the force of mortality in Micraster would have remained constant
during post-larval life. Nor is it likely that the force of mortality varied with age in
the same manner in the two species in Rowe’s sample, or that the chances of fossilization
were the same for both, since one was probably a burrower, while the other crawled
about on the surface of the sea-bed (see p. 406).

In general, the length, breadth or height of an animal, or the size of any part of it,
will be highly correlated with its age, older animals being, on the whole, larger. ‘Thus to
compare one sample with another, or one species with another, by comparing the means
or medians of variates which are highly correlated with the size of the animal, will involve
making quite unjustified assumptions, and may give very misleading results.

In fact, in quantitative palaeontology the assumption is often made, although not
explicitly, either that the age distribution of the sample is the same as that of the living
population, or that all the samples have been biased in exactly the same way. Means or
medians are then employed for purposes of comparison. The defence of this practice
would appear to be that, from the very nature of palaeontological material, it is impossible
to do any better. In fact, however, it is possible to avoid making any such assumptions
about the age distribution of the sample if ‘size’ parameters, such as means and medians,
are abandoned for the purpose of comparison, and ‘shape’ parameters are used instead.
The age distribution of the sample will have little effect, if any, upon the values of the
estimates of ‘pure’ shape parameters. This makes the use of the latter of particular value
in quantitative palaeontology, where the age distribution of the sample is dependent upon
that of the original living population in a very complex and indirect way. Ratios of two
variates are often used as shape parameters in this way, but they suffer from the dis-
