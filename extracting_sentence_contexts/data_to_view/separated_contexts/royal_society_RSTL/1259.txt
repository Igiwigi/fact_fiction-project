* The mode, in which the breathing organs of the teredines
are supplied with water, makes it evident that all sea worms,
as well as other soft animals, which have no cavity for the
reception of sea water, must have the/breathing organs placed
externally. This is the case with all those species of Actinie
met with in the West Indies, called Animal Flowers ; andthe
beautiful membranous expansions they display resembling
the petals 'of flowers, are in fact 'the breathing organs, not
tentacula for catching food, as their-appearance led'me to be-
lieve, when describing the new species, discovered in the year
1780, and which has aplace in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1785. In animals so perfect 'in their organs as the teredines, and
which have red blood, there can be. no doubt of the: exist-
ence of brain and nerves: but it is\not to.
