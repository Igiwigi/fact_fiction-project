There is a vast amount
of literature dealing with the ductility of UFG and NC metals, which discusses the ductility
governing phenomena in this grain size regime and how to improve it (e.g. [5-7]). By contrast, the
fracture toughness, which determines the sensitivity of a material to crack-like defects, has only
been marginally investigated. The main reason for this circumstance lies in the fact that UFG and
NC metals and alloys cannot be easily produced in large quantities with sufficient dimensions by
most synthesis techniques, for example, inert gas condensation [8], pulsed electrodeposition [9]
or mechanical alloying [10]. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) [11] is one exception, this method
permits the production of adequate material quantities to perform fracture mechanics tests very
close to the standards. This review will focus on the fracture toughness of UFG and NC materials
generated by the SPD approach.
