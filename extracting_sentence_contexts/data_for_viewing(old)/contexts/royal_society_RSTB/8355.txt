that are relevant for others. Conversely, principles may
be level-specific and focusing on only one level or even
a priori assuming that principles obtained by studying
one level can be applied tout court to other levels may
be misleading. It is hence important to extend the evo-
devo paradigm to other levels of the biological hierarchy
and include the whole functional phenotype [10].

In this introductory article, I am mainly concerned
with showing that morphology and behaviour share
many aspects, beginning with the importance that the
environment plays for their development. Behaviour and
morphology constitute in fact different qualities of the
same unique phenotype, tightly linked in development
and evolution. Since these qualities appear to be present
at each level of the biological hierarchy, a unique frame-
work of analysis encompassing levels seems already
possible. Based on that assumption, I provide an example
of comparison across levels and discuss some impli-
cations. I conclude with some critical considerations on
methods used for discovering the genetic basis underlying
behavioural diversity. At the end of the article, summaries
of the contributions presented in this issue can be found.
