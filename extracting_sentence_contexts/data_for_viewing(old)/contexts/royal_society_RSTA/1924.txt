behaviour and attitudes, including preventing littering, uptake of reuse schemes, better adoption
of recycling schemes, and legislative changes and internationally binding controls among many
others.

However, do all these stated targets make complete sense? At present very little plastic waste
is composted, but this is one of the three stated methods that are proposed to reduce plastic
pollution within the Global Commitment. The reason the majority of the major plastics are not
currently composted is simply because most plastics do not decompose in standard compositing
systems, since biodegradability is a fundamental requirement to be compostable [12]. Equally, are
all stake-holders prepared to make the necessary economic invests required to meet the targets,
and even if the investments are made immediately will this allow sufficient timescales for the
new industrial plants to be built and become operational? The use of compositing also questions
whether compositing is in fact consistent with circular economy concepts, since the plastics are
designed specifically to be removed from the resource flow immediately after use, and therefore
contrary to retaining the plastics in the system as long as possible.

2. Plastic usage and fate

(a) Why use plastics?

Applications of plastics can be grouped together into different sectors of use as shown in figure 4.
While these usage data represent EU 28, NO and CH countries, they are similar to all developed
