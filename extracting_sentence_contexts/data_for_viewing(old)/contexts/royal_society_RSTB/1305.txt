‘As it has been either tacitly assumed or avowedly stated that the presence of
or gas dissolved in a liquid is detrimental to the stability of the liquid under tensior
or prohibits completely the establishment of tensile stress in it, one might natu
conclude that the sap, which is probably not completely air-free,* would rupture j
every lumen owing to the development of gas-bubbles when exposed to tensions suf
cient to raise it in high trees. And, of course, under the stress, a lumen in whi
rupture has occurred at once becomes water-free and useless.

The question of the stability under tension of water containing dissolved air bei
therefore involved, we made some experiments to settle the matter one way or th
other. We found that the presence of dissolved air did not interfere with the atte
ment of high tensions ; in fact, when all solid objects present had been wetted by p
preliminary boiling the presence of considerable quantities of dissolved air seemed in
way to interefere with the success of the experiment. Air-free water gave no bette
results, nor (whether from chance or not) gave results quite so good. In mo
cases rupture appeared ultimately to occur upon the wall of the tube. Profess
Firzceracp, and, in a written communication, Professor WorrTHINGTON, suggestec
that solid objects in air-containing water might, when this was under tension, colle¢
air upon their surfaces and so bring about rupture. Even if this was so for har
solids, such as glass—and the results of our comparative experiments did not point t
it—it appeared most improbable that it could apply to a substance so permeate
and little differentiated from the water as woody cell-wall. To test the behaviou
of this material in presence of air-containing water under tension, we enclosed chips 0
the wood of Taaus baccata, which had been boiled in water to ensure complet
