INTRODUCTION.

THE comparative study of the gill structure of the Lamellibranchia may be said to
date from 1875. WriraMs, it is true, had in 1854* published two papers on the
subject, but owing to the fact that the morphological relations of the gill lamellie to
the gill axis and to other parts of the body were not then understood, and owing to
the somewhat wild and fantastic mode of argument affected by this author, they
cannot claim to be seriously regarded as the first important contribution to the
literature of the subject. The few remarks on the different types of Lamellibranch
gills made by Leuckarr in 1848* (p. 113), Hancock in 1853 (p. 290), and
* See alphabetical list of references, pp. 278-284.
