It is easy to understand each process of the interaction of
hydrogen with various defects, but I am not sure that these processes
are the only cause of hydrogen embrittlement. That's my first question. The second question is regarding the fact that hydrogen promotes
the formation and emission of different defects, particularly vacancies,
which is now well known. The question is how you can distinguish
between a situation where hydrogen embrittlement is linked only to
the hydrogen, and a situation where the production of defects gives
the embrittlement. How can we construct an experimental or simulation
approach to differentiate these situations?
