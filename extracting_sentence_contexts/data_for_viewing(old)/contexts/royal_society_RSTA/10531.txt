This shows the much greater relative importance of the 24-hour term in temperature
than in magnetics. The difference is probably even greater than the figures suggest.
The magnetic values of ¢,, &c., refer to mean inequalities for the year; whereas
General StrRAcHEY’s corresponding values represent arithmetic means of 12 monthly
values, and his phase angles are most variable in the shorter period terms. It will be
seen in fact that the values obtained for c,/c,, &c., from the mean temperature
inequalities for 1892 to 1895, or 1889, 1890 and 1899, in § 62, are less than the
values we have just derived from General Srracuey’s figures.

§ 69. A rather striking illustration of the points of agreement and difference just
discussed, was afforded by the case of V at Kew. As already stated, all the tables
had to be re-ealeulated, making allowance for the non-application of a temperature
correction in earlier years of the period. I was puzzled for a time by the, at first
sight, remarkable fact that whilst the new values of ¢, differed very appreciably from
the old, there was exceedingly little difference between the new and old values of the
