In the Tunicata the apparatus of the circulation is developed obviously above the
standard of the former. A heart and arterial trunks are detectable. The blood cur-
rents, however, are not determinate in direction. As in the larya of insects, the
portions of the fluid which accumulate in the peritoneal chambers oscillate to and
fro under the muscular contortions of the body ; presently, however, and at unequal
intervals, it obeys the impelling force of the heart, and advances in a definite orbit.
In the Cynthidee or Salpidee the fluids may be readily obtained for examina-
tionÂ®,

It is colourless, and discovers very distinctly the property of coagulating. The solid
elements (figs. 64 and 65), relatively to the bulk of the fluid, are scanty. Similarly to
what, was observed in the Bryozoa, the cells exhibit several varieties. It is a fact of
considerable interest, that the floating cells of all inferiorly vitalized fluids should be
characterized by variety more or less numerous, in the form, size and structure of the
corpuscular elements. The adult type of the corpuscle in the blood of the tunicated
Mollusk is marked by no other feature of constancy than that of the orbicular figure.
Sometimes this form is modified into the flat circular; frequently the cells are simply
nucleated, again they are destitute of this part. All those which may be reckoned
as mature, contain, in addition to a nucleus, granules, forming more or less of the
bulk of the cell. The cell-capsule is more evident in this class than in the former.
If submitted to the action of an endosmotic medium, such as water, it fibrillates
more obviously than the corpuscles of an unmixed chylaqueous fluid. This cha-
racter is a mark of superior organization.
