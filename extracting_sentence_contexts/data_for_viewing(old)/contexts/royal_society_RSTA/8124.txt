For an isotropic material the stress quadric degenerates into a spheroid when
uw =—1,0 or+1,

so that symmetry alone necessitates that 4. = v at those three points.

On examining Lopr’s diagram, fig. 2, it will be seen that some of the experimental
points, particularly for » = —1, which correspond with direct tension in the absence
of internal pressure, do not satisfy this condition so that either there is a considerable
possible error in the measurements or else the tubes were not isotropic. In spite of the
fact that the probable error appears to be of about the same order as the effect measured
Lopr’s results seem to show a distinct tendency for the absolute value of v to be less
than that of pu.

In view of the uncertainty so clearly shown in Lopr’s diagram, fig. 2, it cannot be
definitely stated whether von Mises’ hypothesis that » = v is true or untrue, it was
largely to find out whether another method could be devised to give more reliable results
that the work here described was undertaken.

Method of the Present Work.

The method adopted for obtaining all possible ratios of the principal shear stresses
was to subject a tube simultaneously to a direct load and to torsion. By adjusting the
