TECHNICAL BEARINGS OF THE Sowrnc-DatE EXPerimMent.

The point of obvious interest is that, as in the spacing experiment, we have again
found the conventional practice of the fellaheen to be the correct one.

Our direct experimental results, namely, that early-sown plants do not flower any
sooner, nor fruit any better, than normal sowings, are rather opposed to assumptions
which have formerly been made. At the same time it has long been recognised that
a spell of cold weather may “retard the growth” of the early sowings (e.g., p. 409),
but our examination of the depressant factor brings out the curious fact that this
effect of cold weather is really due to the cold surface soil thus produced.

The whole story of the sowing date is thus tolerably complicated. Amongst the
earliest researches effected by one of us in Egypt was an investigation into the
sore-shin fungus, which showed that the effects commonly ascribed to cold were
mainly due to the action of temperature on the fungus and its host conjointly.
Now, at the end of our work, we have succeeded in tracing out the direct effect of
temperature on the plant alone.

It is plainly a matter of indifference, as far as the best plants are concerned,
about
