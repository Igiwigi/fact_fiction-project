(1) A TuHrory or THE PHENOMENA FOUND IN THE ABOVE EXPERIMENTAL
RESEARCHES IN TERMS OF THE ELEctROoN THEORY OF MAGNETISM.

The theory of Lorentz, which postulates no free magnetism, but attributes
magnetic phenomena to the motion of electric charges, accounts admirably and in a
simple way for the main characteristics of the Zeeman effect and for the rotation of
the plane of polarisation in a magnetic field. Each of the latter phenomena appears
to be closely related to the diamagnetic property of a substance; for LANGEVIN has
shown that the magnetic moment produced in a molecule by the application of an
external magnetic field is such as would lead to diamagnetism by a process which is
compatible with the simple explanation of the Zeeman effect given by Lorentz.
Further, the fact that the magnetic rotation produced by the ferromagnetic elements
is proportional to the intensity of magnetization, and not simply to the intensity of the
applied magnetic field, shows that we must take into consideration the magnetic
property in this case also.

No theory has yet been devised, however, which is completely consistent with the
principles of mechanics and the phenomena—optical and electric—of the luminiferous
medium, and in adopting the theory of Lorentz, we are merely seeking to obtain a
fuller interpretation, on certain hypotheses, of the experimental facts obtained in
Part I. But it is evident that whatever theory be adopted with regard to the origin
of the diamagnetic property, any distortion of the molecular system, such as is
produced by crystallization, must be accompanied by an adjustment of the magnitude
of that property.
