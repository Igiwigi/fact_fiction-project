The extremely remarkable fact here reveals itself, that when the beam of the electric
lamp is sifted by certain blue glasses, the platinum at the focus glows with a distinct pink
colour. Every care was taken to avoid subjective illusion here. The pink colour was also
obtained at the focus of invisible rays. Withdrawing all the glasses, and filtering the
beam by a solution of iodine alone, platinum was raised nearly to whiteness at the
focus. On introducing the pale-blue glass between the iodine cell and the focus, the
calorescence of the platinum was greatly enfeebled—so much 80, that a darkened room
was necessary to bring it out in full distinctness; when seen, however, the thermograph
was pink. A disk of carbonized paper being exposed at the obscure focus, rose at once
to vivid whiteness when the blue glass was absent ; but when present, the colour of the
light emitted by the carbon was first a distinct pink ; the attack of the atmospheric
oxygen 800n changes this colour, the combustion of the carbon extending on all sides
