But ¢,, whilst increasing with sunspot
frequency, seems practically no larger in ordinary or even in disturbed days than
in quiet days. The influence of disturbance on c, seems very small, The values of c, seem almost
independent of sunspot frequency, and those derived from ordinary and from quiet
days are nearly equal. The fact that ¢, cs and ¢, are so nearly the same for ordinary and quiet days may
seem at first sight to imply that the ordinary and quiet day difference curve is
necessarily almost a pure sine curve of 24-hour period. This conclusion, however,

does not necessarily follow unless the phase angles are nearly the same in the two
cases,
