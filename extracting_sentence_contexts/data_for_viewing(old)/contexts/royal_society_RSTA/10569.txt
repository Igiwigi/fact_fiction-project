amount, because this would be the point at which the specific resistances of the
existing vapour and mist and of those added would be most different. Therefore the
curve would rise suddenly at E. After this, each addition to the normal current
would make the change of specific resistance due to the same added small non-normal
increment of current smaller and smaller, so that the curve would fall towards the
axis of current as shown in F G (fig. 13). Finally, there would already be so much
solid-carbon vapour and mist in the are that the addition of a little more would
make practically no change, so that this curve also is asymptotic to the axis of
current. The fact that the are is never really quite central, and that the volatilising
surface must therefore cover a little solid carbon long before it is larger than the
core, must introduce some modifications into the first part of the curve, shortening
D E, and making E F rise less abruptly, something like D E/ Fâ€™ G, but these

modifications are unimportant.

resistance of the are with the direct current for a constant length of are.

When both carbons are cored, the curve must be like D E H K, or rather
