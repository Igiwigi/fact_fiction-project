We demonstrate the performance of GFINNs on three benchmark problems. To compare against
other methods, we also report the results obtained by GNODEs [23], SPNNs [13] and SDENets
[22]. Implementation details can be found in appendix A. The code for the numerical examples
are openly available on GitHub at https: / /github.com/zzhang222/gfinn_gc. We note that SPNNs
and GNODEs can only be applied in case 1 and case 2, respectively, while GFINNs cover all the
cases.

(a) Non-uniqueness

By the multiplicative structure, the GENERIC formalism allows multiple modules resulting in
the same dynamics. That is, given (E,S,L,M), there are infinitely many (E,S,L,M) satisfying
L(z)(0E/0z)(z) + M(z)(0S/dz)(z) = L(z)(0E/8z)(z) + M(z)(9S/z)(z). As a matter of fact, if we let
G be an affine transformation of G with a slope coefficient a, by letting A:=a~'A, we obtain new
modules resulting in the same dynamics. Because of the non-uniqueness, the inferred quantities
Enn and Syn may look different from the target quantities. We therefore calibrate the inferred
quantities to make them look similar to the ground truth values. The calibration is done by finding
the aforementioned affine transformations using some target values. We apply the calibration
only for the visualization purpose to demonstrate the discovery of the physical quantities by
GFINNs.

(b) GENERIC formalism under fluctuations

Fluctuations can be included in the GENERIC formalism [18,20], resulting in a stochastic
differential equation (SDE) of the form
