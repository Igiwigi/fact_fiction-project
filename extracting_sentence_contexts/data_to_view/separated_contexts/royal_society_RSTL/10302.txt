On the contrary, when the 8urface is at 8uch a temperature that a
liquid film upon it exerts a tension greater than the pressure of the vapour of that
liquid present in the atmosphere in contact with it, the liquid volatilizes from the
gurface, Under the latter conditions no vapour would be condensed from a gaseous
mixture. For a surface at a given temperature, condensation depends upon the
tension of the vapour in the mixture, and for a given tension of the vapour, condensa-
tion depends on the temperature of the surface. These facts permit the question to be readily tested by experiment. In the first
series of temperature experiments, if 37 be taken as the constant coefficient at bigh
temperatures, then in the last experiment the tension of the steam formed by the
unimpeded reaction would be 162 millims. at 60% A+ this temperature the tension
exerted by a film of water is about 150 millims.
