In order to avoid technicalities that would obscure the line of argument we present our main
results for non-random evolution families and indicate the changes that have to be made in the 2-
dependent case in Remark 5.8. Rather than discussing the maximal L?-inequality in [60] in detail,
we will provide a detailed proof of a Gaussian tail estimate. The rationale of this choice is that
this estimate cannot be deduced (e.g. via Lemma 4.3) from the result of [60] due to the fact that it
does not provide the correct order O(,/p) of the constant. The result presented here is new, in that


it generalizes [58, Theorem 1.2] to arbitrary 2-smooth Banach spaces. A further novel feature of
our result is that it gives an improved bound on the variance.
