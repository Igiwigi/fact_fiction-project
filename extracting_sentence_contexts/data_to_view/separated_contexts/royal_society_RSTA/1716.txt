Remarks 4.4.

(a) The condition p > 3 is due to the embedding W??(2)  Cl“(2) for p € (3, 00). Since the
two-dimensional Helmholtz projection Q fails to be bounded with respect to the L*-
norm, we instead estimate it in spaces of Hélder continuous functions Cpe ((0, 1) =
C°(T?) for a € (0,1), where T? denotes the two-dimensional torus. In fact, Q is bounded
with respect to the C°“-norm. This follows from the theory of Fourier multipliers on
Besov spaces, e.g. [66, Theorem 6.2] for the whole space, and the periodic case follows
using periodic extension.

(b) In Theorem 4.3, we may even consider f € LeLe(ay for p€(3,00). Then the
corresponding semigroup is still analytic, but it fails to be strongly continuous.
