Summarizing the above, we note that the works of Volmer, Weber, Becker and Déring [6-
8] form the basis of the classical theory of nucleation. Moreover, the equations determining the
growth process are the Fokker—Planck-type equation for the particle-size distribution function
and the mass balance and/or heat balance equation. An important fact is that the form of the
Fokker-Planck kinetic equation can be different as a result of the physical nature of the nucleation
process under consideration. For example, this equation is the first-order equation and has the
form of a continuity equation in the case of neglecting ‘diffusion’ processes over the crystal size
space. If this ‘diffusion’ is taken into account, this equation is the second-order equation with
variable coefficients [11-13].
