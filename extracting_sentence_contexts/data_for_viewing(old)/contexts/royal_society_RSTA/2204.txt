it is a torus. If N has a boundary, it must lie on 0M and since it is invariant under a non-vanishing
field X, the boundary consists of finitely many periodic orbits. The fact that X is non-vanishing
and tangent to the boundary of the level set implies that the pullback of # to the boundary is
non-vanishing as well. By remark 3.7, the first case of theorem 3.4 can be applied. Hence, N is
an orientable surface with boundary that fibres over S!, thus it is a cylinder. This determines the
topology of the regular level sets of B. The rest of the proof is standard. Indeed, let ¢ be the flow
of the vector field S = (VB/dB(VB)), which satisfies dB(S) = 1. Then we have

* Bout) AB(S)=1, B(do(x)) = B(x).

We deduce that B(¢;(x)) = B(x) + t and hence the open set Mj is a trivial fibration T? x I fora real
interval I in the case that the level sets have no boundary. The same holds when the level sets are
cylinders (due to the fact that in the complement of the set C the level sets of B intersecting the
boundary have a transverse intersection). Since the vector field X commutes with curlX it follows
that it is conjugated to a linear flow on each level set diffeomorphic to a torus. For the cylinder, all
orbits are periodic as an easy consequence of the Poincaré—Bendixon theorem and the fact that X
preserves the area form i* 12. | |

Remark 4.2. This proof also works to obtain the topology of the regular level sets in the four-
dimensional Euler equations studied in [15]. The way to obtain the closed and independent one-
forms is done as in [1].

Arnold’s theorem shows that for non-constant Bernoulli functions, the situation is very similar
to integrable systems. However, for a constant B, a contact structure appears and the situation is
the opposite: a non-integrable one. This case will be analysed in §6.
