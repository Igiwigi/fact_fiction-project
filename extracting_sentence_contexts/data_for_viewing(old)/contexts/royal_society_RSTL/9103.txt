It is especially on the east and round the eastern end that the mountain range
is steepest, for there the coral reef comes nearly close to the shore, and the island
would seem to rise rather abruptly from the depths of the ocean.

The rock specimens which Mr. Balfour collected appear to have been brought
together with a naturalist's diserimination as regards their variety, and with con-
siderable care as regards their representation. of the different localities.

The petrological study of them brings out the fact that, while externally they
differ considerably in their mechanical texture and appearance, they all, as has
been a√æove stated, belong to the doleritic and baxsaltic group of rocks, and especially
to a yariety of these rich in Olivine, and free from any appreciable amount of glassy

wground-mass.
S The coarser grained and more strictly doleritic varieties of this rock (strictly,
erhaps, they should be called Anamesite) are illustrated by various specimens
"taken from Mount Grenade, from the summit of Mount Piton, from the summit
and also from a valley south of the Grande Montagne; likewise in some of the
Zearefully collected specimens, of which further mention will be made, from the
SCascade valley, a valley carved out by a stream which, rising between Mount Pitou
nd Mount Limon, almost exactly in the centre of the island, enters the sea at the
