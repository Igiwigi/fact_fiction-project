The pressure level at the left (inlet) end of a capillary is always set as
pi =8L/Re. In a single-phase flow, this pressure difference, (p1 — p2) = 8L/Re, will generate the
Poiseuille’s flow with the flow rate Q = 2/3. The actual flow rate will in fact be lower due to the
action of capillary forces. At the walls, for the average velocity, we set the no-slip boundary condition (wu = 0), the absence
of the diffusion flux through the wall (04/(dy) = 0) for the chemical potential and the condition for
the concentration field that defines the condition of neutral wetting (the contact line is orthogonal
to the wall, the molecules of both liquids interact equally with the molecules of the wall), which
is defined by 8C/(ay) = 0.2

2We would like to note that for displacement flows the choice of the static contact angle is of little significance. The static
contact angle defines the shape of a static meniscus.
