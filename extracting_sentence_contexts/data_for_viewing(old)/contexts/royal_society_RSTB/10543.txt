derived within the field of dynamic systems, load in some
way on serial autocorrelation (long-term memory) within the
data (e.g. Hurst exponent, attractor dimensions, etc.). Behav-
iourally, people have been shown to be highly sensitive to
such long-term features that impact uncertainty [16,17].

At times, manipulations of uncertainty or statistical struc-
ture (as implemented in SL paradigms) amount to a
terminological difference. Simple artificial grammars (regular
grammars) of the form often used in SL and artificial grammar
learning (AGL) paradigms can be represented as a first-order
Markov process: one where the next step is conditional only
on the current state. When represented this way, the fact
that certain transitions are allowed, whereas others are not,
produces a quantifiable reduction in uncertainty and dis-
tinguishes grammatical from random strings. For this reason,
some manipulations used in neurobiological studies of SL are
also manipulations of uncertainty. For instance, in an fMRI
study, McNealy et al. [18] examined the blood-oxygen-level-
dependent response when participants heard either random
syllable sequences, or syllable sequences generated by a gram-
mar that effectively produced fixed ‘words’ that could be freely
combined. The latter (more regular) condition produced
greater activity in lateral temporal cortex (see [19] for a similar
paradigm and findings). Thus, most generally, manipulations
