As the curves of
Figs. 7 to 12 show, it is not due to one of the factors, viz., the auricular contractions,
by which the ventricles are usually distended. The auricles are either weakened or
arrested, as we have seen, by vagus action. We can, therefore, say that the diastolic
expansion in question takes place in spite of the fact that the auricles are weakened. Is it due, as Frangois-Franck, McWit1am, and others have asserted, to a
diminution of the tonus of the relaxed ventricular walls? In coming to this
conclusion these observers omitted to take into consideration one important factor,
viz., the intra-ventricular pressure during diastole.
