0 <j <3 and set

Zo(t)=Yo(t), Zi(t)=Va(t) — tZo(t), Zp(t) = Yo(t) — tZy(t) — $1?Zo(z)
and Z(t) = Y3(t) — tZo(t) — $17Zi(t) — }t9Zo(r).
We then seek e; in the form ej = Leo F,,;Zj, 0 <i<3and find F = (F;;)o<ij<3 such that
00 =9rXtw(t;09), L3e3 = Len = Le = ep.

In particular, let Fo 9 = 0; Xtw(t; co)/Zo(t); then F;; =6;;Fo for 0 <i,j <3.

Suppose Ztw(t) is a travelling wave defined on R (although it is sufficient to define it on
[0,1]) and we define &(to) such that (€(to)Ztw)(t) = o(t + 1, T)Ztw(t). It can be checked that
&5(t0)Ztw is still a travelling wave. As e784 €5(t +19 +5,t +8) e = E(t + 19,7), it follows that
e% E(t +s) e** = E4(19). In fact, using arguments similar to the ones in [22], one can show
e% &(s) isa group with the infinitesimal generator (1/c)D A(Xtw) — 91 = £. In other words,

eS €5(s) =exp (: ( (PAG) - *)) = exp(sL).

5. Splitting of the zero eigenvalue

Recall that the spectrum of £ has a double eigenvalue for any velocity c in the family of solitary
travelling wave solutions such that H’(c) 4 0. We now consider the situation when there exists a
critical non-zero velocity co such that H’(co) =0 but H’(co) 40. As shown in §3, in this case the
multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue of £ at c=cpg is at least four, so that we generically expect
the onset of instability due to the additional two or more eigenvalues splitting away from zero
and appearing on the real axis. We start by considering the case when the eigenvalue is exactly
