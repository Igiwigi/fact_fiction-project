The curves are contours of 40. 530 D. N. pe G. ALLEN, L. FOX AND R. V. SOUTHWELL ON

30. The narrow-section solution (§29) would be exact if it were not for the term
g2*/r° in (16) A, and this term is small; so it was not to be expected that the new solution
would be widely different, and figure 17 shows that in fact all of rr, 22, Zr are small and
00 is very nearly independent of z.

Problem (ii). Shearing and flexural stresses in a toroidal ‘hook’

31. The wanted functions are ¢ and y as defined by the governing equations (18)
and by the boundary conditions (19) of § 10.
