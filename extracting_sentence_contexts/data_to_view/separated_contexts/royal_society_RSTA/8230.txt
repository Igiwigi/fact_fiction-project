Now has two triply infinite systems of planes, say
a-planes and @-planes} ; and we take it that the planes of V,° are «-planes. To the
chords of ¢, there correspond as usual only points of 2 ; and these points form a surface
¢@ which is the double surface of V,°. To trisecant planes of ¢, there correspond in fact the «»* 8-planes of Q ; and in particular,
to the trisecant plane joining the three points P, Q, R of c, there corresponds the unique
plane which meets the three planes of V,*, which correspond to P, Q, R, in lines. To cubic ruled surfaces T which pass through cy there correspond then the «* «-planes
of 2.—For any such «-plane forms a [3]-section of Q with each of «* @-planes ; and to
any such [3]-section of Q there must correspond a ’-surface breaking up into a plane
and a cubic ruled surface I’.

* Analytically, we take coordinates of a [5] 8, to be proportional to six independent quadrics of ®’,
so that to any point of S corresponds a point of 8; which describes the quadric Q. T See e.g. ‘ Principles of Geometry,’ by Prof.
