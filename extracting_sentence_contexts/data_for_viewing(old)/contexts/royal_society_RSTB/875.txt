contained in branched connective tissue cells in all respects similar to those which
occur in uncoloured parts of the skin, We are unable either to confirm or deny this,
since up to the present time we have not succeeded, in spite of persistent attempts,
in demonstrating the cellular nature of the chromatophores. We have cut sections
of the skin of the various Fishes examined, and have frequently made preparations
by the chloride of gold methods, and by the more modern method of steeping in
methylene blue and then fixing with picrate of ammonia. We have so far failed to
distinguish the connective tissue cells in the skin, but hope to resume this part of
the investigation with more satisfactory results at some future time. The present
section merely deals with the minute relations of the coloration elements as seen in
sections stained or unstained.

The first fact to be mentioned is that the pigment is not exclusively confined to the
derma, but occurs in some cases also in the epidermis. A typical instance of this is
afforded by the Flounder where, in any section of the upper side of the skin, black
pigment is seen in the epidermis. Coloured pigments are not seen in sections,
because they are dissolved out by the alcohol in the process of preparation. The
black pigment is not contained as a rule in the epidermic cells but between them,
sometimes in masses which resemble in section the chromatophores of the derma,
and look as though some of the latter had bodily migrated into the epidermis ; more
usually the pigment appears in granules or thin short threads, which might be
sections of branches of chromatophores. In a specimen of the Fish which had soaked
for some months in diluted glycerine the epidermis peeled off in patches of some size,
and these, when mounted and stained, showed beautifully the condition of the
pigment in this layer. It appeared in the form of somewhat injured chromato-
