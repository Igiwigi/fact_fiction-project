Although, however, our observations prove that this thickness is practically con-
stant for any one film, they indicate considerable variations in its magnitude for
different films. The differences between the numbers given by the optical method
are perhaps not much in excess of the probable error of experiment, but in the case
of the electrical observations they far exceed it. They may be partly due to light
changes in constitution ; but the following reasons negative the supposition that this
is the only, or indeed an important, cause.

In the first place, the constitution of a liquide glycorique is more difficult to main-
tain unaltered than that of a s0ap solution. Tt is, however, in films formed with
the latter that the greatest apparent variations in thickness occur. This, on the
other hand, is in accord with the fact that films formed without glycerine are, as is
proved by the colour phenomena they display, more uncertain and irregular in their
behaviour than those made of the standard solution. Again, if a change of con-
stitution took place, we should probably have detected it by progressive changes
in the calculated thickness, which would in reality have been due to alterations

\in the specific resistance. Finally, the absolute constancy of the hygrometer and
thermometer seem to preclude the possibility of any considerable change of constitu-
tion even in a black film. On the whole then we think that the thickness of the
