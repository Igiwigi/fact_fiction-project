balmed ; and he has described several chemical operations to
which he subjected them, in order to discover the nature of
the-ingredients employed by the Egyptian embalmers. The
result of these experiments by no means  settled the ques-
tion they were intended to resolve. With regard to the
anatomical state of the mummies examined by him, the -in-
formation he has given us is very deficient. All he has said
reduces itself to a repetition of the. common adage © dry as
a mummy.” Like Dr. HapLey, BLuMExBacn, and many
subsequent writers, he came to the conclusion, that Egyptian
mummies are invariably found in a state of aridity, without
the least vestige of the soft parts or viscera, and are wholly
deprived: of humidity, in fact, that they are mere- skele-
tons enveloped in © cerecloth:”” It will be seen,-that such an
opinion requires considerable modification.

The next information -of -importance we possess on the
subject of Egyptian mummies, is to be found inthe third
and fourth volume of the Transactions of the Royal Society
of Gottingen. Of two /papers on the subject by -Professor
HEevNE contained in those volumes, the first relates to the
antiquity of mummies generally; and the -second gives a
description of a mummy presented by the King of Denmark,
to the Museum of the Royal Society of Gottingen, on which
Professor GMELIN |instituted- various chemical /experiments
