7. That there is a simple connection between the intensity of a colour and the
extent of field.

8. That the colour fields depend on the size of the object viewed, and that the
dependence appears to follow a simple empiric law.

9. That the retina is most sensitive to light at its central part and the sensitive-
ness diminishes towards the periphery.

These results as they stand do not seem to confirm either one of the two
main theories of colour vision. The existence of a colour field at all is difficult to
explain on the Youne theory, and the fact that a colour field for red can be
obtained with bright illumination although the disappearance of this colour and light
takes place almost together at the centre of the retina, is not easily accounted for on
Herineâ€™s theory. It appears as if light were the fundamental sensation caused by
the main vibration generally, whilst colour is as it were an overtone to which the
receiving nerves are less susceptible than to light, the further away they are situated
from the centre, and may be due to the form of vibration.

Tn closing this paper I should be doing an injustice if I did not place on record the
great assistance I have had during the whole of these investigations, which have
extended over three years, from my assistant, Mr. WALTER BRADFIELD ; with every new
step I took he made himself thoroughly acquainted, and every series of measures I made
myself he repeated with his own eyes. There is nothing stated as being fairly proved
