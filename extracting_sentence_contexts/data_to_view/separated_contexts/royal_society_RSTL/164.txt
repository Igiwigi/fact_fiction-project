some time exposed to the #tmosphere,/it yields to-caustic'ammo-
niac a precipitate, in all respects similarto that which is sepa-
rated by caustic ammoniac from corrosive sublimate. I would infer from these facts, that the white dense fumes
consist of mercury, or perhaps. oxide of mercury, united'to the
nitrous etherized gas; and that, when the muriate of ammoniac
containing them is exposed to the: atmosphere, or is boiled, the
gas separates from the mercury; and the excess of nitrous acid,
which always comes: over with nitrous ether, decomposes the
ammoniacal muriate, and forms corrosive mercurial muriate or
8ublimate, This theory is corroborated, by comparing the quan-
tity of gas estimated to be contained in the fulminating mercury,
with the quantities of gas yielded from alcohol and nitrous acid,
with and without mercury in solution; not to mention that
more ether, as well as more gas, is produced without the inter-

the product of ether, is always in the inverse ratio to the pro-
duct of nitrous etherized gas. Should a further proof be thought
necessary, of the existence of the nitrous etherized gas in the
fulminating mercury, as well as in the white dense fumes, it
may be added, that if a mixture of alcohol and nitrous acid
holding mercury in Solution, be 80 dilute, and exposed to a
temperature s0 low, that neither ether nor nitrous etherized gas
are produced, the fulminating mercury, or the white fumes, will
never.
