REPULSION RESULTING FROM RADIATION. 525

| surface and extreme lightness are the requisites in selecting materials for the beam,
index, or gravitating mass; and when the masses have the same specific gravity and
extent of surface, their position in respect to the source of heat determines the extent
of movement. Thus a cylinder of pith is more sensitive when arranged for the heat to
act on its side than on its end; and the film of mica in experiment 65 was more affected
when the heat struck its flat surface than its edge, although the difference was not s0
great as might have been expected had air-currents been the cause of motion.

76. But these facts can equally well be used on the opposite side; for assuming that
the moyement is due to a repulsive action of radiation, it is reasonable to suppose that
extended surface, weights being equal, would have an advantage. The repulsion by
