depending on the detailed construction of the machine.

This kind of setting is a ‘* perverse”’ one, since it makes the ailerons turn the machine
in one sense and the rudder in the opposite sense; this is of course the meaning of
being zero.

If «= 0, we have the three-dimensional phugoids of §20, defined by equations
(20-7) with y as independent variable. The approximation means once again that
we neglect the drag, the air resistance effect of side-slip, and the air resistance effect of changes in
the w velocity component. While we assume that the machine adjusts itself in the Lanchester
manner about each of the yawing, pitching and rolling axes.

There is an apparent difficulty due to the fact that the machine is not symmetrical
when &, ¢ are not zero, so that its steady glide is in general on a helix. If in this
helical glide the banking angle is ¢,, then it is easy to prove that the new gliding
angle y,, the new gliding velocity uw, /_,, and the rotation (g/V_,) rj, are given approxi-
mately by

M1 =ysecg,, um? =secg,, ru, = tangy. (26-10)
But the non-steady motion is again given by (20-4), (20-5) or (20-6); so that an aero-
plane possesses only one set of three-dimensional phugoids for any given condition.
