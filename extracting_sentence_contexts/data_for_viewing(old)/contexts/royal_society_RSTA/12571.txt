Aa in the case of molecular viscosity, the different values given by the comparisons
bo partly due to the fact that the addition of Â« carbon atom to form the group
:@ exerts a different effect from that produced when the carbon atom udded
3 the group C:O, and partly to the presence of molecular aggregates in the
thy] alcohol.
