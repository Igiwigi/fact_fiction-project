to combination, that is, the law which regulates this force when all disturbing causes
are removed, is entirely unknown. Although the determination of this law, solving the
the most important problem of the science, appears in the present state of our know-
ledge Â«till to lie in the far distance, it is certainly not premature to search for facts which
may serve as starting-points in this field of investigation. The interesting relations in
which photo-chemical induction stands to this question have, therefore, attracted our

special attention.


382 PROFESSOR BUNSEN AND DR. H. E. ROSCOE'S PHOTO-CHEMICAL =

The fact that the action of light upon a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen does not
take place instantaneously, but that a considerable continuation of the exposure is neces-
sary before an action occurs, was noticed by DRAPER in 1843. From this observation he
concluded that chlorine, on exposure to light, undergoes an allotropic modification, per-
manent for several weeks, which differs from ordinary chlorine by possessing a greater
combining power.

We shall show that the true cause of this phenomenon is totally a different one ; that
it cannot be explained by the supposition of an allotropic modification of chlorine, but
that the peculiar action which we have called photo-chemical induction here comes into
play.

If the chemical rays emanating from a constant source of light be allowed to fall upon
