In the past few decades, data have emerged suggesting that several animal
species of different taxonomic groups are capable of representing quantity
[1,2], which allows the estimation of set sizes (for reviews of comparative litera-
ture, see [3—6]). One open issue is to what extent quantities (such as spatial
distances, time durations or numbers) are encoded in the nervous systems by
similar mechanisms. To be more precise: to what extent do similarities in behav-
ioural performance correspond to similarity of mechanisms, or even to a
common evolutionary origin? Although any definite answer to this question
is difficult, 1 would like to discuss two cases in point: one is related to the
encoding of some basic Euclidian geometric properties of space, such as dis-
tances and sense, the other is related to the so-called ‘mental number line’,
which underscores the important fact that number and space are intimately
related concepts.

2. The case of geometry

Geometry cognition has been much investigated in the past few decades using a
task developed originally by Cheng & Gallistel [7—9]. Basically, in the task, ani-
mals should reorient in a rectangular environment in accord with its metrical
and sense (right/Ieft) relationship. It was noted that during initial, spontaneous
reorientation (i.e. a working memory task) animals often ignore other types of
