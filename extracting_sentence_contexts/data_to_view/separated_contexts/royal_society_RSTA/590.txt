This amounts to saying that biological information, the most basic concept of
molecular biology, does not really belong to science. This is the ontological claim of the chemical paradigm, the idea that all natural processes are
completely described, in principle, by physical quantities. This view is also known as physicalism,
and it is based on the fact that biological information is not a physical quantity. So, what is it? A similar problem arises with the rules of the genetic code: they cannot be measured and cannot
be reduced to physical quantities, so what are they?
