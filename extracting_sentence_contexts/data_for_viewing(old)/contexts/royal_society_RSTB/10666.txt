inal CLO model [3]. Physiological evidence has since validated this version of the
model by showing that the history of a neuron’s activity determines its current
biochemical state and its ability to undergo future synaptic plasticity [4,5], a
phenomenon now referred to as metaplasticity—the plasticity of synaptic plas-
ticity [6]. The BCM model has been widely tested. It was first examined in the
visual system, where sensory experience could be altered and the subsequent
effect on synaptic modification rules could be examined. Evidence for the sliding
modification threshold was eventually obtained in multiple brain regions beyond
the visual system [7-13].

Learning and plasticity theories incorporated the BCM model and sliding
modification threshold partly to provide a mechanism for stabilization of
synaptic strength. In fact, biologists have long reflected upon the stability
issue and studied it in biological systems beyond the nervous system, because
