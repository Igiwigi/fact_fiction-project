Fach consists of two or three membranous folds, placed at different depths from the
surface, of about three-fourths of a circle in extent, 80 that the passage through a sucker
from the external surface to the interior of the neck is rendered rather tortuous, and
inclining to a spiral. The external opening of this passage varies very much in different
Cysticerci, both in 8ize and shape ; but it is always s8maller than the internal one. It is
difficult, if not impossible, to demonstrate by the microscope alone, the existence of a
passage through a sucker ; however, this fact admits of proof from the circumstance of
the carbonic acid, which is evolved in the cavity of the neck during the decomposition of
the calcareous bodies, when these animalcules are in acetic acid, being seen under the
microscope to pass freely through the openings in the snckers. In the membranous
folds of the suckers, both circular and radiating fibres are distinctly visible, resembling
in their general characters those in the neck, already mentioned. See Plate X. fig. 4.
