â€” Placed in the part of the external circuit leading from the machine to the negative
V terminal of the tube. The effect was to constrict the luminous column by the forma-
= tion of a dark space between the part of the interior of the tube directly under the
5 tinfoil and the luminous column (Plate 17, fig. 13). The section of this dark space
A through the axis of the tube was in the form of a segment of a circle of which the
centre would be in or near the tinfoil or within the glass immediately beneath it, 80
that the whole figure was that of a section of an anchor-ring by a co-axial cylinder.
As the air-spark was increased the dimensions of this space also increased, till nothing
was left of the haminons column within the part of the tube surrounded by the tin-
foil but a very bright central line (Plate 17, fig. 14).

It will be observed that this phenomenon is precisely what would be produced by a
repulsion of the luminous column, the peculiar form being occasioned by the fact that
the tinfoil was used in the form of a ring, s0 that the repulsion must take place
symmetrically from all sides, and hence must produce constriction of the column
instead of displacing it entirely. We shall, however, see that some caution is neces-
