If, therefore, we are to
depart from this principle some ground must be shown for 80 doing. The comparative value of two hypotheses may be tested by following these hypotheses
out to their consequences, and comparing these consequences with the facts to which
the hypotheses are to be applied. If we find that one hypothesis is applicable to all
the facts, while the other is applicable to only a portion of those facts, the latter hypo-
thesis is inadmissible. But both hypotheses may include all the facts, and be equally
applicable to them, including in each case precisely the same facts. In this case both
hypotheses are equally tenable, and we haye no means of giving a preference to either.
