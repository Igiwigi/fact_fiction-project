E(k) occurs as viscosity v decreases and the maximum velocity gradient ||Vu|| becomes larger
and larger. In fact, energy dissipation ¢ = v||Vul|* is observed to be non-vanishing as v > 0 in
turbulent flow, requiring velocity gradients to grow unboundedly. Estimating ||Vul] ~ (e/v)!/2,
the upper bound (7.1) becomes

(P(t) < 6a y" [ew (2 ()'") - | . (7.2)

This bound allows unlimited diffusion of field lines. Consider first the case 4 =v or Pt =1, for
simplicity, where Richardson’s theory implies that

(r7(t)) ~ 12at + ef. (7.3)

The rigorous upper bound always lies strictly above Richardson’s prediction and, in fact, goes
to infinity as v = — 0! The case of large Prandtl number is just slightly more complicated, as
previously discussed in §4c. When Pt > 1, the inequality (7.2) holds as an equality for times
<ttrans with

trans = a (7.4)
This is then followed by a Richardson dispersion regime

(7) ~6 (=) +e(t—ftrans)®, > trans, (75)

assuming that the kinetic Reynolds number is also large and a Kolmogorov inertial range exists
at scales greater than the Kolmogorov length (v°/e)!/4, Once again, the upper bound (7.2) is much
larger than Richardson’s prediction and, at times longer than trans, the dispersion of field lines is
