Reaching causal verdicts about scenes like this one requires going beyond
what actually happened, and considering what would have happened in a
relevant counterfactual situation [1-3]. If ball A had not been present in the
scene then ball B would not have gone through the gate. The fact that this counter-
factual is true suggests that ball A caused ball B to go through the gate. By the
same logic, in figure 1b, ball A did not cause ball B to go through the gate. Here, ball B would have gone through the gate even if ball A had not been present
in the scene.
