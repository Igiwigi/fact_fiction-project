The explanation of these differences in the after-effects of vagus excitation on the
output of the heart is obvious enough on examination of a series of myocardiographic
records of the action of the vagus on the auricles. These show that while, in some
cases, the auricle has a period of increased force as an after-effect, in other cases the
auricle gains strength more slowly, for, as we have pointed out, there is no direct
correspondence between the rate of the heart-beat and the strength of the auricular
contractions. We conclude, then, that th√© want of conformity in the after-effects of vagus excita-
3 tion on the output of the heart, is due to variations in the after-effect of the excitation
on the auricular beats, and that the temporary increase of the output, which is of
common enough occurrence, is due to the temporary increase in the force of the auricular
contractions, and also to the fact that the venous pressure usually falls slowly. III. Errect or Vacus Excrration on THE RuyTHM OF THE Heart.
