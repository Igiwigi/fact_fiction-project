Consider in general the cubic surface (#XX, Y, Z, WY=0, and in connexion
therewith the equation Xz+ Yy+Z2+Ww=0, which regarding therein X, Y, Z, Was
current coordinates, and z, y, 2, w as constants, is the equation of a plane. If from the
two equations we eliminate one of the coordinates, for instance W, we obtain

(xXXw, Yu, Zw, —(Xx+Yy+Z2))=0,
which, (X, Y, Z) being current coordinates, is obyiously the equation of the cone, vertex
(X=0, Y=0, Z=0), which stands on the section of the cubic surface by the plane. Equating to zero the discriminant of this function in regard to (X, Y, Z), we exPress
that the cone has a nodal line; that is, that the section has a node, or, what is the same
thing, that the plane aX+yY+2Z+wW=0 is a tangent plane of the cubic surface ;
and we thus by the process in fact obtain the equation of the cubic surface in the reci-
procal or plane coordinates (x, y, z, w). Consider in the same equation &, y, 2, W as
current coordinates, (X, Y, Z) as given parameters, the equation represents a system of
three planes, viz. these are the planes aX+yY +2Z+wW'=0, where W! has the three
values given by the equation (#XX, Y, Z, W')*=0, or, what is the same thing, X, Y, Z, W'
are the coordinates of any one of the three points of intersection of the cubic surface

u:X+yY +227 +wW'=0
is the polar plane of this point in regard to a quadric surface X*+Y*+Z*+W*=0;
the equation
(+LXw, Yu, Zw, —(Xx+Yy+Zz))=0

is thus the equation of a system of 3 planes, the polar planes of three points of the cubic
surface (which three points lie on an arbitrary line through the point x=0, y=0, 2=0). In equating to zero the discriminant in regard to (X, Y, Z), we find the envelope of the
system of three planes, or say of a plane, the polar plane of an arbitrary point on the
cubic surface,—or we haye the equation of the reciprocal surface, being, as is known, the
same thing as the equation of the cubic surface in the reciprocal or plane coordinates
(z,y,z, w).
