Under such circum-
stances the physiologist must admit one of two suppositions. The chylaqueous fluid,

being a vital fluid, must in $0me manner be oxygenized. In this case this can happen

only mdirectly, either through the blood-proper, which 'in this species immediately
receives oxygen from without, or through the alimentary system, which is being con-
stantly traversed by a current of fluid-sand. 'These facts are here noticed in historic
connection with the chylaqueous fluid, because they tend to elucidate its peculiar
laws. Between the corpuscles of the chylaqueous fluid in Nats filiformis and those of
Arenicola, a close resemblance is obseryable, -the same disposition to fibrillate on
bursting. The typical cell is orbicular in shape, nucleated and granular (fig. 16).
