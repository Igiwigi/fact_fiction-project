2 Enough has been said to show that Matonia has many points of contact with
.2 various fern families, but the sum of resemblances is the greatest between this genus
'S and the Cyatheaces. Several writers have drawn comparisons between the sori of
= Matonia and those of the Cyatheaceze, but neither in this respect nor in the anatomical
3 Batemans is there sufficient similarity to render advisable the inclusion of the Malayan
FS genus among the Cyatheacez.
& The facts of anatomical structure lend support to the retention of the Matoninew as
% a distinct sub-division of the Filices, represented by a single genus and two species, —
¥ isolated surviving ferns of a long line of extinct species, which flourished in the
& Jurassic and Cretaceous epochs. We may next briefly consider some of the fossil
representatives of the Matoninew, paying special attention to their geological and
8 geographical range.

A The statement that the Matoninese were well represented during the Mesozoic

epoch rests on evidence derived in part from the nature of the sori and sporangia, and
in part from the characteristic habit of certain fossil fronds.
