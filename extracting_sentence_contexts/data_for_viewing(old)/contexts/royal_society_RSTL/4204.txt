According to the explanations under the other head, the masses of hepatic cells
of which the parenchyma of the liver is composed are pervaded by intercellular
passages leading directly into ducts, which from having a proper coat are recog-
nisable as 8uch. The hepatic cells, analogous to the endogenous cells of other glands.
which form, like an epithelium, the immediate wall of the intercellular passages,
become, in the recognisable ducts, superseded by a proper epithelium.

10. Of these hypothetical explanations, it is to be observed, that those under the
first head are founded on the assumption that the hepatic cells correspond to glan-
dular vesicles,—for it is glandular vesicles and not endogenous cells which open into
ducts either separately or after having coalesced to form tubules,—an assumption
already opposed to analogy and altogether unsupported by any fact, but now com-
pletely set aside by the facts and arguments which have been adduced in this paper.
Whilst the explanations under the first head must thus be rejected, that under the
second head, which assumes the hepatic cells to correspond to endogenous cells, and
which was first suggested by Professor Heng of Heidelberg as the most probable,
has by the same facts and arguments been proved to be correct in principle.
