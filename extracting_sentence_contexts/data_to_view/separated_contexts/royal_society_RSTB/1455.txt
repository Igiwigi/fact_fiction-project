From this ready penetration by a substance that cannot osmose, Mercrr
© argues that the vapour must pass through the stomata and penetrate by the inter-
cellular spaces. Also, if a leaf be injected with mercury and pressed between paper
£& sensitized with AgNOs, the blackening of the paper by the vapour only occurs in
5 those parts which bear stomata. The interpretation given is no doubt correct, but it
£ is not logically conclusive, for the very fact that mercury attacks protoplasm shows
3 that it must osmose through a colloid membrane—the cell wall—and so might enter
3 the leaf partly through the cuticle. * One fact the author does establish, namely,
5 that diffusion takes place through stomata with equal facility in either direction.

& Several other vapours, such as H,S and SO,, gave similar results, and NH, was
| especially rapid in its action.
