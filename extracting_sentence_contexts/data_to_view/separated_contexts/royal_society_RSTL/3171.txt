The experiment was
finally made with water fourteen inches in depth. Particles at a very moderate
depth in the water seemed to have no motion except the general motion of the
fluid, and the whole of the lower part of the water may be considered as per-
forming the part of a solid mass upon which the superficial undulating portion
reposed. In fact it matters not to the fluid, what is beneath, provided it has
sufficient cohesion, is uniform in relation to the surface fluid, and can transmit
the vibrations to it in an undisturbed manner *,

fluids, differing in density or some other circumstances, by which the denser
was enabled most readily to accommodate itself to rapid, regular and alternating
displacements of its support when that support was horizontal, suggested an
inquiry into the probable arrangement of the fluid when the displacements
were lateral or even superficial.

lower extremity dipped about one third of an inch into water, fig. 27,
and causing it to vibrate by applying the rod at Xx, or by tapping the
plate with the finger, undulations of a peculiar character were obsery-
ed: those passing from the plate towards the sides of the basin were
scarcely visible though the plate vibrated strongly, but in place of ,
such appeared others, in the production of which the mechanical force

* I have seen the water in a pail placed in a barrow, and that on the head of an upright cask in a
brewer's yan passing over stones, exhibit these elevations.
