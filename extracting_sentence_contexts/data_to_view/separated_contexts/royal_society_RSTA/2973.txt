Similarly, if a tube had first
erystallised in a B-shower, it usually continued to give B-showers when heated again
to dissolve the crystals and then recooled. The above statement does not invariably
hold good, however, for occasionally a tube was found to give both a- and B-showers
in turn after successive heatings and coolings. Friction generally has a special
effect in bringing down £-showers, in fact 8 appears to be far the most usual
modification to crystallise in the tubes. It was found that when only a few glass
fragments were enclosed in the tubes to produce friction the B-showers did not
usually occur until the solutions had passed into the labile state by about 8° of
temperature and, therefore, crossed the supersolubility curve defined by the experi-
ments on refractive indices. If, however, a few fragments of some heavier material
such as corundum or tinstone were enclosed in the tubes to produce the friction, the
B-showers were found to occur as soon as the solution had reached the labile
temperature.
