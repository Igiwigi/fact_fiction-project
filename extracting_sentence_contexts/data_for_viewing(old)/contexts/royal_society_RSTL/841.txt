loss of caloric, never shocks our mind, because it is familiar to
us, We cannot say what loss of caloric may be sustained by
mercury, in order to unite with platina ; or how far the presence
of the latter may contribute to expel caloric from the former.
We know too, that at any temperature, without the aid of a
combustible body, to act as a reductive, we have not been able to
disunite the last portions of oxygen, from the oxides of iron or
of manganese. Yet, in the usual method of reducing a metallic
oxide, the oxygen is Surrounded by a much greater quantity of
caloric than is necessary to convert it into gas, Every fixation
of a volatile substance is analogous to the present question ;
and they whose minds have taken alarm from the novelty
of the fact, may thus be familiarized with the necessity of ad-
mitting it,

But, it may be objected, in the instances of iron or manganese,
oxygen is combined with a combustible body, and retained in it
by a decided and powerful affinity. There is no reason to suppose


of a metallic Substance called Palladium. 311

that such an affinity may not exist among metals. We have
been forced to acknowledge it, in a few cases, among the earths ;
and, from the profound and sagacious researches of Mr. BEr-
