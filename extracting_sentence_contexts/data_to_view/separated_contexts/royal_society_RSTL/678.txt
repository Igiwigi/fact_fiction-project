Like the atmosphere, the ocean is subject to irregularities
of temperature. This fact is proved by the Journal in an
ample manner. The causes which produce these irregula-
rities may be divided, very generally, into three kinds, tem-
pestuous weather, shoals, and currents. Independent of other modes of operation, and they are
various in tempestuous weather, superficial currents appear
to be established in the course of the prevailing winds.
