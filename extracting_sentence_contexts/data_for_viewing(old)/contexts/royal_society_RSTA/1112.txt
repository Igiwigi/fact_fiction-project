in the SNIC (left, c) and the Hopf (right, d) parameters. Intersection with the axis with negative
(positive) slopes correspond to stable (unstable) phase relationships between pairs of oscillators.
At 5ms delay, excitatory (E5, green) synapses lead to a coupling function with a stable phase
difference, ¢ + +7//5 that is neither synchronous (¢ = 0) nor anti-phase, (¢ = 7). However, once
the synapses slow down to t = 15 ms, the stable phase-shift is ¢ = (E15, blue). Similarly, with
inhibition at 5 ms decay (15, red), ¢ =z is the only attractor. However, at slower values of decay
(t =15, 115, orange), there is bistability between synchrony (¢ =0) and anti-phase (@ =z). For
the Hopf case, excitatory synapses lead to stable synchrony (or near synchrony) (E5, green), while
inhibitory synapses lead to anti-phase (15, red). These figures show that both the nature of the
coupling and the shape of Z play an important role in determining the phase-locking properties
of symmetrically coupled oscillators.

The fact that a pair of identical oscillators always leads to an odd effective coupling function
(the even terms do not matter) would lead one to believe that we could assume H is an odd
function. However, once more than two oscillators are connected, then the even component of the
