vibrations: having learned to perform the vibratory discrimi-
nation task described above, animals were presented with
two electrical pulse trains of different frequency, and their
task was to judge which of the two trains was higher in fre-
quency [12]. As each pulse evokes a burst of activity in cortex
[16], pulse trains will evoke entrained responses whose fre-
quency matches that of the pulse train. If indeed entrainment
conveys information about frequency, then discriminating
the frequency of ICMS pulse trains should be analogous to
discriminating the frequency of skin vibrations, since both
evoked periodic responses in S1 neurons. Romo showed that
the animalsâ€™ performance on the task based on ICMS was com-
parable to that based on skin vibrations. In fact, the animals
could compare the frequency of an ICMS train to that of a
skin vibration [13]. These results were significant for two
reasons. First, while previous studies had revealed a correlation
between temporal patterning in S1 and vibratory frequency
(e.g. [15]), the study showed that this patterning conveys
information about frequency using a causal manipulation of
neuronal activation. Second, Romo and colleagues demon-
strated that animals were able to perform a perceptual
discrimination task based on artificially generated sensations.
The trick had simply been to replace the natural afferent input
with ICMS that mimicked the relevant aspect of neuronal acti-
vation, in this case neuronal entrainment. The landmark study
