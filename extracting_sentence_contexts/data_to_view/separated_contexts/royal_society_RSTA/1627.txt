Since the
action of the non-ideal effects, such as ambipolar diffusion, is supposed to increase toward small
scales, the observed behaviour must be related to the dissipation of small-scale vorticity motions. Unlike that, the absorption bands at heights above 500 km peak at lower frequencies. This fact is
indicative of the overall reorganization of the magnetic structure being responsible for the lack of
the vorticity in the AMBI simulations. The simulations with the Hall effect show an excess of vorticity above 500 km both relative to
the BATT and AMBI simulations up to a factor 2. The dependence of this excess on frequency


shows a weak maximum at low frequencies, and therefore is indicative of global magnetic
structure changes.
