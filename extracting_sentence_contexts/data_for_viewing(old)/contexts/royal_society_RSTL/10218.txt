somatic layer is separated by a considerable interval from the epiblast.

We have been able to 8ome extent to follow the development of the segmental q
The imperfect preservation of onr specimens has, as in other instances, rendered
study of the point somewhat difficult, bub we believe that the figure representing
development of the duct some way behind its front end (Plate 23, fig. 29) is an accu
representation of what may be seen in a good many of our sections. |

It appears from these sections that the duct (Plate 23, fig. 29, 59.) is developed as a
hollow ridge-like outgrowth of the somatic layer of Bt: Fs directed towards the
epiblast, in which it causes a slight bulging. The cavity of the ridge freely communi>
cates with the body-cavity. The anterior part of this ridge appears to be formed first,
Very s00n, in fact, in an older embryo belonging to this stage, the greater part of the
groove becomes segmented off as a duct lying between the epiblast and somatic meso-
Ãžblast (Plate 23, fig. 28, 89.), while the front end still remains, as we believe, in com-
munication with the body cavity by an anterior pore. '

This mode of development corresponds in every particular with that observed in
Teleostei by ROSENBERG and OELLACHER.

The structure of the notochord (nc.) at this stage is very similar to that obseryed
by one of us in Elasmobranchii} The cord is formed of transversely arranged flat-'
tened cells, the outer parts of which are vacuolated, while the inner parts are granulan,
and contain the nuclei. This structure gives rise to the appearance in transverse
sections of an axial darker area and a peripheral lighter portion.
