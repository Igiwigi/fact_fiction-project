Although time factors are still wanting, and detailed observation of the plant in
its natural habitat necessarily somewhat scanty, it is possible to obtain a fair working
conception of the way in which the flower has come to be associated with insect
visits. On the assumption of dicliny the drop-mechanism of the functional ovule,
which had been utilised by insects, is retained in the staminate flower in full
working order, since insects which go to one flower for honey are likely to expect

plasmolytie sugar-solution, and this may even abstract water from the cell-contents of the massive stigma-
head by exosmosis through the surface-pits.

But the question really involved is the extent to which this “stigma dise,” with its insect-visited
exudation, was similarly constructed and equally entomophilous in the original hermaphrodite flowers, at a
period, that is to say, when it also acted as a pollen-collecting funnel. The fact that the edges of the disc
are incurved in older withered flowers, and the papillose surfaces more or less approximated, suggests the
possibility of a preceding mechanism for pollen-retention,

honey in the other (ef the gyneecial nectary of the staminate flower of Ilex). At
any rate the fact remains that only that portion of the ovule (the pyriform mass
extending just to the level of insertion of the integument) is retained for this special
function alone; it similarly stores starch, but, having no other use, it is rapidly and
completely depleted in older flowers. The “stylar tube” is retained since the
secretion from a deep-seated nucellus must be taken to the exterior, and this rapidly
