This value is not much different than the melting temperature of stearic acid (69°C). On the other
side, SLC16:0 shows no first-order transition in the 10°C to 110°C temperature range but only an
ill-defined second-order transition between 85°C and 100°C (electronic supplementary material,
figure S9b). Considering the fact that the melting temperature of palmitic acid is 63°C, it is highly
unlikely to expect first-order transitions (fusion/crystallization) of SLC16:0 above 110°C. This
suggests that acidic SLC16:0 molecules are in a more fluid state at room temperature, a fact which
could explain the continuous micelle-to-fibre transition rather than abrupt crystallization. SLC16:0 forms fibrillar hydrogels, as observed for other synthetic [25,83] and microbial
[44,48,50] glycolipids.
