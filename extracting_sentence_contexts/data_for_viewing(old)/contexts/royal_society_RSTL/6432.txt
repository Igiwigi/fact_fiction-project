presence of Agamogenesis; but this mode of generation may perhaps have had the effect
of retaining a previously existing condition, rather than of originating a new and pecus
liar state of things. The cases of the Bee and of some Lepidoptera prove that a double
method of egg-development is no necessary condition of Agamogenesis.

Passing on to the other sex, T am not competent to offer any opinion as to the rela-
tions of the male and female elements to one another, or the homologies existing
between the product of the male, the semen, on the one hand, and the egg or any part
of it, on the other ; but it is remarkable that, as we find (if I am correct in the view now
adyanced) in the Annulosa eggs of two different sorts, 0 also there are traces of a similar
bimorphism of the semen. In Notommatea Sieboldii, according to LEYDIG, the sperma-
tozoa are of two sorts; ZEXKER has made the same observation with reference t0
Asellus aquaticusF, in which animal I have also convinced myself of this curious fact;

and among Mollusca there is the well-known case of Paluding vivipara.
