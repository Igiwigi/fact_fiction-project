The last equation, incidentally, shows that, if n; is constant, of and ¢, must have the same sign.

In order now to derive the evolution equations in terms of 6, we can either start from equations
(2.1) and (2.2), assume that ot = o'(6), e = e(0) and ¢ = (6), and follow a completely analogous
reasoning to the one used to derive equations (2.4) and (2.5), or alternatively we can start
directly from equations (2.4) and (2.5) and use the fact that do = d(a'(a)@) = o'(1 + 6(Ino*),) do
to transform all the derivatives with respect to o into derivatives with respect to 0. In either case,
we arrive at the following evolution laws for c and 6:

dc
an —B(C,O)(vads(c, 8) — vdes(9)) + (1 — ¢) (3.6)
and
do Vads(C, 0) — Udes(9) 3.7
