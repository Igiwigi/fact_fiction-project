It may be added
that Balkhash is bounded, both north and west, by very considerable hills, the
Koi Djarlegan, &e. Moreover, apart from the question as to the extent of the hypothetical Aralo-
Caspian Sea, it has been suggested that the Aral Sea, at all events, has retired in recent
times from some considerable area, and is continuing to recede thus. This statement,
which occurs in several text-books, would appear to be only partially supported by the
facts which came within my own observations. In the summer and autumn of 1886,
I visited the whole north shore of the Aral Sea lying between Gulf Perofisky and
the mouth of the Syr Darya. From Togusken to Sary Cheganak the shore is formed
by high cliffs composed of horizontal beds of Eocene formation, containing fossils.
