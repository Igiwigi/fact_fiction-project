Sublayers can work together :
to compensate weakness in the physical system (as illustrated in our previous example). The aoa)
interaction between sublayers also complicates our attempt to optimize the overall system. :
Optimization of one sublayer may be detrimental to another sublayer. This fact was illustrated D4
in our example when for instance a one-way cavity design was considered. The optimization ae
needs to be done on the system, which clearly indicates the importance of the architecture of aon
the system. [BB
In this paper, we focused our attention on quantum information systems where we can realize ,

large pure quantum states (large enough to run quantum information tasks). This is a necessary
approach for these applications which require high-fidelity quantum coherence.
