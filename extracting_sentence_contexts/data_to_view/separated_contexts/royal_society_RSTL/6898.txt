Adopting the 8nggestion of Dr. DUxCaX, it
follows that the fibres composing the ventricles form twisted loops, which look alike
towards the apex and the base. FREDERICK CasParR WoLpe furthered the investigation,
by showing the possibility of dividing the muscular substance composing the ventricles
into bands; whilst SExAc in the last century, and Dr. Joun Reid in this, gave a new
interest to the subject, by showing that the fibres of the external and internal surfaces
of the ventricles are more vertical in direction than the deeper or more central fibres,
which more approach to the circular. Such are a few of the more important facts ascer-
tained by successive investigators. Having myself in the summer of 1858 made numerous dissections, upwards of 100 of
which are preserved in the Anatomical Museum of the University of Edinburgh **, I
have arrived at results which appear to me to throw additional light on this complex
question, and which seem to point to a law in the arrangement, simple in itself, and
apparently comprehensive as to detail. This law will be adverted to subsequently.
