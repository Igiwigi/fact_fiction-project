standards in each case. A table of differences was then made giving the inter-
mediate values by interpolation and the value in millimetres of one tenth-metre at
every 25 units.

The wave-lengths of all the lines, including the standards, were computed from
this table, using second differences.

Each of the three spectra measured was reduced independently, using the same
standard lines, but computing a separate table for each. A direct comparison of the
three sets of measures showed that they were very nearly identical, and one table
might have served for all, But there appear small systematic differences, due in part

the fact that the measures were made at different distances from the centre of the
ares, and probably in part also to slight irregular contraction of the photographic
films in drying.

It was therefore considered more satisfactory to treat each spectrum entirely
independently, combining in the end the wave-length values obtained to arrive at the
most probable values measured on all three spectra.
