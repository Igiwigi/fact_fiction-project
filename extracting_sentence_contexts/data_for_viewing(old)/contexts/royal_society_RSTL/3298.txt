tide, that the furrow left by its passage must have been either oblique or parallel to the shore, What would
have been the effect if this large and heavy block had been pushed over a surface of solid rock instead of sand?_
This question will recall to the mind of those who have read the late papers of Mezsrs, CnanvuxTIER, VENETZ,
and Agase1z, the case of the longitudinally and obliquely scratched rocks of the Alps, In the Addenda to my
Journal during the voyage of the Beagle, I have endeavoured to show that the passage of ice, with imbedded
fragments of rock, acting at uccessive levels on the surface of shoals during the gradual rising of the land,
offers the most probable explanation of the scratches and grooves, which have justly excited s0 much attention

lines, it frequently entered a little way on each side of the gully. From this fact it
is evident that the gully must have been partly formed before or at the time when
the shelyes were sea-beaches. I particularly observed several instances of this struc-
ture. One which struck me most was in Glen Roy, opposite a gap in the mountain
which leads to Glen Fintec ; here two small threads of water were united at the point
where the line of shelf crossed them, and at their junction the rock was much ex-
posed, 80 that any one would have supposed that the furrow in which they flowed
had been entirely hollowed out by their action. But the shelf curved in a little way
on each side; and, what was more curious, the apex of turf above the point of junc-
tion of the two streamlets had evidently originally formed part of the shelf. By this
it was shown that the entire hollow, with the exception of the actual beds of the
streams, must have existed as an indentation or little cove on the line of ancient sea-
beach. It appeared to me that the extent to which the shelves entered these furrows
