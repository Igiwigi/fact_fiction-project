We thus obtain a solution z of (10.3) such that z(—co) =0. As we have seen, such a solution
yields a solution u° of our original problem (10.1) such that |u° — max(0, y/)| < C. In fact, it satisfies
lim)x|00 |u® — max(0, w)| =0. By using the method of super- and subsolution, we can construct another solution v that
satisfies equality in the first line of (10.3) rather than an inequality. Because the set of solutions
of (10.3) is convex, it is clear that because of the inequality in (10.3), there is a very large
indeterminacy.
