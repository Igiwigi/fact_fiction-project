the peripheral end of such a root, but also in that portion of the sensory root between
the ganglion and the spinal cord; pointing to the probability that there are certain _
nerve fibres which do not depend on the ganglion for their trophic supply, but

derive the same from elsewhere, either the spinal cord at another level, or the
periphery.

In conclusion I wish to call special attention to the value of the method of
excluding one or more nerve roots during an epileptic spasm, as affording us a means
of confirming the facts that have been previously observed from stimulation of the
nerve roots, and also of ascertaining new facts with regard to them and the plexuses
which they form. It supplies us with a valuable means of studying the manner in
which conduction of impulses from the cortex through the nerve roots and plexuses
to the muscles takes place. Further, the method is capable of still wider extension ;
as if instead of producing general epilepsy, we apply less powerful stimuli to the
centres for different movements, as represented in the motor cortex, we shall be able
to connect such centres or parts of these with the nerve roots to which fibres proceed
from these cortical motor centres.
