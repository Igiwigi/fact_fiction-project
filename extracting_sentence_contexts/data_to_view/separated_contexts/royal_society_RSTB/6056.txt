To
his surprise the effect of this displacement was exactly contrary to what might have
been predicted on the Kremu gravity hypothesis. For example, a forward displace-
ment of the otolith, instead of making the eyes roll upwards, caused them to roll
downwards, and so on. It might be urged that the fact of two distinct modes of stimulation points to the
existence of two different mechanisms within the utricular receptors. Against this
idea the evidence, practically conclusive, is as follows. A bisoliutricular frog,
subjected to linear acceleration in a forward direction, begins by giving the same
gravity response as if it were being slowly tilted backwards.
