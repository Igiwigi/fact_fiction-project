Yet eminent chemists
have offered an explanation of these phenomena, and if these are adequate, further in-
quiry is unnecessary. I shall not criticise the absolute or the relative value of these
explanations ; but they add s0 much to the interest of the question, so clearly show
the difficulties under which chemical theory has Jaboured in dealing with these facts,
and also, as I believe, how inadequate it has proved to meet them, that I shall briefly
