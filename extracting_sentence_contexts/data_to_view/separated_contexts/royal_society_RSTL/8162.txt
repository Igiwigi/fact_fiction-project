coefficient of 6” is the first that does not vanish, m roots of the equation coincide with
zero, and mz points of intersection are united at A.

The result of substituting the coordinates of any point P in v, may be conveniently
represented by means of the differential operator P. It is known, in fact, that

(2:0, +Ps0, +P30;,+P40«,)"- (CE a,)* _ þn. (Pr VT 47) Ps)" 3

or, which is the same thing, P"#, is |2 times the result of substituting the coordinates
of Pin ,, Our result may therefore be stated in the following form :—
The necessary and 8ufficient conditions that the conic K, = 4AC—B* may have m-point
Lontact with the surface u, at the point A, are that in the expansion of (A+5B+#C)".u,
SY powers of 0, the mth power of 6 is the lowest whose coefficient does not vanish. Z IT.
