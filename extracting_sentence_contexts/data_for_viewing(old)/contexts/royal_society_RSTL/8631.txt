from the sea, in the sense above defined. At Benares it falls in November, and fro
that month to January the air approaches more nearly to saturation as the temp:
rature falls. At Lahore and Rawul Pindee it is in October, and at Mooltan as early :
September: at this last station the normal variation of the Indian climate is reverset
and the absolute maximum of the year falls in December. At Rawul Pindee an
Roorkee, both situated close to the northern Hills, the winter (here the seconda;
maximum) falls in February, or a month later than at other stations. This wintt
maximum is evidently related to the winter rains of the Upper Provinces, and, like tl
corresponding winter maximum and rains of Europe, is traceable to the descent of th
equatorial (here the anti-monsoon) current and the low winter temperature. But f
this it may be inferred that the Punjab winter would be much more rigorous. Th
increased humidity of the winter does not affect places much below Benares. At Pati
the last vestige of it is perceptible in the fact that the mean humidity of January do
not, fall below that of December, and at Hazareebagh the proportion remains constal
from November to January. At Cuttack, however, the phenomenon reappears, an
the humidity of January appears to be higher than that either of the preceding «
following months. "This may possibly be due to the descent of an anti-monsoon currel
from the Arabian Sea, a conclusion which is fayoured by several circumstances, which
shall refer to later on.

It was observed by Dr. Hooke, in the meteorological appendix of his © Himalaya
Journals,” that the relative humidity of the atmosphere remains pretty constant througl
out all elevations in the Himalaya, except in a Tibetan climate*. The data for th
hill-stations in the present, Table generally confirm this obseryation, but they als
show that the law is subject to considerable exceptions at certain seaso0ns of the year
