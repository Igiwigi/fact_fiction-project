This shows that solutions emanating from compactly supported differentiable initial
conditions are global in time. Consider now f € X0,m,4 and a sequence of such regular initial
conditions ket approximating f and assume that the corresponding solution t > f(t, f) has a
finite time blow-up at tnax. By the moment estimates above, the bounds of || f(t, f pll[o,m] OVer any
finite time interval depend continuously on fi and thus are uniform in k on [0, tmax]. On the other
hand, there is a sequence (f),>1 such that fy > tmax,1—> oo and I ftw Ally [om] is unbounded;
that is, the distance between f (tn, f) and all f (tn, fd becomes arbitrarily large. This contradicts the
continuous dependence of solutions on the initial conditions following, on each [0, fy], from the
Gronwall-Henry inequality, [16, Lemma 3.2]), see also [1, Theorem 8.1.1]. a

Remark 3.7. The additional restrictions in theorem 3.6 are due to the fact that, in the general
case, we cannot control the production of particles; that is, the zeroth moment. In principle, there
is a positive feedback loop in which Mp contributes to M, which, in turn, amplifies, in a nonlinear
way, higher order moments that determine the rate of growth of Mo. The adopted assumptions, bes
which postulate that either Mo is controlled by My, or that the evolution of mass is not influenced [=
by other mechanisms (ro 4 0 implies that there is a production of mass independent of the existing :8
one), although technical, seem to be the simplest ones that break this cycle. We do not claim :
that these assumptions are optimal but at present we do not have any examples of a finite-time 1S
blow-up of solutions in this setting. It is, however, worthwhile to note that there are known cases : ~
of a finite-time blow-up of solutions to growth-fragmentation—coagulation equations even with :
bounded coagulation kernels but with the renewal boundary condition [28]. Dy
