by electrons from the aluminium plates, and (6) ionization in air by its own
électrons plus a comparatively small ionization in air by a net gain of electrons
from the aluminium plates at the end of the chamber. (The latter of these might
have been approximately eliminated from the results of experiments on the
corpuscular radiation from aluminium, This was unnecessary, however; an approxi-
mate correction was obtained by extrapolation.)

Homogeneous beams of various wave-lengths were employed, and the relative
ionizations in air and in aluminium were obtained. A correction had, however, to be
made to the relative ionizations obtained in this way, for the air ionization was due
to the electrons ejected from a given mass of air, whereas the aluminium ionization
was produced by the electrons from a mass which increased with the frequency of the
primary radiation, This is due to the fact that the shorter the wave-length of
the primary radiation, the greater is the velocity of electrons which this radiation
ejects, consequently the greater is the depth of material from which they emerge.
An approximate correction for this may, however, be found by extrapolation. This
is explained below in its application to the determination of the relative ionizations
in air and in copper. The final results of the experiments on air and aluminium are
shown graphically in fig. 6, curve 2, The rise in the air ionization at a wave-length
about 0°56 x 10-* cm. (A/p in Al = 2°5) is well marked, and the subsequent rise in
aluminium ionization is shown in the change in relative ionization in the opposite
direction at a wave-length of about 0°52 x 10-* cm. (A/p in Al = 1'9). It-will be seen
that the curve so ‘obtained is very like the relative ionization curves for SO, and air
obtained directly. This, of course, is as it should be, the atomic weights of aluminium
and sulphur being close together, and their characteristic radiations consequently
