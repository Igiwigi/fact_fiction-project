If, on the horizontal turntable, the frog, momentarily lying supine, is subjected
to smart rotation towards a given side, it rolls at once from supine to prone with that
side lowermost. Should the rate of angular acceleration to the specified side have
been insufficient to induce body-righting, the frog may, on sudden cessation of the
rotation, right itself by rolling over the opposite side. As a delabyrinthized and
even a bisoliutricular frog under similar circumstances remain wholly unresponsive,
it is plain that some labyrinthine mechanism, retained in the biconjoint frog and
destroyed in the other two, is responsible, and in a perfectly determinate and
consistent fashion, for the righting of the rotated biconjoint.

That the mechanism in question is the pair of posterior canals is indicated by the
following facts. As McNatty and Tarr (1933) have shown, prominent actions of
a given posterior canal are. (a) to cause spinal torque, (6) strongly to ventriflex the
head on the opposite side, and (c) simultaneously to extend, or stiffen, the hind-limb
on its own side of the body. When one watches the effect on the supine biconjoint
frog of turntable rotation, say, towards its left, one notes that the spinal axis becomes
torqued, that the right side of the head becomes strongly flexed on the abdomen
and that the left hind-limb is thrown into long-splint extension. This points to
effective stimulation of the left posterior canal.

Experiment proves the conjecture. If, by subsidiary operation, one severs in
the biconjoint frog the nerve from its left posterior canal, it gives no response to
leftward rotation when lying supine on the turntable. If, however, the rotational
movement to its left is abruptly stopped, or if one begins by rotating the supine
