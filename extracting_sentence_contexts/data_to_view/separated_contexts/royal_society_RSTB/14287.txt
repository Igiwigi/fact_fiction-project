For example, the concept DOG is
defined by co-occurring concepts such as WALK,
BARK and FURRY, in the same way that the word DEMOC-
RACY is defined by co-occurring concepts such as POLITICS,
STATE and REPRESENTATION. What matters for our purposes is that the close relationship
between abstract concepts and language use is a constant
across different accounts. In fact, language also works as a
glue that helps categorize everyday disparate experiences
under the same concept [28], for example describing both
being able to make political statements without fear of impri-
sonment and not having to work at a boring job in order to
pay the bills as FREEDOM. Furthermore, given the variability,

ately distributed. Bavelas et al. [15] showed how storytellers
benefit from their listenersâ€™ feedback, arguing for their role
as co-narrators.
