To date, three
resistance mechanisms involving promotor duplications
(TR34/L98H, TRs3 and TR46/Y121F/T289A) and single
mutations (G54 and M220) have been found in A. fumigatus
isolates from soil and air samples and in clinical specimens
of patients (table 1) [24,60-62]. Surveillance by University Medical Centers (UMCs) in
The Netherlands increasingly show that the environmental
