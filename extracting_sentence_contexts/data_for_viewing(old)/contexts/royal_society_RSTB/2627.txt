ridges of Heliastrea, Mussa, Fungia, etc., several small fascicles are formed and
grow so closely crowded together that a large knotty-looking or irregularly-shaped
granulation is the result.

Once more I repeat the important observation that the same microscopic structure
holds good for all protuberances on the skeletal surfaces of Madreporaria, and I
therefore recommend the use of a single term, preferably “ granulation,” for all cases.
The typical appearance of a “ granulation,” as seen in surface section, is shown in
fig. 838. This figure yields also unmistakeable evidence of the fundamental lamellar
structure of the Madreporarian skeleton.

Full-grown coral skeletons often show much larger granulations at the uppermost
part of the calcareous framework than lower down. This is simply due to the fact:
that growth in thickness of the septa, coste, etc., is continued after the coral has
reached the full height which happens to be characteristic for that particular species.
During this continued growth in thickness the “ granulations” are the parts of the
skeleton most added to, and they assume a variety of shapes. They very often lose
at the same time their primitively clear arrangement in rows along the course of
“ trabecule,” since they keep spreading sideways, crossways, or lengthways, and
become confused with neighbouring granulations. It is in this condition that the
granulations ure apt to become “ pseudosynapticular,” #.¢., to form calcareous bonds
between adjoining septal, costal, or indeed coenenchymal parts of the skeleton,

Again, “ pseudosynapticulie ” (vide fig. 71) was a term applied to the appearance of
uniting bars in a few particular cases studied by Prarz, The very general occurrence
