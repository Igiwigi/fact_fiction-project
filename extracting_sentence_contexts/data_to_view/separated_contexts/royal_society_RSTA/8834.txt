But 32048 is also (6) Fs. This is not a mere list coincidence. As a fact (3) Fy and
(58,) F, are very nearly equal, and if both existed would show as a double line too close to have been
resolved, The second line has a separation 1864°23 to (2) 33962°43, and its deduced F, makes with the
calculated F, the limit 30725°18 very close to the definitive value found below. For F, 33937°99 is
supported by (— 26,) Fy = (1) 33948°71 giving F, = 33937°85, but the Fy (0) is large and 31242 shows
a separation with F, of 1865-39 also large. Also (1) 31247-07 as (—6;) F, gives Fy = 31241-64 which
makes F,(«) = 32589°82 and the separation from F; = 1864°64 both improved, On the other hand
(—28,) Fy = (4) 31253°32 gives Fy = 31242°46 precisely the line observed.
