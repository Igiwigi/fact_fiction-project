We were therefore led to develop modified equations for
this purpose. These equations represent the molecular extinction coefficients of the
xanthates with an accuracy almost within the limits of experimental error, and give rise
to difference curves which fall short of normal curves only in showing slight ripples
within the region covered by the absorption band.

equation (iii) of Bre.eckt and Henrt. The principal feature of our new equations consists in the fact that they represent the
absorption curves as being symmetrical on a scale of wave-lengths. The equations of
Kun and Braun, on the other hand, postulate a symmetrical distribution of frequencies,
whilst the equation of Bretecki and Henrt is of an intermediate type. Our adoption
