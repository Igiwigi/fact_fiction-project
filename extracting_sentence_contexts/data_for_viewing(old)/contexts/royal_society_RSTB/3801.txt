specimen of Araucarites (so labelled in our collection, but without data as to its
horizon), whose trunk measures about 15 cm. in diameter, That the trace does
persist is shown by the cases above cited, and by the fact referred to before, that
the Cordaitean leaves remained long attached to the stem (see Section 3a), these
forms belonging to the geological period when the deciduous habit had not been
attained. That they have been overlooked in mature fossil wood is not strange,
since they are difficult to observe, and even in the living forms have not
been recognised until recently. The writer believes that many more fossil forms
with persistent leaf traces will be found when the importance of this feature is
realised.

There is another point in connection with the leaf traces that indicates their
primitive character. STRASBURGER (1891, p. 106) has drawn attention to the fact
that in the pines the resin canals in the leaves do not connect with those in the
cortex, and considers this a specialised condition. Jmrrrey (1908 and 1910 b) agrees
with him, and shows that in Prepinus there is such a connection, and that this form
is therefore of a more primitive type than the living pines. In the Araucarinez, the

resin canals of the cortex accompany the leaf traces on their course through the base
of the leaf, and connect with those in the lamina.
