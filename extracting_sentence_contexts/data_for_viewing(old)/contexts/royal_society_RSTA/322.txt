where the components of Lp drive transitions {i — j,,k=1,2,...,K} and K is
given by the number of positive transition rates y,; > 0. By construction, as one
may verify by writing down the master equation, this system always collapses into
a purely classical mixture of the coarse-grained states. Equivalently, in a quantum
jump trajectory simulation, after the first quantum jump, the state is always given
oy a single such state. In fact, in such a trajectory simulation, this system behaves
exactly like the original Markov jump process. Neglecting for now that our original
model has three different input conditions € ¢ {HOLD,SET,RESET} and thus

hree different conditional transition matrices p? we first discuss how to move
from the discrete time Markov chain model to a continuous time Markov jump
process. Rephrasing this question, we can ask the following: is there a Markov
jump process with conditional transition probability matrix P(t) that ‘looks like’
our Markov chain when stroboscopically probed at fixed time intervals 6t? If our
Markov chain has transition matrix P, then we need to determine a generator
matrix Q such that
