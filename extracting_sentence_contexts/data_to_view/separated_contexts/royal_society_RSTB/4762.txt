Classing the plots solely
by inspection of the curves of response to rainfall we shall put together every case in
which the manurial treatment is alike, and indeed the whole series of curves arrange
themselves in sequence of order of increasing abundance of nitrogenous fertilisers. As
preliminary to a fuller discussion we may note (i) that in all the plots the average effect
of additional rain is harmful. This agrees with Hooxer’s finding for Eastern England.
(ii) In all save the dunged plot 2B, the average loss is rapidly reduced during August,
an observation which finds a simple explanation in the fact that the average date of carting
the crop is August 24th, so that as August advances an increasing proportion of years
occur in which the rain is too late to affect the crop. The exceptional behaviour of
plot 28 indicates that the average loss per inch of rain in the month preceding harvest
is even heavier than that shown in the diagram. (iii) In all the plots October is a month
in which the average loss per inch of rain is small, or in which rain above the average is
positively beneficial. This is the reverse of the condition found by Hooker, who finds
the greatest negative correlation with rain early in October. (iv) In all plots save two,
the unmanured plot (3 and 4) and plot 5 which receives mineral (non-nitrogenous)
manures only, the autumn period of benefit, or but little loss, from rain, is followed
by a period centred in January in which dry conditions appear to be particularly desirable.
