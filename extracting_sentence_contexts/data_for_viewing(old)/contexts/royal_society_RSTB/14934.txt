female genotype fixed effects. We also tested for an interaction
effect between the focal and stimulus female genotypes that
males were paired with on males’ network positions.

In all models analysing the effects on network structure, the
effects of DGEs, IGEs, an individual’s genotypic frequency in
the group, and interactions between these effects were treated as
fixed factors. Genotypic effects (DGEs and IGEs) were treated as
fixed factors because genotypes were chosen non-randomly
based on prior information (see §2b), and because there were
only three levels of genotype for females. All models also included
a random effect of the identity of the individuals’ social group, to
account for the fact that each individual was a sub-sample of its
social group.

(g) Model fitting

All analyses were conducted in R v.3.6.2 [83]. Network positions
of instrength and outstrength were analysed using Poisson-dis-
tributed generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), as these
measures of network position are counts; and network positions
of clustering coefficient and eigenvector centrality were analysed
using linear mixed models (LMMs) using R package Ime4 1.1
[84]. Model fits were assessed using the package DHARMa
0.2.7 [85]. Accommodations for overdispersion were applied as
