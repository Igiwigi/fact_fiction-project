extremities of this spiral, the brass tube E can be heated. The upper end of the tube
is clamped at A, and the lower end rests in a socket, F, capable of a little lateral
adjustment by a screw. By this means the brass tube (the pillar) can be adjusted in
respect to its distance from the cylinder D. Both E and D are lampblacked.

This apparatus is almost identical with one described and figured in my paper
“On Repulsion resulting from Radiation” * (Part IL, pars. 99, 100), only there the
cylinder was of magnesium, and the platinum spiral was bare. With my old apparatus
the noteworthy fact was ascertained that the incandescent spiral attracted the
suspended cylinder to a moderate extent at normal atmospheric pressure ; the attrac-
tion diminished to a minimum between a tension of 50 mm. and 150 mm., then- rose
as the pressure diminished, until, at a tension of 1°15 mm., the attraction was nearly
four times what it was in dense air. Above this exhaustion the attraction suddenly
dropped and changed to repulsion, and at the best vacuum I could get the repulsion
was nearly thirteen times stronger than the attraction in air.

With the present apparatus I was able to verify the broad phenomena formerly
