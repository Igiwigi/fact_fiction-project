Hence, both ensembles hint at a tendency for the
models with the largest magnitudes of the shortwave CRE in the most stable cloud regimes to
have more positive cloud feedbacks in those regimes. This provides support for the argument of
Brient & Bony [13] discussed above, in which models with more low level cloud tend to have
more positive feedbacks. Additional support for this argument is provided by the fact that the
low cloud fractions in the 90-100th percentile range are positively correlated with the net cloud
feedbacks in the same range (figure 4e,f). Figure 3e,f also shows that both the standard and ConvOff ensembles have positive
correlations between the values of the longwave CRE in the 90-100th percentile range and the
cloud feedback averaged over the low-latitude oceans, indicating that models with stronger
longwave CRE tend to have more positive cloud feedbacks. Figure 4b and 5c show similar
correlations between the low-latitude ocean cloud feedback and high cloud fraction in the
ConvOff ensemble and IWP in the standard models, respectively.
