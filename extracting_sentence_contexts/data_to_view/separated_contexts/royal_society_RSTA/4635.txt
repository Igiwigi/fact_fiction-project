The free boundary here is the boundary of the set where the solution u is strictly positive. Denoting
this set 2 := {u > 0}, one can rewrite this problem as a shape optimization problem

min{cap(K, 2) + |Q|:2 CR},

where cap(K, 2) stands for the capacity of the set K in 2

cap(K, 2) =min {| |Vul* dx lu € H\(Q), u=lon x} :

The Alt-Caffarelli method was extended by Briancon et al. [6] to the Dirichlet energy E,(2)
(see also [7] for the first eigenvalue ): given f € L™(R4), let us denote

Given a bounded open set D ¢ R“, the shape optimization problem reads

min{Ep(@) + |Q| : 2 CD). (1.4)

In this case, stating the problem as a shape optimization problem or as a function minimization
problem makes no difference, problem (1.4) being equivalent to

. [Vul? dv: ueHUD =
min 7 z — fu + X¢\uj>0) ) dx : ue Ho(D) >. DS

The starting point for proving the regularity of the free boundary of the optimal set relies on the :
analysis of the state function, solution of the PDE Da

The case of a general spectral functional (1.2) involving higher eigenvalues leads to a new kind : 8
of difficulties related to the fact that each eigenvalue of order higher than 1 is itself a saddle point axes)
and not a minimizer of an unconstrained energy! This fact makes very difficult any attempt to
use the Alt-Caffarelli techniques in a direct manner. For example, the natural choice of a state
function in the 4, optimization problem (1.3) is a corresponding eigenfunction, solution of

— Au = Aj(2)uUR in 2, uz € H}(Q), | ugdx=1.

Even in this simple case, the relationship between the set 2 and the eigenfunction u, is not trivial,
2 being, in general, only a set containing {1 4 0} (in fact, if 2 is just a quasi-open set, it is not
even known if the nodal line {1 =0}/M @ has a zero Lebesgue measure).
