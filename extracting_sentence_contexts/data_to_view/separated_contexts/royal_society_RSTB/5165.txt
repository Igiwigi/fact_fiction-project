It may well be
that under a single designation I have included specimens that are specifically distinct,
but I have not consciously united forms which afford any evidence of differences which
are constant. :

Mr. Berry* in a recent paper vigorously protests against the use of the name Gileichenites
in preference to Gleichenia. ‘The argument that some of the species originally included
by Gorrrert in Gileichenites are no longer regarded as true Ferns does not seem to be
a valid reason against the employment of that term. He adds, “ It is surely nothing
but a mental illusion to imagine that the use of an objectionable term like Gleichenites
indicates a conservation of judgment.” ‘There is no mental illusion underlying the
recognition of the fact that the Cretaceous fronds which afford evidence of soral characters
differ in certain important respects from any recent representatives of the genus
Gleichenia. Specimens referred by Berry to Gleichenia give no information on the
nature of the sporangia and thus lack a feature of some significance in the definition of
a genus. As a general rule, it is a sound principle to indicate, by the addition of the
termination ites, either our ignorance or the occurrence of some character in which a fossil
species differs from any existing type. (leichenites does not necessarily mean that
a plant so named differs in any essential respect from the recent genus ; it means that it
is not a recent species, and in the great majority of instances that our knowledge of the
sum of the characters is deficient.
