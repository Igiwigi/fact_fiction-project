The forced vibrations at any instant will clearly differ from the incident motion at
that instant by a numerical factor only.

The natural vibration, on the other hand, is compounded of members, whose phases
are practically fortuitous. This is easily seen as follows. The phase of natural
vibration aroused by the beginning of a new train depends upon the point of time
at which this event takes place. The difference of a fraction of a period in the
position of this point of time produces a finite change in the phase of the natural
vibration aroused. But, in building up the slowly varying vibration by means of
simple trains, the instant at which each start is, to a few periods, immaterial.

ยง 68. SELLMErER concludes from this that the natural vibration will be insignifi-
cant compared with the forced vibration. This mistake arises from the fact that

* Tt will be convenient to get rid of the endings of these trains. This we may do by supposing that a
train, once started, is unending ; and by introducing a train of equal amplitude and opposite phase, whose
beginning is so fixed as to extinguish the former train at the right moment. By this arrangement we shall
only have to deai with beginnings.

light. It is true that, on the average, the amplitude of the sum of a large number
of vectors of random phase is small compared with the sum of the amplitudes.
