Apart from these three post-partum animals no other parous animals, which
could be definitely identified as oestrous, were obtained.

Copulation normally precedes ovulation. All animals with recent corpora lutea
were pregnant with the single possible exception of S.4. It is remarkable, if
ovulation occurs spontaneously, that non-pregnant animals with corpora lutea in
the ovaries were not found. This and the occurrence of non-pregnant lactating
animals without corpora lutea in the ovaries, since such animals presumably had a
post-partum oestrus, suggests that ovulation may not be spontaneous.

The high rate of fertility, which results apparently in copulation being followed
by pregnancy in 100%, of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant
animals, with the possible but very doubtful exception of S. 4, were obtained. The
absence of such animals, however, clearly does not provide evidence that sterile
copulation would not result in pseudo-pregnancy, but merely indicates that sterile
copulation is extremely rare.

The fact that only 3 animals in post-partum cestrus were obtained as compared
to 53 parous pregnant animals, a ratio of 1 : 18, suggests that the duration of the
post-partum oestrus is approximately 1/18th of the period of gestation.
