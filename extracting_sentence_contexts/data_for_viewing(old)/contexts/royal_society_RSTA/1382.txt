algorithm. On a cropped four-dimensional dataset with only five channels and five vertical slices,
we present the spatio-spectral TV reconstructions for these algorithms with respect to the number
of epochs. One epoch is the expected number of iterations for the algorithm to have processed all
the data, i.e. all data subsets once. For PDHG, the full data are used in each iteration, so an epoch
here equals an iteration. On the other hand, for SPDHG an epoch is determined by the number of
data subsets. In our case, we use S = 10 data subsets with balanced sampling, which means that
on average half the iterations call the regularizer and in the other half one of the data subsets is
chosen with uniform probability. Hence, 20 iterations are required on average to process all the
10 data subsets, so an epoch for SPDHG equals 20 iterations.

We run PDHG for 2000 iterations = epochs and SPDHG for 1000 iterations = 50 epochs.
We observe that even after five epochs, a meaningful reconstruction is obtained using the
SPDHG algorithm, whereas in PDHG no structures of the rock are observed. In fact, the SPDHG
reconstruction after five epochs is visually closer to the PDHG reconstruction after 50 epochs. This
