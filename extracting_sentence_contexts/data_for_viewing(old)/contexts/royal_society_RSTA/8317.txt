Tf I, has a k-gonal Iq, II,,_,,, has an edge of length 2 cos 0, where 0, = x/k.
So, if 0,,1,1 refers to this edge, the cireum-radius of II,,_;,, is given by

2.82. oma = C08 0, cosec O,..1,1.

A glance at the diagram (Fig. 1 ; in which
O is the centre of II, AB an edge, and
Q the centre of the actual vertex figure fo [?m\
at A) reveals the fact that \
