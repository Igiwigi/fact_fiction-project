that the rise of the flowering-curve, beginning with the date of the first flower,
depends on the soil-temperature, which in Egypt is roughly synonymous with the
latitude, though the subsequent rate of the rise may be affected by soil-fertility.

These conclusions agree with practical experience up to a certain point, but they
offer no explanation of a fact which is common knowledge—to wit, that the Egyptian
crops, of some seasons are early, while others are late. It is not likely that there
should be any very striking difference in soil-fertility over all Egypt between one
season and the next, even in the event of an outbreak of cattle-plague. There must
consequently be some other operative cause, and this is very clearly indicated by our
data as being the available soil-water. We saw in figs. 4 and 5 that the Terraces at
Giza were “ late” in 1910, and later still in 1911, except at the wet end, and we
have discussed the determination of this delay by water-shortage on p. 184. It only
remains to notice how perfectly such delay may simulate real “lateness,” by com-
paring, in fig. 12, the two curves G.’10 and N.’13. A portion of G.’11 is plotted
for comparison, before its feeble rise has begun at all.

The idea of Pre-determination is very useful here. If the crop has been sown and
