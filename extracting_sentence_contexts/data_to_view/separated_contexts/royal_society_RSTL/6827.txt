38. Taking (z=0, y=0) and (2=0, w=0) for the equations of the two directrix
lines respectively, the equation of the scroll is

(*Lz, y)*(z, w)'=0. Quartic Scroll, Second Species, S'(1,, 1,, 4), with two double directris lines,
and with a double generator.

39, This 1s in fact a specialized form of the first species, the difference being that
there is a nodal (double) generator. Supposing as before that the equations of the
directrix lines are (p=0, y=0) and (2z=0, w=0) respectively ; let the equations of the
nodal generator be (z+y=0, z+w=0); then, observing that for the first species the
equation may be written (#XLz, y)*(z, z+0)*=0, it is clear that if the terms in 2? and
2(2z+w) are divisible by (x+y)* and (z+y) respectively, the surface will have as a new
double line the line (y+y=0, z+w=0), which will be a double generator; and we
thus arrive at the equation of the second species of quartic scrolls, viz. this is

((#+3)%, (v+9)(z, y), (z, 9 Lz, 2+0wY=0.
