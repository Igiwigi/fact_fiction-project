yet remain conjectural, though supported by very strong analogies. On the other
hand, its use in ensuring a supply of food to the animal cannot be questioned.

The structure and growth of the cells, and their connecting medium, offer many
interesting points for consideration. In the ramified and creeping species the cells
are connected by a cylindrical stem, which appears nearly homogeneous throughout,
and does not present that obvious distinction between hard and soft parts that is ob-
seryed in the stems of Sertularia. If, however, this stem be cut across, especially when
decomposition has commenced, a granular matter flows out, leaving the delicate
corneous sheath nearly empty. This corneous case of the stem is easily seen to be
continuous with the cells that arise from it, but the internal substance cannot be di-
stinctly traced to the animals as in Sertularia. It is probable, however, that it passes
gradually into the parietes of the body by which the cells are lined. With the facts
before us of the progressive growth of the stem, and the production from it of buds or
geminz, which gradually develop into mature animals, no doubt can be entertained
either as to the vitality of this part, or of the direct communication between it and
the young animals, at least up to the period at which they begin to emerge from
their cells and to seek nourishment for themselves. Nor is it reasonable to suppose
that this communication ever aſter ceases, for then it would be impossiþle to account
for the nutrition of the growing parts, and the combined operations by which the
regularity of growth of the whole is maintained, as exemplified in the ramified species
by the proportionate thickening of the stem to the number of branches which it has
to bear, and in the definite forms which each species assumes.

But it might be questioned whether the whole of the stock is a living part, or only
