TH is achieved when W = 85nm, that is exactly at the width at which there is a plasmon mode at
both the FF and TH. Importantly, from the results presented in figure 6, we find that the double
resonance condition is fulfilled when the graphene ribbons are in relative close proximity to their
nearest neighbours. Therefore, despite the fact that the excitation of localized surface plasmons
on the graphene ribbons plays the major role in the observed enhancement of the TH intensity,
the optical coupling between neighbouring ribbons and other diffractive effects could also affect
the optical response of the graphene structure. The conclusions valid for a periodic distribution of graphene ribbons also hold in the two-
dimensional case. To illustrate this, we calculated the linear and nonlinear optical response of a
two-dimensional array of square graphene patches with side length, W.
