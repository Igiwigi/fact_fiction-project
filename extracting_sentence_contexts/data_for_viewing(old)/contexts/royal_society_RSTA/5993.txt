Thus, a sufficiently large b(1) = B ensures an exponentially small &(1), which shows that we can
operate the system in the annealing regime, i.e. the regime where H,(s) interpolates smoothly
from X to Z. Recall that b(0)=1, so &(0) = Wg serves as a definition of @q- Let &(1)/aq =6 be
the desired precision. Then we can choose the remaining time-dependent control b(s) by solving
equation (5.26) for b(s) and setting &(s) = (1 — s + 5) (again compare equation (5.24) to equation
(5.19)). This, together with equation (5.25), fully defines the schedule.

This mathematical model in fact describes a family of qubits, different by wg, pi(1) and 5.
The family is spanned by varying the ratio Ey/Ec and B, in the region where both are >>1 to
ensure the applicability of equation (5.26) and the smallness of the precision parameter 5. Note
that in the Ej/Ec > 1 and B > 1 regime the aforementioned conditions wg < pl and wq < 4E La?
are automatically satisfied. Among the qubits in the family, a smaller @g/@p(1) will allow a
(relatively) faster anneal while the qubit approximation is maintained, but exactly how E)/Ec
and B (or equivalently wq/wpi(1) and 5) enter needs to be investigated via the adiabatic theorem,
which we will delay until we analyse a simpler CSFQ case below.

We have thus shown how to reduce the circuit Hamiltonian Hcy to an effective qubit
Hamiltonian Hg, and how the circuit control functions b(s) and f(s) relate to the effective qubit
annealing schedule functions &(s) and ¢(s).
