films we employ is almost always a horizontal circle. This is by no means the case
“with the boundary between the two black tints. Sometimes one completely encloses
a patch of the other, sometimes the line of separation is sinuous or stands higher at
one part of the film than at another. In some cases when no difference of hue was
observed, the passage of an electrical current through the film either created the
difference or enabled us to notice a boundary line which we had not before perceived.
Tt is a very curious fact that under such circumstances tiny white flecks appear in
the black along the boundary line between the two tints. Sometimes this line has
been observed before the passage of the current, sometimes it has not been noticed
auntil the flecks have drawn attention to its existence.
a These eye observations are confirmed by electrical measurements. It is indeed only
“Bn one fortunate occasion that we have been able to measure electrically the apparent
#hicknesses corresponding to the two black tints when exhibited by the same film.
Hoth hues were then seen and the line of demarcation was above the upper needle.
‘Phe thickness (measured electrically) of the part between the needles was 200 p.p.
When the line of separation was about half-way between the two needles, the thick-
