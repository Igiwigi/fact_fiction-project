The derivations based on the Feynman path integral bypass the conventional semiclassical
approximations and therefore allow us to introduce several rigorous statements. If the :8
Hamiltonian is up to quadratic and the perturbation up to linear, the dephasing representation is
(or phase averaging [15] or weighted average classical limit [31]) is exact. For example, for : a
displaced simple harmonic oscillators :

the dephasing representation is exact [15] if the classical trajectories are propagated with the
average Hamiltonian H since then the Hamiltonian difference (3.11) is indeed linear in Aq and 2s
Ap: Da

H"(x") — HQ) = Pap + kg(a + Aq). (42) 8

By contrast, the dephasing representation is not exact even in this simple system if H’ is used for thy
dynamics, as quadratic terms in both Aq and Ap appear: :3

H'(x") — H'(x)= mCP + Ap)Ap + ak2q + Aq)(a+ Aq). (4.3)

Similarly, the dephasing representation is not exact (in fact, breaks down rather severely) for
simple harmonic oscillators with different force constants,

as the perturbation is quadratic in Aq even if the average Hamiltonian is used for dynamics:

The last simple example provides a particularly bad scenario for the dephasing representation,
which can be remarkably accurate in much more complex, even chaotic systems such as the kicked
rotor. Unfortunately, undisplaced harmonic oscillators provide a good model for the ‘silent’
modes in electronic spectra, i.e. the modes which are not excited by the electronic transition, and
hence are not displaced, but may have a different force constant in the excited state. Especially in
large molecules, the majority of the modes are silent, but the dephasing representation produces
an artificially fast decay of fidelity amplitude [40], which in turn gives rise to artificially broadened
spectra, often to the point that any structure is lost.
