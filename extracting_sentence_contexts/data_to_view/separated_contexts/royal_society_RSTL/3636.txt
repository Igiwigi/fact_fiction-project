wholly washed away again from the surface between the fall of the water of one year
and the rise of the next, there must have been an accumulation from year to year. That the fertilizing effect of the inundation is exhausted, or nearly $0, is true ; but in a
country where there are no streams tributary to the main river, where rain is almost.
