observation that the vapours emitted by ice and by water both at 0°C. are of equal
tension, Drmargay|| has proved that in vacuo metals evaporate sensibly at lower:
temperatures than they do at the ordinary atmospheric pressure, and he suggests
that even metals of the platinum group will be found to be volatile at comparatively
low temperatures.
Thus he finds that cadmium volatilizes at 160°, zine at 184°, and lead and tin at
860°, and subsequently Sprine% (1894) demonstrated that zine is volatile at atmos-
pheric pressure at about 300°, cadmium at about 400°, while even copper is slightly
volatile at the latter temperature, f
Morssan** has stated quite recently that the vapour tension of solid silicon enables
it to unite with iron and chromium by true “cementation” at a temperature of 1200°,
which is much below the fusing point of these metals.
It must be borne in mind that the interesting facts recorded by the various expetin
menters whose names I have cited hardly come within the prevailing conditions in
