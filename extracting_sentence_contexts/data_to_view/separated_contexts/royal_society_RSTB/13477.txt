Members of one’s coalition supply more eyes and ears  &
for collecting information about the flaws and misdeeds of
competitors, more cognitive power for synthesizing, contex-
tualizing and analysing this information, and more routes
for disseminating it (see [23,28] for a detailed discussion). If coalitions indeed improve the collection, analysis and
dissemination of reputation-relevant information, then the
evolved psychology of reputational competition should be
sensitive to the quality of one’s own coalition and that of
one’s competitors: those with close, strong, high-quality
coalitions are more formidable in reputational contests than
those with low-quality coalitions. The studies presented here
aim to test our hypothesis that coalitions enhance not just
physical formidability, but also reputational formidability,
including that among women.
