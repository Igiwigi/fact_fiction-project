BMN derived the non-equilibrium equation of states during the FF, and showed the
fast-forward variants of Poisson’s adiabatic equation and Bernoulli’s formula. Confined to the
thermally isolated isentropic process and using the exact solution of the von Neumann equation,
statistical means of the quantal adiabatic and non-adiabatic forces are evaluated in both the


low-temperature quantum-mechanical and high temperature quasi-classical regimes. Reflecting
the fact that the fast-forward dynamics is population-preserving cooling or heating process, the
state variables such as the statistical mean of force, cavity size and effective temperature are
not quasi-static, but rapidly changing variables. BMN elucidated the quantum non-adiabatic
(QNAD) contributions to Poisson’s adiabatic equation and to Bernoulli’s formula. The QNAD
contributions are proportional to the acceleration of cavity size and square of its velocity, and
has coefficients dependent on temperature, gas density and cavity size.
