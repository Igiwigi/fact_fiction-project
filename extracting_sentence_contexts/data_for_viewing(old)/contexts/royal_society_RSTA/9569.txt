a special heating grid, and the electric power required to maintain a constant difference of temperature,
as measured by means of a pair of differential electric thermometers on each side of the heater, is
recorded.

of the wire an anemometer capable of giving an accurate measure of air-velocity
without reference to a calibration in terms of some other form of wind-measuring
instrument. The problem is analogous to the determination of the constants of
platinum wire for the purposes of thermometry ; in fact standard thermometer wire
is the most suitable for thé purpose of hot-wire anemometry in that its electrical
constants are usually determined with great accuracy.

The specifications described in the next section were carried out independently of
any previous work, and as they offer several distinct advantages with regard to the
construction of a practical standard of anemometry, it has been thought by the writer
worth while to describe them in some detail. The special type of instrument developed
may be called a linear anemometer consisting only of a single wire, and is especially
suited for the study of turbulent flow and the analysis of sharp gradients of velocity
such as are to be found in the neighbourhood of obstacles in streams, in jets, &c. The
advantage to be derived from the use of a single wire lies in the fact that it is
possible to measure with considerable accuracy the velocity in the neighbourhood of
