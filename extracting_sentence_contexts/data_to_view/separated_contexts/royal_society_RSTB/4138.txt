There is no
kinetonucleus. The cytoplasm often contains several ingested masses of food-material
or Bacteria (figs. 13, 14, 16), or else food-vacuoles (fig. 15). When one of these
coprozoic flagellates feeds usually in a holozoic manner, there is not the slightest
doubt about it ; the cytoplasmic contents, in stained preparations, reveal the fact. I have seen the later stages of binary fission occurring in the living individual and
have also obtained indications of the process in stained preparations. I have not yet
observed the earliest stages in the process and so cannot say whether the dividing
individual becomes first of all quite motionless for a short period.
