means it may well be reversed under a Republican administration.? The differences between
these respective pledges reflects the inherent asymmetry of the problem more generally. A global
agreement must resolve the fact that negotiating countries are at very different stages of
development, and that the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) will either require compensation
for stringent emissions reductions, or will only commit to mitigation once development has
taken place [11]. Optimistically positing significant Sino-US progress beyond their recent pledges,
world energy demand is still predicted to increase as incomes, not to mention populations, in
LDCs increase in the future [12,13]. For all of these reasons, adaptation is now an unavoidable
feature of the response to climate change, particularly in LDCs.
