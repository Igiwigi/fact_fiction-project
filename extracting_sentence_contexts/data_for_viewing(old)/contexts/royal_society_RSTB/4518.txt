In Experiments 3 and 6 we analysed the urine passed just before the experiment
began, and that passed just after it terminated, for lactic acid by Ryrrerâ€™s method,*
and found in the second sample no more lactic acid than the trace found in the first.
Our determinations of lactic acid were not made with the greatest care in these
experiments, and the results given in Tables II-VI should be regarded as approxi-
mate: the trace of lactic acid found in the normal resting urine is referred to as
negative in these Tables.

The actual identification of lactic acid in the urine is, however, probably too coarse
a method to adopt if the production of lactie acid is small, for lactic acid might get
destroyed in whole or part before it could be excreted by the kidneys, and Ryrren
shows in fact that after severe exercise, excess of lactic acid in the urine disappears
more rapidly than does that in the blood.

Far the most delicate test for the lowering of the alkalinity of the blood owing to
deficiency of oxygen or production of lactic acid is to be found in the reaction of the
respiratory centre. Douaias and Hatpans (loc. cit.) showed that if the alveolar CO,
pressure is determined at intervals whilst resting after the stop of some severe
muscular work, it shows a characteristic fall to a value much below normal, followed
by a slow recovery, indicating that the threshold stimulating value of CO, on the
respiratory centre has been temporarily lowered by the exercise. This reaction is,
however, absent after gentle or moderate exercise, the threshold value after the
exercise being the same as it was before.
