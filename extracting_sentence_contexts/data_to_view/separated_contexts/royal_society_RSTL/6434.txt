2. At the time that that paper was written, I believed that the photographic effects
produced by the electric spectra of all the metals furnished results in a great degree
smilar to each other, if not actually identical. This, it will be seen from subsequent
statements, is correct 80 far as the fact of the similarity in this portion of the spectra is
concerned, but is erroneous as regards the general conclusion deduced from it. During
the past winter I have renewed these experiments, substituting a quartz-train for glass
and bisulphide of carbon, and have chiefly used a fine quartz prism, kindly lent to me by
my friend Mr. Gas81or. The refracting-angle of this prism is about 60*; its faces are
about 2 inches long and 14 inch broad, and are s0 cut as to furnish a singly refracted
beam for the medium rays, by transmitting it along the axis of the crystal.
