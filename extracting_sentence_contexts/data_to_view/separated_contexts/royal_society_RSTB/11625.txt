However, if the focus is on conservation
of a landscape and other grassland-associated taxa, such as
plants, birds and arthropods, the dominant species of herbi-
vore may be less important. Unfortunately, the debate of the
introduction of native versus domestic herbivores becomes
constrained by cultural and logistical perspectives based on
an incomplete understanding of the factors that influence the
effects of grazing (figure 3). Conservation groups, agencies
and private land-owners have biases towards native or dom-
estic herbivores despite the fact that studies have
demonstrated that similar responses in biodiversity can be
achieved by cattle and bison as long as both species are
allowed to interact with heterogeneous fire patterns [12,33]. A focus on a dominant herbivore may also ignore the
importance of secondary herbivores that may have much
different impacts on landscapes because of differing foraging
behaviours. Diverse herbivores can alter the impacts on
woody plant encroachment and plant diversity because of
diverse foraging behaviour [34].
