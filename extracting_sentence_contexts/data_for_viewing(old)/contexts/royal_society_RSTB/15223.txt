key role in the evolution of terrestrial vertebrates. first seems to depend on the position of the food in the


mouth after ingestion. It further appears that transport and
processing behaviours generally alternate in salamanders,
which process food depending on its location in the oral
cavity, its processing state, and the presence or absence of
struggling motions. Despite comprehensive research on
intraoral food transport in salamanders, a detailed descrip-
tion of transport is complicated by the fact that (i) many of
these studies were based on the erroneous assumption that
food size does not matter and (ii) transport mechanisms
cannot always be clearly disambiguated from processing
mechanisms [73,74]. The latter can be because during the
intended transport of food items, these might be damagedâ€”
or the foods might be moved across the oral cavity during
intended processing behaviours. Since neither the damage
inflicted on prey nor its passage through the oral cavity can
be exclusively attributed to food processing or food transport,
these behaviours might be regarded as the two extremes of a
continuum. However, our method of implying behavioural
intentions based on the direction of the food movement and
