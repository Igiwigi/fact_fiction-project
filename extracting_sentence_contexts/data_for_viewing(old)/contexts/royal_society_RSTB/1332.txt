division of the nucleus. In the first section both divisions of the nucleus (which I
pri distinguish as right and left) are seen united by a constricted portion, and the right
vision appears larger than the left. In the next section a similar appearance is
nted, but now the left is larger than the right. In the third section the left half
© appears. The nucleoli and the inter-nucleolar substance present exactly the
‘ppearance as in nuclei which are not undergoing division.

It may, I think, be taken as a fact that the nuclei of the microspheric form ing
in number during the earlier stages of growth by simple division.

Dispersal of Nuclear Substance.—Besides the round or oval nuclei, there are
generally present in the protoplasm irregular strands of red-stained substance. The
may be small and few in number, or they may be so large and abundant that

stained masses. In sections these strands are frequently seen to be continuous wit
the nuclei (fig. 12).
In some specimens (fig. 6, « and b) the nuclei furthest removed from the centre presen
the rounded shape above described, several of them being disposed in pairs as thoug!
recently divided, but as the series of chambers is followed toward the centre the nue
assume an irregular shape, and the red-stained strands appear in the protoplasm abou
