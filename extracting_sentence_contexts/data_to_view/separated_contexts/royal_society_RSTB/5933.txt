These latter are so close set that the
cytotrophoblastic extensions can readily join with each other so as to form a continuous
layer of varying thickness, the cells of which intermingle with those of the compact
zone along their line of junction. In this way there is produced a well-defined composite
zone (Pl. 19, fig. 107, 27) underlying the peripheral syncytium which varies in its
detailed characters in the different species, and which, once established, persists in a
readily recognisable, though more or less degenerate, condition through the later
stages, right up to the full-term placenta, whereas only remnants of it are described
as persisting in later stages of the human placenta. In this connection it may be recalled (for the fact is well known) that in the human
placenta of such a stage as that represented in Pl. 19, fig. 106 (foetus, G.L. 29 mm.),
the cytotrophoblast of the greatly-reduced “ cell-columns ” of the attaching villi may
be found spreading out on the surface of the decidua basalis, round their bases of attach-
ment, in the form of irregularly ring-shaped zones which thin out peripherally. Such
isolated areas of cytotrophoblast are no doubt to be regarded as remnants of the
trophoblastic “shell” of earlier stages, that “shell” itself being represented in the
Catarrhine placenta by the cytotrophoblastic layer of the “ penetration” or
“ junctional ” zone (chorio-basalis).’

Finally, as concerns the relations of the villous branches to each other, it has been
shown by several observers in recent years, first by CoveNrRy (’23) in 1923 inthe placenta
of Cynocephalus [Papio| papio (foetus, C.R.L. 122 mm.), then by Grosser ('25, ’27)
in 1925, in the shed placenta of Cercopithecus (?) and by WisLock1 (’29, p. 64) in placentas
of Colobus abyssinicus caudatus (fcetus, C.R.L. 143 mm.), C. abyssinicus ituricus
(foetus, C.R.L. 134 m.m), and the Macaque (foetus, C.R.L. 163 mm.), that the villi in
