arose from a primate and simpler set of mortuary behaviours.
Palaeolithic archaeology should provide the only means of test-
ing hypotheses about the growing elaboration of chemical and
emotional responses to death through the processes of rational-
ization and enculturation. Given the renewed interest in
undertaking in the insect and animal world [12], should we
archaeologists not try to nuance our understanding of early
human morbidity and necrology, asking questions of relevance
not only to human evolution but to the wider animal kingdom?

We have interpreted the Palaeolithic record in relatively sim-
plistic terms, notably looking for evidence of burial, a practice
that was in fact remarkably rare, even taking issues of taphon-
omy and sampling into account. We have also tended to
exaggerate its importance; we would do well to remember
that early observations of insect necrophoresis lead to the con-
clusion that ants worshipped their dead and created cemeteries
for them [20]. Instead, we need to ask exactly why cannibalism,
curation of corpses, disposal of them in areas of ‘discard’, or
burial, and the persistence of such practices were important,
and what purpose they served to their social groups. If there
is one practice that is special, and apparently unique to later
Homo, | would argue that it is not burial per se, but the cultural
delineation of specific areas for the disposal of the dead; the
creation of landscapes of the dead.
