Comparing these deflections with those obtained with diamagnetic bodies, we see
that they are in the opposite direction. With the direct current a change from posi-
tion 1 to 3 is followed, in the case of diamagnetic bodies, by a motion from higher to
lower numbers; while in the present instance the motion is from lower numbers to
higher. In the former case the north poles of the astatic magnet are attracted, in
the latter they are repelled. We also sce that a direct current acting on diamagnetic
bodies produces the same deflection as a reverse current on magnetic ones. Thus, as
we promised at a former page, the opposite polarities of diamagnetic and magnetic
bodies are transferred from the region of deduction to that of fact.
