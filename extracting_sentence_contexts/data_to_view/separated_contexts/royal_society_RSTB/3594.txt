Figs. 21-24 give some of these forms as they appear in stained preparations. They
always lie right up against the peritrophic membrane. Now, there is little doubt from
the fact that these forms can be seen in live films to be caused by the fusion of soft,
rather unhealthy-looking trypanosomes under the unfavourable condition obtaining
on the slide, that many of these appearances are cases of degeneration. Nevertheless,
this is no proof that all the multiple individuals are degeneration products, to be
dismissed without further consideration, I have not been able to get any evidence
that the multiple forms play any progressive or essential part whatsoever in the
cycle. They must, however, always be borne in mind, as these appearances may
afford an unfortunate mask, obscuring the process of conjugation.
