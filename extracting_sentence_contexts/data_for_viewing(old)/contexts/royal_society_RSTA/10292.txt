*22-74, As XVII Hp R, an axiom of continuity will be wanted.

Note.—The above axioms are all axioms of geometry, in the sense of “ geometry”
as defined in the sense definition of it given in Part I. (i.). But geometry in this
Concept V. includes more than does geometry in Concept I. For in Concept I.
geometry has only to do with points, punctual lines, and punctual planes; but in
Concept V. geometry has, in addition, to consider the relation of the objective reals
(which are all “linear”) and of interpoints to the above entities. In this respect,
geometry in Concept V. merges into physics more than does geometry in Concept I.
Thus the excess of the number of axioms in Concept V. over the number in
Concept I. arises from the fact that there is a larger field to be covered. Also,
T Hp R is not required in the geometrical reasoning.

*25. Preliminary Propositions.

*25°11. Proposition.—Assuming (II-VI) Hp R, all the propositions of the theory
of interpoints (cf. *1) hold of the interpoints of this Concept.

*25°12. Proposition.—Assuming (IL—VI.) Hp R, if ¢ be an instant of time, then
Oy possesses at least four members. In symbols,
