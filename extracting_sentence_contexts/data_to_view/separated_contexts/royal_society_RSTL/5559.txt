898 MR. C. DE MORGAN ON THE STRUCTURE AND

While no doubt the hairs have other and mechanical offices to fulfil, it would be
difficult to 8nggest any use besides that of ministering to sensation which could demand
their close and direct union with the living neryous and vascular membrane. This view derives great support from the fact of the existence of a structure within
the claw of the larger crustaceans, which, 80 far as the author can learn, has not hitherto
been described. It is generally stated that the claw is entirely filled with the muscular apparatus
belonging to it, but this is by no means the case. Neither the moveable piece or index,
nor the part of the tarsus which it opposes, the pollex, contain any muscular tissue.
