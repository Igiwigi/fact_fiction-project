246 MR. G. T. BENNETT ON THE RESIDUES OF POWERS OF NUMBERS

PART IL—ON THE RESIDUES OF POWERS OF NUMBERS FOR ANY MODULUS,
COMPOSITE AND COMPLEX.

In order to maintain as far as possible the parallelism of Parts I. and II. a number
of facts and relations peculiar to complex numbers are noted (most without proof) in
the following Preface to Part II.

Prerace To Part II.

Complex primes.—i.c., numbers either real or complex which have no real or complex
factors.
These are of two kinds

(i.) Real primes of the form 4% + 3; e.g. 3, 7, 11, 19,...
(ii.) The factors of real primes of the form 4k + 1, which are expressible as the
sum of two squares, ¢.g., 1 + 27,2 +7, 3+ 27,2+4 37... Among the last
