In the Water
Cube, self-cleaning materials were used to cover the water bubble design. However, nothing
about the objects from living nature that inspired these materials can be said to inspire anything
else about the design. In fact, at best, this building could be said to fall into inspiration from non-
living nature, or, more properly, mimicry of non-living nature. For the Grange Audubon Society,
many wonderful environmental principles were incorporated, from materials to landscape. However, there is no biologically derived inspiration that drives the design or creates a cohesive
whole out of the kit of parts.
