'This experiment enables us to see clearly the canse of a class of decompositions very
analogous to it, and which have presented similar theoretical difficulties. An alloy
of platinum and silver will dissolve in nitric acid, which will not act upon the plati-
num alone; acids will, in like manner, dissolve the alloy of copper and zinc}, which
on the copper alone have no action. Now the hydruret of copper is itself, in its che-
mical relations, an alloy, and the action of the acid on the alloy of copper and zine is
a fact very analogous to the action of the hydrochloric acid upon this body, and the
explanation of this fact involves similar phenomena ; thus—

the polar composition of the hydrogen being essential to the comprehension of the
experiment. A further confirmation of this view is found in the decomposition by
water of the remarkable bodies discovered by FRrankLanDy, to which he has given
the names of zinc-methyl and zinc-ethyl. The theoretical analogy of these bodies to
the hydrogen compounds of the metal is perfect, and with water they give a precisely
similar reaction to that of the hydruret of copper with hydrochloric acid. Zinc-ethy],
