= 155. I shall now briefly refer to two questions which have some connexion with the
= abstract solution of the optimum size-density distribution discussed in the previous section.
€ The first is the problem of zoning. It will be noticed that throughout the discussion given
8 above it has been tacitly assumed that the number as well as the demarcation of different
8 zones have been settled beforehand. The underlying principle is simple. Obviously the area
z must be divided into zones (that is, the number as well as the shape and size of each zone
© must be decided) in such a way that, at any given level of cost, the final estimate would be
obtained with minimum error; or alternatively, for any assigned level of error, the work
would be done at minimum cost. The solution in any particular case would depend on the
nature of the physical field and would involve not merely the cost and variance functions
but also a knowledge of the contour levels of the variate over the whole area as well as the
randomness or degree of non-randomuness of different regions. In fact, the question of

zoning falls under what has been called the third type of problem, namely, “mapping

surveys’, further consideration of which must be postponed until certain investigations are

completed.
* [Footnote added in proof on 24 July 1944.] Since writing this present paper in November 1942 a good deal of
work has been done in the Calcutta Statistical Laboratory on the theory of multi-stage sampling, giving it

a concrete basis which will be discussed in other papers.
