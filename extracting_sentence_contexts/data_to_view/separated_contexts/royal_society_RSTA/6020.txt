This indicates a high level of symmetry in the state right
before the quantum phase transition, namely, that the single-spin distributions of concurrence
may be very similar for all spins in the chain when appropriately rescaled; this is indeed
confirmed in figure 3d. From the network point of view, this suggests that the weights can
be written as w= cj; for some local variables {a;}: in such a case, the weights of the links
intersecting node i rescaled by their mean value, s;/dj, are oi (Cigi @1/di) =(N — 1)aj/ Digi ay
(N — 1)oy/ >) a7, hence approximately independent of i. In fact, in the k = 1 concurrence network,
aj = 2 sin(iz/(N + 1))/V/N +1. As the magnetic field is decreased (and k increases), we observe the appearance of k—1
peaks in the disparity, signalling a local increase in the heterogeneity of pairwise concurrence for
centrally located spins. A close inspection of the plots also shows that the outermost (and highest)
peaks in Yj; correspond to the outermost (and lowest) minima in the strength s;, which presents
k peaks.
