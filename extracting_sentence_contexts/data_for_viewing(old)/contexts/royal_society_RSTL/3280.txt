OF ALL THE PHENOMENA OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 103

power in itself could be conceived capable of producing this effect, the de-
ductions above made, although they would have stood incontrovertible, yet
the causes of them would have remained inexplicable, but for the important
discoyery of Mr. OgrsTED, which threw a new light upon magnetic investi-
gations.

This philosopher discovered that a wire conducting an electric current was,
during the interyal of transmission, in a state of magnetic induction. Such a
discovery, at such a time, was most fortunate ; and not on this point only, but
on various others, it excited the attention of all the most distinguished philo-
sophers of Europe. The number of interesting facts which were thus elicited
will always form a prominent feature in the scientific history of the nineteenth
century, but the greater part of them are unconnected with the present inquiry;
I shall therefore only refer to one or two, which have an important bearing
upon the question under investigation. As 80on as I was informed of this
interesting discovery, I was anxious, by experiments as nearly similar, as cir-
cumstances would admit, to those I had adopted with the iron ball, to elicit in
this case also the laws which govern the reciprocal action of the wire and the
needle; and after a pretty long series of experiments I arrived at this conclu-

*'That the force of each particle in the wire on each particle of the needle
varies inyersely as the square of the distance, and that the nature of the force
