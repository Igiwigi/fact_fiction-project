in M. Zertier’s Memoir (loc. cit., p. 28). Its organization agrees well wii
S. cuneifolium and S. Dawsoni. The other fragment has been inte
M. Renavutr as demonstrating the heterospory of Sphenophyllum.t M. Z
pointed out that in this specimen the sporangia were certainly borne on pei
(loc. cit., p. 34). His interpretation of the supposed macrosporangium is di
from that of M. Renauur. M. ZerLuer regards the “ macrospore ” as being in wali
a part of the sporangial wall, while the supposed wall of the macrosporangium
in his opinion, to the pedicel. One of us (D. H. Scorr) was enabled .
M. Renavut’s kindness, to examine the specimen in question, and was di i
accept M, ZerLuer’s interpretation. ‘

Although we cannot regard the evidence derived from this specimen (
imperfectly preserved) as by any means sufficient to establish the fact of hetero:
yet we fully allow the possibility that heterosporous species of Sphenophyllun
have existed. That both heterosporous and homosporous species may occ
the limits of a single genus, is sufficiently proved by the case of Calamos

The morphology of the strobilus of Sphenophyllum cannot be fully ini
until the true homologies of the sporangiophores are established. Four vie
