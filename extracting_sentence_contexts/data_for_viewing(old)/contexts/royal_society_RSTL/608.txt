the same temperature, would emit, if painted, or blackened in
the smoke of a lamp or candle, I was desirous of finding out,
whether the frigorific rays from cold bodies are affected in the
same manner, by the same means, and in the same degree.

It was to ascertain that point, that the experiment No. 20 was
made: and, although the result of that experiment afforded
abundant reason to conclude, that those substances which, when
hot, throw off calorific rays in the greatest abundance, actually
throw off great quantities of frigorific rays, when they are cold;
yet, as the relative quantities of these rays could not be exactly
determined by that experiment, in order to ascertain s0 import
ant a fact, I had recourse to the following simple contrivance.

Exper. No. 24. Having found, by the result of the last ex-
periment, (No. 23,) that the calorific emanations of a circular
disk of polished brass, g inches in diameter, at the temperature
of 112? F., were just counterbalanced by the frigorific emana-
tions of an equal disk of the same polished metal, at the tem-
perature of g2* F. placed opposite to it, 80 that one of the balls
of the thermoscope placed between these two disks, at equal
distances, was just as much heated by the one as it was cooled
by the-other, I now blackened the two disks, by holding them
over the flame of a wax candle, and repeated the experiment
with them, so blackened:
