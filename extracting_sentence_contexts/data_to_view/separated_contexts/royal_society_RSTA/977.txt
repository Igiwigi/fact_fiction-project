As the box size increases, the differences for these weakly bound states will be smaller. =
The number of solutions will formally be equal to the number of basis functions used; however, :8
we will only need to consider solutions with energies close to the scattering energy (often just : =
above the dissociation energy of the reactant channel). 1S
The Bloch terms and finite region introduce substantial requirements for the basis set, which Do
must now ideally consist of basis functions with finite domain in three non-orthogonal scattering 7
coordinates rg, rB and rs, with tractable resulting integrals. Furthermore, for each scattering : N
boundary, at least one basis function must have a non-zero value but zero derivatives. The [8
zero-derivative boundary condition introduced by necessity by the Bloch operator is a non- :3
trivial and not often understood condition that has become obvious in our considerations of
wave functions for RmatReact but has been obscured in electron—molecule collision problems
due to their far inferior basis sets: this fact is demonstrated in a simple system in appendix A. These multiple boundary conditions are unusual and non-trivial constraints on the design of the
basis set that are not yet fully understood, and will be the most challenging part of using the
RmatReact methodology for reactive collisions. We will thus defer its consideration to §3.
