during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. These areas were: (i) the ‘boning hall’ which experienced higher
transmission and had a measured ACH ~ 0.4-0.5; and (ii) the ‘abattoir’ which experienced lower
levels of transmission and had a measured ACH ~* 8. Ou et al. [13] measured the ventilation rates
in two buses with slightly different secondary infection rates after an infected index case travelled
in them: (i) 7/46 (15%) passengers tested positive after travelling in bus B1 which had a ventilation
rate of 1.7217? per person and (ii) 2/17 (12%) passengers were infected after travelling in bus B2
which had a ventilation rate of 3.221s~! per person. In both of these studies, the measurements
showed that the setting with increased ventilation had lower transmission. However, there were
confounding factors that reduce confidence in this conclusion. Most importantly, Walshe et al.
[12] noted that in addition to the different ventilation rates in the boning hall and abattoir, the
occupancy rates were also different, with higher transmission also being associated with the
higher occupancy area (see §3b). Therefore, the study in fact showed that the combination of
improved ventilation and lower occupancy was associated with lower transmission. This limits
the quantification of the effect of ventilation alone.

In two of the other studies which showed decreased transmission with increased ventilation : 3S
