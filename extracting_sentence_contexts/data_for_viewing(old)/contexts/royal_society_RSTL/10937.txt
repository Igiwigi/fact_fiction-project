respectively components ; X, j., v, &c., being the letters placed alongside of the plain
lines if we employ the graphical method of sec. 64. In some cases it will not be
necessary to employ specitic letters to represent the units, they may be represented
by the spaces between the letters representing the unified pairs, e.g., we may represenb
the chain given above thus aXuvpe, where only the terminal units are given. If we
have a\pype and amoe, we 8ee that the two units a, e are connected by the two
different chains Nuvp and To.

220. We may have equations such as

Mwvp=nro =,

denoting the fact that the three chains Xpyp, To, « can have the same terminals, and
we may write a chain such as Auppy for shortness ApS, and similarly in other cages.

221. We may employ as the symbol to be attached to the barbed line of sec. 218
in accordance with the method of sec. 64 the symbol 1. An equation such as Muv=1
will then show that the chain Xpy on the left hand side of the equation is closed.

Groups— Circuits.

222, Any single 8b which is 8uch that each component unit is unique with respect
to each of the others, may be termed a group.
223, The single system A of unified aspects of any system (sec. 185) is a group, as
each unified aspect is unique with respect to each of the others.
