Such a basis, however, would be of no practical significance, as it would certainly not
convey all the information regarding the concomitants.

The situation is restored by the restriction that all ground forms and all concomitants of
the basis shall be expressed as Clebsch forms. For any given algebraic form there is one and
only one equivalent Clebsch form. A concomitant is said to be reducible only if the equi-
valent Clebsch form is expressible as a polynomial in the Clebsch forms of the basis without
polarization.

A Clebsch form is a form in which the tensor of variables is a Clebsch tensor as previously
defined. These have the fundamental property that the product of two simple Clebsch
forms is a simple Clebsch form, a fact which follows immediately from the corresponding
property of Clebsch variable tensors.

With this restriction the basis of a given set of ground forms is obviously unique, save
that to each irreducible concomitant may be added any polynomial in the irreducible con-
comitants of lower degree provided that the degree in the coefficients of each ground form,
and also the type, i.e. the partition with which it is associated, is the same as for the irre-
ducible concomitant.

If the basis of a given set of ground forms is known, and also the syzygies, i.e. the algebraic
relations which are satisfied by the concomitants of the basis, then a complete knowledge of
all the concomitants follows.
