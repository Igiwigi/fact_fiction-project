servation. 'The star 37 Tauri had © nearly the colour of Mars” whilst in contact with

subsequently to occultation by the planet. The facts are different ;—are they

March, © the five-feet Equatorial was placed upon Mars, in order to compare
its colour with that of 37 Tauri; the star and planet were still in the field to-
gether, though nearly at opposite points of its circumference.
