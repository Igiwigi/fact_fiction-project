When o = y, (11.2) becomes ¢, = &;,

where the a,, are power series in (s — v) vanishing with (« — v), the coefficients being
Laurent series in ye”. These must, of course, form a Hamiltonian set, so that, for
example, @;; = — @22, and we remember that p/o = A/v. We search for a linear combination

where the «, are arbitrary constants. Solutions for the 1, having the required periodicity

any other possible choice of p, ¢.g., » ==, will be equivalent to one of the above, since
the exponents of the solution (11.1) are by their nature indeterminate to an integral
multiple of c.
