circular plates or parallelograms, in which the area of one plate, was double of the
other, the lengths of the latter being in the ratio of 2 : 1, the respective intensities
were found to be very nearly in an invyerse ratio of the areas; a somewhat remarkable
fact.

58. We may conclude from these phenomena, that the intensity does not vary in
an inverse ratio of the square of the surface, according to the general law (16.), ex-
cept when the areas are 80 disposed ; that the whole perimeter of the various plates,
is as the respective surfaces ; a result which applies also to cylindrical conductors, the
electrical capacities of these being the same as the plane areas, into which we may
conceive them to be expanded (54.).

59. The curious fact, that the capacity of a sphere or cylinder is the same as that
of the plane area into which it may be supposed to be rectified, seems to afford some
new views in electricity. We find in the case of electricity accumulated on a hollow
sphere, that a conducting substance, insulated and placed entirely within the sphere,
remains in a neutral state; from which it has been inferred that the charge resides
only on the exterior snrface. Now the intensity of a sphere being the same as that,
of a plane circle of equal area, it should follow that the distribution is in each
alike, since it is difficult, from any known fact, to suppose a given quantity of electri-
city expanded over twice the surface, as may be inferred in the latter case, and yet
maintain the same intensity : the redundant electricity, therefore, if the above deduc-
tion be true, should be also disposed on one side of the plate only, notwithstanding
that it may be determined to either when operated upon by a neutral body.
