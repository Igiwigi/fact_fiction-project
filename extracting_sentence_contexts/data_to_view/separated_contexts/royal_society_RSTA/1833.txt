If, moreover, / is the distance of the centre of gravity from the base in inches, then
(2.22) 1 = 4-727-40-1172. The altered position of the centre of gravity can therefore be recovered by
calculation, if the altered value of B. can be deduced from the observations. This is,
in fact, the case (see ยง 4.1), so that even for shells of type IL. the dynamical constants
of the shells after firing are satisfactorily certain. ยง 2.3.
