Hence the least stable and most soluble of the unstable solids
should appear first. Ostwald’s rule, however, was shown not to be true by the investigations
of Young and Burke (1906) in the system sodium thiosulphate-water. It is probable that an improved version of Ostwald’s rule could be sustained in which the
guiding factor would not be the metastable solubilities which are, in fact, equilibrium
figures, but ‘supersolubilities’, a supersolubility being defined loosely as the concentration
at which the probability of nucleus formation becomes ‘high’. For a summary of views on
the subject of labile regions and supersolubility see Clark et al. (1944). Miers & Isaac (1909)
were able to plot experimental supersolubility curves for the three forms of monochloracetic
acid in water or naphthalene under conditions of roughly comparable agitation, but it was
never certain that a given form would crystallize when it was expected.
