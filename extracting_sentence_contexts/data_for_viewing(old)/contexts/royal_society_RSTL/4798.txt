Turning from the flat Plagiostomes to the Sharks, we find that their osseous struc- |
tures are essentially the same as amongst the Rays, though presenting numerous i
minor modifications, both in their modes of development and in the forms which I

their osseous centra ultimately assume.

The common Picked Dogfish (Spinaz acanthias, Cuv.) presents one of the simplest
types, and is one which can be s$tudied with facility owing to the readiness with which
examples can be obtained in different stages of their growth. The small plates with
which the surfaces of the cartilages are covered, are not above one-fifth or one-sixth
the size of those seen in the Ray, and are consequently more numerous in the same
area; in other respects they closely resemble them. Mr. Mi1uLas has already pointed
out the fact that the ossified centrum of the vertebra of the Dogfish is shaped like a
hour-glass*. It is in fact an osseous cylinder, constricted in its centre and 8ur-
rounding the canal of the chorda. If a vertebra be taken from a very young Dog-fish,
and a section of it be prepared in the direction of that of the Ray (fig. 28), viz.
vertically, midway between the two concave extremities, we shall perceive that the
canal of the chorda dorsalis is surrounded by a very narrow ring of bone. Between
the inner surface of this ring and the fibrous membrane lining the canal, there exists
a considerable interval which is occupied by cartilage, in which the cells are uniformly |
diffased, excepting in the immediate vicinity of the bone, where they exhibit a slight
disposition to assnme a concentric arrangement, External to the osseous ring is the
great bulk of the cartilage forming the vertebra. In that portion of it which sur-
rounds the bone, the cells are arranged with great regularity in lines running from
the ring towards the periphery. In the more external portions this radiated disposi- |
