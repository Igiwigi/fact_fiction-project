Tnow turn to another fact. When the autumn has well adyanced here, there springs

up from the plain country, stretching away SE. and 8:W..by W., a kind of haze which
becomes visible at.sunset, and which grows day by day in height until it attains to
perhaps 3” or more aboye the horizon; this haze, moreover, grows denser daily, until at
last it is sufficiently opaque to obscure the sun's rays. I need not in this place enter
into the causes which produce this haze; it is sufficient to remark here that I have
noticed it year after year, and from its opacity and-its formation occurring just before
winter, I always call it © the winter bank;” indeed I remember talking about ,it one
evening with the late Archdeacon Prarr, who also had noticed-it, -in connexion with
8ome other fact. Now this haze bank practically compelled the 8un to set whenever

the latter sank behind the former; s0 that in the first autumn of my observations the
appearance of the haze obliged me to close work for the season. Subsequently it
occurred to me that the gradual growth in height of this haze gave me exactly the very
test T required, viz. sunset varying one day with another from a depression of 13* to af
altitude of ome 34%, Accordingly I watched the corresponding effect on the air-lines,
and found beyond all question that as the bank rose and the corresponding swnset
occurred higher, the variable and air-lines all disappeared, each in its turn.
