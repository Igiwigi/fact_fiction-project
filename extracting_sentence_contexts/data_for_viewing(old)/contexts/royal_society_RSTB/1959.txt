The experiments made upon the influence of alterations of density of the water
upon the plants have yielded some interesting results. These may be summarized as
follows :â€”

1. Gradual concentration of the water causes plasmolysis. This does not kill the
plant; if it continues, a new wall is produced within the old one, and growth
still goes on, for a time at least.

2. If sea-water of normal density is now used to replace concentrated sea-water
a rapid swelling results, followed by a bursting of the wall and extrusion of
contents. This sudden restoration of normal density seems to be far more
injurious to the plants than a slow concentration, and this may perhaps
account for the fact that Pelvetia refuses to grow in rock pools. We find
that the germlings grow for a long time in sea-water which is allowed to
partly evaporate, and if the diminution of density is brought about slowly,
the plants continue to grow.

As regards the zones inhabited by the different species of Fucus, these remain on
the whole fairly constant under normal conditions, but they are not rigidly fixed ;
the environment, however, may produce modifications and deviations from the more
usual arrangements.
