Thus we see that whereas in combination with a lead-off from the mouth the only
unfavourable extremity is the right arm, this is the only favourable one in combination
with a lead-off from the rectum; likewise, any one of the three other extremities
constitutes a favourable combination with a lead-off from the mouth, and an unfavour-
able combination with a lead-off from the rectum. The reason is obvious: the mouth
is a point b, the rectum is a point a; the mouth and rectum series of combinations
with other points @ or b are consequently the counterparts of each other.

The logical completeness of these experimental facts is further borne out by :—

1. Observations on Quadrupeds.
2. Observations upon two cases of situs viscerum inversus.

1. Observations on Quadrupeds.—The asymmetry in the distribution of potential
in the Human body originating from the heart is not found in Quadrupeds so far as
I have examined them. On Cats, for instance (post mortem, but of course only
during the continuance of cardiac contractions), the following combinations were found
to be favourable :—

Mouth and either posterior extremity ;
Eye and either posterior extremity ;
