80% r.u. had a slight desiccating influence on X. astia larvae, as their development
was significantly longer than at 90% R.H.

One notes that the drying effect of 50% r.u. on the larvae of X. cheopis and X. brasiliensis
(tables 23, 24) was less at 27 than at 22° C; this humidity is fairly close to the critical limit
of these species, as the growth rate was also greatly influenced by the degree of moisture in
the food and sand mixture. In the first experiment with X. cheopis at 50° R.H. and 27° C
the mixture was comparatively dry, as it had been brought into equilibrium with the air;
these conditions produced a high larval mortality. Larvae that were strong enough to
adapt themselves to this very low humidity dragged on, lived longer and grew into adults.
In the second experiment the mixture had been exposed to 80% r.u. for 3 days, and its
initial moisture was comparatively high; consequently, there was a significantly higher
proportion of development at 50% R.H. with 27° C. The fact that larval and cocoon life
was much longer in the first experiment than in the second (the differences are highly
significant) indicates that the developmental rate is influenced greatly by the loss of water
which rat-flea larvae suffer in their early life, especially within the first few days. Similarly,
in the first experiment with X. brasiliensis at 50% R.H. with 27° C, having a low initial
moisture in the food, there was a significantly poor success in development, when compared
with the second experiment in which the initial moisture in the food was a little higher.
Death occurred in all the developmental stages from a first larval instar to an advanced
pupa in both these experiments; this shows that 50° r.H. has a uniformly adverse effect
on all stages of X. brasiliensis. The combined larval and pupal life of both species at this
