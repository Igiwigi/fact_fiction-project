10 per cent. potassium ferricyanide se .. 7 drops.

This solution requires to be changed frequently, as it rapidly becomes inactive.

After differentiation, the strips must be washed in distilled water for 30 to 60 minutes
before grading up through the alcohols. Dehydrate in absolute alcohol, clear in oil of
cloves or xylol, and mount in Canada balsam.

GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE ENTERIC PLEXUSES.

The general appearance of the enteric plexuses after silver impregnation is shown in
figs. 1 and 2 (Plate 26). In their gross structure, the myenteric and sub-mucous plexuses
agree in the fact that they consist of groups of nerve cells connected together by fibre-
bundles, the fibres of which are both intrinsic and extrinsic in origin. The extrinsic
(vagal) fibres which run in the fibre bundles end in relation to the nerve cells, and the
processes of these latter, either as axones, convey the impulses to the muscle and glands,
or as dendrites, terminate as receptive endings in relation to nerve cells in other ganglia
of the plexus,

The two plexuses differ, however, in their detailed characters and more particularly in
the form of their ganglia and in the variety and size of their constituent neurones. In
MEIssNER’s plexus, the ganglia are thin and flattened (fig. 4, Plate 26) and the cells
are closely grouped together in a single layer; in AverRBacH’s plexus, the ganglia
(fig. 3, Plate 26) are thicker and more massive and the cells lie superimposed on
each other.
