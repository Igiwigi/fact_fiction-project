present method of detecting comparatively small differences in order of intensity—
as estimated by ordinary and very unsensitive methods—it would have been
impossible to interpret this phenomenon as part of a general effect extending
throughout the spectrum, and an effect which must be fund: amental to any theory of
the origin of spectra.
There remains the Principal series of Parhelium, whose members in the range
examined are \A5015 and 3965. The same phenomenon is shown, for the former is
reduced in the bulb to ,%, and the latter has the same intensity in both cases.

It is, therefore, a general fact that, without exception, the energy in the bulb
spectrum has been transferred towards the members of higher term number in all the
component series—provided, as later investigation shows, that the effect is not due to
a mere change in the energy distribution within the lines.

The Helium Spectrum from the Capillary with a Condensed Discharge.—
On Plate 3 is shown the wedge photograph of the Helium spectrum from the
capillary produced by means of a powerful condensed discharge with a spark-gap in
the circuit, and for comparison, the ordinary spectrum developed on the same plate.
The quantitative analysis follows the same method as in the last section, and the
results for one plate are exhibited in the table below. On this particular enlargement
the full length of the wedge was 35 mm.
