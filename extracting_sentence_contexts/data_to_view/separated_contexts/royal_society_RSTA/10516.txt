BEAM OF RECTANGULAR CROSS-SECTION UNDER ANY SYSTEM OF LOAD. 131

but if we put in these values and then proceed to make @ infinite, certain parts of
the expressions for U and V do not give finite integrals in the limit. This is due to the fact that the conditions of rigid equilibrium require shears
Lb/2a at the two ends (fig. viii.). Fig. viii

These shears Lb/2a will produce a deflection due to bending alone, which,
calculated from the Euler-Bernoulli formula, comes to

and when « is made very large, this gives
3L 2 /1 |
V=7(-+—5—)........ (104)

for the bending deflection produced by the end shears at large distances w, which,
however, are still finite compared with a. If, therefore, we allow the beam to bend
freely under these end loads, in such a way that each of these produces its proper
bending deflection and no more, the constant A must be adjusted so that, for large
values of «, V tends to the value (104).
