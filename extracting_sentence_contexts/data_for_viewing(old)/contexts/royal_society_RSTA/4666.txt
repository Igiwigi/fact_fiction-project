the Sunda arc in figure 5 is of particular concern given that, to the south of the 2005 Nias rupture,
the 2007 Bengkulu sequence has failed to release the full strain accumulated since the great 1833
earthquake [95], resulting in a seismic gap that is widely expected to rupture through a great
earthquake in the next years to decades, bearing catastrophic tsunami hazard, especially for the
city of Padang with a population of 1 million [121,122].

(e) Summary

At least one positive conclusion can be drawn from the examination of the 16 post-Sumatra
tsunamis. The considerable progress in science, instrumentation and simulation capabilities, as

well as in hazard awareness, over the past 10 years has led to a much better control of the far : =
field: this is best illustrated by the fact that, to our knowledge, tsunamis have inflicted only three : Sy
casualties in the far field (generally defined as beyond 1000 km of the epicentre), two of the victims a

Our main area of repeated failure remains the problem of ‘tsunami earthquakes’. Because of
their extreme low-frequency spectrum, these events are weakly, if at all, felt by the populations
at risk, thus negating the concept of ‘the shaking is the warning’, which otherwise stands
out as a most efficient means of saving lives. In this respect, we must accept that we did
