G. SEELEY ON THE STRUCTURE, ORGANIZATION,

circumstance that teeth occur upon the bones of the palate in Procolophon, and that
the vomera meet the pterygoid bones with the palatines external to them in the same
relative positions as in my restoration of Protorosaurus (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ B., vol.
178 (1887), p. 205), would prepare me to find other points of correspondence in the
skulls of those types, while the fact that the Anomodonts occur in the Permian
rocks of France and Russia makes an affinity with that type less improbable in the
Thiiringerwald Saurians. Comparison of the Anomodontia with the Saurischia. The skeleton is imperfectly known in the Saurischia in details of structure ; but the
following resemblances may have value as showing affinity.
