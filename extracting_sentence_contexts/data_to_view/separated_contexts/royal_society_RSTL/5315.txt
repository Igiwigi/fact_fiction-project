Some observations made on the compara-
tive loss of weight of the outer and inner membrane haye not, however, shown any
remarkable difference. But this again may arise from the great proportion of the
loss in both membranes being due to the ordinary solvent action of water alone, and
the operative solvent action of the osmotic salt being comparatively minute in
amount; or it may depend, and Iam most inclined at present to take this view, upon
the chemical actions being of a different kind on the two sides of the membrane, and
not upon the inequality simply of one kind of action. Such a supposition was
suggested by the fact, which will immediately appear, that osmotic activity and easy
decomposition are properties often found together in binary compounds. The basic
and acid agents then developed are both capable of acting upon albuminous septa. We may imagine, for instance, in the osmotic action of a neutral salt, the formation
within the thickness of the septum of a polar circle, one segment of which (composed
of the binary molecules of the salt) presents a basic molecule to the albumen at the
inner surface of the septum, and an acid molecule to the albumen at the outer surface,
the circle being completed through the substance of the Septum which forms the
second 8egment.
