curve of frequency, 7.¢., LAPLACE’s curve of errors. The barometric frequency curve
is, however, a marked exception to this rule. The mean barometric height is
very far from coinciding with the ‘mode’ or height of maximum frequency. While
barometric frequency curves are remarkably smooth when a very large number of
observations are dealt with, the distribution of frequency does not obey the normal
law,* but some other law which up to the present has not been fully discussed.

In a memoir published in the ‘ Phil. Trans.,’ A, vol. 186, pp. 343-414, a series of
generalised frequency curves are introduced, and it is shown, pp. 851 and 382, that
the asymmetry of the barometric frequency curve can probably be dealt with by one
or other of these generalised curves.

The importance of this conclusion lies in the fact that the distribution of
barometric frequency in any locality can then be fully described by the statement
of the values of three or four well defined constants.

* This seems first to have beon pointed out by Dr. Veny, in a letter to ‘ Nature,’ September 1, 1887,
