obtained on the previous occasion.

In the case of D and H, the variation in the mid-monthly values in Table IV,
seems altogether too regular to be ascribed to chance, and even in I and V something —
more than chance seems involved. It must be allowed, however, that in these last
two elements the value for March stands out in a way one can hardly suppose to be —
truly representative of Nature, and in the case of V, the tendency to negative values
in the latter half of the year, and the apparent jump from December to January, are
somewhat suggestive of an under-estimate of the true secular change.

§ 12. One possibility to which attention should be drawn is that an annual
inequality may be in no way ascribable to errors of observation, or of estimation of
the secular change, and yet be absolutely fictitious so far as terrestrial magnetism is
concerned, For example, if the distant mark used in absolute observations of D
shifted in any way dependent on the temperature of the air, or on the temperature
or moisture of the soil, an apparent annual inequality would ensue. A similar result
would happen in the case of H if the law of variation with temperature in the
moment of inertia of the collimator magnet were wrongly assumed, In the present
ease I have applied an elaborate check—whose description would take me too far
afield—caleulated to disclose any appreciable uncorrected effect of temperature on
absolute observations of H, and the conclusion it led to was that if any such effect
existed it was small compared to the range found for the annual inequality. It is
also noteworthy that in all the elements the beginning of the month data indicate a
large semi-annual term in the annual inequality, which is not what one would expect
to find if the true cause of the phenomena were moisture or temperature.
