360. Fairfield Smith refers to two papers of J. A. Harris (1914, 1920) in which he had
demonstrated that ‘a hypothesis of zero correlation between adjacent areas cannot be
regarded as probable’ (p. 2). In fact, Harris appears to have proposed using the intra-class
correlation coefficient of yields from adjacent areas as a coefficient of heterogeneity (p. 3). 361. It would be seen that the basic ideas underlying Fairfield Smith’s work are similar
to those adopted in the present paper, although the actual spheres of application are
widely different.
