Finally, upon introducing the temperature-scaled field and elasticity parameters § = wH/T and
B =K/2T and defining the viscosities ratio as q = n/nn So that B=p0+ q), the obtained set
of equations takes the form

(we +1) (e = 5400 (1-@) +PXz, X=(Qxe),

(ms, +P +8) 0%) = FU (2 eX: — 1) + BQ x Xz) + 2c),
(~ xt 3) (2- 3) =#01e — €2) + 2B (e2X2),

(3 +34 ’) (e:Xz) = sf (ex(e2 — 1) + (1 — 2e2X.)) + Blex(Q x X)z + X2) + 3(e2 — 1). Appendix B

Coefficient A is determined by a formula derived on the basis of classical electrodynamics of
dielectric media as [35]:

(iy — 1¢)°(Nx — Nz)
[nz + (13 m@)Nsllng + (1 — mp)Nz]

(B1)

where nm, and ny are the refraction indices of the particle substance and the carrier fluid,
respectively; we set here that both media are optically isotropic. Whereas for the carrier medium
this is an evident assumption, for a ferrite like magnetite or maghemite this is justified by the
fact that either oF those has. a cubic crystalline lattice. According to the standard electrodynamic
conventions, ny =€p and n2= = ef are the dielectric permeabilities of the respective media at the
frequency of light. Factors Nz and Ny in formula (B 2) are the components of demagnetizing tensor
of a spheroidal particle along its major (z) and minor (x) axes.
