This application of ICTs can result in an overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
more than seven times the emissions of the ICT equipment itself. Thus a significant net gain
is possible. This relies on the premise that additional economic growth and other stimulating
factors from ICTs do not have an opposite effect. In general, however, the energy efficiency of
developed economies has been improving steadily throughout the period since the Internet was
introduced [4]. Furthermore, older network equipment is very inefficient and therefore in the near
term significant reductions in energy use are often seen as older equipment is retired. Notably,
optical systems are a small fraction of the energy use of communication networks compared
with electronic access equipment, wireless networks and packet switches. Thus, from an overall
network energy-use perspective, optical equipment is not significant today and may contribute
to improved network efficiency through greater use. Expanded use together with exponential
growth, however, will quickly become a problem if the energy efficiency does not scale with this
growth. In fact widespread use in general is likely to be problematic if further energy reductions
are not realized.

A high-performance optical transceiver today requires more than 100 W, which cannot be
supported in most computing or edge applications [13]. Figure 1 depicts the evolution of the
