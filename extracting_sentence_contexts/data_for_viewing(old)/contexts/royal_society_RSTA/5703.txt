We selected data for France, Spain and Italy among the countries covered by the Facebook
Data-For-Good Initiative, because in these countries the data included periods preceding the
first epidemic wave. We estimated that the data includes 4.9% of France’ population, 5.3% of
Italy’s population and 4.1% of Spain’s population. These numbers are estimated by computing
the number of individuals in each time window, then averaging across all time windows, then
dividing by the population in each country.

(iii) Data pre-processing

We pre-processed the data as follows. First, for each day t, we normalized the mobility flows
from a given origin 0 to a given destination d, dividing by the population of the origin city 0. This
transformation ensures that our description captures the number of trips per individual, and it
is not strongly biased towards large cities. In fact, non-negative matrix factorization techniques
are very sensitive to outliers. In line with previous literature [32,33], we transformed the data to
reduce heterogeneity and limit the effect of outliers. By comparing the log-transformation and
the square-root transformation (see electronic supplementary material, figure S2), we found the
results of the two are comparable, but the latter yielded the most interpretable results. Thus, for
any given day f, and any pair of cities i= (0, d), we pre-processed the data as follows:
