rounded by ducts; for the firm oblong, parenchymatous cells of this cord have the
ducts scattered pretty regularly through its substance, Plate XX. figs. 11, 12.

From the researches of M. Tzzcur, already referred to, it appears that the structure
Sf the yascular bundles is similar in that plant, as is also the Monocotyledonous cha-
Sacter of their arrangement.

Z In conelusion, it may be stated that so far as the general arrangement of the

Structure of the stem is concerned, Fictoria, like Nuphar, would appear to afford
evidence in favour of that view which regards the Nympheaacez as Monocotyledons.

She main difference, in fact the only one, from the rhizomes of plants of that class,
& far as I have examined them, lies in what I believe to be unimportant points,

-Hamely, the absence of the fibrous layer between the cortical and central substances,

And the composition of the yascular bundles exclusively of ducts of the unrollable

Api ral fibres.
