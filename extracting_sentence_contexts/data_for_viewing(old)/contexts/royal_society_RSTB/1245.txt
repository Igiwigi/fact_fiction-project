3. The first appearance of the synangium is as an upgrowth of superficial ¢
the adaxial face, immediately below the apex of the sporangiophore; cells
abaxial side also grow strongly, while the apex itself does not grow ; so thi
organic apex is soon sunk in the groove between these stronger growths.

4, The superficial cells of the adaxial surface, which are to form the synat
undergo periclinal and anticlinal divisions, so as to form about four layers; from’
are differentiated : (a) two sporogenous masses, (b) a septum between them, (
superficial wall.

5. The limits of the sporogenous masses are difficult to define ; this is owing
fact that there is no definite tapetum, while many of the cells of the sporog
tissue also become disorganized without undergoing the tetrad division.

6. The tissue of the septum is similar, as regards origin, to the sporogenous mé
it is therefore possible to regard it as a sterilized portion of a potential archespe

7. The lateral leaf-lobes begin to be formed almost simultaneously wi
synangium.

8. In synangia of abnormally simple form the septum may be partially or
pletely abortive,

9. The tissue which normally develops as the septum, may on occasions deve
