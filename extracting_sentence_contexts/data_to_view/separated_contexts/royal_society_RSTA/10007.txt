In spite of this large magnification the resulting lines are fairly regular, a fact which
bears eloquent testimony to the excellence of workmanship and definiteness of

behaviour of the instrument. The perfection of the arrangements for reading the
scale are also of a high order, seeing that 1 millim. on the ordinates of the curves
corresponds to a length of less than 1 micron (z/g5 millim.) on the scale, and the
regularity of the curves shows that the scale can be read to an accuracy of this order
under favourable conditions.

From the curves it will be seen that with no current through the coils, or with
normal current through both sets, the drift was comparatively small, amounting in
the worst case to only 0°15 division (0°014 millim.) in five complete periods.
