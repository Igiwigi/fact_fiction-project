Again the want of correspondence is less striking at high than at low temperatures.
Lastly, it is possible to test equation (4), viz, y,v,*/T, = yyv,'/T) The same
mperatures have been chosen, and the data are the same as those given above.
he results are :—

erential equation is a faulty one, and contrary to fact. The equation which he
duees from his differential equation, viz. :—

yo! = 0'227 (T — T’),*

e Tis the temperature at which yvt = 0 (i.e., the critical temperature), and T’
» temperature at which the observation is made, is identical with the first equation
don p. 647, viz., yo! = «r, and obviously does not hold.

* The coefficient, 0'227, is expressed in milligrammes per square millimetre.
