PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY OF THE MAMMALIAN HEART. 213

stimulated to a series of maximal contractions by single induction shocks, care
being taken to prevent the muscle being stretched by the weight when in a relaxed
condition. In both cases the shortening in full contraction will be diminished. It
will be sufficient for our purpose in the meantime to insist upon the fact that with
increase of aortic pressure there is, other things being equal, an increase in the amount
of residual blood, There is, however, no resulting diminution of the output of the
heart within normal limits. The ventricle is so easily distensible in the relaxed condition
that it can receive, in most cases, the same amount of blood, in a given time, as
before, in addition to the residual blood which remains over at the end of each beat,
so that the ventricle comtains at the beginning of systole a quantity of blood equal
to what would otherwise have entered it from the pulmonary veins, plus the residual
blood. The amount of residual blood is, of course, always increased, also, whenever, the
aortic pressure remaining constant, the force of the ventricular contractions is
reduced from malnutrition or other cause.
