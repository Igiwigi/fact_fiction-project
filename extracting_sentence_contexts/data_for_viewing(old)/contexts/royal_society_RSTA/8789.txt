viscous drag of layers of water which move parallel to the bottom of the sea. The
assumption that tidal currents move in laminar motion is so opposed to ordinary
observation of the surface of the sea in a tideway that I felt certain, on reading the
paper, that if some other metliod could be found, which did not depend on any special
assumptions as to the nature of the motion, it would be found that Mr. Srreet’s
estimate of the dissipation is very much too small.

This view is strengthened by the consideration that Rrynoups’ criterion? of
stability would lead us to expect that eddies would form in any stream of sea-water
flowing at a speed of 1 knot or more, when the depth is greater than some quantity
of the order of magnitude of 1 or 2 cm. Since the mean depth of the Irish Sea is
over 40 fathoms, mathematical considerations alone would lead us to suspect the
existence of the eddies, which can in fact be seen marking the surface of the sea in
places where the current runs exceptionally strongly, or over a particularly uneven
bottom. Several of these places are marked as “ripples” on the chart of the Irish
Sea, the sheet of water to which Mr. Srreer applied his calculations.

Dissipation of Energy in Tidal Currents.

The mechanism by means of which energy is dissipated in a tidal current by
friction on the bottom must be similar to the mechanism by which the energy of a
river is dissipated by friction on its bed, and also to the mechanism by which the
energy of the wind is dissipated by friction on the ground. The amount of friction
in both these cases is known. It can in both cases be expressed by a term of the
form F, the skin-friction per square centimetre, which is equal to KpV*, where p is
