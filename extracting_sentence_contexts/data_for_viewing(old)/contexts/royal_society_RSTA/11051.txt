§ 23. Table XV. shows the excess of observed over calculated values at Katharinen-
burg; it answers to Table VIII. for Pawlowsk.

The results for the diurnal inequalities in D, H, and I in Table XV. are similar to
the corresponding “all” day results in Table VIII., but on the whole show a slightly
less close agreement between theory and observation. In V, however, the agreement
is distinctly better at Katharinenburg than at Pawlowsk.

In the case of the absolute daily range the agreement between observed and
calculated values is particularly good in D, and it is closer in all the elements than at
Pawlowsk. This may be ascribed to the fact that magnetic disturbances are larger
at Pawlowsk than at Katharinenburg.

The difference between the observed and calculated values in the monthly range
is somewhat large, and there is now clear indication that sun-spot frequency is not
by itself a sufficient guide. The observed values in 1893 are conspicuously below,
and those in 1892 and 1894 conspicuously above, the calculated. The deficiency in
the observed values in 1895 and the excess in 1898 are also marked. [Even in the
absolute daily range in Table XV. there is a distinct depression in the observed
values in 1893 and corresponding enhancement in 1892, though not to the same
extent as in the corresponding case at Pawlowsk (see Table VIII).
