insects; these always have the largest respiratory organs, and breathe the greatest,
quantity of air. In the terrestrial insects the amount of heat is greatest in those which
have the largest respiratory organs, and breathe the greatest quantity of air, whatever
be the condition of their neryous system. In the larya state the respiratory organs
are smaller than in the perfect insect, compared with the size of the body, and the
larva, we have seen, has the lowest temperature.‚Äù But in these comparisons we must
observe that the activity of respiration is equal in the individuals which are compared.
Thus although the respiratory organs are larger in the pupa than in the larya, the phy-
8lological condition of the insect is lower, its respiration is inactive. These facts, it
will be een, are all in strict accordance with each other, and point to the chemical
changes in the air during respiration as the immediate source of animal heat. But it
may be matter of inquiry how it is that the heat evolved within the body of the insect,
during respiration, becomes evident 80 rapidly. This, it may be urged, tends to show
that it results from the influence of the neryous system. But when we remember
that in insects the circulatory vessels are in close and most extensive communication
with the respiratory organs over the whole body of the individual, and that, unlike
the vessels in those vertebrated warm-blooded animals which have extensive respira-
tion, they are neither strictly venous nor arterial, but probably intermediate between
the two, may it not arise from only a very s8mall amount of heat evolved at each re-
spiration becoming latent, while nearly the whole becomes free, and is liberated as
quickly as produced, and that this is the occasion of the temperature of the insect
