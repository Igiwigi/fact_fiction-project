These results, taken in conjunction with those of Bower, make it.
extremely probable that the same phenomenon is displayed by every living cell
whatsoever,

In attempting to explain these appearances which accompany plasmolysis one has
only hypothesis to offer. Bower * suggests two views—(1) that the main mass of
protoplasm on retreating may leave the cell-wall still completely lined with a thin
film of protoplasm ; (2) that the peripheral part of the protoplasm being entangled
as a network among the deposited microsomata may, on the contraction of the main
mass, be drawn out at the points of entanglement into fine strings like those observed ;
while the surface of the wall is left free, and not covered by a film of protoplasm. But it seems to me that all the above phenomena may be explained from the mere
fact that the cell-wall is 80 perfectly wetted (to use a physical phrase) by the
protoplasm ; for as STRASBURGER'S  results how, the connexion between the cell-wall
and the protoplasm is one of the most intimate deseription, even if any direct
perforation of the cell-wall by protoplasmic filaments be left out of the question. The very same effects may be obtained with stringy mucus adhering to a glass
tumbler. My results have certainly 8ghown that the connexion between protoplasm
and cell-wall is much closer than was imagined to be the case ; but I am inclined to
doubt whether the existence of protoplasmic threads in the cell-wall at all influences the
phenomenon of plasmolysis, for they are equally well displayed over the whole surface
of the wall, and bear no relation even to s8uch pits as those occurring in the young
endosperm cells of Archontophenis and Rhopalostylis, where well pronounced
continuity is known to occur.
