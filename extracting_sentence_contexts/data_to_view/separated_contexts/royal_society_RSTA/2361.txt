However,
the most commonly understood effect in the rubric of the wide range of researchers who study
porous media is associated with interfacial curvature, discussed in the following paragraph. Within a tortuous medium (such as a soil) containing water, scientists have long known that
capillarity underlies the distribution of liquid [8], whereas the underlying physics of this catch-
all phrase involves a complex confluence of interfacial curvature and long-range intermolecular
forces [9]. An emphasis of relevance to this meeting is the fact that a ‘sub-freezing’ water-filled
porous media is a multiphase system with a rich fluid mechanics tied uniquely to interfacial
thermodynamics [4]. Clearly, in a confined medium a solid—liquid phase boundary may be curved, in which case, as
originally explained by William Thomson, the material will melt at a lower temperature than the
bulk substance, due to the combination of surface curvature and surface energy [1]. This shift, now
referred to as the Gibbs-Thomson Effect, has been studied with a variety of substances dispersed
on inert substrates or confined in porous media.
