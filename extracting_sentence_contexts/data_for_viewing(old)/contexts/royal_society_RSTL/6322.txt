according to the analogy of the facts which have been determined by observation of the
living animals of the allied type Rotalia, we seem almost indubitably led to the con-
clusion that the canal-system is specially destined for the formation and maintenance of
the © supplemental skeleton ;” serving to convey prolongations of the sarcode-body from
the segments which occupy the chambers, through the thick layer of solid shell-substance
that is secondarily formed around those chambers, and through the prolongations of
that layer which constitute the spines; and further, that it maintains a tolerably direct
communication between even the innermost chambers of the spire and the external
surface,—a connexion which would have been cut off by the interposition of the
< supplemental skeleton,” had not this been provided with some such system of inter-
vening canals.

207. One more fact remains to be noticed, which is of much interest as showing that
the growth of the spire and that of the © supplemental skeleton” are to a certain extent
independent of each other:—TI refer to the departure from the regular form that
frequently shows itself in the later turns of the spire, which (s0 to speak) often * run
