large left allantoic vein and is therefore homologous with the ductus venous Arantii of
man (text-figs. 3 and 4). In Stage IT (G.L. 6-8 mm.) the cranial anastomosis passes over without distinction into
the sinus venosus (text-fig. 2), and is indistinguishable from the latter except for the
fact that its cavity is invaded by hepatic tissue. As development proceeds, the ductus
venous Arantii develops, and is continued cranially by a vessel which receives the efferent
hepatic veins and emerges from the liver to open into the sinus venosus. This vessel is
the vena hepatica revehens communis of HocusTetrer, but in Perameles it already forms
the continuation of the postcaval vein and may therefore be termed the proximal section
of that vein from the beginning (text-fig. 3).
