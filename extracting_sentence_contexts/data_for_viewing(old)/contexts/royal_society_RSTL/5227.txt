DR. TYNDALL ON MOLECULAR INFLUENCES, 231

those which are best calculated to avert such changes. It is yet to be estimated
what influence the extreme non-conductibility of muscular tissue exerts in producing
the remarkable constancy of temperature observed in the human body in different
climates. The cuticle is an exceedingly bad conductor, and this explains the insen-
sibility to heat of hands on which the skin has been thickened by exposure. Probably
many escapes from the fiery ordeal, which have been hitherto referred to collusion,
might be scientifically explained by reference to this fact. While studying at Mar-
burg, I have sometimes heard Professor Buxsztn make a good-humoured remark on
the tenderness of his pupils' fingers. Accustomed as he was to the manipulation of
the glass used in his admirable eudiometrical researches, his fingers had acquired an
insensibility to heat sufficient to carry him safely through an ordeal which, in other
cases, would undoubtedly invoke the judicial condemnation of the middle ages. The
experiments of CHanTREy and BLacpen are often referred to as illustrations of the
surprisingly high temperature to which the human body may for a short time be
exposed without injury. These experimenters owed their safety to two things,â€”to the
non-conductibility of their tissues, and the non-conductibility of the air in contact
with them. Were either of these materials changed, the experiments could not have
been made. If air were a good conductor, and parted with its heat readily, their
hands and faces would have shared the fate of the beefsteak and eggs which were
