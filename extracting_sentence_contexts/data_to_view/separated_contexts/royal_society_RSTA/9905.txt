The cells so formed
were not constant, and their E.M.F.’s were low. In 1904 we attempted in a similar
way to produce cadmium cells, but it was evident that normal mercurous sulphate was
not formed, as the resulting salt was highly coloured ; it was sometimes yellow, but
more often green. The fact that the depolariser in some of our anomalous cells has,
after a long period, turned a yellowish-green suggested to us that its formation might
be accelerated by small charging currents. The constancy of other cells subject to
the same treatment is certainly against such a view, but a slight difference in the
original composition of the depolarisers might account for the more rapid change. To test this point, we placed a normal cell in circuit with, but in opposition to, two
Leclanché cells for 18 hours.
