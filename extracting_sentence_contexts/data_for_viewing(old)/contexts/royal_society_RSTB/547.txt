ave less rich than the prairie lands, for the most part found in the valleys or on the
plains. Taking the vast areas of fertile natural prairie on the American continent, for
example, sometimes of several feet in depth, it may be estimated that, in such cases,
each foot of depth will contain from 6000 to 10,000 lbs., or even more, of combined
nitrogen per acre (= 6720 to 11,200 kilog. per hectare); and the probable time of
these accumulations entirely obviates the necessity of calling in the aid of the free
nitrogen of the atmosphere, brought into combination either under the influence of
the plants themselves or of micro-organisms within the soil.

Further, the history of agriculture so far as it is known, indicates that soils under
cultivation without supplies by manure from external sources, do, as a matter of
fact, gradually become less fertile. This, as a rule, will take place more rapidly
in undulating or high forest lands, than in the natural grass or prairie lands of
the plains.

Again, if we compare the amount of nitrogen in the surface soil of permanent grass
land, with that of adjoining land of the same original character, but which has for
some time been under arable culture, we find that the latter is much poorer in
nitrogen. In illustration, it may be stated that whilst the surface soil of the grass
land at Rothamsted contains from 0째25 to 0째30 per cent. of nitrogen, that of the
corresponding arable land only contains from 0째1 to 0째15 per cent. The arable soil
has, in fact, originally been covered with natural vegetation of some kind, with
comparatively little removal, and consequent accumulation ; whilst, under arable
culture, much of the accumulated nitrogen has been used up, and the loss has not
