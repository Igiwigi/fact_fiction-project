ON THE MODULUS OF TORSIONAL RIGIDITY OF METAL WIRES. 45

The numbers in the above table show considerable discrepancies in the value
found for the rigidity modulus of any one substance by different observers. In
many cases this is no doubt due to want of purity and to imperfect annealing of the
specimens used, also perhaps in some cases to the fact, that the wire was subjected to
excessive tension during the rigidity determinations. Owing to the fact that different observers have expressed the variation of rigidity
with temperature by different formulz (already quoted in Part I. of this paper), it is
not easy to give a comparison of their results. It appeared to be best to calculate in
each case the average decrease in rigidity per 1° C. rise of temperature per unit
value of the modulus over the temperature 0° C. to 100° C., this being the most
generally employed range of temperatures. In order to obtain numbers from the
present research to compare with those of other observers, a temperature coefficient
was calculated for each wire from the last set of observations at 100° C., and at the
ordinary laboratory temperature, assuming the rate of alteration of rigidity with
temperature to be constant in the interval.
