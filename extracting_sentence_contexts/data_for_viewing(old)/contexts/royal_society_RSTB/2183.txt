I have previously shown, in connection with a study of ether and chloroform, that
these vapours more or less permanently abolish the response—chloroform more

cation to which I have referred, and the fact itself is mentioned here solely in order
to emphasise the physiological nature of the phenomena under study.

§ 8. The Three Stages.

With lapse of time, or immediately in consequence of partial injury (¢.¢., of a more
or less violent disturbance), the character of the response alters its type.
Conformably with the classification of nerve-effects in three stages, I distinguish
for the eyeball (i.c., the retina) three states or stages—(1) fresh, (2) transitional,
(3) stale. And whereas in the case of nerve aroused to action by electrical stimu-
lation the distinguishing feature of the first state is a negative response, and in
the third state a positive response, in the case of the retina aroused to action by
