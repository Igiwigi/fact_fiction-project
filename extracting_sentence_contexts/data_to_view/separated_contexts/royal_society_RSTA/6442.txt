Note that,
assuming no load is applied to the structure (p; = 0,p2 = 0), we obtain the dispersion relation

gl 4 RLF 0. (3.5)

In the case where the master body is continuous, whereas the attached structure is discrete, as
shown for example in figure 1, we have

pLFd = GhFa pha _ QlFd) and QlFd = xe(yLFa _ ulFd) (3.6)

where the discrete transform of the continuous function u is (with attached structure support
x=an,n=0,+1,...)

00
uF (y, t) = > u™(an,s) (3.7)
n=—00
It follows that
LFd LFd.,LEd
x, — xGrrPu
QlFd _ Pz 0 , (3.8)

and equations (3.4) become
GEE yLF — plF 4 plPd ylfd___plfdyLPd , (LP, Lr

with ira _ _* ~—, MiMi a °°)

Thus, we have coupled both the continuous and discrete Fourier transforms. A procedure for
continuing with such a coupling is given in Slepyan [39]. Specifically, the combined expressions
(3.9) can be reduced to a single discrete transform via the following fact. If a function fF (k)
represents the product of the continuous gt (k) and the discrete hF4(k) transforms,

fF =F nF) and Fa (: + =) =h*4(k), (3.10)

then the corresponding discrete transform of f (an) is
