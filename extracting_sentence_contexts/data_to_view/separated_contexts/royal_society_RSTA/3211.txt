However, the restriction to ¢* potentials is arbitrary; neither formal renormalizability
arguments nor experimental data serve to justify such a limitation. As a simple generalization,
let us consider the next higher-order operator in the potential ~ A3,,¢°. In fact, many further
operators can be (and have been) studied; see, e.g., [30,31] for higher-order fermionic operators
or [32] for mixed operators. The present simple ¢° example suffices to illustrate an important
point here. The stability criterion 42,, > 0 of the gt potentials can, of course, be alleviated by an
inclusion of a coupling 43,4 > 0.
