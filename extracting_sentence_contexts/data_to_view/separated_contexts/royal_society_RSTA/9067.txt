Even when they are
produced by similar methods by different observers—as, for instance, by Eper and
Vaenta, and by Exner and Hascurk—there will be found a large number in one
not included in the other and vice versd. It is even questionable whether it is
possible to draw a distinct and definite line of demarcation between the two, e.g., in
the cases of Cu and Ba, to take two instances ; the are spectra—with very numerous
lines—in many respects have analogies with those of the spark. But very little is
known as to the structure of the latter, beyond the fact that in some of them sets of
lines with the same frequency differences are met with. The present communication is
an attempt to throw some light on this question. The material at disposal is so vast that it is necessary to limit the discussion to a
few elements, and even in them to restrict it to certain relations only.
