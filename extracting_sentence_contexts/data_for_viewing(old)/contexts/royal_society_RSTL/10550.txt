Festuca loliacea, which is hardly more than a variety of F. pratensis, has only been
found in the samples from two plots, and, like Festuca elatior, in quite insignificant
quantity.

As compared with Festuca ovina, which is one of the most prevalent grasses on the
plots, F. pratensis is rapidly and greatly diminishing. This may possibly arise from
the fact that 7. pratensis is not 80 hardy as F. ovind, is less sturdy in habit, has a less
branched root-growth, fewer stolons, a greater evaporating surface from its broader
leaves, which, together with its less extensive root-development, may afford a reason
why F. pratensis does not resist drought 80 well as . ovind.

Bromus mollis.

This grass is annual or biennial ; all the other grasses on the plots being perennial,
Its roots are stiff, wiry, not much branched, but sometimes very deeply penetrating.
On plot 14 (nitrate and mineral), the roots were discovered at a depth of 4 to 5 feet,
having losb their wiriness and become fleshy. Small tubers were also observed on the
root-fibres at the depth of 9 inches, and more ; the tubers measuring sometimes as
much as a quarter of an inch in length. The culms are 1 to 3 feet high, and generally
