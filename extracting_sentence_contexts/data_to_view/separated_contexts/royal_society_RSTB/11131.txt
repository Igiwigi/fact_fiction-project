Not surprisingly, the answers have turned out
to be far more complex than originally imagined, and we are
discovering that the phenotypic diversity of life on Earth is mir-
rored by an equal diversity of hereditary processes at the
molecular level. This lies at the heart of modern day epigen-
etics, which is classically defined as the study of heritable
changes in phenotype that occur without an underlying
change in genome sequence. The central dogma’s focus on
genes obscures the fact that much of the genome does not
code for genes and indeed such regions were derogatively
lumped together as ‘junk DNA’. In fact, these non-coding
regions increase in proportion as we climb up the evolutionary
tree and clearly play a critical role in defining what makes us
human compared with other species. Another key point in
the post-genomic world is the dynamism of genetic material.
