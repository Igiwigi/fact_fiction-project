The occurrence of dextral break-throughs in our crossing experiments is in harmony
with these principles. We had none till < groups began to separate out in F, and F,,
and three out of the four came from dextrals in E broods, of which we planted out all
that were available in 1929 :—

We conclude from these facts that dextral break-throughs are probably caused by
the same influence that causes H-ness, just as X-rays may produce monsters and also

* In all our further breeding of « and ¢ strains in 1928 and 1929, only one occurred : 10764 from an
odd dextral in gen. 5 of a « line which broke out of a high ¢ strain (Table 30).
