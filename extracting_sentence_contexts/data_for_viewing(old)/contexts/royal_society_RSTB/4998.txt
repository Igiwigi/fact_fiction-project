integument lines the micropyle and forms at the summit a flange overlapping the outer
integument or middle covering of the seed. In both cases the canal of the micropyle is
cutinised. The outer integument of Caylonia is also comparable with the middle
covering of the seed of G. africanum in its complex structure, though it contains no
vascular bundles. In both three layers are present and the structure of the two inner
layers is identical, but the outer layer of the Gnetwm seed is composed of several rows
of isodiametric cells with vascular bundles, while the “ blow-off” layer of Caytonia is
a delicate layer one cell thick.

What significance should be attached to such resemblances? It should be noted
that they are similar to those already recorded for the Pteridosperm Conostoma and for
Bennettites, but here we have a closer similarity in the structure of the micropylar tube.
Such facts seem to point rather to common ancestry and parallel evolution than to
close relationship. The cutinisation of the micropylar tube found in Caytonia,
Bennettites and Gnetum is probably the outcome of a similar physiological mechanism
in the three genera. The comparison of the antherophores of Ephedra may be a more
important point, and again suggests the possibility of the derivation of the Caytoniales
and Gnetales from a common Pteridospermous ancestor somewhat like Crossotheca.

The Caytoniales cannot be regarded as connected with the hypothetical Hemiangio-
sperms} with open carpels, from which, on ARBER and Park1y’s view, the Gnetales
and Angiosperms were considered to have sprung. They were non-strobilate, the
microsporangia and megasporangia do not seem to have been produced in close
proximity and may, indeed, have grown on separate plants.
