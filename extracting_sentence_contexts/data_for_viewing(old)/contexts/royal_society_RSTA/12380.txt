M. Brocu has undertaken a most laborious investigation of the formule employed
for the calculation of the vapour-pressures of water, adopting finally the one given in
the table. The utmost care was taken to obtain the best possible results from the
data taken; but, unfortunately, M. Brocu has accepted Reanavut’s conclusion that
the curve representing the vapour-pressures of ice is continuous with that obtained
from the vapour-pressures of water, and he has employed the whole of the data from
— 32° to 100°. By the method of calculation of the constants for the formula, this
source of error has been to a certain extent eliminated, as is shown by the comparison
(p. 31) of Recnavtr’s individual observations with the pressures calculated from the
formula. In this table it is seen that below — 5°, out of 31 comparisons, the
calculated pressures are higher than those observed in every case but one. The
error is, however, only partially eliminated, and this probably explains the fact that
the formula, with the constants given, will not bear extrapolation above 100° even to
120°, though it is supposed to hold good through a range of 132°.

It is to be feared that the results between 0° and 100° may even be to some extent
vitiated by this source of error—a most unfortunate circumstance, considering the
enormous amount of labour bestowed on the work, and the fact that the pressures
calculated from the formula have received the imprimatur of the Bureau Inter-
national.

Tt is to be noticed that Reanautr’s formula K gives results nearest the truth, but
that fairly approximate results are also obtainable by the use of UNnwin’s and of
Antorne’s formulz. These formule, it need hardly be remarked, are all empirical.
