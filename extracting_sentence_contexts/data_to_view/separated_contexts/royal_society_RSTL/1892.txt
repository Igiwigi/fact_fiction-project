MARSHALL HALL ON THE REFLEX FUNCTION

edge of the table ; in others the infliction of punctures, and the application of
a lighted taper, did not prevent the animal, still possessed of active powers of
motion, from passing into a state of complete and permanent quiescence. The same observations were made upon various other animals—the turtle,
the viper (/ipera Berus), the toad (Bufo vulgaris), the frog (Rana temporaria),
the eft (Triton cristatus), &c. It may therefore be stated as a general fact,
that if an animal be deprived of the cerebrum and medulla oblongata, and
placed under an inverted bell-glass, or otherwise protected from external sti-
muli, it will not move, however easily it may be excited to motion by external
impressions. I must now solicit the attention of the Society to three important points :
it is obvious,

1st, That sensation can act, in inducing muscular motion, only through the
medium of volition ;

2ndly, That, in the experiments which have been described, volition, —the
will, and not the power, to move, was annihilated;

3rdly, That, in such cases,—volition being destroyed and the agency of sen-
sation excluded, —the influence of external impressions, which might be sup-
posed to induce pain, must have been exerted upon some property of the ner-
vous system different from sensibility. The absence of spontaneous motions in decapitated animals, proves the
privation of volition ; and the privation of volition removes all evidence of
sensibility in excited motions, and indeed positively excludes its influence.
