theory for a body to acquire a charge of electricity. A cardinal feature in the
slectrical development of the present theory is on the other hand the conception of
intrinsic rotational strain constituting electric charge, which can be associated with an
atom or with an electric conductor, and which cannot be discharged without rupture
of the continuity of the medium. The conception of an unchanging configuration
which can exist in the present rotational zther is limited to a vortex ring with such
associated intrinsic strain : this is accordingly our specification of an atom. The
I elastic effect of convection through the medium of an atom thus charged is equivalent
to that of a twist round its line of movement : such a twist is thus a physical element
_ of an electric current.
113. The chief result of the discussion is that a rotationally elastic fluid «ther
" gives a complete account of the phenomena of optical transmission, reflexion, and
refraction, in isotropic and crystalline media, coinciding in fact formally in its wider
features with the electric theory of light; and that it gives a complete account of
