are included in these measurements, and that the measurements in consequence cannot be precisely
compared with those in the table. They are, however, practically within the ranges given in the tables

for the corresponding genera.

Apart from this increase of size, the egg of Lepas pectinata is thus a little smaller
than that of Lepas anatifera, especially in breadth, and is rather more ovate. In Con-
choderma virgata the eggs are a little larger than those of Lepas anatifera, especially
in breadth. In Dichelaspis Darwinii, according to Fiipri, the eggs are smaller than
in the foregoing genera, especially in breadth, a fact agreeing with the smaller size of
the Nauplius when first hatched. The eggs of Chthamalus are longer than those
of the foregoing genera, but asin Dichelaspis, narrower than in Lepas and Concho-
derma, In Balanus perforatus, as above stated, the eggs are generally longer
than in any of the foregoing, but of a breadth intermediate between that of Lepas

a anatifera and Lepas pectinata. The egg of Balanus improvisus is apparently shorter
a than those of the foregoing, but of the same width as Chihamalus; while that of
3 Balanus balancides is larger in both directions than any of the rest. In this genus,
2 as in the others, and generally in the group, the size of the egg has a distinct relation
& to that of the Nauplius, but none to that of the adult.
2 In the table is also given the range of variation in the size of the ova. The
ยง variation is greatest in Balanus perforatus and Lepas anatifera, and least in Lepas
