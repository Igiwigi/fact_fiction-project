water vapour in the deep interior of the earth. He wrote: ‘The capital fact to note is that petroleum
was born in the depths of the earth, and it is only there that we must seek its origin’ [7]. Remarkably,
Mendeleev’s insights relating to abundant, highly-active iron based catalysts now come to the
fore not only in modern studies of the utilization of CO2 but also in their effective ‘hydrogen
stripping’ from fossil fuels, with the energy carrier hydrogen now advanced as a solution to the
world’s looming climate emergency, as highlighted in the article by Yao et al. [8].

2. The simple or natural elementary bodies (the situation pre-1869)

Dalton, still widely regarded as ‘the immortal author’, recognized chemical combinations as
being formed by the union or addition of elementary atoms, the relative weights of which
he endeavoured to determine, referring those weights to one of the elements—hydrogen—as
unity. Dalton revived and advanced the hypothesis of atoms to explain the fact that in chemical
combinations, elements unite in fixed proportions, and in certain cases in multiple proportions [9].

Thus, prior to Mendeleev’s 1869 advance, all substances were universally placed as belonging
to only two classes—simple or elementary bodies or substances and compound substances.
A listing taken from a textbook [10] just one year before Mendeleev’s discovery vividly highlights
the situation at that time (figure 4). This remarkable compilation reveals the totality of the world’s
then-known Elementary Bodies, together with their appropriate characteristics. At that stage,
upon these 64 elementary bodies, the entire fabric and classification of the science—and indeed
the application—of chemistry was based.

3. The ‘lofty point of view’ of Mendeleev (1869 and beyond)
