It will be observed at once that these values differ considerably. The difference is,
however, entirely due to the relative values of the Youne’s moduli. In each case the
second term in the bracket represents the effect of the difference in the relevant
Potsson’s ratios for the inner and outer plies. Evidently either of these terms can be
neglected without appreciable error; in fact, the error involved would be less than
that involved in measuring E; and Ey. This is the more noteworthy since the values
of the relevant Potsson’s ratios differ in this case very considerably, and it confirms our
conclusion in § 14 that the effect of a variation of the Poisson’s ratio over the cross-
section of a wooden beam was negligible. Ignoring the difference in the Porsson’s
ratios, the formule (18.1) and (18.2) reduce to

for stretching, E,R + E’, (1 — R) (18.11)

for bending, E, R® + EB’, (1 — R°)
