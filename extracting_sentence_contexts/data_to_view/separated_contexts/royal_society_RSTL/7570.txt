The result strongly
confirms my former views. It is true that the photographs do not show a continuous
chromosphere of anything like uniform thickness ; but that arises from the fact that the
only part of the swn's limb where the envelope was visible at all during totality
happened to be covered by irregular prominences, which were probably very abundant
at the time. In fact, owing to the relative sizes of the swn and moon during the eclipse
of 1860, and the direction of the moon's motion, the top and bottom of the sun's limb,
as shown in plate 15 of Mr. De La Rux's memoir, were considerably within the moon's
limb during the totality; only small portions of the sun's limb on the preceding and
the following sides were uncovered, and there the chromosphere is seen to be almost
continuous, though, as I have said, very irregular. The absolute want of continuity in
the photographs, which, as far as I recollect, is not obseryable in Mr.
