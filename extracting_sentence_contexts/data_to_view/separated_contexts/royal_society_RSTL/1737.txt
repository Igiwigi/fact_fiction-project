A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM. 465

be attached to those zealous officers, surrounded as they must be with difli-
culties of every kind for carrying on snch delicate experiments. In fact,
amongst the multitude of experiments that I have myself made, I have seldom
found, after I had dismounted a pendulum, and then replaced it (even on the
same day, under all the fayourable circumstances of equality of temperature &.,
and with all the convyeniencies of manipulation,) that I could make it tell the
same 8tory in the next series of experiments. Eyen the same pendulum, furnished
with two different knife edges, rendered synchronous or nearly $0, similar to
those described in the above enumeration as convertible pendulums (No. 25â€”
38), where the trifling difference in the results of each pair of knife edges,
ought, after proper reductions, to be a constant quantity, will frequently differ
by an amount much greater than can be attributed to the errors of obser-
vation. The fact, I believe to be, that the pendulum furnished with a knife edge and
agate planes, as at present constructed, is a very inadequate instrument for the
delicate purposes for which it was originally intended : and a more rigid exa-
mination and adjustment of that part of the instrument are requisite, before
we can depend on the experiments made with it, either for the determination
of the length of the seconds pendulum, or even for the comparison of results
obtained in different parts of the world.
