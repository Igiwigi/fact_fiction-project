ponent unit is connected by snch a chain with a detached unit, s0 that all component
pairs are distinguished from all connecting pairs of the collection (sec. 135).

203. Thus a simple network divides the units of a single system into one or more
detached sets, each of the same number of units. Tf, then, p be the number of units
in each 8et, and & the number of sets, po=7n the number of units in the system. Thus
p and o must each be integral factors of n,

where p1=gb=re=sd=n, may be employed to denote the fact that there is a simple
network which divides the units of 8 into p sets of « units, another which divides
them into q sets of b units, and 80 on. We may have equations such as
