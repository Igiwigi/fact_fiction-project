employed by them, and that what have been taken to be single substances have
been, in reality, mixtures of several aconite alkaloids,

We therefore decided to examine the pharmacological action of the pure alkaloids
of several varieties of aconite and their derivatives, specially prepared free from
contamination with other substances. It was believed that, by examining the pure
specimens of aconite alkaloids which had been in part examined previously, fresh
facts might be ascertained which would remove the present obscurity, whilst many
new compounds were available for extending the enquiry not only into their
individual effect, but into the relationship which this might present to their chemical
enstitution. The portion of the research which is described in the present paper has been
Srried out with pure specimens of the alkaloids aconitine, benzaconine and aconine,
Bie chemistry of which has been fully studied since 1891 by one of us in conjunction
avith his assistants and pupils, and forms the subject of numerous papers which have
Seen communicated to the Chemical Society, and printed in the ‘Journal of the
Shemical Society.’ As these papers contain a full account of the chemical com-
Bosition and properties of the various aconite alkaloids, it will not be necessary to do
Paore now than summarize, for reference, the chief properties of the substances
“Gmployed in this enquiry.
