case. Note, nevertheless, that G’ continued to be considerably higher for magnetic hydrogels even
after switching off the field, which can be explained considering that the particle structures were
engulfed by the peptides. At this point, it must be remembered that the particles were coated
by peptides and, thus, they might be integrated within the peptide network. It should finally be
noticed the larger values achieved by the magnetic hydrogels at the stationary state.

The hypothesis of the formation of anisotropic magnetic field-induced particle structures
in magnetic hydrogels, and their maintenance after the removal of the field, was confirmed
by optical microscopy—e.g. [35], where particle chains of several micrometres of thickness
were observed in an optical photograph for a magnetic hydrogel containing 0.01 vol.%
of FeNPs@PEG@Fmoc-FF particles. By means of electron microscopy, we confirmed that
FeNPs@PEG@Fmoc-FF particles were perfectly integrated within the peptide network (figure 1b).
In fact, we could conclude that gelation of magnetic hydrogels results in anisotropic systems,
characterized by the presence of thick columnar structures, composed of magnetic particles and
peptide molecules, glued together by physical interactions between peptides themselves and
the PEG coating of particles and peptides. These structures do not seem to affect the porosity
of the hydrogels [35]. However, it should be noted that for FePs@PEG@Fmoc-FF particles,
the interaction between particles in the presence of field was so strong that very thick particle
structures, easily observable with the naked eye, were induced. These structures were not
integrated so nicely as the structures of FENPs@PEG@Fmoc-FF particles (figure 1c).

(c) Mechanical properties

We characterized the mechanical behaviour of both non-magnetic and magnetic hydrogels in
response to oscillatory shear strains (figure 2). As observed, both non-magnetic and magnetic
