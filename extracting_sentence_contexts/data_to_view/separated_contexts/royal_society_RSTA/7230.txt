The rhombus, ABCD, of angle 60° and side 2-53 A, represents
a unit cell of the net on a {111}-plane of taenite, while the rhombus, 4’B’C’D’, of angle
70° 32’ and side 2-48 A, is the corresponding unit on a {110}-plane of kamacite. Such a fit of mutually parallel lattice planes can only occur if the principal axes of all
taenite crystals are parallel to the axes of the octahedrite. That this is in fact the case is borne out by the well-known
observation that taenite may often be traced from one
octahedral plane of the Widmanstatten structure to another
without encountering a grain boundary. The hypothetical
cubic lattice mentioned above has, therefore, a real counter-
part in the taenite lattice. Let the planes ABCD and A’B’C’D’ (figure 1) be exactly
parallel and let ~ be the angle between AC and A’C’.
