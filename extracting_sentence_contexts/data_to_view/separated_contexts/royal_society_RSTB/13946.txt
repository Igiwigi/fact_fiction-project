In able to discriminate among morphs and therefore favour
other words, even though both Hawks and Doves co-occur their differentiation when morphs are unequally distributed
within a group, one morph will typically dominate at any among groups, which as we saw in the preceding paragraph
given time. Groups will therefore tend to be differentiated happens when relatedness is non-zero. In fact, polymorphism
according to whether they are composed of more or less of among Hawks and Doves is weak if non-existent under
one type. We can quantify this at the level of the population complete random group mixing (and relatedness is zero;

by calculating the phenotypic differentiation among groups electronic supplementary material, figure S3a and d).

Figure 3. Correlations among traits. (a—f) Joint distribution of each pair of traits in a simulated population at equilibrium (calculated from time 250 000 for 100 000
time steps, same simulation as figure 2; darker shade means greater density). (g) Mean + s.d. of the variance—covariance matrix evaluated in the same simulated
population and time points as (a—f); variances are on the diagonal while covariances among each pair traits are on the off-diagonal (see electronic supplementary
material, equation ($8) for definition). (Online version in colour.)

(iii) Non-additive costs and the emergence of Scrounging Hawks situations of conflict are counter-productive in prosocial
and Producing Doves situations.
