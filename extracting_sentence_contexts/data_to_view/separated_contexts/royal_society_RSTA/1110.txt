For x =0 — (Qt-1+ 6°), we have

This yields the linearized equation x;,= y Da jek 8 (6? — &)(xj — Xk) at 0°. Therefore, by
condition (ii), the linearized equation at Qt- 1+ 0° read

The stability conditions are given by the spectrum G(T) of the matrix T. In fact —T is a Laplacian
matrix with spectrum

G(T) = {0,A2,..-,AN},

where the eigenvalue 0 corresponds to the direction 1=(1,...,1) along the group orbit of the
phase-shift symmetry. This means that stability of Qt + 6° is only determined by the eigenvalues
doy... AN:

Note that none of the eigenvalues A2,...,A) are equal to zero, i.e. zero is a simple eigenvalue
of T.
