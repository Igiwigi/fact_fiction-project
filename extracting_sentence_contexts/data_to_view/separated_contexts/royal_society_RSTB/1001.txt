The demand of the tissues under these conditions is too great for the 1

possibility of its meeting that demand is still less if the active congestion, wl
the utmost that can be done by the vascular system, be hampered by the pr
of an increase of venous pressure. Here, not only is the rapidity of the blood
which is so essential a part of active congestion, impeded, but also the am
waste-products that can be removed in the blood is diminished, and hence the de:
of the tissues, instead of lessening, as it should do, becomes more and more
tive, with the result that the amount that leaves the blood-vessels is in
an indefinite period, and consequently the amount of cedema increases. That a functionally active part does not normally become cedematous
ordinary sense of the term, though its tendency is in that direction, is no dou

and that the accompanying active congestion is fully able to meet the deman'

It is therefore evident that the tissues play a part that has hitherto been uni
nized in the production of cedema. &

Complete anemia and hemostasis, however, not only produce an effect

are secretory, they cannot, in the absence of blood, be hampered by any pr
their own functional activity, yet it is evident that they must form waste-p
a part of their very life. Microscopically no differences have been discovered
