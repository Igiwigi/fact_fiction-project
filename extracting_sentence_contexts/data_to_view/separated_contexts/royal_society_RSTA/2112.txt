DBNC_PE) consumes approximately 25% more area, and a PE with cut-off circuitry
(ie. C_PE) consumes approximately 1% additional area, when compared to the baseline PE used
for the same size systolic array. The variation in the area with respect to the array size is due to
the fact that the bit-width of the partial sums increases with an increase in the number of PEs
in a single column of the array. Similar to the area characteristics, the critical path delay of a PE
also depends on the design and the size of the systolic array. However, the variations in the delay
are relatively small, ie. at the maximum 6.5% for the 8x8 systolic array composed of DBNC_PE
when compared to the baseline PE for the same array size.
