already pointed out its close similarity, on account of position and the fact that it loses
its hypodermal connection, to the hypostigmatic gland in both Bombyx and Pieris.
The above-mentioned embryologists who homologised tentorial and silk gland invagina-
tions with spiracles contended that the anterior tentorial arms represented an original
first spiracle and the posterior tentorial arms of the second maxillary segment corre-
sponded to the third pair of spiracles. The additional pair of spiracles on this same
segment in Apis precludes Netson from maintaining the homology suggested by
Patmen (1877), HarscHex (1877), and Carriere and Bireer (1898), viz., between
tentoria and spiracles. This, however, does not prevent us from employing the cephalic
invaginations in a determination of head segmentation.

The following is my interpretation of the cephalic invaginations. In view of the fact
that all investigators are in agreement as to the origin of the main invaginations from
behind the antennz, mandibles, first and second maxille, | maintain that we have here
another criterion for testing our conception of the segmental constitution of the head.
It is of the greatest significance to notice that a second invagination arises immediately
behind that of the anterior tentorial invagination. This can reasonably be associated
with the very reduced premandibular segment, though by the time this pair of invagina-
tions is easily recognisable the segment itself has been absorbed. We have, therefore,
the anterior arms of the tentorium associated with the antenne, the short invaginations
of the flexor mandibular tendon belong to the premandibular segment, the mandibular
apodeme to the mandible, the posterior tentorial arms to the maxilla and the silk glands
with the labium. One is tempted in making these assertions to recall the analogous
vertebrate condition and homologise the mouth and labrum with these several apertures
