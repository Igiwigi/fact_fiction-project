(3.) The somewhat coiled 8mall intestine.

(4) Certain characters of the brain, e.g., the large 8ize of the cerebellum ;
presence of the 80-called lobi inferiores on the infundibulum ; and of tori 86
circulares in the mid-brain.

In spite of the undoubtedly important lis of features to which we have jus call
attention, a list containing not less important characters, both embryological and ad
separating Lepidosteus from the Teleostei, can be drawn up :â€”

(1.) The character of the truncus arteriosus. ,

(2.) The fact of the genital ducts joining the ureters.

(3.) The presence of vasa efferentia in the male carrying the semen from the t
to the kidney, and through the tubules of the latter into the kidney duct.

(4.) The presence of a well-developed opercular gill.

(5.) The presence of a spiral valve ; though this character may possibly b
down with the extension of our knowledge.

(6.) The typical Ganoid characters of the thalamencephalon and the cereb
hemispheres (vide pp. 381 and 382).
