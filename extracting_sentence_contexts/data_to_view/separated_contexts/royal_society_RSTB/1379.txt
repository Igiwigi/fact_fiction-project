The same section shows further that the
anches were inserted immediately wbove the node. We can, therefore, use
s a means of orientation in other cases ; in all sections which show branches
that the adjoining node is below the branch, and thus the top and bottom of
Simen are determined. Another useful clue is afforded by the fact that the
# foliar bundle is generally situated in the median line of the bundle running
it from below, while this is seldom the case with the bundles above the node. *
& indication which can sometimes be made use of is the fact that the xylem
stem-bundles is directly continuous with that of the outgoing leaf-trace, oÂ»
5 ow only. On the upper side the trachese overarch the leaf-trace bundle,
generally separated from its xylem-elements by some parenchymatous tissue.
