ferent breadths of the fringes formed by the different rays. The present experiment
clearly proves, that not only the fringes are broadest in the least refrangible rays, but

those rays are bent most out of their course, because both the axis of the jy is
inclined, and also their breadths are various.

Exp. 3. Though called by Gamarpr, the discoverer, the three fringes, as | welt as
by Newrox and others who followed him, they are seen to be almost innumerable, if
viewed through a prism to refract away the scattered light that obscnres them. 1
Stated this fact many years agoÂ®.

Exp. 4. That the fringes are images may be at once perceived, not when formed
in the light disc as in some of the foregoing experiments, but when formed in
the shadow. Thus when the opposite edges are moved $0 near one another as to
form fringes bordering the luminous body's image, they are formed like the disc they
Surround. When you view a candle through the interval of the opposite edges, you
perceive that the fringes are images of its flame, with the wick, and that they move
as the flame moves to and fro. When you observe the half-moon in like manner, you
perceive that the side of the fringes answering to the rectilinear side of the moon, are
rectilinear, and the other side circular; and when the full moon is thus viewed, the
fringes on both sides are circular. The circular dise of the moon is, indeed, drawn
or elongated as well as coloured. It is, that is to say, the fringe or image is exactly
