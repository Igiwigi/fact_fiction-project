of light, but in a less ratio than the increase of the light. These conclusions were
confirmed, but as they were so well established by Bunsen and Roscos, there is no
need to give the results of any of the experiments on these points.

§ 3. The Effect of Impurities.

One of the most remarkable facts connected with the action under consideration is
the large effect on the rate of combination produced by a small quantity of impurity.
Bunsen and Roscor showed that the addition of y,%9 parts of oxygen reduced the
maximum action from 100 to 9°7. It is extremely difficult to prepare the gas
mixture with a definite quantity of impurity in it, and as yet no experiments have
been performed which are sufficiently comparable to determine the relation between
the quantity of the impurity and the rate of the action. To quote the words of
BunseEN and Roscor: “ It is perfestly useless to collect the electrolytic gas in a large
vessel, then mix it with the impurity, and afterwards to allow the mixture to pass
through the apparatus, for there is no possible means of collecting this pure mixture
of hydrogen and chlorine in large masses, and again forcing it out in a given
