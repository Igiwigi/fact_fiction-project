No endeavour was made to isolate the effect of the individual
factors, but some general conclusions may be drawn, as to the relation existing
between the results obtained and the nature of the conditions, which may suggest
more accurate experimental work. The series of cultures of Nephrodium Filia-mas shows that no necessary con-
nection between cresting of the plant and apogamy exists. But though this
statement is justified in view of the number of instances of apogamy now known in
normal ferns, we are not iv a position to decide that the fact, that nearly all the
prothalli investigated were derived from crested plants, has been without influence
on the results. It may be that prothalli of normal forms of these species will be
found to behave similarly under like conditions. But it appears not improbable that
