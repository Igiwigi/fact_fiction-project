We could also include dispersive
forms for d. For example, d= ap , for which the exponential term exp(d(2z7ik) t) remains bounded
for all t > 0. We also note that for such diffusive or dispersive forms for d=d(0;) the integral
kernel function p = p(x,y;t) is in fact smooth. Also recall, from our ‘abstract’ formulation, we
require Q’ € C™([0, #]; 32(Q; Q)). The explicit form for q’ = q/(x,y; t) given in lemma 2.8 reveals that
its time dependence is characterized through the term i(k; t).
