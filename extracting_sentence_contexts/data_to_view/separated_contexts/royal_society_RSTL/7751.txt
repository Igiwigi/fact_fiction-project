4), it is easy to satisfy
ourselyes, by the method of art. 6, that the above proposition «till holds good. In fact, if the n values of the
new Error be «,, @,, #,, - - - -, We 8hall have, instead of the formula (7),

n=ME—a)+/(E—n)+f(E—2)+&6-þ

which is true in all cases, whether the distribution be continuous or discontinuous, or a mixture of both ; and
hence the formula (9) will follow. + This snggestion is due to Professor J, C. Anans, one of the Referees charged by the Royal Society with the
duty of reporting upon the present Paper.
