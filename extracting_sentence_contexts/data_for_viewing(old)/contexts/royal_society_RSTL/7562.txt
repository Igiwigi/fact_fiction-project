Tax elimination tables in the Memoir on the Resultant of a System of two Equations
(Phil. Trans. 1857, pp. 703-715), relate to equations of the form (a, 6. . a, y)"=0,
without numerical coefficients ; but it is, I think, desirable to give the corresponding tables
for equations in the form (a, b, . .Xx, y)"=0 with numerical coefficients, which is the
standard form in quantics. The transformation can of course be effected without diffi-
culty, and the results are as here given. It is easy to see @ priors that the sum of the
numerical coefficients in each table ought to vanish ; these suwms do in fact vanish, and
we have thus a verification as well of the tables of the present Addition as of the tables
of the original memoir, by means whereof the present tables were calculated.
