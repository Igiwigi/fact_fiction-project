be especially mentioned on account of the excellent agreement between the single
experiments which he has obtained, taking great care in the measurement of the
dimensions of the tubes and in their purification. This agreement, being independent
of the dimensions of the tubes and of the nature of the glass, seems to have taken
away the foundations of the criticism of the results which the ecapillary-tube method
can give. VOLKMANN finds, as is seen, a value which lies rather near the author's,
the difference being, however, about 0°7 per cent.

As is to be seen from the table, a great number of investigations have recently
been executed by the method of capillary ripples. We see that the values found by
this method are generally higher than the value found in this paper. The mutual
conformity between the results of the different investigations is however not very
great. In the author’s opinion this disagreement depends on the fact that in many
cases the conditions of the experimental investigations do not sufficiently correspond
to the assumptions on which the theoretical development rests ; in what follows, an
attempt has been made to show what is meant by this.

The experiments executed by the method mentioned can be divided into two
groups, according to advancing rectilinear waves, produced by help of the vibrations
of a glass plate fastened to one prong of a tuning-fork, or standing waves formed by
interference between two systems of advancing circular waves, generated by two pins
fastened to both prongs of a tuning-fork, being used.

Among the authors who have used the former method, only Dorszy and
Kotowrat-TsCHERWINSEI seem to have examined the magnitude of the wave-length
