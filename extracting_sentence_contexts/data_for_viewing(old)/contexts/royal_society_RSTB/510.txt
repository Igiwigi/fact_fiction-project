leave any doubt that by the growth of the leguminous crops the surface soils had
gained nitrogen, and that this gain bore some relation to the amount of growth and
removal in the crops.

If then the surface soils have gained in nitrogen, it is obvious that they have not
been the primary source of the nitrogen taken up by the plants. It must have come
either from above or from below the surface soil—from the atmosphere or from the
subsoil. The evidence does indeed point to the fact, that much nitric acid results
from nitrification of nitrogen accumulated within the surface soil. But as this nitrogen
either increases or does not diminish, much of the nitric acid produced must come
from some other source than what may be called the original stock of nitrogen of the
surface soil itself. Much doubtless comes from the nitrogen of crop-residue, itself
derived from the atmosphere or from the subsoil,

Before discussing this subject further it will be well to call attention to another
remarkable experiment, showing the amount of nitrogen that may be taken up by one
leguminous plant growing on land where another had to a great extent failed,
