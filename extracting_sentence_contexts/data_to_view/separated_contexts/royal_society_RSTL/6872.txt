The filtrate deposits generally small white plates, retaining, however, a portion of
the substance dissolved, which can be recovered by shaking the aqueous solution with
ether. On evaporating the ether it remains behind as a violet-coloured oil which
quickly solidifies. This latter, as well as the plates first deposited, is in fact almost
pure naphtyl-alcohol, whilst the violet-brown mass on the filter contains, besides naphtyl-
alcohol, a considerable quantity of a reddish-brown body. In order to purify the
naphtyl-alcohol, the united portions are treated with a cold solution of potassa, the
residuary brown-red body *Â® is filtered off, and the filtrate treated with acetic acid as
long as precipitation ensues. N aphtyl-alcohol separates first as an oil, 80on solidifying
to anetwork of small plates, which are still 8omewhat violet-coloured.
