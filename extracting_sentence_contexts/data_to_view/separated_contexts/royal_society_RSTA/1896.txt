Section 4 reports results from numerical simulations of our simplified reactive plasma flow in a
packed bed reactor and introduces a preliminary phenomenological model that could be further
extended to predict the reaction consumption rate as a function of the flow and reaction-rate
control parameters.

2. Mathematical and numerical models

Here, we introduce the model based on the LBM that we will use to study simplified weakly
ionized plasma fluid. The model describes momentum, electric charge and species concentration
fields, taking into account electric breakdown reactions and the interaction between charged
species and the electric field.

(a) Lattice Boltzmann method for the momentum field

LBM models the fluid via probability distribution function of fictive gas particles. Such particles
perform consecutive propagation and collision processes over a discrete lattice mesh. The
governing equation for the D2Q9 model is [26]
