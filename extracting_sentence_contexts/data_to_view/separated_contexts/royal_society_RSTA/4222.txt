This can deform or even break components, thereby compromising
the functionality of the device. On the positive side, capillarity can be used in the design of
microstructures, as illustrated by the development of passive pipetting techniques [5] and by
alternative approaches to self-assembly [6]. Other applications include the formation of foams by
evaporating water from a vertical array of multiwalled nanotubes [7], the engineering of highly
hydrophobic surfaces in the form of coated carbon nanotubes [8], and the fact that locomotion of
robots and insects on interfaces is facilitated by means of flexible appendages [9,10]. One particular promising aspect of elasto-capillarity is the ability of surface tension to fold
planar objects, possibly with hinges, into three-dimensional structures [6]. For elastic sheets,
this process is known as capillary origami [11,12].
