It may be tated generally, that small inland seas, though
communicating with the ocean, are much less $alt than the
open ocean. This is particularly striking in the case of the
Baltic ; and also, though in a less remarkable degree, in the
Black sea, in the White sea, in the sea of Marmora, and even
in the Yellow sea.* -

The ' Mediterranean, though a comparatively small and
subordinate sea, is found to contain rather a larger proportion
of salt than the ocean." This appears to form an exception

* The Caspian sea is also said, but upon no certain authority, to be less salt
than the ocean. Its waters having, like those of the Dead sea, ho obvious communi-
cation with those of any other seas, present a particular case well deserying of
investigation ; and I regret that I haye not yet been able to procure a specimen
of them, notwithstanding the yarious attempts which I have made for that purpose.

+ This has been tated 'by various writers, and appears to be the case from the
few specimens which I haye examined ; but I cannot speak with perfect confidence
on this point, as I was but scantily supplied with water from that sea, though
comparatively so near and s0 much frequented by navigators of all descriptions, In
their analysis of sea water, Bov1LLon-La Grance, and VogEL $tate the propor-
tion cf saline matter in the water of the Mediterranean to be 41, that of the Atlantic
being 38, and that of the English Channel 36.

to the general fact which I have stated above, and stands in
need of explanation. In order to account- for this, it has been argued that the
Mediterranean sea is not supplied by the rivers which flow
into it with a quantity of fresh water, sufficient to replace
that which it loses by evaporation under a burning sun, as-
sisted by a powerful radiation from the African $hores, and
the parching winds blowing from the adjacent deserts ; s0
that a current from the ocean is required to replenish this
waste, and prevent the Mediterranean from sinking below its
level. Accordingly it is observed that a current sets in at all
times from the ocean into the Mediterranean, which current,
I am informed, is 80 strong at Gibraltar, as to carry a ship at
the rate of two or three miles an hour; and it is felt as far
eastward as the Cap de Gat, a distance of upwards of one
hundred and fifty miles; so that ships going out of the Me-
diterranean, scarcely ever attempt to beat out against contrary
winds, and usually keep close either to the African or Euro-
pean shore, in order to avoid the full force of the stream.
