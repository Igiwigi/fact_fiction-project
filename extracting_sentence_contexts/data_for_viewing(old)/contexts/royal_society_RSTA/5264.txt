mass Dirac deltas. These discrete approximations are used extensively in materials science and
variational calculus with hard-core potentials [33-36] in order to understand the crystallization _
phenomenon. However, these discrete approximations with soft potentials such as (1.2) are more 3
difficult; apart from various properties of the minimizers [8,13,17,24], the existence as well as :<
the convergence of these discrete minimizers are not established in general. In a certain range of :3
exponents, we prove that the diameter of the support of the discrete minimizers does not depend :
on the number of Dirac deltas. This result, together with standard compactness arguments, results
in our desired global minimizers among probability measures.

In fact, our strategy to show the confinement of discrete minimizers is in the same spirit as the
proof of the confinement of solutions of the aggregation equation in [37,38]. In our case, the ideas
behind the proof in ยง2 are based on convexity-type arguments in the range of exponents y > a > 1 :
to show the uniform bound in the diameter of global minimizers in the discrete setting. Section 3 =
is devoted to more refined results in one dimension. We show that, for very repulsive potentials,
the bounds on the diameter are not uniform in the number of Dirac deltas, complemented by
numerical simulations. In the range of exponents y > 1 > a, the minimizers turn out to be unique Dk
(up to translation), analogous to the simplified displacement convexity in one dimension. In :
the special case y =2 and a =1, we can find the minimizers and show the convergence to the [4
continuous minimizer explicitly. DN
