biogenic sources, like agriculture and waste, are very much reliant on human activity, they
are also sensitive to changes in environmental conditions. In particular, CH4 emissions from
rice cultivation and manure are strongly dependent on temperature with a Q10 factor (i.e. the
factor by which emissions increase with a 10° increase in temperature) similar to that of wetland
emissions [16]. Emissions from landfills, on the other hand, have a more complex relation to
temperature being positively correlated with temperature when soils are moist but negatively
correlated under dry conditions [17]. The possible net response of anthropogenic CH, emissions
to temperature and soil moisture changes at national or regional scales, however, is unknown.

In national emissions reporting, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) guidelines, only anthropogenic sources are considered, and the reported emissions do
not account for possible temporal variations due to meteorological conditions, at least for Tier 1
methods which are predominantly used [18]. This is due to the fact that the emissions are
estimated based on atemporal emission factors multiplied with annual activity data. Thus, in
comparing national reported emissions with estimates based on atmospheric observations (a ‘top-
down’ approach), there may be significant differences due to seasonal and inter-annual variations
in the anthropogenic sources, which are not accounted for in the emission inventories. This
represents one advantage of top-down approaches to emissions estimates, namely, they include
all variations in the emissions, those due to changes in human activity as well as those due to
environmental factors.

In this study, we use the top-down approach, specifically atmospheric inversions, to estimate
CH4 emissions from 2005 to 2018 for geographical Europe with the aim of determining the
possible variability in anthropogenic and natural sources due to meteorological conditions. We
