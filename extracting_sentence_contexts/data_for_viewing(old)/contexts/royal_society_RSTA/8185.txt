This new value for the wave-length of H, is, as expected from the foregoing con-
siderations, slightly higher than that of Houston.

The fact of the red hydrogen line H, being a doublet (only separable by the
phenomenally high resolution of the echelon spectroscope) does not at all interfere
with its use in this present determination. For even if the weak component were as
brilliant as the intense component, the light is only used in the author’s form of inter-
ferometer to produce interference bands of a very low order of interference, formed by
the interfering reflections from two glass surfaces only about one or at most two milli-
metres apart, and not for high orders of interference such as are afforded and employed
in the long étalons of Micuetson and Fapry and Prror.

Tf we use this value 6562-869, along with the standard Cd, wave-length, to calculate
