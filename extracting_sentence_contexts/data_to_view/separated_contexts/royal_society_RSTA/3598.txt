and the congruency is therefore common to two complexes of the fourth and third
orders respectively. But these complexes contain the congruency

Lf (pp), F(p) +f (ap) F@M]=O-. . «©» (542),

and this is foreign to the question, being, in fact, the congruency (496) of Art. 132 of

connectors for the permutable function f( py) +/(qp). When this is rejected, there

remains the congruency of connectors of two pairs of homographs, and its order and
