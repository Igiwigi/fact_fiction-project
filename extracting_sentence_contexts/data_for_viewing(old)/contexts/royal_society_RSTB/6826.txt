“M’. It is the radicle ““C” one would associate with this reaction, seeing that
tobacco mosaic virus and its strains induce a similar effect on Capsicum As with the
tobacco mosaic mixtures, the addition of the “‘ VN” radicle gives an intensely necrotic
character to the original effect.

We have spoken of distinct radicles in the protein molecule as responsible for certain
specific reactions; it is a logical step to relate them to antigens and to turn to the
serological data to see what support they may give to the idea. So far, but little
analytical work on serological lines has been done with plant viruses. A common
agglutinin has been demonstrated for all the X strains and shown to be present in at
least as great a quantity in X” as in any of the others. We shall probably not be wrong
in considering this antigen as the equivalent of the radicle A, supported as it is by the
fact that X”¥, X?, and X% all equally protect against YS and X¥. Bawden (1935)
showed that formalin destroyed the infectivity of the X virus strains but left the
flocculation intact, i.e. the radicle M is destroyed and A survives. He did not work
with X”, Spooner and Bawden (1935) demonstrated that when anti X° serum was
mixed with XS juice, 87 °% of the subsequent inoculations failed, but when mixed with
X® or X* juices 100 % failed. Again anti-X* serum when mixed with X¢ juice neutral-
ized 89 %,, and with X* 95 % of the plants, the dilution and procedure in all cases being

the same. This may be taken as showing that although X° is more virulent than X° its
anti-serum does not react on X° as effectively as does an anti-X¢ serum itself. In other
