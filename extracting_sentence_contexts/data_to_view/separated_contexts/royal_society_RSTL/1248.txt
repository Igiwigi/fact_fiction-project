to detect this salt in the bittern by crystallization were fruit-
less, though great pains were taken for that purpose; and I
feel the more confident that there is no sulphate of soda in
8ea-water, as the presence of this salt, in any but the most
minute quantities, would be quite incompatible with our know-
ledge of chemical affinities. For since there are, co-existing
in sea-water, muriate of soda and sulphate of magnesia, it is
evident that sulphate of soda would decompose muriate of
magnesia, which saltis known to be in sea-water. And again
we know, that sea-water contains sulphate of lime and muriate
of 8oda ; therefore it cannot contain sulphate of s8oda ; for in
that case we should have muriate of lime, which I have shown
to be contrary to fact. The last circumstance which I shall at present notice, re-
lates to the state in which potash exists in sea-water. *
