In order to fix ideas, compare (28) with the case of a parabolic reflector of the
same focal length, given on p. 167, for which we get

db’ = b[ * 4+°44191b8+ * ]+B8[+°22095d?—1°00000b8+ * ];

we see that there is a close resemblance, except for the value of 4,G, so that the two
hardly differ in any sensible way, except in the curvatures of the fields. It will then
cause some surprise that SxrpEen concluded that the Fraunhofer glass was free from
coma which is so marked in the reflector. It was, in fact, a misapprehension, as the
diagrams given by Sremnern and by FrysterwAnper sufficiently demonstrate.
Serpet’s argument presents an interesting feature.| He puts together the four

components of his sum § (2),
+ 0,412

12,672
+13,454
— 1,662

S(2) = — 0,468
