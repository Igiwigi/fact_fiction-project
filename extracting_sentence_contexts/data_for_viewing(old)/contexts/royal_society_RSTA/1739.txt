It thus remains to show that S is positive and irreducible. To this end, we will use
Proposition 5.5.

So let wéV. Then ut €H1(R4). Since (wt)? <u?, one has ut € V. Moreover, since
utu~ =Oand, by Stampacchia’s lemma, 0;u* dju~ = 0, it follows that a(u*, u~) = 0. Hence,
S is positive by Proposition 5.5(a).

To show irreducibility, let BC R be a Borel set such that both B and R“\B have strictly
positive Lebesgue measure. According to Lemma 5.6, there exists a test function v €
C(I?) such that lgv ¢H! (R4). Thus, v € V but lgu ¢ V, so irreducibility follows from
Proposition 5.5(b).

Convergence of the semigroup in case that s(A) = 0 now follows from Corollary 3.5, and the fact
that the limit operator is symmetric follows since A is self-adjoint (as the forma is symmetric). 1

essential spectrum of a Schrédinger operator is located, we refer to the literature in mathematical
physics, for instance to the classical reference [48, ch. 4].

(b) A Schrodinger semigroup on L2(IR): strong convergence

The semigroup on L?(R*) generated by the Laplace operator A without potential converges
strongly to 0 as tf oo, while we have operator norm convergence to a non-zero equilibrium
in Example 6.1 (if s(A) = 0). The following example, which we owe to Mateusz Kwasnicki [49],
shows that strong convergence to a non-zero equilibrium can also occur.
