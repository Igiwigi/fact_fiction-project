What the significance of this lateral enamel strand may be is doubtful. In Ornitho-
rhynchus at least it is not a mere crumpling or folding of the dental lamina or enamel
organ as AHRENS (1913) and Marcus (1931) believed, nor does it show any signs of
representing an earlier dentition as KiKenrHat (1896) and Aptorr (1916) have
suggested.

e MORPHOLOGY OF THE TEETH OF ORNITHORHYNCHUS 417

GreEGorY (1934, Pp. 192) points out that Bok failed to explain the causal relations
between the enamel niche and the enamel septum and merely assumed that they were
parts of the same phenomenon. Certainly the fact that a niche is present and a septum
is absent in Ornithorhynchus provides a striking example of the dissociation of these
structures. Referring to the vascularity of the septum in Phascolarctus, GREGORY fails
to see that Bork has proved anything beyond the possibility of nutriment being carried
via the septum to the crown of the tooth, and, since it is distributed on each side of the
septum, two growth centres appear in the enamel organ. While Grecory does not
advance any explanation for the presence of the enamel niche, he suggests that it may
represent a secondary vacuity developed in the dental lamina.
