Although the main purpose of this paper has been to record the results of experi-
ments, it is desirable to form, if possible, some picture of the action taking place within
a crystal grain which would be consistent with the externally observed phenomenon of
stress reduction. It is well known that the plastic deformation of metals is accompanied
by slip over certain planes within the crystal grains. The nature and mechanism of
the slip is imperfectly understood, but the fact of its existence has received abundant
confirmation since the pioneer work of Ew1ne and Rosennatn was carried out. It
was formerly thought that the erystal structure within the grain offered a high resistance
to slip, and that the elastic strength as externally observed could be attributed to this
resistance. The knowledge which has since become available regarding the properties
of large single crystals has necessitated a revision of this view.
