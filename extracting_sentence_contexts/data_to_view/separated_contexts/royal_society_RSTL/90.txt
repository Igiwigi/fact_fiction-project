In order to comprehend the Experiment I am now
going to ſpcak of, one ſhould recollect, that the whole
Body of a Polypus forms only one Pipe, a ſort of Gur,
or Pouch. I have bcen able to turn that Pouch, that Body of
the Polypus, inſide-outwards; as one may turn a Stoc-
king,

I haye ſeyeral by me, that haye remained turned in
this manner; their Inſide is become their Outſide,
and their Outſide their Inſide : They cat, they grow,
and they multiply, as if they had neyer been turned. Facts like theſe I have related, to be admitted, re-
quire the moſt convincing Proofs, I yenture to fay,
I am able to produce ſuch Proofs,

They ariſe from the Detail of my Experiments, from
the Precautions I have taken to ayoid all Uncertainties,
from the Care I haye uſed to repeat the ſame Experi-
ment ſeyeral times, from the Aſliduity and Attention
with which I have obſerved them. All this would require a Diſcuſſion too long to be
here related.

1 might alſo appeal to the Quality and the Number
of the Perſons who haye been Witneſſes to theſe Fats;
as well of thoſe who have ſeen e obſeryc, as of
thoſe who have obſeryed 7hem/elves. For Brevity-ſake, I haye omitted ſeyeral curious and
material ZaQs.
