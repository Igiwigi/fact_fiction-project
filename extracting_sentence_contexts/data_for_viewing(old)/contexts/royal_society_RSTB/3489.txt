number (usually four) of leaves in the whorl ; (>) the small size and faleate shape of
the leaves; (c) their erect arrangement on the stem. When we examine the
impression-species of Calamocladus found in the English Coal Measures, we find that
these characters are also presented by C. chareformis (Sternb.) (= Asterophyllites
Rehli, Stur.). A specimen of this species in the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge,* from
the Middle Coal Measures of Barnsley, is shown in Plate 4, fig. 2. The ultimate
branches are long and slender, about 0°7 mm. in diameter, bearing whorls about
1 mm. apart. Each whorl consists of about 4—6 small falcate leaves 1-2 mm. long.
The leaves of successive whorls alternate in position on the stem, and they overlap
slightly. The terminal bud is of simple structure, with only one or two whorls of
sheathing leaves. This species differs in form from all the others, and there seems
to be little doubt that it is identical with the petrified type. The chief difficulty to
this hypothesis is the fact that, hitherto, impressions of C. chareformis have not been
found lower than the Middle Coal Measures,t whereas it appears to be the
commonest form in the calcareous nodules of the Lower Measures. Possibly it has
escaped observation in the shales of the latter horizon, owing to its small size;
while its delicate structure would probably increase the rarity of well-preserved
specimens,

CHARZFORMIS TyPE—VARIETY a.

The specimens examined show considerable variety in shape (cf Plate 4,
figs. 1, 8, 10). Slide No. Q 169 contains some very good longitudinal and transverse
sections of leaves, which can in general be placed in the Charzformis section, but
vary somewhat in structure also from the typical examples (cf Plate 4, fig. 3,
