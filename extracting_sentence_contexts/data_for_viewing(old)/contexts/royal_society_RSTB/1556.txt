Degeneration of the nuclei of the uterine epithelium and superficial stroma also
takes place during this period, and is very marked during Stage VI.

The number of leucocytes is very largely increased.

Stage VII.—1 have nothing to add to the description of the mucosa menstrualis
already given in Part 1. of this paper (No. 8). Denudation occurs in M. rhesus as in
S. entellus; it is brought about in a similar manner and exists to a similar extent; a
menstrual clot is also formed in the same way.

I have here very conclusive confirmation of the truth of the account given for
S. entellus. Fig. 8, Plate 37, in my former paper might, in fact, fairly represent my
specimens of the same stage in M. rhesus. The denudation is a remarkable process ;

both its completeness and extent are unquestionable,

into a repetition of what I have already written with regard to S. entellus.
