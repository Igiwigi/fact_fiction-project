Bak but before cytochrome c release [68]. It is achieved described that the lipid transfer activity of tBid may help
thanks to the SUMOylation (small ubiquitin-like modifier) for CL translocation from MIM to MOM, favouring CL redis-
activity of MAPL, a mitochondrial anchored RING-finger tribution into microdomains and generating local alterations

containing protein with SUMO E3 ligase activity [69]. Thus, in the membrane curvature, somehow promoting cytochrome


c release [12,86â€”88]. Similarly, another BH3-only protein
termed Bik also seems to induce dynamic mitochondrial
transformation, initiating the cristae remodelling regulated
by Drp1 [85]. The latter study, together with recent reports,
highlights the essential role that Drp1 may play in this process
[71,74,76,89]. In fact, it has been proposed that the membrane
remodelling function of Drp1 in this process could be different
from its recognized role in regulating mitochondrial fission
[85], although some authors suggest that both membrane con-
striction and lipid remodelling activities are also required for
membrane fission [90,91]. Along these lines, current research
focused on Drp1 adaptors has shed light on the specific contri-
bution of MiD49/51 to this process [89]. Experiments
performed in knockout cells for Drp1 or these adaptors con-
firmed that Drp1-mitochondrial fission through MiD49/51,
but not Mff, facilitated cristae remodelling required for cyto-
chrome c release during intrinsic apoptosis. Disassembly of
OPA1 oligomers was not sufficient to enable cytochrome c
