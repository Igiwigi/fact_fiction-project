disappearance of the corresponding harmonic components from the lunar variation,
as determined from the mean of a whole number of months. It is found, indeed,
that any such component still remaining is of purely accidental character.

As to the amplitude of the various components, this appears to be independent of
the lunar phase, the irregularities being accidental. The mean of the amplitudes at
the separate phases has therefore been taken as the best value of the true amplitude,
except that a correction has been applied to allow for the fact that the instantaneous
amplitude is greater than that deduced from the mean of a few days, during which

he phase is varying. Thus, if we tabulate a function ¢ cos(n@+ky), where @ is the
