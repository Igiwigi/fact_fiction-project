It has been remarked how productivity rather than turnover is the parameter to consider [4
for industrial exploitability. DNS

There is a lot of interest in the development of new modified FT catalysts for selective a
light olefins synthesis from CO, preferably directly and not through the intermediate CO [oo
formation. The main scientific issue is related to the fact that the systems investigated are mainly .
modifications of conventional FT catalysts, rather than novel systems as probably required. The
role of COz in FT reactions remains contradictory. Hybrid FT-zeolite catalysts appear to be an
interesting possibility, but they are still not being developed on a scientific basis.
