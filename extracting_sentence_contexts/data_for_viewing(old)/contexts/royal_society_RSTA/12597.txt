The first line shows how trifling the a-symmetry was in the sunspot areas, considering
how greatly the area on day n exceeded the mean.

The differences appearing in the last two lines of Table IX. for values of s exceeding
9 are presumably dependent in part on sunspot phenomena prior to day n—15. The
fact that the data from H ranges and character figures accord so closely, not merely
in sign but in absolute size, must be regarded as largely fortuitous, because the scale
of the character figures is a wholly arbitrary one.

1892, 1893, and 1894, led to some very striking results, which are given in Table X.
Use was made in the calculations of figures going one decimal place beyond the figures
in Tables V. and VII.
