The mode of origin of the daily barometric variation has been much discussed, but
the question whether the important semi-diurnal component is of tidal or thermal
origin, or both, seems still open. If it is fundamentally a tidal effect, resonance with
a free atmospheric period of 12 hours must be assumed, since the lunar diurnal
barometric variation (which can hardly be of other than tidal origin) is of’ much
smaller magnitude. Probably resonance is necessarily involved -also if the cause
is thermal, as the Ke:viy-Marcutes theory supposes. In any case, however, the
12-hour variation is clearly much more fundamental than the 24-hour component,
a fact which has an interesting bearing on the magnetic variations.
