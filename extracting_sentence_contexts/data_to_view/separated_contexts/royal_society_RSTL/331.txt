Being much struck with the experiments *recorded in the
Fransactions of the Royal' Society, Vol. LXXV. made by Dr. Forpyce, upon the weight said to be acquired by water upon
being frozen; and being possessed of an excellent balance, belong-
ing to His most Serene Highness the ELEcToR PALATINE DUKE
of Bavaria; early in the beginning of the winter of the year
1787,—as $00n as the cold was sutficiently intense for my pur-
Pose;—l set/ about to: repeat: those experiments, in order to con-
vince myself-whether-the-very,extraordinary- fact related; might.
be depended:on; and, with a; view-to removing, as:far-as was-in:
my: power, every Source of: error and deception, I proceeded-in
the-following manner. Having provided/a number of glass. bottles, of the form and;
size- of - what: in England'is called a Florence flask,—blown as:
thin as. possible,—and-of the same shape and-dimensions, Iichose
out from amongst. them-two, which, after using every method-I'
could imagine of comparing-them- together, appeared to be-s0
much alike as hardly to be distinguished. Into one of these bottles, which I shall call A, I put 4107,86
grains-Troy. of pure distilled{ water, which filled it about half
full; and into the other, B, I'put an equal weight of weak spirit'
of wine; and, sealing both the bottles hermetically, and washing
them, and wiping them perfectly; clean and dry.on the outside,
I suspended them to the arms of the balance, and placed-the
balance in a large room, which for: s0me weeks had been-regu-
larly heated every day by a German stove, and in-which the air:
was kept up to the temperature of 61* of FaureNnaT's/ther-
mometer, with very little variation.
