A fundamental principle of all model building is to make The magnitudes of these two step changes make it unlikely

for identifying the boundary conditions where the at the same time. It is important to note that models of australopithecine
time budgets (using baboon and great ape model equations
to find the best biogeographic fit to the known presence/
absence of australopithecines at specific locations in sub-
Saharan Africa) indicate that, as with other living apes (but
not most living monkeys) [58], the australopithecines were
operating at maximum time budget capacity with little or
no time to spare [83]. They would not have been able to
increase their grooming time significantly above the observed
rates in figure 8 without compromising their ability to survive
(as is, in fact, also the case for chimpanzees today [85]). The
subsequent species of Homo appear to be under even more
severe time constraints [20]. This means that these later homi-
nins would not be able to increase their social (or grooming)
time allocation without first finding ways either to reduce
other time budget components (i.e. feeding, moving and rest-
ing time) or to use social time more efficiently (i.e. allow more
individuals to be bonded during the same time period).
