So that in viviparous forms there is a tendency for meta-
morphosis to commence before the escape of the larve from the parent,* the free-
swimming period of those that escape as tadpoles is usually very short (see Table ITT),
while the permanent structures of the larve are at a relatively high degree of differentia-
tion at the moment of settling and fixation. Among the cultures of Molgula citrina made at St. Andrews, however, there was
commonly found, #.e., from 2 to 5 per cent., larvee which underwent all the normal
post-metamorphic growth changes and differentiation including fixation and rotation
associated with the trunk region without there being any absorption of the tail. That
is, phagocytosis and absorption of the tail, and continuous growth and development
of the trunk may be completely dissociated, and this fact will be seen to be of funda-
mental importance when the acceleration of development occurring in compound
ascidians comes to be discussed in the third part of these studies. In the present
connection, however, it is of interest to compare this apparently normal miniature
adult with its persistent tail, with the similar type commonly occurring among those
cultures of Ascidiella and Phallusia already referred to that had been reared in hyper-
alkaline water. Therefore, in general, hyper-alkalinity preventing accumulation of
acid or carbon dioxide in the case of larvee of the Ascidiide and viviparity in the case
of larvae of the Molgulidee seem to produce the same larval modifications.
