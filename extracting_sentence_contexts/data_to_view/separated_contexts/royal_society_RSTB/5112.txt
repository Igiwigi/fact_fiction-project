This cortex is, however,

of the “ Sparganum” type, consisting of parallel plates of sclerenchyma, which do not
anastomose as in the Dictyoxylon type found in Lyginopteris. All such cortex of pterido-
sperms is, however, excluded from consideration by the fact that, both in H1cki1ne’s
specimen and in ours, the thick-walled tissue is seriated and is periderm, whereas in
the pteridosperms it is primary unseriated cortex. The arrangement of the fibrous strands in the “ cortex band” clearly points to a
distorted and fractured Dictyoaylon periderm. A cortex of the “ Sparganum” type,
consisting of parallel radial plates, could be folded by compression, but would not show
the anastomosis presented by our specimen.
