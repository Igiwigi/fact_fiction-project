ration of the low deep-sea temperatures recorded in tropical seas, but © the ERINONES of

=1It is, however, to Lexz (who had, in his previous papers of 1831 and others, concluded
at the temperature of the ocean decreases with the depth, rapidly at first and then
gadually, until a point of about 36? F. was reached, when it became insensible) that,
Be are indebted for a more special review and discussion of all the facts known up

18454. Speaking of the earlier observations made on the temperature of the seca
8 great depths, he observes:—<© The greater number of these observations, with the
exception of those made by myself, were taken with thermometrographs, and especially
with Six's thermometers. Tt is, however, to be observed that all instruments of this
kind are liable to a source of error which hitherto investigators have not borne in mind,
viz. the compression of the: vessel or the bulb which contains the thermometrical
substance (spirits of wine), particularly by the enormous pressure in depths of several
thousand feet. I was witness of a series of experiments on the action of strong pressure
on a thermometer-bulb, which ParrorT undertook in order to ascertain the influence of
