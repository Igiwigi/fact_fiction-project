The exogenous
growth of this portion of the stem is sufficiently obvious. We have the radiating
arrangement, and the regular increase occurring in the number of vessels in each linear
row, as the stem enlarges its diameter. The new vessels have not been intercalated,
but added to the exterior of each series,â€”a fact often rendered evident by the circum-
stance that, from their walls being less strengthened by ligneous deposits than in the

case of the older vessels, they are much more liable to be disturbed and disarranged by
lateral pressure. 7

* Other specimens haye come under my notice, in which the medullary yessels encroached almost entirely
upon the inner parts of the pith ; nevertheless there remained the central spot, of which the transyerse line
dividing the medulla into two halves is the lateral extension. OF THE FOSSIL PLANTS OF THE COAL-MEASURES, 205

The next distinctive feature in all the examples of this type which I have examined
is seen in the inner and middle bark. Instead of a thick parenchyma, we have here
very little of that tisxue.
