In the case of the first étalon L,, an approximate value of its length was already
known from the mechanical measurements (Table I), and from this the approximate
value of the order for the étalon in the red radiation of cadmium was calculated. The
true value of the order was then derived by the method of coincidences of fractions from
observations in the following radiations, accepting temporarily the wave-lengths
stated below :—

a, Cadmium Red .. ae .. 06488 4696 (Benoit, Fasry & PEROT,
loc. cit.).

a, Krypton Yellow ra .. 0°5870 9154u (PérRarp, loc. cit.).

2, Krypton Green EY .. 0°5570 2892p ot

a2, Cadmium Green Ais .. 0°5085 8224u Fy

4; Krypton Violet - .. 04502 3546» (HumpHReys)*

Lest it be objected that the assumption of these values is, in effect, ‘an assumption of
the result which it is the whole object of the work to obtain, it is pointed out that for
the purpose of applying the method of coincidences of fractions, which is the only
use to which these assumed values are put, it is only the ratios of these values which
need to be known with high accuracy, a quite moderate accuracy being sufficient as
regards their absolute values. And it may be emphasised that as regards the values
quoted, other than the first, it is, in fact, the ratios of these to the first, and not their
absolute values, which have been the direct subject of highly accurate experimental
determinations by previous observers. For the purpose in view an accuracy of 1 part in
