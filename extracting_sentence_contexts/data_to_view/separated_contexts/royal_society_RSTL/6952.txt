The type-pencil, which is to be read per-rotatorily, consists of
© four rays, 8ay a, b, c, d, following each other in uninterrupted circular order, of which
Z two are to bear positive and two negative signs. If the two negative signs fall on a, c
-Z or on Þ, d, the variation-index will be 4, but in the other four cases of incidence 8uch
index will be only 2. Consequently the chance is 2.to 1(*) that the specific maximum,
S which may be 4, is not greater than 2; and consequently the chance that there will be
S four real roots in the equation will be only a chance (too difficult to be calculated, but
E which is a function of the degree of the equation) of the chance 4 that there will be as
S many as four real roots in the equation u7+1u7 —u;,—17=0, where 1, , %, ty , %, are
N

z (®) (*) If a superlinear form of an odd degree contains an odd number of terms, say 2:+1, the greatest yalue
& of the inferior number of like signs is &, and the extreme limit to the number of real roots will be 2&+1.,

= If it contain an eyen number of terms, say 2k, the greatest yalue of the inferior index is k; but for this par-
© ticular case it will readily be scen that a limit may be assigned to the yariation-index closer than that given by
S the rule in the text; in fact the variation-index cannot in that case exceed 2k&—1, which will therefore be the
Ez extreme limit to the number of real roots. Now suppose the canonizant of an odd-degreed function of a, y to
Z have all its roots real, then it may be expresxed by a superlinear form of which the number of terms will be [=] 27+1 or 24, according as the degree is 4i+1 or 4i—1, In the one case the number of real roots cannot exceed

2i+1, in the other 2i—1, Hence the following somewhat curious theorem :
