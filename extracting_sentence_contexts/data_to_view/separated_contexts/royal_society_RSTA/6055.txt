Despite it is permitted by general covariance,
nothing is firmly known about its possible physical origin. The roots of the problem reside in
its interpretation as a quantity which is connected with the vacuum energy density (VED), pyac,
a fundamental concept in quantum field theory (QFT). In fact, the notion of vacuum energy in
cosmology is a most subtle concept which has challenged theoretical physicists and cosmologists
for more than half of a century, especially with the advent of quantum theory and in general
with the development of the more sophisticated conceptual machinery of QFT. The proposed
connection is pyac = A/(872 Gyn), where Gy is Newtonâ€™s constant. Consistent measurements of this
parameter made independently in the last 20 years using distant type-Ia supernovae (Snla) [7,8]
and the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) [9,10], have put the foundations
of the concordance ACDM model of cosmology [2].
