164 DR, C. CHREE: AN ENQUIRY INTO THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP

§ 14. If we compare the results for the mean daily range in Table VII. with those
for the range of the diurnal inequality in Table VI., we see that, though the values
of ain Table VIL. are about double those in Table VI. in the case of D and H, the
increase in b is relatively so much greater that the values of b/a in Table VII. are
some 40 per cent. in excess of those in the earlier table. This means that the
amplitude of magnetic disturbance is in general more enhanced relatively in years of
sun-spot maximum than is that of the regular diurnal inequality. The great rise in
b/a as we pass from the mean daily to the mean monthly range in Table VII. is
evidence of the same fact. That this rise in b/a is not continued, except in H, as we
pass from the mean monthly to the annual range, is at least consistent with the view
that the incidence of exceptionally large magnetic storms is determined by causes of
which sun-spot frequency is no exact measure.

§ 15. Table VIII. supplies information as to the degree of accordance between the
observed values of the ranges and those calculated from the values of a and b in
Tables VI. and VII. Table VIII. is constructed on parallel lines to Table IV.
