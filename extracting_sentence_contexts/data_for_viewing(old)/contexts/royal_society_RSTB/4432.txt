CONES FROM THE BRITISH CRETACEOUS. 393

deduce the size of it from the part shown if he inclines to the belief that it was shaped
like the other members of the family, According to either interpretation the new
cone is very much larger than any other known Bennettites. The ovulate cone of
B. Gibsonianus is little over 20 mm. in diameter, and WreLanp, describing the
most important American form, B. Wielandi, says (1906, p. 109), “The greatest
strobilar diameter, which is somewhat distal, is from 2 to 2°5 cm. exclusive of the
covering of bracts.”

That the portion preserved (which is indicated by unbroken lines in text-fig. 14) was
from the apex of the cone is evident from the following facts: the upper sections, G
and F, contain seeds only (see figs. 4 and 5, Plate 19), while the basal section A
contains nothing but stalks with a few seeds on one side (fig. 1, Plate 19), and these
stalks are cut in true transverse direction, at right angles to those in section AR, in
which they are cut longitudinally ; in the transverse sections the inner seeds are cut near
their bases (see zone 6, text-fig. 24, and Plate 19, figs. 2,3 and 4) and the outer seeds
are cut through their apices (see zone a, text-fig. 2, and Plate 19, figs. 3 and 4). As
WIELAND (1906) pointed out, the seeds only stand vertically at the top of the cones,
the stalks below that bending so as to give a slightly oblique and, still lower down, a
true longitudinal section of the seed in transverse section of the cone. ‘In all the
sections A to G all the seeds are cut in dead-true transverse sections, or in transverse
sections with a minute obliquity.
