and therefore v is an integral of the partial differential equation. We consequently
have the theorem—

integration of a simultaneous system involving fewer independent variables, and

upon the subsequent determination of the arbitrary functions in the integral equiva-
lent of the system. A question therefore arises as to how an integral equivalent
can be obtained.
