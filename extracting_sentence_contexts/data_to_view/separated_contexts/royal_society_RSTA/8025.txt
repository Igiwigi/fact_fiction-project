It is clear that were it possible to assign differing measures
of a priori probability to these simple hypotheses, a principle might be laid down for
determining critical regions, w, for which P (w) would vary from one simple hypothesis
to another. But it would seem hardly possible to put such a test into working form. We have, in fact, no hesitation in preferring to retain the simple conception of control
of the first source of error (rejection of H’, when it is true) by the choice of ¢, which
follows from the use of similar regions. This course seems necessary as a matter of
practical policy, apart from any theoretical objections to the introduction of measures
of a priori probability.

(b) Similar Regions for Case in which H', has One Degree of Freedom. We shall commence with this simple case for which the series (68) becomes

We have been able to solve the problem of similar regions only under very limiting
conditions concerning po.
