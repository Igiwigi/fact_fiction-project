The results are again given in table 14 and show that even were the average size of
Micraster coranguinum the same as that of M. senonensis the two species would still differ

g in breadth (P<0-0005), height (0-05>P>0-01), in the depth of the anterior groove
: (P<0-002) and in the extent of the posterior rise of the test (P<0-002). ‘The two species
g would not differ in the degree of development of the labrum (P> 0-05). Ei Thus in the present instance the differences between the inherent shape of the two
: species are found to be the same by both methods. The fact that they differ both in relative
é height and in the degree of development of the anterior notch would have been obscured
E if the shape comparisons had been confined to taking means of ratios, as is the usual
z practice. This is due to the allometric growth of these two characters, along with the
: difference in size of the two species. VI.
