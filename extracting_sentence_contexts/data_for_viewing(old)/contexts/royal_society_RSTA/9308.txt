As the axial angle ac = 73° 51, this direction, which is that of the first and not the
second median line (the double refraction being
negative), is 18° 47’ from (in front of) the vertical
axis c, and the other extine¢tion in the symmetry
plane is 2° 38’ from (below) the axis a. The two
mutually perpendicular extinction directions in the
symmetry plane are thus not both in the obtuse
