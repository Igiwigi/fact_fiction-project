Consistent with the previous mapping of SPEN to
A-repeat [11], the SPEN-binding sites were clustered in the
A-repeat region, in the variable spacers 2-4 nt from the
5'-end of each repeat (figure 1c). The fixed distance between
the cross-linking sites and the inter-repeat duplex implies a
direct contact with the duplex as well. In fact, Arieti et al. [60]
solved the crystal structure of the SPEN RRM domain and
showed that binding of SPEN to another known RNA target,
the SRA IncRNA, requires both single- and double-stranded
regions. In addition, in vitro gel shift assays suggest cooperation
in the formation of the SPENâ€”A-repeat RNP complex [10]. Taken together, these data support a simple model for the
SPEN-Xist interface, where the stochastic formation of
duplexes among repeats forms a multivalent platform, where
the single-stranded spacers and double-stranded repeats inter-
act potentially with multiple SPEN proteins, which in turn
recruit the histone deacetylase complex (figure 1e).
