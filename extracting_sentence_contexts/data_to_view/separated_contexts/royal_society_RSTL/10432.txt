From this scheme it follows that the coordinates of the edges of the fixed
tetrahedron referred to the other will be («, &,, &g, a4, ;, ag), &. There are other
relations between the constituents of the determinant, due to the fact thab opposite
edges are conjugate polars with reference to the absolute quadric. Thus

<=, b\=g, ce =h, &

Hh=a, M=b, h=c,
If we square the determinant we get
DS=T:

As before we take D=1:; in fact, D is the determinant formed out of the second
minors of A, Whence
D=ALE

Hence if we choose A=1 we must have D=1 also. Each constituent of the determinant D is equal to its minor. Also each minor of D
is equal to its complementary minor. or
