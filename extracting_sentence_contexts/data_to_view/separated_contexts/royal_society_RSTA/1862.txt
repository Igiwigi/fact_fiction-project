It will be noticed
that the constituents of the original note (a) have frequencies which may be written

n+p, 2n+2p,Â° 3n-+3p, | &e.

and these can be associated with components in (c) to give beating at frequency p. This
appears to be the explanation of the curious fact that in an experiment with a current
rich in harmonics the beating heard agrees in frequency with the galvanometer oscilla-
tions p, although with a 8.H. current the beating frequency has the double value 2p. Examination of the above table shows that this abnormal beating at p depends essen-
tially on the co-operation of consecutive harmonics of the original current. In all cases
the ear appears to appreciate only the slowest beats which are present.
