Hence M;5 is the locus of vertices of cones of &. Some of these cones have their
vertices on ¢;. In fact the surfaces [ project from any point P of c, by means of o!
such cones which have all the same vertex P, and which have in common the elliptic
quartic cone Ky by which c, is projected. The section of these is an ordinary pencil of
quadric surfaces. ‘This contains four cones which, joined to P, give the four line cones
of © whose vertices pass through a given point of cs. Any one of the point cones in
question contains two of the surfaces [, say T, and T,, im such a way that planes of
one system of the cone project generators of [', from P, and planes of the other system
project generators of [,; while [,, [, and K, make up the complete intersection of
the point cone with M,*®.
