W. SPOTTISWOODE AND J. FLETCHER MOULTON The first takes place at the moment thab the electricity in the tube passes the spot
where the tinfoil is; the second keeps time with the charging-up of the terminal
which leads to the discharge, and is therefore mos intense at the moment of
discharge. And, further, we have the experimental fact thab under ordinary cireum-
stances these effects are of a diametrically opposite kind. This is, perhaps, the most suitable place for explaining the connexion between
intermittence and sensitiveness in vacuum discharges. The effects observed in
sensitive discharges have been traced in the preceding part of the paper to the
effect of static induction from the free electricity that passes into the tube at each
pulse.
