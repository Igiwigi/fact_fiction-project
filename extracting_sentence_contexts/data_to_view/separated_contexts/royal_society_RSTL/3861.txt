The orders of the metals in the thermo-electric series, at different temperatures, are shown by the points in
which the vertical lines marked with the temperatures Centigrade, are cut by the horizontal and inclined lines
named for the different metallic specimens,

The object to be aimed at in perfecting a thermo-electric diagram, is to make the
ordinates of the lines (which will in general be curves) corresponding to the different
metallic specimens be exactly proportional to their thermo-electric differences * from
a standard metal (P, in the actual diagram). FF 102, 103. Theoretical inferences regarding Electrical Convections of Heat, from

102. 'The thermo-dynamic reasoning adduced above ({y 10 to 15) leads to the
conelusion ({{ 14, 15), that the convective power of the vitreous electricity is greater,
or (which is the same thing) the convective power of the resinous electricity is less, m

in Part I., that the vitreous electricity carries heat with it in copper (F 54), or, as it
may be expressed, the electric convection of heat is positive in copper. From the dia-
gram we infer that it is greater, and consequently positive, in Brass.
