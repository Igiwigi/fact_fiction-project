Some difficulty was felt in determining the last numbers of this experiment, from
the fact that the chloride of potassium had by its great excess converted nearly the
whole of the bromide of gold into the yellow chloride, or still paler double chloride.

THE ACTION OF CHEMICAL AFFINITY. 205

The gradual diminution of power of the chloride of potassium added is exhibited by
the curve in Plate IX. fig. 6.

It was found that bromide of gold was reduced in colour by very small quantities
of hydrochloric acid, or even of the common yellow crystals of the chloride of gold,
