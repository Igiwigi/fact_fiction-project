principal trachez extending longitudinally, one on each'side
of the body, from which other trachez ramify.-' Now cer-
tainly in the gryllotalpa, and, as T have reason to' believe in
many other insects' also, the longitudinal 'trachez bear 's0
small a proportion in their capacity to the aggregate-capacity
of the other trachee, that in such instances they cannot be
called principal trachee. My own opinion is, that these
longitudinal trachez serve as connecting channels, by which
the insect is enabled to direct the air to particular parts, for
occasional purposes.

Though not immediately bearing on the 'present 'point, I
beg leave here to state a fact which I have not seen else-
where noticed, that in the two segments of the body which
carry the middle and hind pair of the true legs, in the larvz of
coleopterous and lepidopterous insects, there are no stigmata,
discernible at least either to the naked. eye, or a common
magnifying lens,

But, to return to the'stigmata' of the gryllotalpa, the first
in order beginning from' the head, is situated very near the
lower part of the posterior ridge of the thorax. This'stigma,
not to object to the term in the present instance, is apparently
connected with all the trachee both of the thorax and of the
head itself. It differs remarkably in size and form' from all
