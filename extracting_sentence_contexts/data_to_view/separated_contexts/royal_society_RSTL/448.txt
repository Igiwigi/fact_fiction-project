The sparks
which are obtained from this 'stone by means of a piece of steel,
have also some appearance of the above colour. These phe-
nomena- may perhaps serve to assist us in acquiring further
knowledge respecting the cause of the phosphorescence of stones,
of which we have hitherto had no very satisfactory explanation. GRAVITY,

The specific gravity of corundum, in its different varieties,
presents a series of interesting facts, particularly when they are
compared with what has been already observed with respect to
its different degrees of hardness. The great interest I have felt
in the study of this substance, has caused me to take particular
care in the examination of such of its properties as might lead
to a perfect: knowledge of it. I will now state the results of
the observations with which the character now treated of has
furnished me.
