This prediction departs from
the mixing-length prediction of Spiegel [3]: in the context of astrophysical fluids, where solid
boundaries are irrelevant, Spiegel assumes that the heat flux is related to the temperature drop in
a way that does not involve the tiny molecular diffusivities. This ‘diffusivity-free’ argument leads
to Nu ~ JRa Pr, that is, y =1/2. While the RB studies do not agree on when and whether RB
convection can achieve a heat transport exponent y greater than 1/3 [4-11], they agree on the fact
that the effective heat transport exponent is always significantly less than 1/2, with experimental
values in the range y € [0.28 — 0.38]. This makes it clear that the relationship between the heat
flux and the temperature difference in experimental RB convection always involves the molecular
diffusivities, either in a power-law or in a logarithmic fashion. With the goal of circumventing the limitations of the RB set-up, we recently introduced
an alternate set-up where convection is driven by internal heat sources and sinks (CISS).
