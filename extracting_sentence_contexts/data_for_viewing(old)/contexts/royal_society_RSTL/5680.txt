MR. C. SPENCE BATE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF DECAPOD CRUSTACEA. 603

© Perceiving that in its passage to maturity the larva of Carcinus passes through forms
that are known to be adult, it is legitimate to infer that those forms hold a lower grade
'the rank of perfect animals than the adult Carcinus. When it first exhibits con-
© litions that approximate to the decapod character, it bears a very close resemblance to the
© miangular Brachyura. This gradually disappears with the development of the hepatic
regions, and the constantly increasing resemblance to the form of the adult.
© The Leptopodiade have generally been ranked by carcinologists as the highest of the
- xrustacean type; but the similarity of their appearance to an immature form of the
© young Carcinus, is a circumstance that must induce the philosophical naturalist to recon-
_— the subject. It is not without a knowledge of the facts upon which zoologists
ve adopted the arrangement, that the above remark is made.
Carcinologists generally admit that consolidation of the nervous system is a marked
5 vation in the character of the animal, and Professor Daxa has enunciated the doctrine.
at * a centralization of the neryous ganglia is true cephalization.”
: It is true that in the Spider-crabs there exists no hollow Space in the centre of the
Zonsolidated ganglia; but those which are thus consolidated homologize with the sepa-
ate ganglia that supply the limbs of the animal with nerves, not with those ganglia that
Supply the organs that are endowed with the power of sensation.
2 This idea receives support from the known characters of the respective animals. The
Fortune of which the Carcimus is placed as the highest form, are active and vivacious
Freatures, whereas the Leptopodiade are inanimate and sluggish, fulfilling in their habits
he existence of the fakirs of eastern tradition; they continue 80 long without move-
