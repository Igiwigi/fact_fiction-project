simple meaning is totally camouflaged. Unfortunately, one sometimes suspects that some devious
writers actually want to make the story seem more complex than it really is.

This brings us to the vital need to keep things as simple as possible, to help both yourself and
your readers. You should, indeed, give yourself every possible help. If this makes your current
hard problem seem easy, it might correspondingly make the next very hard problem manageable.
Keeping things simple applies, in the first instance, to choosing a good notation, where | will
again quote from McIntyre [31, p. 200]:

... bad mathematical notation where four things of the same kind are written as a, M3, £0,
TT{', instead of a, b,c, d,...

I was, in fact, pulled up on something a little like this early in my career on the second page of
Rodney Hill’s aforementioned letter (figure 4), where he commented that my compact notation
‘will give the printers (also) a headache’.


Finally, I must mention a style of showing off and sheer obfuscation that was prevalent
when engineers started to learn about chaos theory, which involved reading some advanced
mathematical books where definitions were quite important. A research student, imitating such
books, would say (in obscure mathematical notation) that the time, t, is an element of the
real numbers lying between minus infinity and plus infinity. Gosh! All this, and just while
studying the oscillations of a driven pendulum. Please keep your level of mathematical precision
appropriate to your problem.
