and the latter factor may be calculated for any angle of incidence.

In the following table the theoretical values of » for various angles of incidence
are compared with the values observed by Sissincu. Here again the theoretical
value of » involves the magneto-optic constant C,e* only by being proportional
to Cy, and a is not involved: thus we have not available any adjustment of x
to improve the agreement, and the test is very severe.

In fact one set of experiments involves C, only, and the other set # only: so
that a complex magneto-optie constant really gives no more opportunity for adjust-
ment than would a real one.
