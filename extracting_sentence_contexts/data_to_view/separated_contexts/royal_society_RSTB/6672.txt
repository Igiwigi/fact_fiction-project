It is more surprising, however, that the curvature of the corpus sterni and the
ventral bending of the keel should appear not only in the explants of the complete
sternum but also in cultures of a single sternal plate. From a study of normal embryonic
development it might have been thought that the curvature of the corpus sterni was
caused by the pressure of the growing viscera. This is disproved by the fact that it
appears in vitro in the complete absence of the viscera, and regardless of whether the
sternum is explanted with the dorsal or with the ventral surface uppermost. DEVELOPMENTAL MECHANICS OF THE AVIAN STERNUM 451

On morphological evidence alone, it seemed likely that the formation of the keel
was related to the growth and development of the pectoral muscles with which it is
so intimately associated, and, as indicated in Part I, the writer herself at first inclined
to this opinion. Experiment showed, however, that the keel can develop in the
absence of these muscles, but this result did not preclude the possible influence of other
extrinsic mechanical factors.
