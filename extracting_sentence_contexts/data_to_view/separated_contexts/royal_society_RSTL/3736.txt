It is stated by Vateniy that in plants, all © secondary deposits” take place in
Spiral lines. I have already remarked, that in animals, spirals have heretofore ap-
peared almost wanting. Should the facts recorded in this memoir, however, be esta-
blished by the researches of other investigators, the question in future may perhaps
be, where is the © secondary deposit” in animal structure, which is not connected
with the spiral form? But more than this: the spiral in animals, as we have seen, is
in strictness not a * secondary” formation ; it is the most primary of all. And the
question now, is whether it is not precisely s0 in plants.
