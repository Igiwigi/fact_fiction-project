observer of class I. there is no sensation of light in the centre, an observer of class IT.
sees a continuous streak of light, the brightness at the centre being little less than
that at the sides. If the intensity is reduced to about one-twentieth of that
required for central extinction for class I., the centre also appears dark for class IT.,
but the sides then are very faint, in fact the threshold is almost reached throughout. Tf a red (SSN 50, 632u‚Äù) spot of light is used, then for both classes the streak of
light looks brighter at the centre than at the sides, whatever the intensity.
