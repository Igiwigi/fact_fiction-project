Mantarp and
Sir Cuatetrer* state that the explosion-wave will be propagated when each layer
Bs brought by compression to its own temperature of inflammation, For hydrogen
"gind oxygen, they find this temperature to be about 550° C., and calculate that a
pressure of 30 atmospheres must be exerted upon the gas to raise it to this point. Brhis temperature may be regarded as the lowest limit of the preliminary heating of
Seach layer before combustion. But having regard to the fact that the individual
Sinolecules of hydrogen and oxygen in a yet unburnt layer may, in the interval of time
Abetween their meetings, be heated above the point at which they combine with each
other, we cannot affirm that this limit of temperature may not be greatly surpassed
in the explosion. Tf we regard the transmission of the explosion to be due to the collisions of the
molecules, and assume that molecules which are chemically inactive towards each
other act as elastic bodies when they come into collision, and that molecules which
combine chemically lose energy of translation and gain energy of vibration, then it
must happen that unburnt molecules come into collision with burnt molecules and take
up their energy in the form of motion. For instance, in the explosion of hydrogen
and chlorine, the energy of the hydrogen chloride formed will be communicated by
