have been observed by the exhibitors of the oxyhydrogen microscope, namely, that
animalcules of kinds which used to be speedily destroyed by the too stimulating
action of solar light, appear to suffer much less from that now substituted, provided
the water in which they are immersed does not become heated thereby.

Parr II. On the Action of Plants upon the Atmosphere.

Having now considered the mode in which light may be supposed to operate upon
plants, I shall next proceed to examine the extent of the changes wrought in the con-
stitution of the atmosphere by the latter, under the influence of this agent.

T say the extent of the changes produced, because no one denies the nature of this
operation, or questions the fact, that carbonic acid is really decomposed, and oxygen
given out, by the green parts of plants under certain circumstances. But, between
the original views of PrIgsTLEY, who saw in this process a counterpoise to the effects
of animal respiration and the like, and those of Er11s, who did not admit it even as
an equivalent to the opposite tendency of vegetable respiration, as carried on during
the absence of solar light, a wide difference exists, and hence some fresh investiga-
tions seem necessary with reference to this question.

On perusing the account, which Mr. Eras, in the Second Part of his Researches
on Air, has given of the experiments by which he attempts to establish this latter
opinion, several circumstances occurred to me, of a nature calculated to throw doubts
upon their conclusiveness. I may mention, for example, in the first place, the small-
ness of the yolume of air in which his plants were confined; in the second, the length
