All the points of a circle are equidistant from the centre; all the tangents are
-Squidistant from the axis, and this distance is the complement of the former distance,
= 216. These properties of the circle lead immediately to the analytical expressions for

=
Jho distances of points or lines in terms of the coordinates. In fact, take

'Z (a, 6,0, F; 9, kx, y, 2)*=0
For the point-equation of the Absolute ; its od will be
Z (A, B, C, F, G, HXE, », Z)*=

Ei he point-equation of the circle having the point (x, y/, 2') for its centre, is
EZ (a, ..X#, 9, 2Y(a, -.X#'; y', 2')* cos? 8—{(@, ...XT, y, 2X, y, 2)}*=0,

Sor
E (a, ..Xz, y, 2Y(a, ...X", y', 2')* 8in* 0—(A, Ay —y'2, 28'—2w, wy —0'y) =
rom which (by the same reasoning as for the case of geometry of one dimension) it
Follows that the distance of the points (a, y, 2), (a, y', 2') is
cos”? (a, I Y, 21”, Y, 2) >
xy (a, 0, y, 2Yv (a, Az,y,0N
or what is the same thing,

V(s, ..Xz, y,2Y (a, Xe, v, 2)?
and it appears from the cosine formula (se ante, No. 208), that if P, P', P” be points
on the same line, then we have, as we ought to have,
Dist. (P, P')+ Dist. (P', P')= Dist. (P, P”).
