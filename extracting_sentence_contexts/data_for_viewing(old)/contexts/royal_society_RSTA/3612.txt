equal to the primitive nucleus composition only for nuclei dominated by clathrate
hydrates. Around perihelion, in the cases of the crystalline and amorphous water ice
structures, the abundances of the highly volatile species released by the nucleus are

systematically lower (by up to one order of magnitude) than the unprocessed nucleus : 8
values. Not only dust mantling but also dust erosion are processes that can strongly Dos
affect production rate ratios. Near perihelion, surface ablation of the dust mantle can [=
become important, which moves the interfaces of sublimation of molecular species closer : S
to the surface, and increases their rate of production and coma mixing ratios relative 2
to water [39]. This process is proposed to explain the strong increase in the column aed

â€”A few observational facts might argue for a primitive diversity. Comet 73P/ DNS
Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, a comet in the carbon-chain-depleted class, underwent : 5
splitting events. If the depletion was just an evolutionary effect, from multiple perihelion 13

passages, we would expect it to be confined mostly to the surface and the interior would
appear typical. However, the fragments were observed to have depletions identical to
those measured before splitting [29]. In addition, the same relative abundances were
measured in the two main fragments for several species observed in the infrared and
the radio [41,42]. Another point arguing for a diversity related to origin is the similar
mean composition and composition diversity measured for short-period and long-period
comets, even for highly volatile species such as HS (the exception being CO, for
which high abundances have been measured only in long-period comets). From this
standpoint, we might expect short-period comets to be more affected by evolutionary
