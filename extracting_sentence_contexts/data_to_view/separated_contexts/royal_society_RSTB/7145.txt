The inner duct, the penis tube, is not developmentally,
as mostly considered, merely the distal part of the ejaculatory ducts, but originates from
a separate invagination here termed the penis invagination, a structure derived from
a single median invagination which appears a little later and quite independently from those
of the ejaculatory ducts. The intromittent organ reaches its greatest development in Anisopus,
where, as in the Tipulidae, it forms a long filamentous projection; nevertheless, not
a growth outwards, but an organ essentially excavated by an intersegmental inflexion, the
genital pouch, part of which forms the large piston apodeme and its walls much of the
pompetta. A large part of the structures surrounding the intromittent organ in the three species
studied, and perhaps in most Nematocera (notably the Tipulidae where the parts are often
very similar to those in Anisopus), are not derived from an appendicular origin but from
intersegmental sclerotizations here termed theca, penis sheath, etc., a fact clearly established
in following the development of these parts in the immature stages. In Chironomus there is
a thecal structure, endotheca, which is tucked inside the penis-tube cavity and is eversible. In Anisopus a thecal sclerotization forms a guide (penis sheath) for the filamentous penis.
