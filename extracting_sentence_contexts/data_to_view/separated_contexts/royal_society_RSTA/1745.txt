A rapid decrease in agreement was observed above
CR = 17, which agrees with the previously discussed findings presented by Zylstra et al. As well
as using direct rather than indirect drive, the work at OMEGA also used conventional DT ice
layers rather than wetted foams. The fact that a similar trend was observed in the OMEGA work
suggests therefore that the observations made by Olson ef al. and Zylstra et al. are applicable
more broadly than to just indirectly driven wetted foam capsules, and also likely applies for
direct-drive ICF. However, it is also clear from ยง2a that 1D performance and yield increase with increasing CR. There is therefore a compromise to be made between improved idealized 1D performance, and
increased agreement between simulation and experiment.
