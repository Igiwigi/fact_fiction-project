108. Acetic acid, then, produced such a change in the colourless globules at the
top of the coagulating blood just mentioned, that I believe them to have been of the
sme kind as certain corpuscles usnally floating in the blood : corpuscles paler than
the rest, and termed * colourless globules.”

109. Are any of the colourless globules in the top-stratum of coagulating blood
concerned in producing the buffy coat? App1s0N believes that they © coalesce” to
form it. ©In a few minutes,” says he, © coagulation commenced in streaks and
films, all of which were evidently composed by the aggregation of the globules.” The
optical instrament used by App1soN was merely a CoppinGrox lens: but the employ-
ment of a compound microscope, with very high magnifying powers, has not enabled
me to detect any other substance than the globules he pointed ont, with the contain-
ing fluid, as giving origin to the buffy coat. 'The fact is, that the globules I met
with were no other than parent cells, more or less adyanced in producing young
blood-dises. In the top-stratuimn I met with a number of these young discs, dis-
charged from their cells, very minute and delicate, and scarcely tinged with red.
When the top-stratum had coagulated, these cells were no longer found : but in their
Stead I saw fibres, such as those in tisswes, known to have their origin in cells: not
in the cell-membranes, which I find to be of very subordinate importance (par. 90),
bat in the dises contained within the cells. These fibres were certainly not produced
by manipulationh. Among the fibres, nuclei were met with, resembling those in the
tissues, which, according to my obseryations, are descended by fissiparons genera-
tion from the nuclei of the original cells (par. 19). In some parts these nuclei were
