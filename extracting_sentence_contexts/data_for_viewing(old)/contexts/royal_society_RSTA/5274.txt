like v? ~ se d>r7>-P;-! =R, regardless of the space dimension. In three-dimensions disclinations
are, however, line defects. In this case, denoting by & the persistence length of the disclinations,
ie. the length scale over which these line defects can be treated as straight lines, the length R
controlling the flow velocity induced by a +3 defect would scale as R ~ &4 log(L/a), with L the
system size and a the core radius. These results could also be obtained on the basis of dimensional
analysis by noting that v* is always proportional to a/n. Because w has dimensions of stress and
7 has dimensions of stress over time, the resulting velocity must also be proportional to a length
scale. This length scale was first noted experimentally by Sanchez et al. [21] and investigated
numerically by Thampi et al. [14,16]. Its nature, however, remains elusive (see §5 for further
discussion on this matter).

The growth of the flow field generated by a defect at large distances can also be cut off by
a frictional force f, =—¢,v as may arise from the fact that the nematic film is confined at an
oil/ water interface [51]. Such a frictional interaction with the subphase removes energy from the
flow at the length scale ¢, = ./7/¢s, thus controlling the decay of the velocity field. Finally, the limit
where the friction dominates viscous forces corresponding to a no-slip Hele-Shaw geometry has
been discussed in detail by Pismen [34]. In this case, the flow generated by a single disclination is
found to decay as ~ r~3 at large distances from the defect.

4. Annihilation dynamics of defect pairs

Here, we discuss the annihilation of a pair of oppositely charged disclinations. The study of the
annihilation dynamics of defect-antidefect pairs is a mature topic in the liquid crystals field
and has been subjected to numerous investigations [43,44,52-56]. In the simplest setting [28],
one considers a pair of k= +4 disclinations located at r+ = (x+,0) and separated by a distance
