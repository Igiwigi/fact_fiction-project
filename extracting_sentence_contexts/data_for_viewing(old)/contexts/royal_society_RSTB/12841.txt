qRT-PCR analysis. Expression of selected transcripts was analysed with cDNA obtained from independent growth of seedlings and was compared to the expression
values obtained from the RNA-seq experiments. Gene expression in NF-treated gun mutants was calculated relative to the NF-treated WT and ACTIN2 as reference
(AAC(t)method). (de) Pearson r > 0.75 indicates a positive correlation between the different datasets and analysis.

a point-mutated C4H gene (figure 1a; electronic supplementary gunt-1, gun5-1, and gun1-1 gun5-1 with the WT in the absence
material, figure S3A/B), showed reduced accumulation of or presence of NF (figure 5). While gun1-1 showed WT-like
anthocyanins compared to WT when germinated in the pres- anthocyanin levels in the control condition without NE
ence of NF (figure 4a). Although anthocyanin accumulation gun5-1 accumulated less anthocyanins, and anthocyanin
was even more impaired in ref3-3 compared to gun1, PHANG deficiency was even more pronounced in gunl-1 gun5-1
expression was suppressed to WT levels after NF treatment plants (figure 5a,b). Stimulated expression of FAB genes

further supported by the fact that diminished anthocyanin treated gun1-1 and gun5-1 accumulated only 60% and 30%,

anthocyanin biosynthesis upon NF treatment, respectively, but NFtreatment. In agreement, expression of FAB pathway
did not trigger a gun phenotype (figure 4d-f). The lack of a genes was reduced to the same extent in both GUN1 alleles
gun phenotype of mutants defective in FAB is in agreement (electronic supplementary material, figure S4D). Stimulation
