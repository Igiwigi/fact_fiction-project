The decrease in size
is not large, being about 1-6 Â°%, for every dioptre of accommodation. If, then, an object
1 cm. long be placed at a distance of 1 m. from the anterior nodal point of the eye, and if
another object 0-5 cm. long be placed at a distance of 0-5 m. from the same point, then the
images formed of these objects on the retina will differ by 1:6 %, because 1 dioptre of
accommodation is required to change the focus of the eye from the more distant to the
nearer object. This fact may be stated in another way: the image of a given object on the
retina increases in linear dimensions by 101-6 %, when its distance from the anterior
nodal point of the eye is halved. The effect of doubling the size of the test object by using
some other distances is shown in table 79. TABLE 79.
