The various strains of the X virus here recorded may all be regarded as of
this nature. Protective inoculation demonstrates that a non-virulent strain affords complete
protection against the most virulent, and that such protection is specific. If such
protection is due, as is suggested, to the fact that the prior attachment of the virus
molecule to the plant protein prevents the subsequent attachment of a second related
strain, then the radicle by which such attachment is attained must be distinct from
that producing virulence. We may designate this as “A” in the X virus molecule. Strains X¥, X°, X, and X¢ of the X virus produce either no visible symptoms under
the Cambridge conditions, as in the case of X”, or various types of mottle, as in the
case of the others; but none of the four strains induce necroses local or systemic.
