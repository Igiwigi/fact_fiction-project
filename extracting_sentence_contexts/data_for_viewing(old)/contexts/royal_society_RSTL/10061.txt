changed, Tt is therefore difficult to form any very certain conelusions as to the
functions of these colourless cells, although probably they form one 80urce of the
colourless blood corpuscles.

The difference in 8ize between the thymic corpuscles and the coloured blood cor-
puscles is seen to be very great in some classes of Vertebrates, and we have no reason
to believe that the one are ever immediately transformed into the other (se Plate 92,
figs. 72, 73, 74, and 75, be and The). x

There is one fact which presents considerable difficultiesâ€”..e., that the blood of the
foetus and of the newly-born animal contains a considerably larger proportion of coloured
to colourless blood corpuscles than is the case in the blood of adults. This was first
noticed by Dxx1s (95), and then by Paxum (96), and yet the thymus is certainly more
active during foetal life and during the first years of growth than it can be during adult
life, when it is composed in a great measure of connective-tissue.

In considering the uses of the cells containing hazmoglobin, it has been stated above
that we find large colourless cells containing masses in shape exactly identical with,
though in size generally smaller than, the coloured blood corpuscles ; and this is true,
not only in all Mammals with circular corpuscles (see Plate 86, fig. 21), but in the Camel
(see Plate 92, fig. 77, d), and also in the Bird, Reptile, and Fish. It is considered by
Korner (97) and most authors that these cells, as found in the spleen where they
