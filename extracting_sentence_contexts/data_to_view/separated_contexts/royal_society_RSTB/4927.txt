it incautious to assert this dogmatically in my paper. As a matter of fact, I have sections
of unincubated blastoderms in which the cells are filled with exceedingly fine grains, just
as you find in the oocytes after the formation of the zona pellucida. At this stage they
are infinitely finer than those I have figured in the primitive-streak stage.” In view of Woopgrr’s work on embryogeny and mine on oogenesis, it seems that the
Golgi apparatus of the young oocytes persists during maturation and fertilization as
fine scattered granules which are included in every blastomere at segmentation.
