the tenfold of the figures resulting from the tabulation of the 30,000 families, we obtain the following
absolute figures for the whole kingdom: 15-19 years, 1490 wives and 393 births; 20-24 years
15,360 wives and 6611 births; 25-29 years, 32,810 wives and 13,032 births; 30-34 years, 38,330 wives
2 and 13,377 births; 35-39, 35,840 wives and 10,598 births; 40-44, 36,740 wives and 6586 births;
D> 45-49, 35,700 wives and 1452 births.

Ro! Mr. Kiser makes on this occasion the just remark that on this base we ought to obtain probabilities
inferior to the reality, in consequence of the fact that the couples married in the year of the census
unduly enlarge the numerator. He therefore undertakes to correct the figures in an approximate
way. Thus, he obtains the following corrected probabilities: 15-19, 41°3 (instead of 264) ; 20-24,
, 51-9 (43°) ; 25-29, 43° (39°7); 30-34, 36° (349); 35-39, 30° (29°6); 40-44, 18:1 (179); 45-49,
: 33 (32). Mr. Kiser mentions in his letter that, in consequence of an error in method, the
probabilities grew somewhat too high, but that this is counterbalanced in some way by the fact that
13 per cent. of the births are wanting. We have further to mention that the author calculated the
probabilities only for those quinquennial groups in which he could observe at least 2000 families.
The probabilities for the married wives of Denmark have been calculated by the Danish Statistical
Office in the ‘ Vielser, Foedsler og Dodsfald i aarene,’ 1880-89 (Kjébenhavn, 1893), p. 13, and refer to
- the legitimate births of 1878-82.
For the calculation of the natality in Alsace and Lorraine, I used—as mentioned above—the statis-
; tical data contained in Mr. Wituetm Srrepa’s ‘Das Sexualverhiiltniss der Geborenen’ (Strassburg,
- 1875, p. 16) and referring to the births of 1872 and 1873. The corresponding figures for the age of
married women I took from the census of December 81, 1871, ‘ Statistische Mittheilungen fiir Nlsass-
Lothringen,’ vol. 4, p. 42 (Strassburg, 1875). The absolute figures are: 15-19 years, 864 wives and
401 births ; 20-24 years, 11,628 wives and 66,576 births; 25-29 years, 30,026 wives and 13,918 births ;
80-34 years, 36,149 wives and 14,026 births; 35-39 years, 35,767 wives and 10,191 births. (The
