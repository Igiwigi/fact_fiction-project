In particular, the first set was formed by
eight helpers, the second by six helpers and two trickers
and so on until the last set was made up of eight trickers. For each set of informants familiarized, 100 episodic belief
networks were generated and their trust factors T were
computed using equation (3.7) and plotted on a histogram. After each set was processed, the memory of the robot was
reset so that the effects of each group of informants could
be analysed individually.
