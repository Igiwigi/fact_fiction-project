per cent. in 1872, and 53'31 per cent. in 1877 ; whereas Agrostis vulgaris has in only
one case exceeded 30 per cent, The table shows that Festuca ovina was neither first,
second, nor third on either plot 11-1, 11-2, 13 or 14, the four plots of the highest
luxuriance of gramineous herbage, and especially of the freer-growing species. Agrostis
mulgaris, however, contributed a much higher proportion of the produce on these plots
(excepting 14) of high gramineous luxuriance, and maturation also, than did Festuca
ovind.
A The general result is, that Festuca oving has gained in prominence on all the
AMeficiently or only moderately manured plots; and it has done 80 the most, other
Ahings being equal, where, with a sufticiency of nitrogenous manure favouring grami-
neous luxuriance, there has been a deficiency of mineral supply preventing matura-
ion, and consequently limiting the power of competition, of the freer-growing grasses.
Sn fact, where the Festuca oving has yielded the highest percentage of the produce, it
Has been with low total yield, and with a very large proportion of dark green, leafy,
5 mature growth. The Festnca ovind also gains where other plants suffer for want of
:Mnoisture ; whilst the Agrostts vulgaris gains (if the other conditions are favourable to
"St) in the wetter seasons.

= The Â«tock of this grass is subterranean, perennial, 80mewhat creeping, but rarely

roducing offsets. "The culms are tufted, 2 to 4 feet high; the leaves flat and broadish.
She root fibres penetrate more deeply than those of F. ovina, but are not 80 much
Shranched. It begins to grow somewhat early and rapidly, and flowers in June.
