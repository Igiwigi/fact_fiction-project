for the bullae in fact sink gradually nearer to the umbilical seam, but in a different plane.)
The maximum diameter of the nearly complete specimen is 165 mm. The chief reasons for assigning this species to Pseudotoites rather than Emileza are: (1) the
restriction of primary ribbing to the outer half of the umbilical wall or slope, leaving
a smooth inner band, which is also characteristic of P. leicharti; (2) the nature of the inner
whorls, which are much less depressed than in Emileia and devoid of primary ribs; (3) the
continuance and coarsening of the characteristic ribbing on the modified adult body
chamber, as in P. leicharti, whereas at the corresponding stage in Emileia ribbing becomes
feeble or disappears. In fact, it is only at the middle stages of growth that Pseudotottes and
Emileia are comparable.
