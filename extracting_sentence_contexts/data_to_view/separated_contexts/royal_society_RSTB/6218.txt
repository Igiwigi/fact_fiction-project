After fixation in 5Â°, mercuric chloride, the mucin
may be preserved exuding between the ciliated cells in great masses, fig. 21, Plate 17
in which state the ciliated cells undergo great compression. As the epithelium of the albumen region, in general, ceases secreting, plasma
cells pass through it in great abundance, from spaces beneath the basement mem-
brane. In fact, during the resting phases of the oviduct, plasma cells increase in
number throughout the connective tissue associated with the tubular glands. Close
examination reveals nests of these cells, which are absent when the glands are active
and the connective tissue spaces are diminished. In several instances, plasma cells
have been found between the bases of ciliated epithelial cells (pl, fig. 9, Plate 14), and
the possibility occurs that these cells, migrating through the epithelium, may be so
crushed and distorted as to resemble lymphocytes, which are the cell-type usually
described in connection with the similar mammalian mucous membranes (BARTLE-
MEZ and BEnsLey (1932)).
