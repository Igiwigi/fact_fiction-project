The elephant seals are usually tagged on beaches on sub-
Antarctic and Antarctic islands, whereas the Weddell seals are tagged on sea ice. Seal data have
been used together with Argo floats to determine the positions of the fronts in the ACC [16]. This
is helped by the fact that many of the frontal areas are biologically productive, and therefore are
good feeding grounds for the seals. While it is possible to target ocean regions and types of area


(frontal zones versus shelf break) by selecting seals by area, age and sex, seals do have a mind of ls |
their own and it can be difficult, if not impossible, to predict exactly where the seals will travel

and obtain data. However, even if seals do not venture far from the location in which they are 3
tagged, they can still provide very useful time series [43] or sections [42] in areas where winter- : s
time data are lacking, and where oceanographic moorings stand a high chance of being damaged <
or destroyed by icebergs. : S

In total, seals have yielded more than 270000 CTD profiles, accounting for more than 70% of 13

CTD profiles south of 60Â°S in the NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) World
Ocean Database (WOD) [38,44].
