Tt appeared probable at the outset that the friction in the microrheometer might be [

due, in a great measure, to the cohesion of the liquid ; and this led me to seek for a i
method of determining the cohesion of all liquids (which has been published else-
where), * but I 80on found that the two phenomena were not comparableâ€”-in fact, the
cohesion had almost no effect in retarding the flow. I need nob quote the work here,
as there will be plenty of proof further on to show the real cause of the retardation. In this paper I shall confine myself to the work I have done on saline solntions, and on
the substance (water) in which the salts are dissolved.
