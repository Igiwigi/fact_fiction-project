This latter condition is known in a
wgriety of Nephrodium Filia-mas. *
g The positions in which sporangia were found on prothalli of Scolopendrium vulgare
fad Nephrodium dilatatum have been fully enumerated, An examination of them
ads to the conclusion that, apart from the fact that the portion of the prothallus on
Thich the sporangia were situated contained tracheides and sometimes bore ramenta,
iâ‚¬ did not present evidence of being a reduced sporophyte. That the peculiarities

j the tissue beneath sporangia are to be regarded as indicating the assumption of

@ the prothallus but also by the occasional association of sporangia with a vegetative
Bud. It need hardly be pointed out that this does not necessitate the assumption
fhat the group of sporangia represents the result of reduction of a bud.t
