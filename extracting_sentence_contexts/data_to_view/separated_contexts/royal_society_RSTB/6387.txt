In later subcultures of line C the length of the cells did not differ much (fig. 28). The values obtained in August compared with those of April show on the whole a

slight decrease in length.

* In all lines the D cells appeared to be considerably smaller than the double length of H cells. This
is due to the fact that only those D cells could stand the pipetting and transferring on glass slides (for
measurement) which had the original hypotheca well overlapped by the epitheca. D cells with the
daughter cells being far advanced in separation broke apart during that procedure and arrived as two
H cells on the glass slide. SOME MARINE PLANKTON DIATOMS 29

There is also no definite correlation between the length of narrow cells and that
of broad cells derived from auxospores.
