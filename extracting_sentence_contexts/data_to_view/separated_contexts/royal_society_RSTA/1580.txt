Except when M is at E, Ont is zero; but with M to the right of E the value of

Oyu is zero, whilst when M is to the left of E, 6x4 = 7. The integral with respect to

plate and cylinder, since it will be found that the resistance in each case is the same when
the flow at infinity is the same. The stream function for the flat plate being
