derable addition-of combustible matter, 'the oxygen employed
was only 4,09. To the rest of Dr. AusTiN's experiments either
one or both of the/above objections are applicable.

The first and most important step, therefore, in the repetition


carbonated hydrogenous Gas. 405

of these experiments, is to determine, whether the carbonated
hydrogenous gas really sustains, by the process of electrization,
a diminution of its quantity of carbon ; because, should this be
decided in the negative, we derive from the fact a very useful
direction in ascertaining the true source of the evolved hydro-
gen. Â» The following experiments were therefore made with
a view to decide this question, and the error of Dr. AusTiN, in
employing too little oxygen, was carefully avoided.*

Experiment 1. In a bent tube, standing inverted over mer-
cury, 94,5 measures of carbonated hydrogenous gas from acetite
of pot-ash, were mixed with 107,5 of oxygen. The total, 20g,
was reduced by an explosion to 128,5, and was farther con-
tracted by lime water to 54. A solution of hepar sulphuris left
only 23 measures.
