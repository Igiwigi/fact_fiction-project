From these considerations, I think it will appear, that any
successful attempt to embody into language those fleeting
laws by which the genius of the inventor is insensibly guided
in the exercise of the most splendid privilege of intellect,
would contribute more to the future progress of mathema-
tical science than any thing which has hitherto been accom-
pliched. Amidst the total absence of all attempts of this
kind, the following illustrations of one of the most obvious
assistants of the inventive faculty, will not, I hope, be consi-
dered useless, even though it should have no other effect than
that of directing the attention of those who are engaged in
mathematical enquiries, to: this most interesting and-impor-
tant subject. At our first | entrance into‚Äù algebra, one' of the- most
remarkable circumstances which presents- itself is, that
some fractions which in certain cases apparently  vanish,

have in fact a finite value. Such is the fraction = which
when z=0 becomes _ = =, and yet its real value is well

known to be log. +. Here then by assigning a certain value to a variable quan-
tity which is capable of all degrees of magnitude, the expres-
sion apparently becomes illusory: let us now examine a
parallel case in the Calculus of Functions.
