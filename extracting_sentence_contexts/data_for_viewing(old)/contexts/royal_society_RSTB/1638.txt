endelymphatieus ; bence it must follow that each succulus will be affected by any
such disturbances to an equal extent and at the same moment,

Tt may be well to emphasize the fact that, whatever may be the force whieh sets
the Weberjan ossicles ti motion, there are no obvious adaptations for increasing its.
intensity in the couree of transmission to the sensory epithelium of the inner ear, and
if, as we believe will prove to be the case, it is the variations in the volume of the gas
contained in the air-bladder under the influence of different hydrostatic pressures,
which condition the lateral expansion or contraction of the anterior chamber, it is
obyious that the foree exerted on the Weberian ossicles will be too considerable for
there to be any use of increased leverage in order to nuginent. the impulse imparted
to the fivids of the internal ear. We shall again refer to this point in discussing
Weesnr's auditory theory of the fiction of these ossicles.

On the whole, and apart from any predisposition in favour of any particular theory,
the impression left upon our minds by Â» consideration of the extent to which the
physiology of the Weberian mechanism is conditioned by the more obvious features
in its structure and relations tu the air-bladder is, that iv is notadapted for the
transmission of the smaller changes of whatever nature that may take place in the
condition of the gaseous contents of the air-bladder; still less is the mechanism
adapted for the transmission of any rapid vibratory impulses that may be con-
municated to the contained gases; on the contrary, the mechanism would seem to be
alimirably fitted to acquaint the Pish with the occurrence of the grosser volumetric
variations that fvom time to time may affect the entire gaseous contents.of the air
bladder.
