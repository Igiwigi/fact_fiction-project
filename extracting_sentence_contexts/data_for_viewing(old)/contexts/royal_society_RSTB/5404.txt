water. The ovarian history of these structures has been described well by WernickE
(1919) and it appears that all follicle cells are rudimentary ova, that the chorion is
formed probably as a precipitation membrane by the outer follicle cells, and that the
inner follicle cells, or “ test cells ’’ as they are often mistakenly called, are enveloped
by the growing ovum, supply it with lipoidal (Harvey, 1927) and possibly other
secretions, and at the end of the growth phase are extruded. For details the reader
is referred to the original papers.

The perivitelline space and the outer follicle cells are important from the point of
view of the floatation of the egg in that they lessen the specific gravity of the egg as
awhole. The egg of Ascidiella aspersa and Corella willmeriana* are the only two so far
discovered that float to the top of still water, and those of the first will sink very quickly
if the follicle cells are washed off. As a matter of fact the tendency to float of the eggs
of C. willmeriana has resulted in this species being viviparous, for Cu1Lp shows that
the adult habitat is such that the siphons are directed downwards, and the buoyant
eggs float away from them and so are retained within the atrial cavity until they are
hatched. In most other cases, the eggs sink more or less slowly in still water but are
caused by very slight agitation to rise from the bottom. This response to agitation is
lost if the follicle cells are detached. The floatatory function of these cells is apparently
due to their very great vacuolisation (cf. Wernick, Harvey and others), and this
may be seen in the living egg of those species in which the outer follicle cells are large.

The perivitelline space is formed after the egg is shed from the oviduct and during
the first two hours it lies in sea water. It is due to the osmosis of water produced
