For the case where m> 1 the asymptote of the curve relating 7, and S' is the line of
slope 1/m, and the calculated curve will never have a slope greater than this value. The
slope of the curve on which the observations lie, however, has a minimum slope > 0-97.
This means that if there is an increase in velocity on passing through the interface, its
magnitude cannot be greater than 0-03V,,. For the case where m<1 the asymptote is
a line of unity slope which does not pass through the origin. The displacement of the
asymptote is such that a decrease in velocity on passing through the interface greater than
0:05Vy, would be conspicuous.

The fact that the scatter is large and number of observations small at the greater values
of T, results in uncertainty in the gradient of velocity at the shallower depths of penetra-
tion of the rays. This uncertainty is further increased by the fact that 0S/@a becomes
smaller as @, increases, and therefore as T,, increases. This results in the calculated curves
for differing gradient values converging on one another as the range increases.

It is, however, apparent from figure 14, in which the depth of penetration for station 2
is plotted against 7â€™, for a gradient of 2-5/s, that the uncertainty is confined to a depth not
greater than 100 ft. Further, changes in velocity within this thickness would be con-
spicuous (except if there were a continuously changing gradient which changed sign
within this thickness) in the same way that sudden changes on passing through the water
to sea-bed interface would be apparent.
