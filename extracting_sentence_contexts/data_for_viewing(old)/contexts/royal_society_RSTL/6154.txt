618 PROFESSOR BEALE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF NERVES

Conclusions.

'The most important facts which have been elucidated in this inquiry appear to me to
be the following :—

1. That nerve-fibres in muscle and in some other tissues, if not in all, may be traced
into, and are directly continuous with, a network formed of oval nuclei and intermediate
fibres.

2. That the organs by which nerves are brought into relation with other textures,
and the agents concerned in the development of nerves and the formation of new fibres,
are the little oval bodies or nuclei which are present in considerable number in the
terminal ramifications of all nerves. A great number of these bodies 1s associated with
exalted nervous action, while, where sparingly found, we may infer the nervous pheno-
mena are only imperfectly manifested.
