In the most general problem four sets of functions will be required, two sets u, and
two v,. These may be found from two fundamental functions by giving ¢ two special,
suitable values. The method of solution is the same as before, for the infinite plate; but it
is, in general, complicated by the fact that four sets of unknown coefficients will have to
be evaluated by the successive approximations.

2. Two EQUAL CIRCLES IN AN INFINITE PLANE

Let the co-ordinate systems associated with the circles as shown in fig. 1 be defined by

=a, 2 a 1! (2-1)
y

Fic. 1

We then have invariance for reflexion in a line parallel to the y axis midway between
the centres. If the centres are at a distance 4 apart, the relation between z and z’ is
z’ =—(Z+4).
