ment which a physiologist may have produced to thwart her
designs. In the first case, she may be provided with an expe-
dient; in the last, she will probably be left without resource.

Here again we may notice the experiment mentioned by
Nucx, which, though under similar circumstances, was at-
tended with a different result. Some who feel themselves
disposed to venerate his authority, will probably oppose his
experiment to mine, and think it incumbent on me to account
satisfactorily for the difference. I can by no means acknow-
ledge such an obligation; for to confer validity on experiment ]
by reasoning, is to inyert the order of inquiry, and support
facts by conjectures. It is sufficient for my credit to be able
to adduce evidence of the truth of what I advance, and for |
this evidence I rely on my preparations. '

The train of reasoning which I have lately pursued, led me |
to extend my inquiries into this particular question still fur-
ther; and as in the last experiments the vesicles were known
to be just on the point of bursting before the tube was cut |
through; the next step in the inquiry appeared to be, to deter- |
mine the consequences of dividing the tube a short time after
the rudiments of the foetus had passed. Will the procreative
operations be s1spended, if the tube be cut through after the
ovum 1s deposited in the uterus ?
