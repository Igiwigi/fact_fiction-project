Other paradigmatic examples for recurrence domains are, for example, the Lorenz
wings centred around the unstable foci of the Lorenz attractor [12], or saddle sets (such as saddle
nodes or saddle tori) that are connected by stable heteroclinic sequences (SHS) as shown in figure 1c
[10,42,43]. In a recent study [38], we have proposed a method for the detection of recurrence domains
by means of symbolic dynamics [4446]. Our approach is motivated by the fact that a
recurrence Rj = 1 leads to overlapping e-balls Be (xj) M Be(xj) # Y that can be merged together into
equivalence classes, which eventually partition, together with their complements and the still
isolated balls, the phase space into its respective recurrence domains. Merging Aj = Be(x;) U Be(xj)
into a set Aj if states x; and x; are recurrent (Rj; = 1) and if i> j, we simply replace the larger time
index i in the RP R by the smaller one j. Let P = {Ay C X|1<k <n} be a finite partition of the
phase space X into n disjoint sets Ay.
