They both give rise, when present in strong solution,
to the development of some contracture, a phenomenon which cannot be ascribed to
acetone. . During the course of this research it has been sought to explain the nature of .
muscle contracture, and it has been determined that the phenomenon is probably due |
to direct irritation of the nerve end plates, the irritant in the case of these oximido-â€”
bodies, being an aldehyde, or, perhaps, more accurately, the COH group. In support of this contention several facts may be here adduced. . |

It is an active process associated with an increased formation of heat. The development of contracture is prevented by curare. . A primary increase of irritability in the nervous path of muscle-nerve preparations
can be traced to the end plates. .
