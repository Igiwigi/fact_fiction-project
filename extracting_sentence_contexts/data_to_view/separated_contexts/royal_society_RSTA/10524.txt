Its effects, at some distance inside the cylinder, will therefore be
small compared with the effects of the large and unbalanced lateral distribution
of shear. We notice that, for so short a bar, the lateral contraction is very much less than
the contraction we should expect according to the “uniform tension” theory. In
fact it never amounts to 60 per cent. of that contraction. For points deeper in the
material, the contraction is much smaller than this. Thus, for 7 = (2) a, the lateral
contraction is 22 per cent. and for 7 = (‘4) a it is 9 per cent. of what it should be on
the “ uniform tension” hypothesis, This seems due to the fact, in itself extremely

remarkable, that there are considerable radial and cross-radial tensions inside the
material.
