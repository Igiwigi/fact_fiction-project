XVI. An Eighth Memoir on Quantics. By A. Caviey, F.R.S.

Received January 8,—Read January 17, 1867,

"Tux present Memoir relates mainly to the binary quintic, continuing the investigations
in relation to this form contained in my Second, Third, and Fifth Memoirs on Quantics ;
bye investigations which it contains in relation to a quantic of any order are given with
Sriew to their application to the quintic. All the invariants of a binary quintic (viz.
tEose of the degrees 4, 8, 12, and 18) are given in the Memoirs above referred to, and
o the covariants up to the degree 5; it was interesting to proceed one step further,
. to the covariants of the degree 6; in fact, while for the degree 5 we obtain 3 cova-
rants and a single syzygy, for the degree 6 we obtain only 2 coyariants, but as many as
Tesyzygies ; one of these is, however, the syzygy of the degree 5 multiplied into the
quintic itself, so that, excluding this derived syzygy, there remain (7—1=) 6 syzygies of
(He degree 6. The determination of the two covariants (Tables 83 and 84 post) and of
te syzygies of the degree 6, occupies the commencement of the present Memoir,
he remainder of the Memoir is in a great measure a reproduction (with various
ditions and developments) of researches contained in Professor SYLVESTER'S 'Trilogy,
md in a recent memoir by M. Hermmre*, In particular, I establish in a more general
fg@m (defining for that purpose the functions which I call * Auxiliars”) the theory which
the basis of Professor SYLVESTER'S criteria for the reality of the roots of a quintic
eguation, or, say, the theory of the determination of the character of an equation of any
ofler. By way of illustration, I first apply this to the quartic equation ; and I then apply
