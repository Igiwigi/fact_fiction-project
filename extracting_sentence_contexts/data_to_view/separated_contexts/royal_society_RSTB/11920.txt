Indeed, examples of bacterial host shifts in which the ances-
tral (donor) host has been identified are largely limited to
the jumps of S. aureus between livestock and humans, the
shift of M. gallisepticum from livestock into wildlife and the
shift of Helicobacter pylori from humans to large felines [59]. Although we have suggested three hypotheses to explain
the lower likelihood of bacterial pathogens to evolve special-
ization in novel hosts, we cannot rule out the possibility that
the reduced number of bacterial host shifts also stems, in part,
from a taxonomical artefact. Indeed, while many bacterial
‘species’ display a broad host range and are considered
multi-host parasites [51,60], there is growing evidence that
individual clones, strains or populations of these species
are, in fact, host-specific and show little evidence of host shar-
ing [61]. Comparative studies considering bacteria by their
species names may, as a result, underestimate the number
of distinct lineages in circulation [62], and therefore of host
shift events. Either way, using a modelling approach, we
show that the ability of bacterial pathogens to routinely
deal with environmental variation, as well as their mode
and tempo of molecular evolution are, in any case, likely to
reduce their propensity for host specialization.
