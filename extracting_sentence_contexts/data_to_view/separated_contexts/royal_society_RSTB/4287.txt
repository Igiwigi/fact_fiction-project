The facet for the lower canine on
the mesial (medial interstitial) surface is placed very definitely on that border of the
tooth and not on the lingual surface, and is, furthermore, separated from the facet of
the premolar on the distal surface by a very appreciable interval, namely, the breadth
(mesio-distal diameter) of the tooth between these mesial and distal facets. Fic. 5.â€”Normal human teeth in occlusion, A, labial aspect; B, lingual aspect ; I,, median incisor ;
I,, lateral incisor ; C, canine; Pm, first premolar ; Pag, second premolar. The conclusions to be drawn from these facts are of the utmost importance. Deductions may be made from such facets with especial confidence in considering
the teeth of more primitive races and anthropoids, since there is much better agree-
ment between the maxillary and mandibular teeth in these instances than in modern
types, such as the European. The condition and position of the facets of wear are
identical on both the canine teeth, so that the possibility of some individual
abnormality in their mandibular opponents may be excluded as an explanation of
these peculiarities.
