As for the scalar problem, this implies that the u-components are only slowly varying near the
fast field Ir. Consequently, they are to leading order constant in I¢, that is 14,2 = i11,2 + O(e) in Ip.
As a result, the accumulated change of w; during a passage through the fast region I is to leading
order given by Agwy (ii, 12) := —eaG (uy, uz) and similarly Agw2(i11, U2) = —(e/VD)BGo(ii1, 2).

The fact that the u-components are to leading order constant over the fast field If implies that
the u-components of the stable manifold W* and unstable manifold W" (3.4) need to match at
x=0. This gives vj = v4 and v2 = v3 and consequently (i11, 2) = (int, + volts 4, vit + V2Uy ,)-
In addition, to account for the change of 7,2, or v1,2, over the fast region I;, we get

Each equation determines a (collection of) curve(s) in the (v1, v2)-plane that, typically, intersect
(transversally) several times, say at (vy , v5 ),j=1,...,J. In the singular limit ¢ > 0, this yields
