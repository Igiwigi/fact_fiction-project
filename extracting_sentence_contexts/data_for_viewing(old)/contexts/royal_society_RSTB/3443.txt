the body of the leech; these are more marked during the earlier stages of feeding.
Hemiclepsis does not possess jaws or teeth.

More than 70 young leeches from 12 different broods were fed on clean goldfish,
and none of them developed flagellates. With the exception of four individuals,
which were examined before they had fed, all these leeches were allowed to remain
for a varying number of days after their first feed, in order to permit the flagellates,
if any were present, to develop and multiply ; some specimens were kept till after
their second clean feed. Neither trypanosomes nor trypanoplasms ever appeared in
any of these control leeches. This result, taken in conjunction with the precisely
similar experience of Brumpr(1), who carried out analogous experiments with over
a hundred young individuals of this species, seems to establish the fact that, in the
case of Hemiclepsis marginata, trypanosomes and trypanoplasms are not transmitted

trom parent to offspring. It may be mentioned in passing that every “wild”
Hemiclepsis hitherto examined has shown a greater or less infection with either
trypanoplasms or trypanosomes or both.

Having established that the young leeches were clean, it remained to use them as
the vehicle of transmission and to observe the features of the process.
