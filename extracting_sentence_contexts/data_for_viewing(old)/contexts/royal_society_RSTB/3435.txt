earlier contributions Gury states that the parathyroids left in the rabbit after
removal of the thyroid undergo a more or less complete transition into thyroid tissue.
This view, subsequently abandoned by Giey himself, has been recently revived by
Kisut, and by Vincent and Joniy, who found that parathyroids left behind in the
eat after removal of the thyroids developed into thyroid tissue, implying a close
morphological and functional relationship between the two kinds of tissue. This view
has been supported by Forsyrm from the standpoint of comparative anatomy, and
the present communication, though offering views differing in some essentials from
those of the last-named author, furnishes further evidence in the same direction.

During the time I have been occupied with this research, other workers in the
laboratory have been performing extirpation experiments, and it has occurred to me
that probably a collection of the known facts concerning the anatomy of the thyroid
and parathyroids might be of considerable practical utility to experimenters.

The literature of the subject is enormous, and although I have striven to make
myself acquainted with as many as possible of the important papers, I beg that any

unintentional omissions may be pardoned.

Absolutely fresh material was fixed in Flemming’s fluid (strong formula), Zenker's
fluid, saturated solution of corrosive sublimate, and other recognised fixatives. It
was dehydrated by gradually increasing strengths of alcohol, and embedded in
paraftin of a melting point of 48°C. The saturation in paraffin did not last more
