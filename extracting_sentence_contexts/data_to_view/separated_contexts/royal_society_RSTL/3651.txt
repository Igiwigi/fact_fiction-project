M. Bior, in the memoir already referred to on M. Merront's experiments, is 80
sensible of these difficulties, that he has contented himself with arbitrarily dividing
the incident heat into three kinds or qualities as respects extinction, calculating by
a Separate law for each, and assuming the sum as the representation of the trans-
mitted heat; a process by which, no doubt, almost any series of facts might be re-
presented, and which therefore gives very little information as to the real law of ex-
tinction.

89. I have spent much Jabour on the same snbject, of which it would be out of
place here to detail the results. I have indeed obtained a form which contains only
three constants, and which expresses tolerably the law of extinction of heat in solid
media.
