In the first place, he does not consider that the statement made in the ‘ Ingolf

plates, holds. #. acutus, at any rate when full grown, can have a few of these spines,
but they are never numerous as in Z. esculentus, and they do not appear at such a
‘young stage. This means that when these spines are found in E£. aeutus they do not
indicate hybridization with FZ. esculentus.

Secondly, the suggestion that the two forms are only varieties of one species is ruled
out of court by the facts of distribution. On the Swedish coast L. esculentus alone
is found, but in the more open sea E. acutus also occurs. Similarly, at Port Erin, in
the Irish Sea, and at Millport, in the Clyde, £. eseulentus is found without FZ. acutus.
In the Mediterranean, on the other hand, FE. acutus is present but not /. esculentus.
This distribution alone seems to warrant the separation of the two species.

Plate 25, figs. 108-117, show a series of specimens from the typical 2. eseulentus
(Plate 25, fig. 108) to the typical H. acutus (Plate 25, fig. 117), with intermediates
between. Plate 25, fig. 108, is FE. esculentus of the typical form, and has a large
number of buccal spines. Plate 25, figs. 109-112, may perhaps be hybrids, but are
nearer to H. acutus than to E, esculentus. The secondary aboral spines are, however,
more developed than is usually the case in H. acutus, and the primaries are less
prominent. The long white spines on the ambitus and the few (Plate 25, figs. 109
