W. WHEWELL ON TIDE OBSERVATIONS

promontories under certain circumstances. 'Thus at the south-east point of Ireland;
(at Arklow, Glynn, and Cahore,) the greatest range is not more than three feet, while
at a little distance along the coast each way it becomes twelve or thirteen feet: and
this 8mall amount of the tide on one side of the channel is the more remarkable,
because it is just opposite the enormous range which occurs in the Bristol Channel. In order to exhibit the succession of facts of this kind, I have drawn out Table X.,
in which the greatest and least range at each place of observation in June 1834 and
1835 are recorded. 'The agreement of the two years with one another in the cases in
which observations have been made in both, shows that these observations are en-
titled to considerable confidence. It may be observed, moreover, that the formule
which have been obtained from the best discussions of tide obseryations do not lead
us to expect a complete coincidence of the range in the two years.
