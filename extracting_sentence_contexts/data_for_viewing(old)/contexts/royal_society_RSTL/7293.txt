=XW'+YZ —ZY'—WX';

and similarly writing

0, 7 -D —_ 0, hk, — 0
—n,-j, f, 6 Sp fe
—Mm, —i, &, @ —m, =, @, @

we obtain with the s coefficients the equivalent result,
XW'+YZ —ZY'—WX'=au'+y7—27/—us,

We thus see conversely that the Hermitian matrix is in fact the matrix for the auto-
morphic transformation of the function aw' +yz'—2y/—wwa.

22, Considering any two or more matrices for the automorphic transformation of s8uch
a function, the matrix compounded of these is a matrix for the automorphic transforma-
tion of the function—or, theorem, the matrix compounded of two or more Hermitian
matrices is itself Hermitian.

23. I take the opportunity of mentioning a theorem relating to the matrices which

present themse]yes in the arithmetical theory of the composition of quadratic forms.
