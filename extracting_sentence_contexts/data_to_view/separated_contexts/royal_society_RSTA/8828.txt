Here it will be sufficient to indicate the nature of the problem and to deal
with the material so far as to give confidence in the results as to the assignment of
series and especially as to accurate determinations of the oun and the various links. As vacuum tube spectra approximate to the spark type, the difficulty of drawing
definite conclusion from the existence of a triplet separation is again enormously
increased by the presence of the link relations which these spectra show. In are
spectra the appearance of a », or », separation may always with some certainty be
ascribed to the fact that the lines in question are directly connected with series terms.

* A case in point is F; (5) and F,(17) in the series next considered ; also F's (13) and Fe (19).
