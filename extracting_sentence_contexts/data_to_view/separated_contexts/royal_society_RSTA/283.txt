(2s)? (2f)*3s configuration, the
phenomenon will involve capture of a / electron. For such a case the attachment coefficient
behaves like £ for small electron energies} (Massey & Smith 1936), and this, together with
the fact that the frequency of the radiation emitted (which will be very small for slow elec-
trons) enters the transition probability as v3, renders the process most infrequent for such
electrons, even allowing for possible radiative stimulation. On the other hand, if the excited
state belongs to the (1s)? (2s) (26)® configuration a radiative transition involving two
electrons would be concerned in the attachment process.
