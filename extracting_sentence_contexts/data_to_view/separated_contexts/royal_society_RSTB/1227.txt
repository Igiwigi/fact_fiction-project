It thus appears that in Hquisetum,
mn, Tmesipteris, and Ophioglosswm, all types in which the sporangia are closely
d together so as to form synangia, a considerable proportion of the potential
ous tissue is sterile, the cells yielding up their substance to nourish their
which develop as mature spores. This cannot be looked upon as a mere
ce; it demands careful consideration, both from the physiological and

ogical aspects.
the physiological point of view the sterile cells act the part of a diffused
tum; they become disorganized, and the substances which compose them are
nm up into the developing spores. Developmentally they are sister cells with
which produce spores,—they are, in fact, potentially sporogenous cells, and the
on may be asked, why they do not develop as such. It would appear that
f nutrition determines the matter, and I think the state of the case is probably
: these plants have increased the bulk of their potential sporogenous tissue
the point at which it can be wholly matured, and the result is an arrange-
7 t by which the number of spores actually produced can be advanced to the

t figure which the plant will be able to ripen. In Psilotum it has been
