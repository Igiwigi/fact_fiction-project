contact with the surface;” these may be called Principal Tangent Conics. In this
investigation I have adopted a method analogous to that employed in my paper * On
the Sextactic Points of a Plane Curve ” (Philosophical Transactions, vol. clv. p. 653);
and as I there, in the case of three variables, introduced a set of three arbitrary constants
in order to comprise a group of expressions in a single formula, s0 here, in the case of
four variables, I introduce with the same view two sets of four arbitrary constants. If
these constants be represented by «, 3, y,d; &«, B, y, 2, I consider the conic of five-
pointic contact of a section of the surface made by the plane @—#kT'=0, where
wm=ar+By+y:+Þt, and o'=e'v+8'y +72 +0t, and þ is indeterminate ; and then 1
proceed to determine +, and thereby the azimuth of the plane about the line @=0,
w'=(), 80 that the contact may be six-pointic. The formulz thence arising turn out to
be strictly analogous to those belonging to the case of three variables, except that the
arbitrary quantities cannot in general be divided out from the final expression. In fact,
it is the presence of these quantities which enables us to determine the position of the
plane of section, and the equation whereby this is effected proves to be of the degree
10 in @: @'=h, and besides this of the degree 1224—27 in the coordinates T, y, 2, t,
giving rise to the theorem above stated.

Beyond the question of the principal tangents, it has been shown by CLepscn and
SALMON that on every surface U a curve may be drawn, at every point of which one of
the principal tangents will have a four-pointic contact. And if # be the degree of U,
that of the surface S intersecting U in the curve in question will be 114 —24. Further,
it has been shown that at a finite number of points the contact will be five-pointic. 'The
number of these points has not yet been completely determined; but CLepscn has shown
(Crelle, vol. lviii. p. 93) that it does not exceed n(112—24) (14n—30). Similarly it
