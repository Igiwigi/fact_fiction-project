5. Chemistry of the thermosphere and ionosphere

An ionosphere can form in the thermosphere and upper stratosphere of Uranus and Neptune
from the interaction of the atmosphere with extreme ultraviolet radiation and X-rays. Galactic
and solar cosmic rays can also ionize species down to tropospheric levels [193]. lonospheric
models of Uranus and Neptune have been developed by several groups [137,150,191,193-199].
Above the methane homopause at the top of the stratosphere, the ionosphere is dominated
by H* and Hj, which form the main ionospheric peak; some amount of H30* and HCOT is
expected to be present, as well, depending on the external oxygen source and vertical profile. A
secondary ionospheric peak forms in the lower thermosphere and upper stratosphere, populated
by hydrocarbon ions (figure 7). Ablated refractory debris from micrometeoroids could deliver
metal vapours [174], whose long-lived atomic ions could potentially replace hydrocarbon ions
in this secondary peak [191]. In fact, Lyons [191] suggests that sharp electron-density layering
in the lower ionosphere of Neptune and the other giant planets, as seen from the Voyager radio
occultation experiment, could be caused by Mg* or other long-lived ions being compressed by
horizontal winds with vertical shears (e.g. gravity waves) acting in the presence of the planet's
magnetic field (see also [200,201]).

Of all the ionic species predicted to be present on the Ice Giants, only Hj has been detected,
and only on Uranus [37,69,71,72,76,199,202-204]. Observations of Hy have provided a useful
probe of thermospheric conditions on Uranus. For example, thermospheric temperatures derived
from Hy observations have been observed to vary with time [76,204]. The long-term trends
in thermospheric temperature variations are interesting and appear to be real. Moore ef al.
[194] caution that solar-zenith angle effects resulting from the changing seasonal geometry
of the planet, combined with temperature gradients and Hj abundances that change with
