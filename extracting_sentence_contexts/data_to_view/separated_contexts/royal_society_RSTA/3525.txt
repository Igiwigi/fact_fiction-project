In contrast to the above deterministic case, this table demonstrates that in no scenario is
there any conventional network investment needed to cope with the uncertainty levels faced by
the planner in the first epoch. Indeed, the model determines that epoch 1 is too early to decide
whether to invest in a long power line (commissioned at the beginning of epoch 2) that may
end up stranded under the realization of scenarios 1 and 2 where solar power emerges right at
the location of consumption. Rather, the stochastic approach chooses to ‘wait and see’ and thus
potential network congestions (under scenarios 3 and 4) are managed in the operational time scale
through smart technologies such as FACTS/QB devices that can be chosen and quickly installed
right in epoch 2. This solution is complemented later on with a battery storage plant to face larger
amounts of wind power that materialize towards the end of the analysed planning horizon, also
considering the drop in cost of batteries in the meantime. It is important to point out that table 3 shows the costs associated with the best expansion plan
for each scenario considered by the planner to characterize the uncertain future.
