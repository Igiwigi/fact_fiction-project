T have deemed it- important to attempt the solution of a problem of the highest
interest in itself and of the greatest importance to the accuracy of many fundamental
determinations in physics and chemistry, but which, so far as I know, has never been
made the subject of direct investigation. It is to ascertain whether mercury has to any
extent the property of absorbing gases in the same manner as water and alcohol. The
fact that gases like ammonia, which are largely absorbed by water, may be readily col-
lected and preserved over mercury, and the absence of any diminution of volume in
gaseous mixtures standing for long periods of time over mercury, rendered it highly
improbable that any such absorption would take place. It was, however, important to
ascertain whether under great pressures any indications of absorption could be found. The following is the way in which T have attempted to resolve this question.
