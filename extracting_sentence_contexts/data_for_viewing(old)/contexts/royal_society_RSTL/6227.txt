In describing the general character of the action of dibromide of ethylene upon tri-
ethylphosphine, I have mentioned that, in addition to the monatomic and diatomic
bromides, which are the principal products of the reaction, secondary compounds may be
formed, but always in comparatively small quantities. The mother-liquors generally
contain oxide of triethylphosphine, formed by the action of the atmosphere; they contain,
moreover, bromide of triethylphosphonium, if the dibromide had not been carefully
deprived of hydrobromic acid. The bromide of triethylphosphonium, however, under
certain conditions, arises from the scission of dibromide of ethylene into hydrobromic
acid and bromide of vinyl, the latter producing in this case the bromide of vinyl-
triethylphosphonium. I had an opportunity of establishing this fact experimentally,
when preparing a considerable quantity of the dibromide of the diphosphonium. 'The
Phosphorus-base having been employed in excess in this operation, not a trace of the
bromethylated monophosphonium had been formed, the absence of which was carefully
proved by a special experiment. The bromides were then transformed into chlorides
and the latter precipitated by dichloride of platinum ; the mother-liquor filtered off from
the copious precipitate of the diphosphonium-salt was considerably evaporated, when, on
cooling, well-formed octohedra were deposited, which were recrystallized from water.

0-4835 grm. of platinum-salt, treated with sulphuretted hydrogen, &c., gave 0:1565
grm.=28:23 per cent. of platinum.
