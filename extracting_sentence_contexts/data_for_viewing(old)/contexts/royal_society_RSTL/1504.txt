Copper, M. Berzer1vs informs me, is hardened by silicium.
In some experiments that I made on the action of potassium
and iron on silex, the iron, as I have mentioned before, was
rendered white, and very hard and brittle, bn it did not seem
to be more: oxidable. Researches upon this subject do not
appear unworthy of pursuit, and they may possibly tend to
improve some of our most important manufactures, and give
new instruments to the useful arts.

V. Some Considerations of Theory illustrated by new Facts.

HypROGENE is the body which combines with the largest
proportion of oxygene, and yet it forms with it a neutral
compound. This on the hypothesis of electrical energy would
shew, that it must be much more highly positive than any
other substance ; and therefore, if it be an oxide, it is not likely
that it should be deprived of oxygene by any simple chemical
attractions. The fact of its forming a substance approaching
to an acid in- its nature, when combined with a metallic sub-
stance, tellurium, is opposed to the idea of its being a gaseous
metal, and perhaps to the idea that it is simple, or that it exists
in its common form in the amalgam of ammonium. The
