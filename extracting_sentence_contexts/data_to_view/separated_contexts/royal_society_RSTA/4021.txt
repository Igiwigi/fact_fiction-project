viz., A operates upon a power of « by striking out one «, twoa’s, three a's, &c., in all
possible ways and summing the results. Thus

Aa’ = pera + apie + waa + axa + wan + wee + wee = 8a° + Ba +1. This simple fact shows that we may expect a corresponding theory of lattices, and
that this is, in fact, the case is seen immediately one introduces the part zero into
the partitions of the functions. I have introduced zero parts into partitions in the
Memoirs on Symmetric Functions above alluded to, and have imported into the theory
the corresponding operators d, and D,. *
