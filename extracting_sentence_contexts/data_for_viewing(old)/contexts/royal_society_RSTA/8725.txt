THE PRESSURE UPON THE POLES OF THE ELECTRIC ARC. 131

in the process of evaporation, we find marked disagreement between observed and
calculated values :—

Any reaction due to evaporation should be calculable from a knowledge of the
number n of molecules of mass m which leave the pole in 1 second with a velocity of
» em. per second. The product mn can be measured, but the determination of v
presents some difficulty. Assuming that in the are the carbon is at its boiling-point,
and that the carbon atoms are in thermal equilibrium with the air into which they
are escaping, #.e.,!the carbon atom possesses the same kinetic energy as is possessed by
an oxygen or nitrogen atom at the temperature at which boiling occurs, we have for
the velocity of the carbon atom at 0° C., using the fact that the velocity of H, at
0° C. = 18°39 x 10‘ cm. per second,

v = 18°89 x 10*x /f = 7°5 x 10* em. per second.

Since the boiling-point of carbon is about 4000° C., the atomic velocity at that
temperature = 7°5 x 10*x / 42,73 = 2°97 x 10° em. per second.

In experiments already quoted the amounts of carbon liberated from the anode
and the cathode have been determined under various conditions of are length and
current strength (Joc. cit.).

In a typical experiment with an are of 6 mm. length and a current of 10 ampéres,
