The situation
is worst for cuckoo bumblebee species located in sector C of
figure 7: their host species have a high probability of losing
their social brood parasites, but alternative host species
either are not available or have a low estimated probability
of parasitism (less than 50% and in most of cases less than
20%; figure 7, sector C). A slightly better situation for
cuckoo bumblebees is present within sector D of figure 7,
as the current hosts are unlikely to lose their social brood
parasite species. We found that 13 bumblebee species assumed to be
unparasitized may in fact act as hosts for cuckoo bumblebees,
as their model-based probability of parasitism is over 50%
(table 3). Three of these potential host species occur in the
Holarctic region, seven in the Palaearctic region and three
in the Nearctic region. Furthermore, we found that 23 cur-
rently parasitized bumblebee species have a_ high
probability of losing their social brood parasites in the
future, as their estimated probability of parasitism is below
50% (table 3).
