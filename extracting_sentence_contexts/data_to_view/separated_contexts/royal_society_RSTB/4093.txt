* It may also be noted that, whereas in the normal type
there is usually a pronounced constriction where the rotaline portion joins the balloon-
chamber, in C. milletti the junction is almost invariably flush with the immediately
broadening balloon (fig. 50). For this reason I am inclined to express the opinion
that Discorbina concinna, Brady (which Brapy himself considered was “ possibly

only the immature or arrested stage of some better known species ”*), is, as a fact,
the immature or arrested stage of Cymbalopora bulloides, whilst Discorbina
mediterranensis (d’Orbigny) is the immature or arrested stage of C. milletti, passing
through a stage which has been separated and diagnosed as Cymbalopora poeyt
(d’Orbigny), or (to put it in another way) that Discorbina concinna and Discorbina
mediterranensis, at some stage in their life-history, proceed to the formation of the
balloon- and float-chambers with a view to adapting themselves to a pelagic existence,” . 1 These triangular “ struts” appear occasionally to be set free in the interior of the float-chamber, as in
the figure, by the growth of the chamber beyond them.
