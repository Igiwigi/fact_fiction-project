Qualitative evidence of these statements is provided by the microscope, and the
theory which accounts for them gives rise to the so-called equilibrium diagram based
upon thermal observations during cooling. It occurred to us that the thermomagnetic
method might throw some useful light upon that part of the equilibrium diagram
which relates to the appearance and disappearance of the eutectoid. This opinion
was based upon the fact that, for reasons which need not be dwelt upon, when the
eutectoid or any portion of it disappears during heating the iron in it should lose
practically all its magnetism. Conversely, when the reverse change takes place during
cooling, that magnetism should be regained.
