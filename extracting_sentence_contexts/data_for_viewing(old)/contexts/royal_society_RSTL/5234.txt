veyed by tabular abstracts. In fig. 1 the isothermals are represented which are
comprised between the mean temperature of the year and the highest isothermal ; in
fig. 2 between the mean temperature and the /owest isothermal. In fig. 1, conse-
quently, the isothermals increase in value from the eireumference to the centre ;
whilst in fig. 2 they decrease from the circumference to the centre. To avoid too
great a multiplicity of lines only every alternate degree (the even degrees of FanREN-
HEIT's 8cale) are drawn. Figs. 1 and 2 are $0 arranged on the Plate that the 8ummer
and winter solstices (marked by a dotted line) are in the same vertical. The ab-
normal character of the winter temperature of the North American Continent is
strikingly manifested in this Plate.

From the temperatures computed from the six years of observation and represented
in the plate, we learn many facts regarding the temperature at Toronto, which are
interesting in themselyes, and may become particularly s0 in their comparison with
the phenomena in other parts of the globe. Amongst these may be noticed the
following :â€”The mean annual range, or the difference between the mean temperatures
of the coldest and hottest months (February and July), is 42*7. The warmest day of
the year is July 28, being thirty-seven days after the 8ummer solstice. The coldest
day is February 14, being fifty-five days after the winter solstice. The mean
temperature of the year is passed throngh on April 19 and October 15. 'The warmest
and coldest days, and the days on which the mean temperature is passed through,
