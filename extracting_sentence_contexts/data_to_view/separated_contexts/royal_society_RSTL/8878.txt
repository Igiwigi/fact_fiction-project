Oritical Review of the last two Sections. Tt has been my desire and aim throughout this inquiry to free it as much as possible
from uncertainty and doubt. I have tried to render the facts safe by laborious repetition,
and to render the interpretations of those facts secure by close and constant criticism. Thus, in reference to our present snbject, T had to put to myself very definitely the
question whether the permanent clearness of an infusion exposed to a very moderate
amount of heat, after having been freed from air by boiling or by the Sprengel pump,
was really due to the destruction of the germs in the infusion. Even in a highly infec-
tive atmosphere from three to five minutes' boiling in an oil-bath suffices to sterilize our
retort-flasks, while it is perfectly certain that exposure to the boiling temperature for
fifty times this interval fails to kill the germs of an infusion containing a good supply
of atmosphericair.
