probably initiated at different times in different parts of the organ mass. I had
myself observed a still more remarkable instance of the same phenomenon.
In making a nerve organ preparation from a vigorous Torpedo, the brain of which
had been destroyed, I held a small mass of cut-out organ grasped between the fingers

and thumb of my left hand. With the right hand I divided the electrical nerve wi
a single stroke of a pair of sharp scissors. To my great surprise, I experienced
shock in my left hand which was of a distinctly multiple character, I performed thi
experiment on three separate occasions, and am now led to think it meant primary,
secondary, tertiary, &¢., responses. The fact of my not obtaining any evidence
such responses in my previous work would be probably due, first, to the less active
condition of the winter fish; secondly, to my not suspecting the existence of, and
not carefully looking for, second and third apices in the electrical curve (a factor
great importance in rheotome work); and, thirdly, to my using a less delica
instrument and too long a period of galvanometer closure. This must explain why
did not then find what I obtained now with great ease, the evidence that th
electrical curve of the response of the nerve organ preparation to single excitation o
its nerve is, in vigorous fish, always multiple in character, the apex of the primary
response being followed after an interval of 1/100” by a second rise, and its apex by
a third rise, and so on.

In the following experiments the circuit was arranged as in fig. 1, but the secondary.
