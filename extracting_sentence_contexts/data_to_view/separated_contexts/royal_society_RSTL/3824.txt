31. t), the commencement of vessels which
afterwards, when collected together, form the larger channels that convey back the
blood to the heart. At the superior angle of each lamina of the branchial plates
there is a small sinus that opens into a larger one, formed on this border of the com-
mon cavity by the whole of the laminze, which from its direction backwards appears
to communicate with the orifices. From these facts it would appear that the blood
permeates the nucleated parenchymatous tissue of each double lamella, and is brought
into contact with the air, when the branchiz are inflated during respiration, by endos-
mosis through the membranes, and then, collected in the sinuses at their base, it passes
out again through the orifices and vessels at their superior border, to be returned again
to the heart. These vessels form delicate vascular trunks or sinuses which pass
around the sides of the body in the posterior part of each segment, and gradually
enlarged by communicating with other yessels in their progress, pour their contents
into the heart at the auricular orifices (z) on its dorsal surface. OF MYRIAPODA AND MACROUROUS ARACHNIDA.
