aid in investigations on the liability of wrought-iron axles to fracture produced by
gndden changes of the temperature of the air. Again, it will be observed from Experiment LVI. that shortly after the iron has
been heated and then cooled there is less elasticity than when a considerable rest has
been allowed ; and in fact we have in this case exactly the same kind of restitution of
elasticity in iron as we have seen takes place after the wire has experienced mechanical
extension. With nickel the increase of elasticity produced by res after cooling is still
more remarkable. Equally remarkable also is the temporary change of elasticity
produced in nickel ; and a comparison of the loss of elasticity produced by raising the
temperature to 100* OC. with the change of susceptibility to alteration of resistance
from change of stress as shown in Table XXII, affords a still further proof that stress
and strain act in the contrary direction as far as electrical conductivity is concerned.
