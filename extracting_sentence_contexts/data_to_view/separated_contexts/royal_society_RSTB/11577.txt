These scales vary in spatial extent (nanometre to millimetre) and in
level of abstraction (tracking of ion concentrations versus body wall dynamics). Each sub-project is organized as a public repository on GitHub, a web-based
software development platform that serves as the de facto location for collabora-
tive, open-source software projects, including those defining biological models. Each sub-project also has distinct success criteria, which all have in common a
goal of reproducing empirical stylized facts associated with a biological
subsystem using biologically inspired dynamical models.

(a) Unit tests

In practice, formalizing these success criteria requires producing a checklist of
experimental observations and then assessing how well a single model can
reproduce them when simulated with the appropriate parameters and stimulus
conditions. Here we implicitly assume that the ability to reproduce experimen-
tal results is an indicator of model fitness, and that models which reproduce
more such results are, ceteris paribus, superior to those that reproduce fewer. This is analogous to the ubiquitous practice of wunit-testing in software
