So, by this test there exist lines of force within the magnet, of the same
nature as those without. What is more, they are exactly equal in amount to those
without. They have a relation in direction to those without ; and in fact are conti-
nuations of them, absolutely unchanged in their nature, 80 far as the experimental
test can Ã¾e applied to them. Every line of force therefore, at whateyer distance it
may be taken from the magnet, must be considered as a closed circuit, passing in
some part of its course through the magnet, and having an equal amount of force in
every part of its course.

3118. When the axial part of the wire is dismissed and the magnet employed in
its place, s0 as to be included in the circuit, it is easy to See how it acts the part of
the conductor.
