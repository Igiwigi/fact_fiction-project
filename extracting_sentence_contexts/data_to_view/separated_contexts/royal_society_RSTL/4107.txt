In the former case the north poles of the astatic magnet are attracted, in
the latter they are repelled. We also sce that a direct current acting on diamagnetic
bodies produces the same deflection as a reverse current on magnetic ones. Thus, as
we promised at a former page, the opposite polarities of diamagnetic and magnetic
bodies are transferred from the region of deduction to that of fact. ON THE POLARITY OF THE DIAMAGNETIC FORCE. 253
