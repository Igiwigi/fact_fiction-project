leading to any definite demonstration as to the mode of origin of the Marattiaceous
sorus, or us to the relations by descent of any of its various types. The contention
which I do press, however, with some persistence, is that these questions are still
open, notwithstanding that writers of authority have treated them as already
decided, whether by evidence from fossils, or from development of living forms. I
have above pointed out how in my opinion the paleophytological evidence is insufli-
cient to prove the priority in the Marattiaceze either of the type with separate
sporangia, or of the synangial type. As far as I can see, the facts from fossils would be
consistent with either view. Nor does the argument from comparison and develop-
ment of living forms lead to any definite conclusion, so long as we treat the
Marattiaceze on their own merits, and do not proceed on the assumption that they
were descended from Leptosporangiate ferns. Comparing them, inter se, it would be
possible to interpret all the facts as consistent either with a progression from a
synangial state to sori with separate sporangia, or as consistent with a progressive
coalescence. ‘This conclusion will I think be admitted by those who follow all the

investigation.

But it is our duty not only to contemplate possible views, but to decide which is,
