Here, s+ =(b+ Vb? + 24ac)/4c is such that Q) is minimizing the bulk potential fg. It should be noted that Q, remains invariant if we replace n, by —ny at each point in its
definition. Thus Q; depends in fact on the pair {—n), np} not on np alone. It can be observed that
the set of matrices having the representation of Q) (for some np € Ss?) give a way of embedding
the space of lines, namely the real projective plane RP”, into the space of Q-tensors Sp. We can thus
think of Q; taking values into RP? (in fact into RP! given the specific form of np as ny - e3 = 0).
