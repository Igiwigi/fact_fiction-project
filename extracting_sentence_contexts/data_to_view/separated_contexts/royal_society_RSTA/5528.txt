The asymptotes of P(X) are determined by the singularities of the generating function G(y). For
X; — —oo, the leading singularity in the upper half plane is y=2:. This follows from the fact
that for any i there is a finite probability of zero amplitude, so that the moments (|q;|1 diverge for
q < —2. At the left tail, it gives limy,_, 55 P(X;) « exp(—2X,), which is indeed observed in figure 6. It is not clear at the moment how to find the singularities in the lower half-plane that determine
the positive moments and the anomalous exponents.
