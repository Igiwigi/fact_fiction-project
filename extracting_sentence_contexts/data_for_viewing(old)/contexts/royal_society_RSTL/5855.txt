ing been observed by reflected, instead of direct rays, that a zenith spectrum at the
level differs most notably from one on the mountain, by the greater extent of the

Wl end visible, and by the increased number of lines; and that, though it shows some
Sproximation to a low-sun mountain spectrum, it has some radical differences there-

EProfexor STOKEs indeed snggests, that the deficiency of the red end of my high-sun
Suntain spectra may be due to the more luminous rays extinguishing the faint red ;
ind that if the former had been absorbed by a cobalt-blue glass, or the extreme red
eparated by refraction through a second prism, A might have been seen ; just as in fact
twas seen with the low-swn spectra, when the atmosphere acted the part of a snitable
tbsorbing medium ; and the suggestion is of extreme value for future experiments, though
tis proper to state, that on Teneriffe the magnifying power employed was such, as neces-
arily to throw the brightest part of the spectrum out of the field of view when the
Xtreme red was under examination.
