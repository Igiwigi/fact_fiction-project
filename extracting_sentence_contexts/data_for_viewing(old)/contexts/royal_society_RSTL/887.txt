' The whole of the foregoing experiments were made with the
machine called No. 1; and, as the friction was continued, in each
experiment, during many days, with a pressure upon each couple
of pieces equal to g 1bs. 8 oz. 12 dts. and 21 grs., and as (consi-
dering the severity of such a trial) the loss sustained by the
pieces, separately or collectively, was not very considerable, it
may with reason be inferred, that standard gold does not easily
suffer abrasion by the friction of metal against metal, or of coin
against coin, especially under the circumstances which com-
monly prevail during the circulation of money.

In the machine No. 1, the pieces of gold were opposed face
to face; it now therefore appeared proper, that the facts thus
ascertained concerning the wear of gold, of different degrees
of ductility, should be farther examined, and corroborated by
a different method. To effect this, the second of the machines
before described, which I shall call No. 2, was employed.

It has been already observed, that this machine was a cubic
box, of 8 inches withinside, formed of oak one inch in thick-
ness, through which, a strong axis of iron passed, 50 as to be
turned by a wheel and pinion.

Experiment with the Machine No. 9.
