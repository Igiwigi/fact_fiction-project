Here we find the same 6d, for F, and F,, whilst in F we had it only for F,. The
set with separation 17 show no F,, and again is numerically an exact oun multiple
displacement, viz., 6 which gives 17°0. The line found close to the expected—(3,) F,
above—forms part of a chain

(1) 82765'29 186447 = (3) 34629°76 1864:06 = (1) 3649382

It may be the representative corresponding to the satellite displacement 6, observed
in F for m = 2, 3.

Using links 2e+u = 18761°38 and 2e+v-= 19056°2 we should find lines at 39678°79
and 39383°97 with the corresponding lines to F,, F; beyond the observed region. Asa
fact, we find lines at (37) 39683°95 and (1) 3938698. The first corresponding to a
—4, displacement should give 2e.v.F,(1) = 89679°70. The second would differ from
the same displacement by 8 and is therefore inadmissible. It should be noticed that
both the 3e and 2e+w sounders give lines larger by unity than the expected value.
This may, of course, be due to combined errors in the sounders and observation errors,
but the F are entered in the list as if the sounders are correct. As none of the
F(1) or F(1) lines can be observed, their means can have no weight for an accurate
determination of the limit.

m= 2, The F lines are in the ultra-violet, and should be, with the limit chosen, at 42842-73,
44707°23. With sounder e+v = 11742°10 we find the set (4) 31102°16 1863°17 (<1) 32965°33
with a small separation corresponding to that for F,. It gives F, = 42844°26 and F, = 4470743.
But the set appears to be really F, (16), F, (16).
