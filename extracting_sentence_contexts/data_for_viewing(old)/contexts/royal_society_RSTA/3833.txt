described above. It turns out, however, that there is no profound relationship between chirality
and spin. One may appreciate this simply by noting that a parity inversion of the beam reverses
the handedness of the beam (and the direction of propagation) while, nevertheless, leaving the
spin unchanged. Spin derives not from the screw sense of the helices but instead from the sense
of rotation of the field vectors: the spin can be cast as an integral over At x A, for example, with
A“ the solenoidal magnetic vector potential and x denoting the conventional vector product.
This resembles the angular momentum r x ¢ associated with the rotation of a particle’s position
vector r, say.

At first glance, then, it might appear that chirality and the angular momentum of light are
disparate subjects: chirality is the concept of handedness while the angular momentum of light,
in particular spin, is associated with rotation rather than any form of inversion. Developments
in recent years have revealed, however, that these two fields are, in fact, subtly intertwined. The
purpose of this short paper is to elucidate and consolidate some of the advances in this direction.


In what follows, we consider ourselves to be in an inertial frame of reference, adopting a right-
handed Cartesian coordinate system x,y,z with time t. Indices taken from the start of the Roman
alphabet (a,b,c, ...) may take on the values x, y or z and a double appearance of an index implies
summation over x, y and z. We take a microscopic view, focusing upon freely propagating light or
the interaction of this light with individual molecules. We work within the semiclassical domain,
where the electromagnetic field is treated classically and everything else is treated quantum
mechanically [37].
