Lemaitre in 1927 [27] combined the Friedmann
models with the phenomenon of redshift, calculating for the first time the constant in the
‘Hubble’s law’ v = Hr, connecting the distance to recession velocity, found by Hubble two years
later. The 1927 paper of Lemaitre was translated into English in [28] after a suggestion of Eddington
(for this amazing story that made Lemaitre ‘the most well-known theoretical cosmology of the
day’, see [29]). In that same 1927 paper, Lemaitre had also shown that the Einstein static universe


was unstable, small irregularities would in fact grow in time. The resulting Lemaitre universe has
the property of coasting as static an infinite time in the past, before expanding and accelerating
like de Sitter’s universe in the future (this instability of the Einstein static world was also shown
independently a few years later by A. Eddington [30], and this universe is sometimes called the
Eddington-Lemaitre cosmology).
