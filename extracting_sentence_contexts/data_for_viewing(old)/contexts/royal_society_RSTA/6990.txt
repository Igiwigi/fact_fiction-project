22w ,— 16wo— 16wWp+ 2w 4+ 4Wp + 2W9+ 2Wyy— 64 = 0,

20wy—16wWp— 8We+4Wp+4Wy+2Wg+ Wy +Wy—64 = 0.
From (B. 11) and (B. 12) the fictitious points are involved as follows:
w, = 2:45874wp—0-93368wp,
We = 0:11473wp— 0-03343wp,
Wy = 0:05891w, —0-02943w¢, (B. 17)
Wp = 0-66262w,—0-25731w¢,
Wy = bwyp— 2W_+0°33333w,.
There are several possible methods of solving these equations, the chosen one depending
on the skill and experience of the computer. For example, the nine equations could be

solved simultaneously by the standard relaxation procedure. Alternatively, the fictitious
points could be expressed in terms of w,, Wz, We and wp, leaving four equations for relaxation.

Or again, an iterative process could be used, in which the fictitious points are held fixed at
some approximate values while equations (B.16) are solved for wy, W;, We and wp. New
and more accurate values can then be obtained for the fictitious points from (B.17) and
the process repeated until there is no further change. This last method is effectively the one
used (graphically) by Fox & Southwell, and has the advantage that no complicated formulae
are used in the relaxation; the process may, however, converge only slowly.
