T,0,K*% 0.5-1.5s is a dead time required to process
information about stimuli and to initiate actions. It may be different for
different kinds of stimuli; see model (3.10).

— Relaxation time. T* 1-10s appears owing to the fact that vehicles are
capable of only finite acceleration; see model (3.12).

— Desired time gap (also called time headway). Tsay 1-2s is the time
distance drivers would like to keep when following a leader; see
model (3.13). We remark that these times should also be distinguished from the numerical
update time that is simply an artefact of time discretization.
