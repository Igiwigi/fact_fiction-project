The blue colouring matter may be readily extracted by cold water, but is de-
Fomposed by boiling. The blue solution dispersed an orange light like the other, but

colour, 80 that the mixture of the two would be blue. And in fact when the blue
Muid was changed to red by boiling the colour became far less intense. A
