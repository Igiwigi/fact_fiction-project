from the peroxide as 7 : 4. For calculating on this hypothesis the amount of oxygen
in the two preparations, we find for the preparation A. from experiments I. and IT.
respectively, 6'60 and 6:67 per cent. of oxygen, and for the preparation B. from ex-
periments IIT., IV. and V., 6'91, 7:05 and 6:80 per cent. of oxygen, which are the
numbers given in the other experiments. The reaction would therefore be repre-
sented thusâ€”

This method has the advantage of giving a considerable loss of oxygen with a small
quantity only of the substance ; and the perfect agreement with one another of nume-
rous experiments made in this way, led me to place in it the greatest confidence.
Facts, however, afterwards came to my knowledge, which proved that this action was
not 80 absolutely uniform as had at first appeared ; and although under the circum-
stances, and with the precautions (especially as to. the relative quantities of the sub-

stances) which I have mentioned, the entire agreement of the experiments proves
that the action is that which I have here given, yet this threw a certain doubt upon
it, and it is only in some of my first experiments that I have used this plan of deter-
mining the oxygen uncontrolled by the following.

The determinations with platinum were made in a little apparatus of a very 8imple
