the asteroid collision [122].

The other mutation that likely benefited our primate ances-
tors was the uricase mutation, that occurred stepwise from
around 24 Ma until the gene was fully extinguished in the
mid Miocene. Uricase is an enzyme that degrades uric acid,
and uricase-deficient mice show a dramatically greater rise
in uric acid in response to fructose [123]. We have discussed
the evidence that the loss of uricase likely represented a true
‘thrifty gene’ [124]. The mutation occurred during a period
of near extinction of ancestral apes from global cooling [125].
Evidence that it might be a thrifty gene was shown by the
fact that inhibiting uricase can markedly amplify the ability
of fructose to induce metabolic syndrome in rats [126], while
resurrecting the ancestral uricase was shown to block the lipo-
genic effects of fructose in human hepatocytes [127]. Of note,
when the mutation occurred, it only doubled serum uric
acid levels (to x3-4 mg dI-') and thereby acted primarily to
protect against starvation as opposed to driving obesity
[128]. However, during the twentieth century, serum uric
acid levels rose dramatically in parallel with increasing sugar
intake and the rise in obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular dis-
ease [128]. People with uric acid levels greater than 8 mg dl
are much more likely to develop obesity and metabolic syn-
drome, and experimental and pilot studies suggest that the
