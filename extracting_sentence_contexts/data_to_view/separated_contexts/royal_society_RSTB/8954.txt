In the light of the ongoing global species. The integration of evolutionary biology in conservation

demise of biological diversity and the urgency with which this science can deliver the tools to quantify option values. Maclaurin and Sterelnyâ€™s general discussion of option
value in fact drew heavily on the potential role of phylogeny,
and analysed the early work linking phylogeny to feature
diversity and thus to option value [15]. Surrogates are often
used in conservation science and can be of two types,
either taxonomic or environmental [34]; the former is based
on a particular group or organisms that is thought to rep-
resent adequately overall biodiversity (e.g. [35]) and the
latter generally includes a mix of physical and biological
information, often comprising multiple potential surrogates
(e.g. [36]). PD provides surrogate information for feature
diversity, under a phylogenetic assumption that shared fea-
tures can be accounted for by shared ancestry [15,16].
