In the case of the
iodide, however, there was a sensible change in the direction expected from the behayiour
of leadâ€”4. e. the spectrum became dimmer, that is, exhibited a tendency to die out. When, however, baric fluoride was examined, a different state of things was observed. Instead of the spectrum becoming more complex it became simpler, exhibiting in fact
only the four longest lines of barium with any degree of distinctness, and these showing
but little brilliancy. STRONTIUM and MAGNESIUM. Strontium behaved in this particular in the same way as barium did, the falling off of
the lines in the fluoride being very marked.
