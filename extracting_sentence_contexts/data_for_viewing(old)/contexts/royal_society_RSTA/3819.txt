of work produced and driving heat q+.

Let us consider the effect of o on n. The balance equations for energy and entropy are

q+ —q-—p=0 (G1)

and
q+ q-

To te=0 (3.2)


Vanishing right-hand sides of these equations correspond to the fact that the state of working
body either generally does not change in time (vapour and gas turbines) or changes cyclically
(vapour machines).

Thermal efficiency n = p/q+ follows from equation (3.1) in the form

On the other hand, as follows from equation (3.2)

— TL TL
aa = —-+o—.
q+ T+ q+

Therefore,
