stops only about one-fourth more of the former than of the
latter. Now, in answer to this, it may be alleged, « that the
« ingredients of which the former glasses are made, dispose
« them probably to stop the invisible rays of heat, and that
« consequently a great interception of it may take place, with-
« out bringing on a necessity of stopping much light ; and that,
«< on the other hand, the different texture of crown glass may
« stop one sort of heat as well as the other, so that nearly an
« equality in this respect may be produced.”

When a hypothesis is made in order to explain any phezno-
menon of nature, we ought to examine how it will agree with
other facts; and, in this case, we are already furnished with ex-
periments, which are decidedly against the supposition that has
been brought forward. For, the 148th and 149th experiments
shew that the bluish-white and flint glasses transmit all, or nearly
all, the invisible rays of solar heat; whereas crown glass, by
the 150th experiment, stops a considerable number of them.
But, to assist the objecting argument, let it be alleged, as has
been proved by the 94th experiment, that our bluish-white
glass stops a considerable portion of the heat that goes with the


on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. 513
