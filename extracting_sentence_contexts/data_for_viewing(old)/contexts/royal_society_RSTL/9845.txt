M. Rexavur represents the first of his Sigillarian types by the Sigillaria vascularis
of Mr. Bixxsy, but which is really a state of the common Lepidodendron selaginoides.
When M. RExAavuLT denies that a Lepidodendroid state of this supposed Sigillarian
plant exists, he overlooks the fact that Mr. Bixxgy long ago described and figured a
partially decorticated specimen in this condition under the name of Lepidodendron
vaseulare.* In that memoir Mr. BixNey correctly points out that the plant only
differs from his Sigillara vascularis in the absence from the former of an exogenous
zone.

Fig. 1 represents a transverse section of a branch of this plant, enlarged about
13 diameters, its actual diameter in the longer direction being nearly '8. In its
centre is the vasculo-medullary axis, , the periphery of which consists of a continuous
zone, sharply defined externally, composed of numerous barred vessels. More intern-
ally, cellular elements are interposed between these clusters of vessels, until, in the
central portion of the axis, the vessels are either isolated or combined in very 8mall
groups. The medullary cells are of two kinds, as pointed out in my memoir, Part II.,
