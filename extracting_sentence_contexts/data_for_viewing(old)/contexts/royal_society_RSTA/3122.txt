This is the Fourier transform of

which may perhaps look like a plausible joint probability density until one uses it to compute the
probability that (p,q) lies in the disc {(u, v) : wv? <1}.

In fact, the appearence of such negative probabilities is the rule rather than the exception; in
the Schrédinger realization, only when the probability vector is itself of essentially Gaussian form

do they not appear [9]. Nowadays, the ‘negative probabilities’ which always appear otherwise
are widely used in quantum optics as a measure of ‘quantumness’.

To find a truly quantum substitute for the joint probability distribution of a canonical pair (p, 9),
recall that, in the commutative case, the joint probability distribution encodes all expectations of
bounded measurable functions of the two observables, that is, elements of the von Neumann
algebra that they generate. Let us find a way of similarly encoding the expectations of elements
of the von Neumann algebra VV), generated by a canonical pair (p,q). In accordance with the
