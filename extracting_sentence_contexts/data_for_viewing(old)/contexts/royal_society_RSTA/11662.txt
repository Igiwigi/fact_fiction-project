The ingot of alloy weighed 286°5 grams, while the total weight of the metals used
was 287'15.

At temperatures but little above the eutectic, the stationary temperature at the
F.P.* lasted but a short time, so that there was some danger of reading these freezing
points too low; to meet this, nuclei of alloy were extracted from the crucible and
dropped in just before the temperature fell to the freezing point. This method
removes the risk of surfusion and slightly raises the observed F.P.

There was an interval of a night between the earlier readings of this series and the
last four, but the constants of the pyrometer were not re-determined. A change in
the constants may be the cause of the fact that the first F.P. on the second day was
a degree higher than the F.P. of the same alloy on the previous day. We have,
therefore, in drawing the curve of this series subtracted one degree from all the
second day’s readings.

* FP. is “ freezing point.”
