constants of the circuit. It is now necessary to find the relationship between y and the dis-
placement of the measuring end of the bar, and finally the equation connecting € with V
and the circuit constants.

(a) The parallel-plate condenser unit

Let D be the initial separation of the earthed and insulated plates of the bar condenser.
~q Then the initial capacity C, of the bar condenser is
Q
= C, = A(1+¢)/4nD, (5-6)
I
9 Where A = cross-sectional area of the gap, and ¢ = correction term for the non-uniform
& distribution of the field between the plates due to the fact that the plates are not infinitely
@ close together.
™ At time ¢, the separation of the plates is (D —£), and the capacity C is therefore

A(1+¢)

=| _ fi
5 is Fret naa (67)
6 assuming that the displacement is sufficiently small in comparison with D to leave the
.g correction term ¢ unchanged.
From equations (5-6) and (5-7),

3 y = §C/D = €C,/(D—£), (5:8)
