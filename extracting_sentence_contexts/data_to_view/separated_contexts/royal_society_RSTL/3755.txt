The uses of this canal-system can only be a matter of speculation. Not having
had the opportunity of examining specimens in which the soft animal snbstance had
been preseryed, I am unable to affirm whether the interseptal canals of Cycloclypeus
are occupied in the living state by a portion of the sarcode-body, or whether they are
empty; but as I have unquestionable evidence that the former is the case in Poly-
stomella, I should think there can be little doubt that it is also true of this genus. Now if we come to examine the purpose of this canal-system, we are at once struck
with the fact, that it can scarcely be requisite for the nutrition of the segments of the
sarcode-body enclosed within the chambers; since the mutual communication which
these segments have with each other, seems fully as adequate for the purpose in
Cycloclypeus, as it is in Orbitolites, Orbiculina, or Alveolina. If we examine wherein
this organism $0 differs from the foregoing as to require such an additional system,
we may find a not improbable answer in the possession of that additional skeleton
which intervenes between the proper walls of the chambers; for the canal-system,
excavated in the very substance of this, would seem to furnish the appropriate chan-
nel for its nutrition. And that such is its object, will be shown in a future memoir
to be almost certainly proved, by the comparison of facts then to be addaced from
the structure of other genera.
