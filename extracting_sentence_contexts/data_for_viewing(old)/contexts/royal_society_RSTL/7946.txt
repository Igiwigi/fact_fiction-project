with inorganic matrix, and the transyerse diaphragm or septum of cellular tisxue marking
the node (Plate XXIV. fig. 10, 5)*. Tt has been supposed by more than one writer
that the fistular cavities did not exist in the living plant, but that they were the result
of disorganization and decay. Such, however, is certainly not the cage. The sharply
defined outlines and exquisite preseryation of their innermost cells demonstrate that no
such decay has affected these specimens. In its very young tate the pith was olid and
unbroken—a fact demonstrated by the specimen represented in Table 3, fig. 7 of Mr.
Bixxey's Monograph already referred to. But the small size and exceeding rarity of all
8uch specimens demonstrates that the rapid growth of the woody axis caused the Pith to
become ruptured and fistular at a very early period. 'The process thus commenced ended
finally in a complete absorption of the pith, explaining s8ome points in the history of
these plants of which no explanation has hitherto been found. On looking vertically
at the cellular diaphragm (fig. 10, 2), we discover that whilst its more peripheral portions
consist, of elongated cells like those common to the rest of the pith, in its thinner
central part we have a very regular and delicate form of parenchyma (fig. 7). Some
writers consider that they have found yascular tissnes in the pith. IT have not done 80.
The Woody Zone.—This, as we have seen, is a zone of yariable thickness, consisting of
a series of wedges compoxed of yascular and cellular tisxue combined (fig. 1, F), separated
from each other by cellular prolongations of the pith (fig. 1, c), in which the cells haye
