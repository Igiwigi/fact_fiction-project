In view of
all these facts it is apparent, as Dopps has pointed out (1935, a, B), that the hormone-
producing mechanisms are not very specific in their demands for a chemical excitant,
and it is all the more remarkable that the body should, so to speak, go to such trouble
to produce the particular active substances which are believed to be responsible for
the respective sexual processes of the male and female. At present the most reason-
able way of regarding the matter is to suppose that the sexual hormones were
originally derivatives from the sterols which are widely distributed in living tissues,
that the hormones at first had no particular physiological significance, but that in the
course of evolutionary progress the parts of the body concerned, the uterus and the
vagina and the male accessory sexual glands as well as the secondary sexual structures,
have developed the capacity to respond to the chemical substances which have thus
acquired the character of specific hormones in the manner originally postulated by
Srar.inG (1935). The mechanism in this respect is, in fact, comparable to that of
the regulation of the respiratory movements through the centres in the brain respond-
ing to the increased tension in the blood of that simplest and most primitive of all
products of metabolism, carbon dioxide. It is interesting to note, further, that the
oestrogenic substances which are got rid of in such large quantities in the urine of
pregnancy are nearly all in a “‘ combined ”’ form, and possess a very low physiological
potency, and that one of these inactive substances has now been isolated and identified
by Conen and Marrian.* This discovery is in agreement with the suggestion that
the oestrus-producing substances were primitively of no special physiological signifi-
cance, and it would seem that after the development of the mechanism involving their
