890 PROFESSOR BEALE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF NERVES

tisxues are represented by networks and plexuses of coarser fibres in adult tismes, and
as plexuses of coarse and fine fibres may be een in the adult tissues at all periods of
life, it is only reasonable to assume the existence of networks composed of fibres 80 very
fine as scarcely to be visible by the highest powers we possess, and 80 delicate as to be
destroyed by the most careful manipulation, or to become disintegrated almost imme-
diately after the death of the animal. All argument, however, must give way to obser-
vation ; and even if the results of obseryation are incompatible with conclusions previously
regarded as true, the new facts must be receiyed, and our inferences must be modified
accordingly. But, on the other hand, it will be admitted, in an anatomical inquiry like
the present, that there may be the greatest difference of opinion as to the actual demon-
stration. The ends which one observer may consider to be natural terminations, by
another may be held to be merely apparent ends, depending upon our being unable to
see the continuation of the fibre in consequence of its extreme tennity. The importance
which all observers attach to the process of preparation they follow, is alone sufficient to
show that the appearances produced are yery different according to the manner in which
a specimen is examined ; and further, it is quite certain that many points to be readily
demonstrated by one process, are quite invisible when another plan is followed. This is
one explanation of the many conflicting statements as to facts of observation.

In a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1860, I was led to conclude
