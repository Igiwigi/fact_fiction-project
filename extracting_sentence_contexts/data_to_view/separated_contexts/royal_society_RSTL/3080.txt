I have found, however, that it keeps time nearly with a
well-regulated pendulum clock, from 12 minutes after it is wound up till
about an hour after that time. It is therefore always prepared for the ob-

servations by being stopped 12 minutes after it is wound up; and thus,
although the intensities measured by it could not very safely be compared with
those measured by a more correct watch, yet considerable reliance may be

placed on the comparison of measures thus made by itself at different times. I have in fact already discovered, by using these precautions, such an increase
of intensity as was to be anticipated during the cold season now come on. My
observations have been too desultory, owing to numerous other avocations, to
permit me to look out for a diurnal change of intensity. The balance of the watch makes 290 vibrations in a minute, $0 that the vi-
brations are not commensurate to the seconds ; recourse therefore must be had
to reading off the time by approximation on the seconds dial-plate.
