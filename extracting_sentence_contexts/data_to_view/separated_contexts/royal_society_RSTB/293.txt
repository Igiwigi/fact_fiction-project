unexpected difficulties and seeming incongruities. These difficulties, no doubt, ari
sometimes from our want of knowledge, but often also from our inability to rightl
interpret the known facts, which are only too frequently few in number, and serv
rather to indicate the wide fields of knowledge yet to be searched than to furni
