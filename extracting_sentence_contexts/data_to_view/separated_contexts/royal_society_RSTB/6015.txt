EXPERIMENTAL METHODS AND TREATMENT OF DATA

(a) Preparation of materialâ€”The results to be presented consist of a series of readings
of lengths and radial breadths of tracheids, and of the inclination of the fibrils in
their walls, in the annual rings of various species of Softwood. Four specimens were
used, a Cedar branch 27 years old, two seven-year-old seedlings of Japanese Larch,
and a section of a twelve-year-old trunk of Abies nobilis. Only the spring wood of
each specimen was used for two reasons: in the first place there is some evidence
for assuming that spring tracheids reproduce more faithfully than the tracheids of
summer wood the length of the corresponding cambial initials, and in the second
place, the distinction between tangential and radial walls is made quite clear in
spring wood by the fact that only the latter have bordered pits. This is not true
for the last few layers of tracheids in summer wood. Other criteria which were
sometimes used for distinguishing between tangential and radial walls were the
more pointed ends of cells in tangential view and the deformation of the radial
walls which marked the previous position of ray cells.
