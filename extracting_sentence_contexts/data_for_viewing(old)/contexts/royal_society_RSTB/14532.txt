opportunistic planning (the ability to adapt to new information), turn-taking
(the ability to give the right contribution at the right time), and audience

However, for unimpaired speakers who have mastered a common language,
talking to each other is—most of the time—straightforward [1]. But the phe-

requires to run smoothly. In fact, shared control allows speakers to guide the
conversation toward mutual understanding.

Speakers reach mutual understanding when their understanding is aligned—
that is, when they focus on the same aspects of the world and conceptualize them
in the same way. Interlocutors do not reach alignment in isolation, but through
