therefore deduced from this inſcription, which differs
pretty conſiderably from that exhibited by the ſepul-

to paſs for the true antient Phoenician alphabet, that
prevailed over fo great a part of the Eaſt in the earlier
ages. Y From the paſſage here produced we may farther
infer, that the Phoenician inſcriptions either coeval
with the Samaritan coins ſtruck by Simon, prince
and high prieſt of the Jews, or older than thoſe
coins, muſt be formed of letters, for the moſt part,
extremely ſimilar to the Samaritan, And this we
find in fact to be true, Many of the elements
therefore of thoſe inſcriptions may be more eaſily
diſcovered by the aſſiſtance of Simon's medals, than by
that of any monument of antiquity ſeveral hundred
years later. Nay, the powers of many letters, allowed
to belong to the Phoenician alphabet, have been aQtually
aſcertained by means of the correſpondent elements
on the Samaritan coins. We muſt not therefore too
haſtily admit, or too cloſely adhere to, what M, Abbe
