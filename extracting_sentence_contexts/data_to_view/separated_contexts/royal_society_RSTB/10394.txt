While these demonstrations of
the breadth of statistical learning have been impressive, they
bring into sharp relief a set of questions about the nature of
the processes underlying statistical learning: how can the
same mechanism be responsible for so many different kinds
of learning? How is this sensitivity accomplished over so
many different stimulus types, tasks and time frames? The
fact that we have no settled answers for these questions
suggests that our understanding of statistical learning is less
clear than our ability to demonstrate its existence. Nevertheless, recent modelling and neuroscience work
suggests a compelling avenue for answering these questions
in terms of explicating the relationship between statistical
learning and memory. Modelling research has demonstrated
that processes thought to be integral aspects of memory
are also capable of giving rise to sensitivity to statistical struc-
ture (e.g. [42,45]).
