first one and Ag = 0.0125 at the second. These choices were motivated by the fact that at high
c the solitary wave must be resolved with a finer grid in order to feel the regularization of the
potential. Better results for the theoretical predictions at the first bifurcation could be obtained
by substantially increasing the system’s length; however, this would render the linearization
problem rather unwieldy.

Despite the numerical issues discussed above, these results are generally in very good
agreement with the theoretical predictions. In addition to showing instability when H’(c) < 0 and
the linear dependence of the squared eigenvalue on c — co, in agreement with theorem 5.3, they
also suggest that H’(c) > 0 corresponds to spectral stability. In particular, the solitary travelling
waves are apparently stable at 1 < c < cg, max, which is consistent with stability of near-sonic waves
proved in [23]. This example also provides a nice explanation of the instability of solitary waves
near the lower sonic limit c=1 at ¢ =0, when cp max = 1, and the problem no longer has a KdV
