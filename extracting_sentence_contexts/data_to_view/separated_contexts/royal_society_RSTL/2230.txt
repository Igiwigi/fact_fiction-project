Place the screen at different distances from the heated ball,
and very little difference will be observed in the descent of the
fluid. In one experiment, the effect was 18 degrees with
the screen close to the instrument, and the fluid rose only
one degree when the screen was removed five inches towards
the heated ball. Professor LtsL1E has demonstrated that when the heat is
absorbed by the screen, and radiated from its posterior sur-

face, the effect diminishes rapidly with every remove of the
screen from the heated body.* This fact which he has
established both by experiment and reasoning, is an infallible
test for the opacity or transparency of all kinds of screens. Hence in the preceding experiment, the effect was not pro-
duced by heat radiating from the posterior surface of the
screen, but by heat actually radiating through the screen in
the same manner as light radiates through water, or other

transparent fluids.
