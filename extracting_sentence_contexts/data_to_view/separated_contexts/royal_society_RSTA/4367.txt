If there was no multiplexing gain, we would need to dimension core nodes such
that they can carry the load resulting from all the lines peaking at the same time to the level
of the most demanding of any of them. So for N lines, we would need a capacity of the order of
N*R(1) with R(1) ~ 130 (from figure 5a). In actual fact, we only need to dimension those nodes
to N*R(N). So the multiplexing gain is of the order of G(N) = [N*R(N)]/[N*R(1)] = R(1)/R(N). As
shown in figure 6, if statistical multiplexing did not occur, network interfaces in the core of the
network would have to be 50-60 times bigger than they need to be in practice.
