As the Web grows, changes and expands, researchers must seek novel ways to explore,
navigate and search its content. Kargerâ€™s [8] paper discusses the challenge of exploring the vast
information spaces that are continuously emerging on the Web. The problem is compounded by
the fact that, to date, most data authoring and management tools have been oriented towards
programmers and Web developers. Users have been unable to really harness structured data for
information management and communication. He describes research that enables end users to
define their own schemas (without even knowing what a schema is), manage data and author (not
program) interactive Web visualizations using the Web tools with which they are already familiar.
