very light sleep (stage 1, for example, which is not consist-
ently interpreted as sleep [240])â€”and thus the question
becomes which of these somewhat anomalous responses
reflects conscious perception or, minimally, some level [241]
of consciousness.

In sleep, the transition from conscious wakefulness to
unconscious sleep is generally taken to occur between sleep
stage 1 and deeper stages such as stage 2 or rapid-eye-move-
ment sleep. Interestingly, despite the long-held notion that it
is pre-attentive and even preconscious, and although there is
little consensus, the neural response that tracks this transition
most closely may in fact be the MMN [111,242-245]. This is
particularly true if one sub-categorizes stage 1 into responsive
and non-responsive portions [243]. The MMN is equally sensi-
tive to transitions between wakefulness and sedation under
anaesthesia in that it is completely abolished during or even
prior to behavioural unconsciousness [242,246]; even under
light anaesthesia its amplitude is drastically reduced
[244,247]. The situation is a bit more complicated in the
disorders-of-consciousness literature, where the MMN has
been observed during states of behavioural unconsciousness,
although the inter-individual variability typical of evoked
responses may partially explain the discrepancy across
studies. However, as has been noted [238,248-250], the
