With regard to the degenerations met with in the cerebellar peduncles, my oy
results are in accord with those of Marcut and of Ferrter and TURNER, in so far
the middle and inferior peduncles are concerned, for I only found degenerated fibi
in these peduncles on the side of the lesion, while no sign of any degenerated fib
could be detected in the middle and inferior peduncles of the opposite side. But witl
regard to the superior peduncles, I am compelled to join issue with these observer
for degenerated fibres are certainly to be seen in this structure on both sides afte
simple ablation of one lateral lobe of the cerebellum, The degenerated fibres occupy
so special a position in the superior peduncle of the opposite side (see fig. 7), that it i
strongly opposed to the result being an accidental one. But there is corroborativ
proof of the genuineness of this result in the fact that degenerated fibres oceupy thii
position after the cerebellum has been divided into two lateral halves by a mesial
incision. It thus seems clear that Marcnt’s inference that none of the cerebella
peduncles contain commissural fibres connecting the two halves of the organ
erroneous, in that the superior peduncles unquestionably appear to contain s!
fibres,
We are all agreed that the ultimate termination of the majority of the fibres whie
degenerate in the superior cerebellar peduncle on the side of the cerebellar lesion isi
the opposite red nucleus and optic thalamus. Manrcat, however, describes son
of these degenerated fibres as terminating in the red nucleus on the side of : I
lesion, while Ferrin and TuRNER make no mention of having found this connection
Like Marcut I have been able to trace degenerated fibres to the red nucleus on th
side of the lesion ; these are degenerated fibres of the superior peduncle which don
decussate.
