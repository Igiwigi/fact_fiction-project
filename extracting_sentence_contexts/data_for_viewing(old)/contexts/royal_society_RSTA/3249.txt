in this context [18-23]. Wilson’s power-counting arguments of renormalization tell us that these [oS
higher-order operators die out rapidly towards the IR and thus do not exert a sizable influence on [8
the long-range observables (as long as the flow is dominated by the weak-coupling Gaussian :8
fixed point regime). Still, these operators can exert an influence on the IR flow itself. The is

renormalization flow, i.e. averaging over the fluctuations of all quantum fields, now provides
a mapping of the bare action onto the renormalized effective action S, — I’. The latter encodes
the dynamics of the theory in the IR and thus can be more directly parametrized in terms of the
long-range observables. Any measured quantity therefore imposes a constraint on the form of I”
and thus indirectly on the form of S 4.
