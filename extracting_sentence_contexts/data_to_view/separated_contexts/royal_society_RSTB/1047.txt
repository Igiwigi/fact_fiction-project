T. GROOM ON THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF CIRRIPEDIA, 137

blastoderm cell, and that with three, I could find no transitions, as also between
many other stages. Allowing everything for variation I was unable to explain the
facts. After much time wasted in these endeavours I found the true explanation,
The second blastomere does not come from the first, but from the yolk; this at
once gave the clue to the development, and further progress was easy. The first external indications of the formation of the second blastomere are the
gradual appearance of small granules over a definite area of the yolk to one side of
the first cell (¢f, figs. 50, 86, 88): these, from the first appearance of the patch, have a
radial arrangement round a point situated near the periphery : the granules are seen to

Sbe arranged in long moniliform rows, between which are other smaller ones not showing
any definite arrangement: between the rows are clear and thin lines meeting in a
Bemall central space; at intervals along the clear lines dilatations occur.
