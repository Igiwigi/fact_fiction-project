This can only mean that, in proportion to the increase in the
area of the macrospore-wall, the growth of the cytoplasm proceeds more rapidly than
is usual among Gymnosperms. Whether this is due to an abnormally rapid formation
of new cytoplasm, or to an unusually slow increase in the peripheral area of the sac,
or to both, is not certain. The small size of the sac at the time of its septation,
together with the fact that the vacuole is similarly absent in Gnetum when the normal
growth of the sac is hindered,{ favours the second view. Other evidence, however,
makes it probable that the absence of the vacuole is, in part at least, directly due to
the rapid growth of the cytoplasm and multiplication of the nuclei. In a cone, most
of whose ovules already contain embryos, a few near the apex are still in early stages
of development.
