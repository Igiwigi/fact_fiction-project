This event features an extreme spatial and temporal variability: (1) even
if the wet area is rather large and includes almost all the windward side of the Western Ghats
[9], daily rainfall on July 26 dropped to only 73mm at Colaba, located on a small peninsula in
the ‘old’ Mumbai, only 27 km south of the Santa Cruz gauge [9]; (2) 381 mm of rain fell at Santa
Cruz in only 3h from 9 to 12h UTC in the local afternoon [8]. This extreme space-time variability
emphasizes the role of small-scale and short-lived phenomena operating at subdaily time scales
embedded within larger- and longer-lived structures. In fact, Vaidya & Kulkarni [8] and Kumar
et al. [9] described the complex multiscale interaction from the strong westerly flux bringing a
large amount of moisture from the warm Arabian Sea, interacting with the Western Ghats, to
the development of a synoptic low-pressure system (LPS) over the northwest of the Bay of Bengal
and a mesoscale offshore vortex near Mumbai, this last feature being clearly involved in the ‘cloud
burst’ that occurred on the afternoon of July 26. Other research has examined the atmospheric environment of daily rainfall extremes from a
climatological perspective. For example, Francis & Gadgil [6] found that 62% of daily extremes
greater than or equal to 150mm along the western Ghats were associated with LPSs organized
on synoptic and larger scales.
