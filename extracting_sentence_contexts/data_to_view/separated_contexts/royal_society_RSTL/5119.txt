In ſuch an inquiry metallic bodies ſeem to de-
ſerve our firſt and principal attention, as their
Specific gravities have been aſcertained by well
known and repeated experiments. Without enter-
ing into a minute chemical theory of the princi-
ples of metals, it is ſufficient to obſerve that they
are univerſally allowed to confift of 1. an inflam-
mable or ſulphureous matter, which is of the ſame
kind in all the metals; 2. of a fixed matter or
calx, which appears in each of the metals to be
ſpecifically different in aerght, as well as in other
properties.

As the ſulphurcous matter, in the intire metals,
aCts ſtrongly on the rays of light, it is neceſſary to
calcine, or to divide them into extremely minute
particles, in order to examine ſeparately the action
of the calx, or fixed matter, on the rays of light,

In order to examine all the metals in like cir-
cumſtances, by reducing them into the ſmalleſt
particles, and depriving them of their ſulphur as far
as was practicable, I expoſed each of them, united
with a proper quantity of the pureſt glaſs, without
any additional mgredient, to the greateſt degree of
fire they are capable of bearing, without having all
colour whatever deſtroyed. In this ſtate it appears, from a variety of experi-
ments and facts, that they aQually do, without any
exception, exhibit colours in the order of their

denfities, as follows, -
Gold Red. Palos Orange. Silver —— —Yellow.
