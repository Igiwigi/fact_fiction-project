In general, those gases which either do not unite with oxy-

E, From the fact that carbonic oxide, olefiant gas, and car-
Z buretted hydrogen, when brought to unite with, oxygen by
S means of the platinum sponge assisted by heat, undergo this
S change at different temperatures, it seemed an obvious-con-
