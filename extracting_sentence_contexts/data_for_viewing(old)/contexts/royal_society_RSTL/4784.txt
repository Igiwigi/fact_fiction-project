yellow tinge to the liquid. If, however, a mixture of alizarine and yerantine be dis-
solved in caustic alkali and they be then precipitated together by means of a solution
of alum added in excess, then on boiling the precipitate with the liquid, a bright red
s0lution is obtained, and on filtering and allowing to cool, orange-coloured flocks are
depoxsited, while the liquid $till remains red, but gives a yellow precipitate on the ad-
dition of acid. By treating the residue with additional quantities of alum-liquor more
is dissolved with the same colour, and this continues until either the alizarine or the
yerantine, whichever of the two was present in the smallest quantity, is removed. From
this experiment I am inclined to conclude that alizarine and verantine are capable of
forming a double compound with alumina soluble in boiling water, and that a mix-
ture of the two in the proportion in which they exist in this compound, constitutes
what has been called purpurine. At all events, it follows that alum is not adapted
as a means of separating the substances derived from madder. 'The fact of rubianine
also dissolving in boiling alum-liquor and crystallizing out again on cooling, is an
additional objection to its use.

The difficulty of obtaining pure verantine in sufficient quantity for the purposes of
analysis, has prevented me from determining its composition with the requisite accu-
racy. TI have however obtained approximations sufficiently near to remove almost all
doubts on the question.

I. 0:3280 grm. verantine, dried at 100? C. and burnt with chromate of lead, gave
0:7865 carbonic acid and 01215 water.
1. 03220 grm. gave 0:7740 carbonic acid and 0:1205 water.
