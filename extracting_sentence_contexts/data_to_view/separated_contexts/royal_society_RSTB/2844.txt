His procedure is, however, unsatisfactory. A limited amount of CO, was admitted into the plant chamber through a long
glass inlet tube ; samples of the air were then removed through the same tube at the
beginning and end of the experiments and were analysed by means of a Bonnier and
Mangin apparatus. In the first place, exception must be taken to the long inlet tube, and to the fact
that it serves both to admit the CO, and to remove the samples. It might be some
time before identity of composition between the air in the chamber and the air in the
tube was established by diffusion, and the air removed for analysis would consist
mainly of the contents of the tube. Since to indicate respiration the second sample
must contain more CO, than the first, the existence of a feeble respiration might
easily be masked by such an experimental error.
