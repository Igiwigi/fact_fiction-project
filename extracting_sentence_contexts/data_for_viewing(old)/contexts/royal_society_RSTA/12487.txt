density. A plausible explanation of the first result exists in the very certain presence
of moisture in the gas, taken in conjunction with the course of procedure adopted.

The lower pressures were obtained in fact by releasing a certain quantity of the gas
between the first and second series of experiments. Now if moisture be present, the
effect of this procedure is to concentrate the impurity at the lower pressure, for on
the moment of release there is an intense chilling of the vessel, which will have the
effect of precipitating any moisture in suspension in the gas. A small thing will con-
ceal the decrement of thermal capacity, as will be judged from the succeeding experi-
ments. I may point out here that over and above the quantity of moisture (calculated
to besome 2 milligrammes) necessary to saturate the volume of 160 ¢.c. of air at the
normal temperature, #,, the effect of moisture is to cause very serious error. Water,
in the form of a liquid, within the sphere must, in fact, be conceived as adding its
latent heat of vaporisation to intensify the error. For every milligramme of water
evaporating within, there will be thrown down externally a corresponding milligramme
of steam. I have already described the results of observations which showed that even
with the use of a much safer apparatus for effecting the compression of the gas,
a considerable weight of water was, in some way, taken up by the gas in its passage
through the pump ; so that it was found essential to re-dry the gas immediately before
its entrance into the sphere. The presence of moisture in the preliminary experiments
is therefore very probable.

Not at first fully recognising the probability of error in the first results, it was some
time before I recognised the possibility of a variation of the specific heat with
pressure. The ordinary contention that from ReeNavutr’s experiments on air at con-
