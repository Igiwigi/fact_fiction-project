Only a short segment of the vessel is seen in the specimens
before the level is reached at which the brain was sectioned. The branches of the
anterior spinal artery are small vessels which are distributed within the area bounded
by the median and antero-laterial sulci. In man, Stoprorp has found that these
branches are distributed to the medial region of the cord and bulb; in fact, in man
he has found that the trigonum hypoglossi is invariably delineated in injected
specimens (1916). This I have confirmed (1927). In the left side of the specimen depicted in fig. 1 there is, however, a branch which
arises from the left stem of origin and which proceeds laterally to inosculate with the
