As the flow becomes increasingly reversing at higher De, the WLM solution experiences larger
shear rates as discussed before. The Giesekus constitutive equation becomes more appropriate
than the UCM equation in this regime. For w #0, the presence of the mobility factor in
equations (4.12) couples normal and shear stresses. This coupling makes radial normal stresses
susceptible to undergoing a saddle-node bifurcation, controlled by the local shear rate d,uz.
This possibility can be pursued perturbatively, by considering that the shear stresses t,z in the
UCM base flow are a first-order approximation of the actual shear stresses in the base flow. This
approximation relies on the fact that the UCM velocity profiles are in good agreement with the
velocity profiles experimentally observed at small forcing amplitudes, except at resonances [27].
Following this reasoning, we have found that above a critical value of the forcing amplitude
normal radial stresses diverge in a finite time, and so do all other stress components. Normal

radial stresses are perpendicular to the flow direction and can bend the streamlines, giving rise : =
to the secondary flow observed experimentally [21]. Repeating this scheme systematically, in the : a
whole range of forcing frequencies experimentally accessible, we have found remarkably good 73
agreement with the threshold determined experimentally, as shown in figure 4, with no adjustable iL
parameters other than material properties and system dimensions. =

Since the present scheme relies on maximum shear stresses 1,z in the UCM base flow, it is not [4
affected by the fact that the Giesekus model with no solvent viscosity contribution is incomplete : *
