THE PRESSURE UPON THE POLES OF THE ELECTRIC ARC. 121

From a comparison of the anode and cathode pressure curves we see that it
depends upon the are-lengths whether one or the other is the greater, but for long
ares there is little doubt that the anode pressure preponderates.

The fact that for direct current the total pressure is greater for short ares than for
long ares is in agreement with the observation upon alternating current ares quoted
on p. 115.

Variation of Total Pressure with Current for Constant Arc-lengths.

Fig. 13 shows graphically the observations contained in Table IV., Series B,
single-are method, 3°5 mm. arc-length, and fig. 14 depicts the results of Table VII,
Series ©, double-are method, 3 mm. and 6 mm. are-length. The graphs are
