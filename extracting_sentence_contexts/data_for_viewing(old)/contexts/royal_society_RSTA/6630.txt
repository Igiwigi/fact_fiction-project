Many problems in physical applied mathematics lead to models in the form of field
equations, usually partial differential equations, whose solutions have to contain sin-
gularities just along a line or collection of lines in space. The aim of this Discussion
Meeting was to explore the unification that might come about from bringing together
scientists from various disciplines in which these models commonly occur. The obvi-
ous candidates were fluids, superfluids and superconductors (all of which can support
vortices of different kinds), liquid crystals and solid crystals (which can contain dis-
locations): in some of these areas, such as superconductivity, line singularities are
generally desirable, but in others, such as liquid crystals, they are not.

Three points immediately arise when considering the relationship between line
singularity models and practical situations. The first is the fact that the positions
of mobile line singularities are almost always unknown a priori so that any mathe-
matical model needs to predict their dynamics. Secondly, clarification is needed of
the abstraction in which what is in practice a ‘core’ of finite radius (or characteristic
length scale) is replaced by a line of zero radius. Finally it must be realized that
interest is often centred on samples containing many, many line singularities.

In order to resolve these issues, mathematical modelling has to be carried out on at
least four length scales: the core radius, the radius of curvature of the centre-line, the
distance between neighbouring singularities and the size of the sample. Indeed the
characterization of line singularity problems in terms of three dimensionless length-
ratios provides the best framework within which to achieve some unification between
the theories for the different practical situation. We have summarized the connections
