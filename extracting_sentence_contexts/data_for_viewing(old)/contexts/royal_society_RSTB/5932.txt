and this suggestion is supported by the results of another series of similar operations
made on the next older primordium P,, which will be reported in another paper. In
these experiments bracts often developed from the smaller half of P, or sometimes from
both halves. An example is shown in fig. 15, No. 23, in which P, was halved as well as
I,, and both halves of P, gave rise to bracts.

These experiments on P, therefore increase the probability that the I, bracts resulted
from operations made late in the plastochrons. Actually the bracts never appeared
when the operations were made early in the plastochron but only when P, was large
or medium at the time of the operation. On the other hand a bract did not always arise
when the operation was made late in the plastochron ; for in two of the experiments of
sub-group 1, P, was large at the time of operation, and yet Ia was a leaf. This fact
is at present difficult to explain, but it must be remembered that the estimations of the
sizes of P, are liable to considerable error.

In spite of this difficulty, therefore, it seems probable that an I,a bract arises when the
operation is made late in the plastochron and when the wound is fairly close to the
centre of the presumptive area of I,, as it actually was in two at least of the three experi-
ments in which bracts arose. As an explanation it is suggested that the presumptive
area of I, is then so divided that even the larger part of it is too small to give rise to a
leaf. And yet the presumptive area is already so far determined in the direction of
leaf-formation that the larger part of it cannot be de-differentiated but is bound to go
on and form a structure of some kind. On the other hand, when J,a arose as a complete
and symmetrical leaf the original presumptive area of I,, if it was to any extent â€œ deter-
