the hydride flutings gradually made their appearance and finally became very
brilliant. These gbservations are most simply explained by supposing that the
residual oxygen present in the globe at the beginning of the experiment was
gradually consumed, forming magnesium oxide, while hydrogen was liberated when

the poles became heated and entered into combination with the magnesium vapour
in the outer parts of the are. Other experiments have shown that hydrogen is
occluded in considerable quantity in the metal, and, in fact, the C and F lines were
often present in the spectrum, although no hydrogen was otherwise introduced into
the globe. Attempts to completely expel the occluded hydrogen from the metal
employed have not been successful.

In this experiment, if a high vacuum was first produced, the oxide bands were not
seen at all, but the hydride spectrum gradually appeared as before. Again, when the
residual air was first washed out by hydrogen, the hydride flutings were brilliantly
visible as soon as the are was struck, and the oxide flutings were not observed.
When dry nitrogen at atmospheric pressure was introduced into the globe, neither
the hydride nor the oxide flutings were seen. In hydrogen at atmospheric pressure
the hydride spectrum was present, but was less bright than when the pressure was
reduced.
