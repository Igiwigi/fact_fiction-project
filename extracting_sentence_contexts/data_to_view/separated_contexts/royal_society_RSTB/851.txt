The fibres of the posterior nerve do not decussate,

‘The identification which has been made above of certain elements as the afferent
‘6 and efferent mechanisms of the nervous system of Branchippus finds further support
5 if we turn to the structure of the circumoral ganglion, or ganglion of the stomodeeum
-2 and second pair of antenne. A complete description of this ganglion would lengthen
2 this communication unduly, and, moreover, would be mainly of morphological interest.
> The facts which lead to the identification of the motor and sensory elements may,
3S however, be briefly set down. £ The circumoral ganglion consists of a double ring of nervous matter enclosing the
cesophagus and uniting the nerve cords, The double ring is displaced so that it lies
¢ at a considerable angle with the horizontal plane of the body, this displacement
g being due to the very great hypertrophy of the upper lip and the continuation of the
= esophagus as a horizontal and posteriorly directed tube which ends posteriorly in the
g mouth. The double ring is especially developed posterior to the cesophagus, where
© it lies stretched as a double commissure between a ganglionic enlargement on
each nerve cord.
