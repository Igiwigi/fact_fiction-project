24 hours, or 2,055 kilogs. per square centimeter acting tangentially on the upper
face of a slab one centimeter thick for 24 hours, would displace the upper surface
through a millimeter relatively to the lower, which is held fixed. In Britigh units
this becomes, â€”134 tons to the 8quare inch, acting for 24 hours on a slab an inch thick,
displaces the upper surface relatively to the lower through one-tenth of an inch. It
is obvious that such a substance as this would be called a solid in ordinary parlance,
and in the tidal problem this must be regarded as a rather small viscosity.

Ti 8eems to me, then, that we have only got to postulate that the upper and cool
gurface of the earth pregents such a difference from the interior that it yields with
extreme glowness, if at all, to the weight of continents and mountains, to admit the
Possibility that the globe on which we live may be like that here treated of. If,
therefore, astronomical facts should confirm the argument that the world has really
gone through changes of the kind here investigated, I can se no adequate reason for
agguming that the whole process was pre-geological. Under these circumstances it
must be admitted that the obliquity to the ecliptic is now probably slowly decreasing;
