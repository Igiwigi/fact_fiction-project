contacts.

Mr. C. Hockin, who has greatly assisted me with suggestions since I first devised the

experiment, undertook the whole work of the comparison of the currents by means of
the galvanometer and shunts. He has also tested the resistances, and in fact done
everything except the actual observation of equilibrium, which I undertook myself.

The electrical balance itself was made for me by Mr. Becks.

k The electroatatic force observed was that between two parallel disks, of which one, 6
inches diameter, was insulated and maintained at a high potential, while the other, 4
inches diameter, was at the same potential as the case of the instrument. þ

In order to insure a known quantity of electricity on the surface of this disk, it was
surrounded by the © guard-ring ” introduced by Sir W. Troasox, 80 that the surface of
the disk when in position and that of the guard-ring were in one plane, at the same
potential, and separated by a very narrow 8Pace. In this way the electrical action on
