The
corrections, personal and instrumental, in this method were evidently somewhat
difficult, and it was abandoned before any very good results were obtained by it. The lowest result obtained by this method was about 380 feet per second and the
highest about 930 feet, the' average being 630 feet. The explanation of this very
high result was no doubt to be found partly in the circuit-closer, which was at that
time in various ways imperfect, and partly in the fact that the fall of the weight could
be readily heard through the air. This may have caused the observer to anticipate
the very mall vibration which was produced in the mercury. The circuit-closer was
caused sometimes by the rapid up and down movement of the earth to leap out of
contact immediately after haying closed the circuit; in such cases the chronograph did
