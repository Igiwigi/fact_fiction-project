aggregation into networks or separate groups occurs in which the Euglene remain
in an actively motile condition. NGExi in 1848 had observed groupings of a similar
kind in other organisms, and Sacus in 1876 found that certain green swarm cells
exhibited a peculiar net-like pattern, which he ascribed to currents set up in the
water by the unequal distribution of heat. The aggregations described in the
present paper are, however, as I shall endeavour to show, not due to heat, but are
in large measure the mechanical result of the action of gravity combined with cohesive
forces acting upon organisms heavier than water.

In the first part of the paper a description is given of the movements of Euglena
and the various experiments made to determine the conditions under which the
aggregations of this and similar organisms occur. The second part contains a general
discussion of the facts observed and the conclusions drawn from them.

1. Seasonal Distribution and Movements.

Euglena viridis is a very common and widely distributed organism which may be
found at any season of the year in water which contains much organic matter in
solution, but is usually more abundant during spring and autumn than at any other
time, and may entirely disappear during the summer months. Its normal cycle of
seasonal distribution is as follows :â€”In February, or even earlier if the season is a
mild one, the surface of the pools where Euglena is found becomes covered, on fine
days, with a green scum composed of motile cells which have been liberated from
cysts contained in the mud at the bottom of the pool. If the weather becomes dull
