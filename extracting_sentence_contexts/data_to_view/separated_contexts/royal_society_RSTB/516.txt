GILBERT ON THE

We trust, therefore, that M. Deniratn will accept our comments in all friendliness,
when we say that our own dearly bought experience leads us to believe that the above
facts are quite sufficient to render approximately accurate quantitative estimates at
the different periods impossible. From the results, it seems probable that the samples
taken at the commencement of the experiments in 1875 were less comparable with
those of 1878 and 1879, than were those of these later dates with those of 1881 and
1885. ‘Lhe losses indicated were, indeed, in most cases, much less over the second
period of 4 years; a result which is, however, doubtless partly due to the fact that no
manure was applied during that period. Another reason for concluding that the
samples were less truly representative at the commencement in 1875, than afterwards,
is that the percentage of nitrogen found at that date (0°204), is high for the depth
stated, of arable soil in ordinary agricultural condition, Though, if the soil is naturally
very rich, or if it had been treated otherwise than in ordinary agricultural practice,
such a percentage is by no means impossible. The percentages of 0°15 and upwards,
as afterwards found, are however quite as high as is usual in good, but long worked
arable soil, which is only manured and cropped in the ordinary way.
