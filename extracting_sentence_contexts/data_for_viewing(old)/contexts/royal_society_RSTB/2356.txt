absorbed by the caustic soda depends merely on the amount of dilute acid required
between the first reaction with phenolphthalein and the second with methyl-orange,
the stage corresponding to the complete decomposition of the acid carbonate; and
that it is entirely independent of the relations of the total acid equivalents of the
alkali before and after absorption. By this means we avoid the errors incident to all
methods which depend on the determination of small differences between two large
values.

It is essential that the caustic soda should be absolutely free from alumina and
iron, which interfere with the sharpness of the second titration, consequently caustic
soda made from metallic sodium should be employed. If a trace of alkaline silicate is
present it interferes somewhat with the delicacy of the phenolphthalein reaction, a
fact which has also been noticed by Lerrs and Brake in the titration of baryta
solutions (‘ Proc. Royal Dublin Soe.,’ ix. (1900), p. 152). This is, however, not a
matter of such great importance in this method as it is in one dependent upon the
exact titration of the whole of the alkali, The difficulty may be avoided by using
freshly prepared solutions, and by the selection of a glass which is not readily attacked
by caustic soda.*

The titrations were carried out in cylindrical bottles or flasks, provided with a
caoutchoue cap bearing two tubulures, through which the delivery tubes of the
burettes could be inserted. The use of this cap prevents the absorption of CO, fronr
the air, but it is obviously not needed during the second titration.

The burettes used for the soda solution were filled from the stock-bottles through
