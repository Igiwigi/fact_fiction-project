Our mean heritability estimate of h*=0.20 is within the
range of estimates of the mean heritability of methylation
across the genome in humans (15-34% [73-76]). That it is sig-
nificantly lower than the mean of non-clock CpGs examined
(0.30) makes sense, given the expected high proportion of
variance accounted for by age for clock CpGs.

One limitation of this study is that by measuring methylation
using a microarray designed for humans, we are biasing our
study towards conserved genomic regions. We chose to use a
