of the material are usually, but not always, greater than they are in the case of fine-
grained copper and aluminium. The load-extension and volume change curves for a
specimen of fine-grained decarburised mild steel are shown in fig. 13. It will be seen
that the removal of the carbon from the steel has removed the flat part of the load-
extension curve and also the discontinuities in the curve of change in internal volume.

Comparison between load-extension curve and complete shear, shear-stress curve.

Tt was pointed out above that for a complete solution of any problem in plasticity it is
necessary to know the resistance to further distortion after any given total strain. Many
observations have been made of the load-extention curve over a large range of strains
and some have been made of the torque-angle curve for round rods. The connection
between the torque-angle curve for a rod and that for a tube is known,” in fact one may be
deduced from the other by purely mathematical processes. From the torque-angle
curve for a tube, the shear stress—shear curve can be obtained, but for a complete
analysis of plasticity the whole effect of the past strain history of an element of metal
would have to be known. This leads to such complexity that further progress is
impossible unless some simple generalisation can be made to give results of sufficient
accuracy for practical purposes. The general similarity of the (P, e) and the (8, s)
curves is well known and it might be suggested that the resistance to further distortion
depends only on the amount of work which has been done on the material since it was
in its initial annealed state. If this were true the quantity « in the expression for
Mour’s and von Misxs’ hypotheses would be a function of the work done ; thus if
