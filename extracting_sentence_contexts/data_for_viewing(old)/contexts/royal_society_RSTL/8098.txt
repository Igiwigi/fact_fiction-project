differentiated teeth in the genera Amphitherium, Amphilestes, Spalacotherium, Peralestes,
Stylodon, &c., of the lower and upper oolites. One solitary form (Myrmecobius) alone
remains at the antipodes with minute and slightly differentiated teeth, in number ex-
ceeding the type one in most modern Mammals, and recalling that in lower and wider
vertebrate groups.

The two or three smaller but functional premolars in advance of the large lower car-
nassial in the meso0zoic Plagiaulan are reduced to two more minute functionless and
speedily lost premolars in the neozoic Thylacoleo.

Professor Huxrey to the London Geological Society : 4 in what circumstance is the Phascototherium more
embryonic, or of a more generalized type, than the modern Opossum ?”—Quarterly Journal of the Society, vol.

This fact invalidates the averment of © the contradictory bearing of the dental system
of Plagiaulaz upon the assumption that the earliest; Mammals had the full complement
of teeth :” which averment Dr. FALCONBR reiterates and © calls special attention to,” in X.
p- 365, XI. p. 451. For if, in place of asxuming Plagiaulan to be the earliest mammal,
