142 DR. C. E. BEEVOR ON THE FIBRES OF THE CINGULUM AND THE

amygdalee, with which it has connections which have not yet been clearly elucidated.
Behind the splenium of the corpus callosum the bundle is thinner, and again increases
in thickness as it descends in the hippocampus; this difference in size is due to the fact
that different systems of fibres contribute to its formation. There is no doubt that
there are fibres here which connect the internal surface of the frontal conyolutions with
the cortex of more distant parts, viz., the apex of the temporal lobe. During the
course of this bundle, it forms various intermediate stations of communication, and this
is proved by the fact that the bundle of fibres, when traced from their beginning to
their ending, do not get progressively smaller, but below the corpus callosum they
become larger, as also in the temporal lobe. In the course of the cingulum above the
corpus callosum, numerous other fibres from the neighbouring parts of the cortex, join
it and then leave it again after a longer or shorter course ; this small system of arciform
fibres is united to the fibres which go the whole length of the cingulum; these fibree
arciformee resemble the fibree proprize of other parts, and help to swell the size of the
cingulum above the corpus callosum; they are least numerous behind the splenium
corpus callosi. . . . In Mammalia the cingulum receives at its anterior part fibres from
the medulla of the olfactory lobe. . . . These longitudinal fibres of the cingulum are
crossed by transverse fibres from the medullary centre of the hemispheres ; these
terminate in the cortex of the gyrus fornicatus, and are the fibres of the corpus
callosum. It is not known whether any fibres of the corona radiata also follow this
