the manner in which it thus affects the field depends on the form of its expression in
terms of H, C, &c. Now unless the principal term in B is one depending on H only,
the behaviour of the body in question would not at all approximate to the magnetic
behaviour we know that bodies exhibit. For instance, we know that bismuth
always behaves very approximately as if it were non-magnetic. This requires that

the principal term in B’ should be poH’. It is needless to say that this will not in
general be the case if B involves D, In fact, in a steady field, the only conditions we
should be able to assert that B imposed upon the field would be those which resulted
from equations (17), (18), which do not contain pyH’ at all.

85. The conclusion we are bound to come to is that on the present theory there
must be no term in 7 which will result in yV/ containing D. Thus the thermo-
magnetic effects must be left to the theory of irreversibility.

Tt might be thought that all difficulty would vanish if, in g, instead of D we substi-
tuted d, since this would involve terms in e similar to those given above for B and
since E= —e. This, however, is not the case. No term in e can affect steady
currents. The equation E + e = 0 determines the value of d but does not affect the
value of C. Again, since in equations (18) (14) we should have ¢ instead of C, we
