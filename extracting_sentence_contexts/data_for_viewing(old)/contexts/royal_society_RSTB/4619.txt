Houmeren (1909, pp. 208-18, and 1911, pp. 15-31) has dealt tolerably fully with
the Blattid affinities of the Isoptera, laying special stress upon the wing characters of
Mastotermes, and other features of their external structure. The affinities revealed
by their internal anatomy have been less thoroughly examined, and Archotermopsis
exhibits the following Blattid characters in the digestive and reproductive organs.

The digestive system is clearly of the Blattid type, and very closely resembles
that of Periplaneta. The presence of cceca to the mid-gut appears to be a character
inherited from the Colotasia (Borpas, 1898, p. 191) group of the Orthoptera, and
these structures have not so far been detected in any other Termite. The crop and
gizzard are extremely similar, both in form and histology, though the gizzard is less
strongly developed than in the Blattide. The Malpighian tubes alone offer any
fundamental point of difference, and the fact that they are few in number in Termites,
and numerous in the Orthoptera, is perhaps due to the probability that the former
are more primitive in this respect than the latter. In Archotermopsis and, according
to Honmeren, in Hodotermes, Porotermes (Glyptotermes), and Calotermes eight
Malpighian tubes are present. It is noteworthy that these four genera belong to the
generalised family of the Protermitide. This same number of Malpighian tubes,
according to ScHINDLER (1878, p. 607), is found in the young larvee (4-5 mm. long) of

Periplaneta and the full number is not acquired until a later stage in development.

The enlarged condition of the hind intestine, found in many Termites, is purely an

adaptive character correlated with the presence of intestinal Protozoa, since it is no
