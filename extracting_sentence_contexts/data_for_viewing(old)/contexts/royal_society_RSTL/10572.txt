excess, as of P, trivialis), also of Holcus lanatus, and a less one of Avena flavescens,
A. pubescens, Anthozanthum odoratum, and Lolium perenne ; a small deficiency of
Avena elatior, and collectively of Phleum pratense, Aira caspitosa, Cynosurus cristatus,
and Bromus mollis. Thus, the grass which is in very marked excess with the straw is
Dactylis glomerata, whilsb Alopecurus pratensis, Poa trivialts, and Agrostis vulgaris
are. also notably in excess. The grasses 80 brought into prominence are all free-
growing, and three out of the four of good agricultural repute. On the other hand,
the grasses most notably in relative defect are, Festuca ovina, Poa pratensis, and Holcus
lanatus, whilst the several species of Avena, and Anthoranthum odoratum, are also in
decreased amount, Compared with the grasses which have become more prominent,
geveral of those which have diminished are plants of more limited growth. The
Festuca ovind especially, which is in the greatest degree in defect, is comparatively
very superficial-rooted and fine-leaved. In fact, the most striking character is the
enormous increase of Dactylis, and the very large diminution of Festuca ovind.

With regard to the Leguminosz, the yield on both plots, 13 as well as 9, is 80 small
that the differences are of little moment ; but, so far as the figures go, the conditions
geem to be rather more favourable for Lathyrus pratensis on the plot with the straw.

As on plot 9, 80 on plot 13, the only three miscellaneous plants which have con-
tributed as mnch as 1 per cent. to the mixed herbage in any one year, and which were
