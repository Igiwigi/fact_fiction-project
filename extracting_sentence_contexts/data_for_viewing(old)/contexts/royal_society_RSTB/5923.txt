pale. It seems reasonable to regard this phenomenon as an inhibition of inhibition.
If this suggestion is provisionally accepted, the shape of curve A becomes intelligible.
It is consonant with physiological principles that a primary inhibition should become
temporarily established before a secondary one asserts itself, if the stimuli for both
are applied simultaneously. The steep upward slant of the curve would then represent
inhibition resulting from the stimulation of the dermal photoreceptors. It is note-
worthy that this steep portion coincides with the other two primary inhibition curves
shown in the figure. After a minute or so the secondary inhibition comes into play,
and the pigmentomotor apparatus, released from inhibiting impulses, induces the
proximal migration of the melanophore pigment—slowly, as it does when an animal
is taken from light to darkness.

It is a very remarkable fact that an exactly similar response of animals brought from
darkness into light on a white background has been observed by PARKER and Lan-
CHESTER (1922) in fishes. Fundulus, when taken from a dark box, were pale. They
were placed on a white background in full daylight. ‘‘ After a few seconds the fishes
from the dark box, though they were on a light background, grew dark, reaching a
maximum in about half a minute. They then remained dark for about five minutes,
after which they took on the light tint normal for their surroundings.” If this
similarity is real, and not merely apparent, then it implies that the mechanism of
pigmentary control in Fundulus and the chameleon is identical in every essential
respect. Such far-reaching conclusions, however, must await the results of further
investigation.

We will refrain from the attempt to fit the curious reversal of the white background
