Howdle then explained how gas evolution can be
used to generate highly porous biomaterials and the final talk of the meeting was
from Hench, who covered the importance of pore structure hierarchy for
biomedical applications. One contribution of 18 to a Discussion Meeting Issue ‘Engineered foams and porous materials’.

4 Preface

Overall, the meeting was highly successful, both in attracting an excellent
group of speakers and other participants and in terms of the discussions and
cross-disciplinary contacts, which ensued. In fact, the meeting was notable for
the wide range of topic coverage and the scope for cross-fertilization highlighted
by the various discussions. The group of people it brought together would not
normally meet at conventional conferences, but they nevertheless found many
areas of mutual interest. The development of novel highly porous materials, and
the understanding of ways in which their structure and properties can be
characterized and controlled, was thus given a significant boost by the meeting.
