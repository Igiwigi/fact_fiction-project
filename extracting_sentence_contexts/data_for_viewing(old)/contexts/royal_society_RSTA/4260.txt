sufficient representation, analogous to that found in classical physics. Schrédinger expressed this



difficulty in his cat-paradox paper: ‘if a classical state does not exist at any moment, it can hardly
change causally’ ([{16], p. 154).

I shall now define classical causality. Given, however, that most of my uses of the term refer
to classical causality, by ‘causality’ I shall mean primarily classical causality, unless qualified
otherwise. I shall indicate a few alternative conceptions of causality, which are applicable in
quantum theory in the absence of classical causality. If understood classically, causality is an
ontological category, part of reality. It relates to the behaviour of physical systems whose evolution
is defined by the fact that the state of a given system (as idealized by a given theory or model) is
determined at all moments of time by its state at a particular moment of time, indeed at any given
moment of time. This concept is in accord with Kant’s principle of causality cited above and has
been commonly used since, which states that, if an event takes place, it has a determinable cause
or set of causes of which this event is an effect. It is also commonly (although not universally)
assumed that the cause must be antecedent to, or at least simultaneous with, the effect. Quantum : =
phenomena, at least in non-realist interpretations, violate the principle of (classical) causality, :
because no determinable event could be established as the cause of a given event, and only
statistical correlations between certain events could be ascertained. nee)

I define ‘determinism’ as an epistemological category, part of our knowledge of reality.
Determinism denotes our ability to predict the state of a system, at least, again, as defined a]
