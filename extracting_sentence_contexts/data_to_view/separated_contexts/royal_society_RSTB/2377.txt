The basipetal
sequence seen in the Cyatheaceze, Dicksonieswe, Hymenophyllaceze, and Dennstzedtiinse
would hardly be possible without an elongating receptacle; the continual moving
upwards of the more mature sporangia, so that they can freely shed their spores,
leaves space for the initiation of younger ones below, while the latter are in their
early stages close to the source of supply, and protected by the basal indusium. This
seems to me to be the raison d’étre of the elongated receptacle in such cases, and I
apprehend that, given a basipetal succession, it has been a response to the need of
space, by upgrowth from the base, not the result of ‘“ metamorphosis” of any pre-
existing vegetative part. An indirect support for this opinion is found in the fact
that the receptacle disappears in those Ferns where the mixed sorus is acquired.

(c) In cases of “ mixed” sori the receptacle is commonly flat, though some
exceptions do occur. A peculiar interest attaches to those closely allied Ferns of the
Dicksonia-Davallia affinity, in which a transition from the basipetal sequence to the
mixed sorus is believed to have taken place. In Dennstedtia and Microlepia the
receptacle is clearly conical, though it does not show an elongation at all comparable
to that of the Hymenophyllacez ; for the number of the sporangia is but small,
though the succession of them is for the most part strictly basipetal.
