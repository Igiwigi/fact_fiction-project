Merssner and others show, only as a consequence of reactions, by which some of the
ozone is destroyed.

The view here taken is then, that under the action of the ultra-violet light small
drops of water combine with the oxygen in contact with them, and in consequence of
the lowering of the equilibrium vapour pressure by the dissolved H,O, they are able
to grow, when similar drops of pure water would evaporate.

The time taken by the nuclei to grow to any given size depends simply on the
time required for the quantity of dissolved substance produced in each drop by the
action of the ultra-violet light to become sufficient to enable a drop of that size to be
in equilibrium. That, for a drop containing a definite quantity of dissolved substance,
there is a definite size necessary for equilibrium, is obvious from the fact that the
lowering of vapour pressure due to the dissolved substance is proportional to the
concentration, that is, inversely proportional to the volume, while the increase of
vapour pressure due to the curvature of the surface is inversely proportional to the
radius. By the growth of the drop, if initially the solution is too strong for
equilibrium, the lowering of vapour pressure due to the dissolved substance will very
quickly diminish till it ceases to exceed the rise of vapow pressure due to the
curvature,

If it is only, as is in itself quite likely, at the surface of separation of the gas and
liquid that the ultra-violet rays cause combination to take place, the maximum effect
will be produced where, as in this case, the water is in the form of a cloud of minute
particles; for it is only in very small drops that any considerable proportion of the
