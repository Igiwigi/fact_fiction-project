GEORGE W. WALKER ON THE PROBLEM OF

and unknown depth both methods fail, as is obvious from the consideration that, since
all the rays we can observe must have passed out from the focus, we have no data for
the comparatively large range of distance AB on the surface for which brachistochronic
rays would not penetrate as deep as does the observed seismic ray. In fact, another
unknown element enters into the connexion between the observed time curve and the
variation of speed with depth. A finite depth of focus implies a minimum angle of emergence at some point on the
earth’s surface and a point of inflexion on the time curve, and vice versa. Now, in
considering ZépprRitz’s accepted time curve for P, we recognize that up to 4 = 1000 km.
the curve is probably hypothetical, but from 1000 km. to 13,000 km. there is no indication
of a point of inflexion.
