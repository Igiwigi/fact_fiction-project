in the systemic arteries, excite at the same time the augmentor centres in the cord.


PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY OF THE MAMMALIAN HEART. 265

For example, if spontaneous active movements supervene in the course of an experi-
ment, the pressure is raised, the augmentor nerves being excited at the same time as
certain of the vaso-constrictors. This excitation of the augmentor centre is frequently
followed by vagus action, with slowing or irregularity of the ventricles. If, again, we
stimulate the centripetal fibres contained in such a nerve as the sciatic or splanchnic,
we get also augmentor effects on the heart, as well as the constriction of certain
vessels, resulting from the action of certain vaso-motor nerves. The meaning of these
facts appears to us simple enough, namely, that when the supply of blood to a part
of the body is below what is required by its nutrition, it may be for the interest of
