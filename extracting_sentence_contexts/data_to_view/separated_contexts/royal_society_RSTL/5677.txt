This proved that the cause of the accumulation of the
corpuscles did not reside specially in the capillaries, and also showed distinetly that it
could not be explained by mere abnormal adhesiveness of the vascular parietes, which
was, I understand, the view entertained by the late Dr. Marsnaiu Hai; for sup-
posing the walls of the vessels to experience such a change, which seems by no means
improbable, this could only lead to encrusting of the lining membrane of such a yein
with adhering corpuscles, and not to the occupation of its whole calibre by them, as
took place in these cases, unless the corpuscles were themselves also abnormally adhe-
SIVe. Another important fact which was brought out by this class of experiments is, that
mere quiescence of the blood in the vessels of a healthy part fails to induce aggregation
of the red corpuscles, such as occurs in blood outside the body. In the parts which
had not been subjected to irritation, the corpuscles exhibited no trace of adhesiveness;
and though completely at rest, they were nowhere to be seen grouped together, surface
to surface, although in the larger vessels there was abundant space for the occurrence
of this phenomenon, which invariably presents itself in freshly drawn frog's blood
examined between plates of glass in a sufficiently thick film. On one occasion, when
examining the tissues of the web of a frog under chloroform, the limb being kept steady
by a string tied tightly round the thigh, 80 as completely to arrest the circulation, I was
particularly struck with the total absence of adhesiveness in the red corpuscles ; 80 much
80, that, as the foot had been kept moist without circulation for about three hours, I
suspected that it must have imbibed water, which, when mixed with blood outside the
body, destroys altogether the adhesiveness of the red corpuscles. 'This, however, proved
to be a mistake ; for, having occasion to administer more chloroform, 1 applied it on a
piece of lint of considerable size without taking the usual precaution of protecting the
foot from the vapour, and left it 80 for about a quarter of an hour.
