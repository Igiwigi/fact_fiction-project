Risbey et al. also examine the
likelihood of winning bets based on future trends predicted by the CMIP5 ensemble of model :
runs under an intermediate emissions scenario (RCP4.5). They again find that the warming bets =

win almost 100% of the time until late century, when warming begins to stabilize in response Sy
to emission cuts. The certainty of ongoing greenhouse warming, and the fact that it now rivals 2
natural variations on decadal scales, means that bets against greenhouse warming are near certain aed
losers. Furthermore, as noted by Risbey et al., the widespread failure of climate contrarians to a
bet against greenhouse warming, despite arguing that it must be small, reveals their underlying : Ss
