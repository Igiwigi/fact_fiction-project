Pertebre.

In the former Memoir the difficulty of coming to any accurate conclusion
respecting the number of vertebrae was felt to be 80 great that the authors stated
- that *it is beyond our power to determine precisely the number which the skeleton
« contained.” The assumption that nineteen vertebrae intervened between the
skull and the last dorsal (that which is anchylosed to the pelvis) was made doubt-
fully, and with the full expectation that more extended study might reyerse it.
It was based on the probability that Pezophaps would possess as many vertebra as
Didus, and on the fact that Prof. Owex's artist had assigned that number to the

latter.*

A The former collection contained one hundred and sixty-one vertebree. Those
Feceiyed in the recent collection of Mr. Jenner alone augment this number to

e hundred and thirty-two assignable to the cervical region, which we conceive
Should be distributed as follows :—
