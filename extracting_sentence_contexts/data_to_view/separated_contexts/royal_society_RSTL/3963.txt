Hence the reason that though the rotation of the bar or cube
(2324. 2328.) upon its own axis is stopped, its vibration as a pendulum is not affected.

2331. That neither the one nor the other motion is affected when the bar or cube
is over the vertical pole (2328.), is simply because in both cases (with the given
dimensions of the pole and the moving metal) the lines of particles through which
the induced currents tend to move are parallel throughout the whole mass ; and

therefore, as there is no part by which the return of the current can be, carried on,
no current can be formed.

2332. Before proceeding to the explanation of the other phenomena, it will be
necessary to point out the fact generally understood and acknowledged, I believe,
that time is required for the development of magnetism in an iron core by a current
of electricity; and also for its fall back again when the current is stopped. One
effect of the gradual rise in power was referred to in the last series of these Researches
(2170.). This time is probably longer with iron not well annealed than with yery
good and perfectly annealed iron.
