The
E further changes which take place are, in the main, similar to those in other Ichthy-
E opsida, but in some ways the appearance of the embryo is, as may be gathered from
Â£ fig. 52, rather strange. This is mainly due to the fact that the embryo does not
6 become folded off from the yolk in the manner usual in the Vertebrates ; and as could
'S be shown in the sequel, the relation of the yolk to the embryo is unlike that in any
S other known Vertebrate. The appearance of the embryo is thus something like that
& of an ordinary embryo slit open along the ventral side and then flattened out. Organs
which properly belong to the ventral side appear in the lateral parts of the dorsal
surface.
