it was employed, had been supplied to them. It is evident therefore that this failure
was due chiefly to the ova, and not to inefficiency of the impregnating fluid. On the
other hand, I have been equally unsuccessful with ova from a frog that had been
killed only two hours and a balf when the impregnating fluid employed had been
more than four hours and a half mixed with water. In this case the failure appeared
to have been due chiefly to the spermatozoa, nearly the whole of which, on inspection
by the microscope, were found to be motionless and appeared to have lost their vita-
lity. At the same time it must be mentioned that the female from which the ova
employed in No. 3 of the last set of experiments were obtained still existed, in $0 far
as the vitality of the muscular system was concerned, and therefore can hardly be
mentioned in comparison with MM. PrgvosT and Dumas' observation. But while the
numerical results obtained by myself have been less favourable than those of SraL-
LANZANI or the physiologists now mentioned, the general facts, so far as they are open
to comparison, are in full accordance with them. The difference in the details of
our respective obseryations appears to have been due in chief part to the influence of
temperature at the time of the impregnation of the ova, or within the first two or
three hours after the impregnating fluid has been supplied. Thus, if the temperature

as I have stated, has more certainly taken place than when the temperature was suh-
