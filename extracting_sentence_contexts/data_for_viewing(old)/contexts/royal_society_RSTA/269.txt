Warwick University. Extracts from David’s letter are reproduced [in figure 2], and in the ae
body of the letter, he recounted in his elegant script and with his usual clarity of expression 2S
the essentials of catastrophe theory, and how they related to our work at UCL on the : %
buckling of elastic structures. :B
limmediately invited David to come to UCL for a chat about this seminal collision of ideas. :&

Quite remarkably, Giles had just computed the imperfection sensitivity characteristics for
a stiffened elastic plate and drawn a beautiful three-dimensional representation of the
singularity (see fig. 6 of my ‘advice article’ in this Theme Issue). David immediately
identified this as a hyperbolic umbilic catastrophe, seemingly the first known practical
example of this important interactive phenomenon.

The galvanizing impact of this meeting is well testified by the fact that within two months
Giles and I had submitted a major article to the Journal of Applied Mathematics and Physics
(ZAMP) [60] entitled Towards a unified bifurcation theory, in which we laid out in full the
relationships between the two lines of research, and including, of course, Giles’ hyperbolic
umbilic picture. This turned out to be an influential and highly cited paper. It appeared
in 1975, as did David’s insightful introduction to catastrophe theory in the IMA Bulletin
[61], which served as an excellent and accessible guide to many of my subsequent research
students.

The close working relationships that catastrophe theory triggered with the Warwick group,
including Ian Stewart and David Rand, served me well in later years when I encountered
the perplexing chaotic motions of articulated mooring towers.
