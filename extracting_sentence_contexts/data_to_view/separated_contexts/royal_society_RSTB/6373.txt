Prerrer (1901), however,
shows that the hyaline thickening, of ectodermal origin, which covers the mouth of
the cup must be regarded as a lens, an observation I have been able to confirm. Cutnort’s account differs from that of all other workers in respect to the cuticle
which, he says, “ descend jusque dans les godets oculaires qu’elle revét complete-
ment”. My sections of the optic cushion of Marthasterias glacialis show, on the
contrary, that the epithelial cells of the optic cup have no cuticular lining resulting
from an invagination of the cuticle ; the latter, in fact, is entirely superficial in
position. Finally, there remains for consideration the histology of the cells which
line the optic cup. Briefly stated, there are two divergent views as to the nature of
these elements of ectodermal origin.
