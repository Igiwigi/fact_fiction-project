The question then arises as to what such secondary
cartilage really represents. 1 think that there can be no doubt that it represents
a preformation of a dermal ossification, and it may be noticed that, in the case of the
dentary, as well as of the pterygoid, the dermal ossification is not plate-like, but thick,
and is sunk at some little distance beneath the surface. Prof. Watson has also kindly
drawn my attention to the fact that the preformation of dermal ossification in secondary
cartilage tends to occur at places where muscle-attachments are formed. â€˜There seems,
then, every reason to believe that secondary cartilage is an embryonic adaptation of
a functional nature, and that qua cartilage it is secondary, though the dermal bone
which it precedes is a primitive structure, inherited from the reptiles. Now, the relations of the secondary pterygoid cartilage to the ala temporalis in
Sorex are very suggestive of those of the pterygoid bone to the processus ascendens
of the pterygo-quadrate of a reptile such as Lacerta, and of which a drawing of a
transverse section is given in text-fig.
