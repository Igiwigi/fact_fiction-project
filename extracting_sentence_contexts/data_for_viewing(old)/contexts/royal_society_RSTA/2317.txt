B, then an observer can define an experiment (A, B) with a behaviour given by p(S_4) ® q(Sp),
where @ is the tensor product.

b) Result

The aim of this paper is to prove the following:

Theorem 3.4. The set of behaviours P(S) allowed by quantum theory for any Bell or KS scenario S is
equal to the largest set allowed by assumptions 3.1 and 3.2.

c) The totalitarian principle

The fact that the quantum set equals the largest set allowed by assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 implies
that any behaviour allowed by these assumptions is compulsory in the sense that there exist a
preparation and a set of measurements that produce it. This resembles Gell-Mann’s totalitarian
principle [4]: ‘anything not forbidden is compulsory’.

The story of the totalitarian principle can be summarized as follows. In the context of the
interactions between baryons, antibaryons and mesons, Gell-Mann made the observation that any
process which is not forbidden by a conservation law is not only allowed but must be included
in the sum over all paths which contribute to the outcome of the interaction. Gell-Mann named it
the ‘principle of compulsory strong interactions’ [4] and commented that it ‘is related to the state
of affairs that is said to prevail in a perfect totalitarian state. Anything that is not compulsory
is forbidden’ [4]. After that, the principle started to be called ‘Gell-Mann/’s totalitarian principle’
[43,44] and reformulated as ‘anything not forbidden is compulsory’. However, Trigg [45] and
