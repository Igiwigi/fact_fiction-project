The discrepancy between Experiments III. and IV. is
mainly due, as the values of D show, to accidental errors of the small flows in
opposite directions. The mean value 4°1803 agrees very well, allowing for the
difference of temperature, with the value 4°1810 deduced from observations I. and IT.
with calorimeter D at 28°°0 C., which would give 4°1805 at 29°10 C.

(37.) Variation of the Gradient-Correction with Temperature. The importance of this correction arises chiefly from the fact that the value of the
heat-loss increases with rise of temperature for any calorimeter. As a result, the
correction, which depends on the square of the heat-loss, is considerably larger at
higher temperatures, and thus affects the curve of variation of the specific heat as
well as the absolute values. If the correction were constant, it would affect only the
absolute values, which would matter little owing to the uncertainty of the electrical
units.
