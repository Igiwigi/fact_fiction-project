of Plate 17 appears in fig. 37. Characteristics of the stage are the incomplete efface-
ment of the pachytene coiling and the diminished chromosome length. It is no longer
possible to distinguish the limits of paired and unpaired regions with certainty, but
chiasmata cannot yet be separated, optically, from twists. This difficulty ceases at
diplotene (figs. 38, 38a, Plate 17; fig. 51, Plate 18). From diplotene to diakinesis
(fig. 52, Plate 18; fig. 39, Plate 17; and fig. 18, Plate 16) appearances are too well
known to need description.

In sectioned material the earliest stage at which a whole chromosome can be traced
throughout its length is pachytene. Free ends can be detected even as far back as
preleptotene, but the mass is then too closely tangled for any one thread to be followed
very far. At early pachytene (fig. 34) this can just be done, and at late pachytene
(fig. 35) it is comparatively easy owing to the fact that the chromosome threads are
not only better spaced but shorter. Now a very interesting fact emerges from a
measurement of the chromosome of fig. 35. Allowing for the two ends being slightly
out of focus the length is 36 mm. (see Appendix IV). But this figure is of the same order
as the values previously obtained for the length of a somatic chromosome (the measured
prophase specimen came to 40 mm.). This means that in meiosis the chromosome at
pachytene, after the movements of pairing have ended, is roughly comparable in
length to the somatic chromosome at its fullest extension.

It is, however, important to notice that in comparison with earlier stages of meiosis
the chromosome at late pachytene is not at its fullest extension. If whole chromosomes
at early and at late pachytene are compared the former are invariably the longer.
This is at once apparent if the outlines of the photographed specimens are drawn side
