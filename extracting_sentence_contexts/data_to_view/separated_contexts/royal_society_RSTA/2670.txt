This approximation decouples equations (3.7) and (3.8). The
individual wave-like terms in (3.7) and (3.8) can be absorbed separately by going to the
respective comoving frames, which make both (3.7) and (3.8) take the standard form of the
linear Edward-Wilkinson (EW) equation with quenched disorder [16], that is studied extensively
in the literature, shows roughening phenomena that is controlled by the quenched disorder. Given the fact that linear equations (3.7) and (3.8) are essentially coupled generalizations of
the standard quenched EW equation, the former equations should also display roughening
phenomena. In the special limit By =0, uy follows the standard quenched EW equation (after
removing the B)-term by comoving). The statistical properties of uy are known in this limit [16].
