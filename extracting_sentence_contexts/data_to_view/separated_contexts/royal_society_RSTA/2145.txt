Conclusion

We propose the first mixed-signal (analogue/digital/relative temporal) perceptron design using
the principles of PWM. Central to our design are a number of parallel inverters that suitably
transcode the input-weight pairs from the spatial domain to the relative temporal domain. This approach aims to deliver high resilience to amplitude and frequency variations in the
supply voltage, exploiting the fact that PWM-based solutions are typically agnostic to such
variations. Another advantage of the proposed design is its simplicity. While conventional
implementations of the perceptron require complex logic to perform multiplication and addition,
the proposed approach uses only one gate (either an inverter or a two-input NAND) per
bit for every input.
