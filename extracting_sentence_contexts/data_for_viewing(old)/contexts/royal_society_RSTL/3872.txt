own enlarged structure, and in part also to the presence of numerous gray nucleated
cells, which assist to form the ganglion. Between these two series of longitudinal
fibres are placed the commissural ones (g), which pass transversely through the gan-
glia for the posterior pair of nexves (4). The fibres of reinforcement which form the
sides of the cord are distinctly seen at the sides of each ganglion beneath the trans-
parent covering of the cord (b), bounding the sides of the ganglion in the interspace
of two nerves (f'), and also at the posterior surface of the nerve where they join the
cord, having between themselves and the commissural fibres, and fibres of the cord,
a slight interspace, which is occupied by nucleated cells. Those fibres which belong
to the anterior pair of neryes, which have been seen to be afterwards removed from
the ganglia, have communications both with the anterior and posterior nerves, thus
combining in action the nerves which are distributed to the muscles (c) and sides of
the segment with those which are given to the legs (4). This fact is interesting from
the circumstance that the commissural fibres which enter into the composition of
these anterior nerves are placed above the superior aganglionic tract of the cord, and
this will in great measure account for the removal of these nerves from above the
ganglion, with which they are thus shown to be in connexion during the growth and
elongation of the cord itself. It is also further worthy of notice, that this is a con-
dition in these nerves of Polydesmus precisely analogous to that which exists in the
respiratory nerves in the larva state of insects, in which, as I formerly* showed, there
are commissural fibres running transversely across the segments and lying loosely
above the aganglionic tract of the cord. In regard to the enlargement of the fibres
of the cord, it may be remarked, that the ganglia are always softer and far more
