The
modification of blue-green to white is obviously of a different nature. One suggestion is
that in some way, at present unknown, the blue-green receptors have become altered into

dominators. The fact that the latter were found by Granit to have response curves extending

over nearly the whole of the visible spectrum, does not prove that when stimulated they
would cause a sensation of white to be perceived, but that seems to be a justifiable supposi-
tion, for dominators would be expected to give a colourless sensation, just as the rods do in
twilight vision. A possible alternative view is that the blue-green receptors give a colourless
sensation, not by their conversion into dominators, but by their being linked with the other
colour centres in the brain: either the red one only, or more probably the red, yellow and
blue. It should not be difficult to decide which of these two alternative schemes is correct,
by an examination of the shape of the luminosity curve for colourless foveal vision ; for on
the first hypothesis it should be of the dominator type, as found by Granit—that is, an
exceptionally broad type of response curve should be obtained; on the other hand, if the
second hypothesis is correct the response curve should be narrow, resembling that of one
of Granit’s ‘modulators’.
