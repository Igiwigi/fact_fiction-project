This may possibly be due to a smaller value of « for the stratum of gravel about
4 feet thick which separates these two thermometers, than for the higher strata, or
to the fact of No. 5 being buried at some distance (9 feet 6 inches) from the vertical
plane containing the other three. Unfortunately, when the pits were open, no very critical examination of the
character of the gravels at different depths was made; but it is proposed to repair
this omission when next the thermometers are dug up. The excessively close agreement of the mean values of /7/« derived from the
annual and half-yearly waves is very remarkable (especially in view of the fact that
the results are deduced from the observations of a single year), and seems to indicate
a high degree of precision in the observations. The systematically larger values found from the diminution of amplitude, as com-
pared with those deduced from the retardation of phase must be traced to some
other cause, and may possibly be due to the proximity of the Observatory building,
the south front of which is situated at a distance of 36 feet from the thermometers. The temperature of the ground beneath the buildings would in all probability be
different from that at an equal depth beneath the exposed surface.
