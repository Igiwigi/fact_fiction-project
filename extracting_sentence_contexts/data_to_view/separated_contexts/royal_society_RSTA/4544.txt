This could be an
explanation—next to model biases in feedback strength—for the questions outlined in §1
(figure 2). The inconsistency of ECS estimates based on the observed warming and those based
on GCMs with freely evolving SST evolution could be partly caused by the assumption of a
constant 4. The estimates based on the observed warming, which use an effective radiative forcing
estimated from GCMs together with the assumption of a constant 4, would be biased low, if 4
would, in fact, not be constant but time or temperature dependent, as shown in figure 4b. In the
same way, a state and temperature dependency of 4 makes the mapping of GCM, palaeo-proxy
and short-term observational estimated sensitivities a lot more difficult. Does this imply the zero-order linear energy balance model is useless?
