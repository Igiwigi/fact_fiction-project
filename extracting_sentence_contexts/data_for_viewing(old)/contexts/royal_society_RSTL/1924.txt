a lighted taper, did not prevent the animal, still possessed of active powers of
motion, from passing into a state of complete and permanent quiescence.

The same observations were made upon various other animals—the turtle,
the viper (/ipera Berus), the toad (Bufo vulgaris), the frog (Rana temporaria),
the eft (Triton cristatus), &c. It may therefore be stated as a general fact,
that if an animal be deprived of the cerebrum and medulla oblongata, and

muli, it will not move, however easily it may be excited to motion by external
impressions.

I must now solicit the attention of the Society to three important points :
it is obvious,

1st, That sensation can act, in inducing muscular motion, only through the
medium of volition ;

2ndly, That, in the experiments which have been described, volition, —the
