The animal continued to improve, and on the 107th day was tested as to sensibility. The reaction
to heat and to pricking was apparently normal. The clip is now removed from the right (paralyzed)
foot almost as soon as from the left. It was anesthetized, and the whole of the leg area of the cortex
cerebri on the right side removed. The next day the animal was found sitting up, and quite recovered
from the shock of the operation. The animal is found to be completely paralyzed in the left (previously
non-paralyzed) leg. The right (formerly paralyzed leg) retains as much movement as immediately
before the operation. The skin of the left foot feels neither hot, dry, nor is it swollen. A clip placed
upon the left foot produced no facial signs indicating that the animal felt, whereas, when attached to
the right foot, it showed plainly that it felt, and in less than 80 seconds drew the leg up and removed it.
The feet dipped in hot water successively, the animal responded much more readily with the right foot
than the left. Similarly, pricking caused more excitement of the animal on the right side than the
left ; in fact, it took very little notice when the left side was pricked.

That is, the reverse of what it formerly was.

The animal remained in this condition for 8 days, when it was killed with chloroform.

The spinal cord was removed, hardened, and sections of it made in the usual manner. The lesion
itself is not shown in Plate 1, but a photo-micrograph of a section of the cord just above the lesion,
showing the ascending degenerations and the shrinkage to nearly half its size of right side. When the
cord was taken ont, the seat of the lesion was evidenced by a small fibrous nodule, situated on the right
