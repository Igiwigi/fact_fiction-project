But since the Siler of Mr. Darron's theory of
chemical combination, as explained and illustrated by Dr. TrnomsoN,* the inquiry which T had designed appears to be
superfluous, as all the facts that I had observed are but par-
ticular instances of the more general obseryation of Mr. DaLTox, that in all cases the simple elements of bodies are
disposed'to unite atom to atom singly, or, if either is in excess,
it exceeds by a ratio to be expressed by some simple multiple
of the number of its atoms.
