also affects power consumption as an approximately linear
function of sampling frequency and, therefore, battery
capacity and ultimately size (figure 2). In a manner similar
to that illustrated for the porpoise above, if sampling frequen-
cies are to define particular waveforms, then data need to be
sampled at a rate at least two times the highest frequency
component in that waveform. Elephants are capable of gener-
ating infrasonic calls [51] with frequencies below 50 Hz being
possible, and lasting for several seconds [52]. In this case, an
accelerometer would need to record at twice the highest fre-
quency of an elephantâ€™s vocalization range to detect/record
the sound [53], assuming that the ensuing vibration can be
sensed by accelerometers. In fact, by sampling acceleration
at 320 Hz on African elephants Loxodonta africana, we have
detected clear pulsed waveforms at 19Hz, which we
assumed were due to infrasound.

(b) Memory
A key element of biologgers is that they store, rather than
transmit, data [54]. This has power and_ practicality
