We reversed our positions, and I
heard substantially the same, perhaps a little fainter. On joining my assistant at the
bridge I heard the loud concussion of a gun, and was informed by a police-inspector that
it came from Woolwich, and that he had heard several shots about 2 P.M. and previously. The fact, if a fact, was of the highest importance in relation to the present question ; 80
I immediately telegraphed to my friend Professor Auer, asking him for information. He
was absent in Portsmouth when the telegram arrived, but on his return he found that
guns had been fired at the proof-butts about the time mentioned in my telegram. On
the following day he kindly furnished me with the following particulars :—


AS A VEHICLE OF SOUND. 211

«The firing took place at 1.40 p.x., The guns proved were of comparatively small
8ize—64-pounders, with 10-lb. charges of powder.

.* The concussion experienced at my house and office, about three quarters of a mile
from the butt, was decidedly more severe than that experienced when the heaviest guns
are proved with charges of 110 to 120 1bs. of powder.
