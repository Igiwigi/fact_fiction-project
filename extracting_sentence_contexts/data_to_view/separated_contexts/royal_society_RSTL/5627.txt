R. JOUNSON ON THE RELATIVE

amalgams, convinced that if the chemical nature of alloys and amalgams is still en:
loped in darkness, it is because they have been prepared with impure or commercial.
metals, and not made in equivalent quantities. 'The consequence has been, that as
metals have only a slight affinity for each other, and as the definite compounds which
they have a tendency to form were mixed with an excess of one of the metals employed,
the alloys produced have presented properties which could lead to no information as to
their nature. These difficulties have been increased by the fact, that in many alloys,
such as those of copper and tin, or copper and zinc, the metals have a tendency, when
allowed to cool slowly, to form several crystallizable compounds, differing in their com-
position in the various parts of the alloys; the less fusible being on the exterior, and
those more 80 in the interior of the mass. 'The impurities existing in commercial metals
are often 80 large as considerably to modify the properties of their alloys; for we have
found in our researches that if 1 per cent. of a metal be added to 99 of another, it alters
its conducting power most materially. 'To ayoid these causes of error, we have composed
our alloys of pure metals and employed definite proportions. The apparatus which we used is composed of a deal box (Plate XXVII.), A, 105
millims. in width, 165 millims. in length, and 220 millims. in height; with a cover, and
painted white externally and internally. Inside this box are two vulcanized india-
rubber square vessels, the sides of which are 15 millims. thick.
