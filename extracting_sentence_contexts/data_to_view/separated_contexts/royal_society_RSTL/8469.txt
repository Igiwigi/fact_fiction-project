BrsSEL has shown this for a=0; and it can easily be proved to
hold good when « is a submultiple of } and þ a multiple of a. For the horary groups I find the fourth order sufficient. These horary groups might
be combined in triple sets; but, as I have said, there is a difficulty in the interpolation
due to the fact that while «/, the mean of any three, is multiplied by cosine or sine of 0,

9

the first and third components of it should be multiplied by the same functions of 9—6
and 0+b. This, however, may easily be corrected. Take the case of A : the effect of
three components to determine this is :—
