Thus, (0,L;4)D and E%,(0,A) are exp(—o+L)-close, where o+ is the rate of exponential decay of
solutions at +00, and so the set of cluster points as L > oo of the negative zeros of D, (A) is equal
to the set of negative zeros of Dp.(A), counting multiplicity, by Rouché’s theorem as in [32, Rmk
4.3], and by remark 3.5.

(ii) Combining the result from (i) with theorem 3.1(v), we see that

Mor(H) = Mor(H_) = # conjugate points in (—0o, L)

for any L > L4. As Mor(H) does not depend on L, we conclude that there are no conjugate points
in (Loo, +00), and so Mor(H) is equal to the number of conjugate points in R.

(iii) This is equivalent to (ii), because Hy fails to be invertible precisely when L is a conjugate
point. a

Remark 4.3. The fact that Mor(H;) converges to Mor(H) as L > +00 has also been shown in
[33]. Here we used an alternative proof based on the arguments from [32] (see also [16]) where
the spectrum of the operator on the full line was approximated by the spectra of the operator
on [—L,L]. Unlike [33], this approach generalizes to operators which are not self-adjoint; this
is relevant as recent progress has been made in defining Maslov-like indices for such problems
(e.g. [34]).
