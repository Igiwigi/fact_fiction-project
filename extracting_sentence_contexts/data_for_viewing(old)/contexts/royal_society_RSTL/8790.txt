Fig. 31 a. Mouth-region (0) of an embryo at a somewhat earlier period, more highly
magnified. Surface-view.

Plate 3. figs. 32, 33, represent two views of an embryo less fully formed than that
of fig. 30, but still showing the shell-gland remarkably well (54). The embryo is also
remarkable for the distinctness with which it exhibits the condition of the alimentary
canal with its two central lobes or gastric chambers, and fore and aft the pharynx and
the rectal peduncle.

Though the foot is developed to 80 slight an extent in this specimen and the body-
walls generally were 80 thin and transparent as to suggest some abnormality of deve-
lopment, yet at the point marked F in the figure, glow moyements of contraction and
expansion were going on. From this phase onward, in fact, the foot exhibits muscular
movements.

Plate 3. figs. 34, 35, 36 go together, giving different views of three embryos of very
nearly the same stage of developmentâ€”that is to say, a little in advance of the embryo
of fig. 31. The foot has now grown out as a yery prominent conical mass, and being
covered with vibratile cilia and capable of considerable alteration of form, becomes the
chief locomotive organ, The embryos in this condition move about freely in the brood-
pouch, and feed on the material supplied to them from its walls. The pharynx (ph)
now actively functions, expanding widely and bringing in material to its cavity by
means of its ciliate lining, then contracting sharply, and passing on its contents to the
left gastric chamber. Hence the food passes by a slow circular moyement into the
adjacent right gastric chamber, and thence to the rectum. As yet, however, there is
