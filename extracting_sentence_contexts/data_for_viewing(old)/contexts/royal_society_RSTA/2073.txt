strong invariants. It has been applied to a wide variety of problems including quantum optics
and related systems [13-15], non-stationary quantum field theory [16-18], geometric phases
[19-21] quantum computation [22] and quantum cosmology [23]. It is worth emphasizing that
the classical counterpart of the Lewis—Riesenfeld strong invariant can be derived by Noether’s
theorem [24] (see also [25] for a simplified discussion). Its generalization to dissipative systems
has recently been presented in [11], where the weak invariant of the time-dependent quantum
damped oscillator has explicitly been constructed by the use of the Lindblad equation.

The action principle for kinetic theory has repeatedly been discussed in the literature. Among
others, the approach [26,27] should be noticed, in particular. There, an auxiliary field is introduced
in order for the construction of the action functional for the Liouville-von Neumann equation,
and thus this approach is referred to as the auxiliary field formalism. A primary reason for
the introduction of such an extra field is due to the fact that the Liouville-von Neumann
equation is a first-order differential equation in time for a density matrix. Although the Liouville—
von Neumann equation possesses time-reversal invariance (for autonomous isolated systems),
more general master equations may violate such symmetry. For example, the Lindblad equation
repeatedly mentioned above describes dissipative dynamics. Then, the auxiliary field formalism
comes to play a prominent role: the action can be constructed for dissipative kinetics through
the extension of the space of variables. It is also mentioned that this formalism offers a powerful
tool for obtaining approximate solutions in analytic forms if combined with the Rayleigh-Ritz
method [27,28].


Recently, the auxiliary field formalism has been applied to classical fractional kinetic equations
[28,29] as well as a general quantum master equation [30]. It has been found that the auxiliary field
