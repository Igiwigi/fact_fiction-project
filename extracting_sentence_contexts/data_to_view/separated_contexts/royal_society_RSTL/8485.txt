Then increasing the yalue of 3, by that amount, the yalue
will be diminished by 0-001, and that of 4, increased by half as much, The error of the results in the mon
of July cannot therefore much exceed this. In January the mean moyement of the air is 80 low that the ern
of the assumption similarly estimated must be quite insignificant. n x
I should expect that the differences of d, and d, are principally due to the real mean temperature of tho 1

e +, o
column in most months being somewhat higher than the assumed temperature 5t5, A certain

error must arise also from the fact that tho adopted values of yapour-tension are probably in all cages low
than the real tensions ; but the effect of this cannot be yery great. MR. H. F. BLANFORD ON THE WINDS OF NORTHERN INDIA. 609
