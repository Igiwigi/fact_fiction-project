Our inhomogeneous scalar field theory </ may be augmented to a theory with values in Algsts
in various ways. The simplest is to define of :locStc—> AlgSts so that </(M, J) = (./(M,]), (M, J)", 4)
for each object (M, J) of LocSrc, and taking A (ir) to be the morphism induced by ./(w) for each
morphism y : (M,J) > (M’, J’) in LocStc (note that </(y)* maps any state of /(M’,]’) to a state of
A (M,]J)). A more interesting possibility is to equip each A(M, J) with the corresponding set of
Hadamard states, which are the standard choice of physically acceptable states of the scalar field

(e.g. 3).

1For example, let A = ®ay((Om + 2)f) + (fy If dvolus)12rcmy)- Then our definitions give

kgA=Po)((Om + nf) + (| Gu +P fod vol) lag + (\, Ifa vol) Asim) =0

using the relations in /(M, 0) and the field equation obeyed by ¢, which is consistent with the fact that A =0 by the relations
in o/(M,]).

2By the time-slice property (discussed later) there are isomorphisms /(M, J) = «/(M’,J’) whenever the Cauchy surfaces of
Mand M can be related by an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism.

3For simplicity of presentation, we suppress a further condition often imposed on state spaces: namely that S should be

closed under operations induced by .A, ie. to each w € S and Be A with «(B*B) > 0, the state wp(A) = @(B*AB)/w(B*B) is
also an element of S. Definition 3.2. A state w on A(M,J) is said to be Hadamard if the corresponding two-
point function W2) :C%°(M) x C%(M) + C defined by WO(E,f) =o(arpy(fOarp(f')) is a
distribution in Z'(M x M) with wavefront set

where V+/~ is the bundle of future/past-directed null covectors on M.
