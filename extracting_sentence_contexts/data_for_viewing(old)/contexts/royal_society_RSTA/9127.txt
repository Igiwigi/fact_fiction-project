perpendicular to each of the B directions. Thus we may substitute for (3.81) the new
equations of constraint

(3.85) BaymQ” = Beyng” = »-» = Bang” = 0.
The equations of motion are (3.85) together with
(3.86) f=Q + 0B, + 0 Bey +... + 0” Biyy,
where 0”, 6@,...,6@ are undetermined. Differentiation of (3.85) with respect to
t gives
(3.87) Band” + Barun TQ" = «+ = Bannf” + Baoun TT = 0.
Multiplying (3.86) by By), and summing as indicated, we obtain
(3.871) By, f" = By, Q + 6",

using the fact that the B vectors are of unit magnitude and mutually perpendicular.
Hence by (3.87)
(3.872) 9” = — Bon Q” = Bonn"
Similar expressions may be obtained for 6°, ..., 6°. When we substitute in (3.86)
we obtain the equations of motion
(3.88) f= — (Baym Q” ea Boy qq") Bay

=" (Baym Q” a Beyun¥"1') Be)

= (Bann + Bann GZ’) Boy
Thus we have the result :
