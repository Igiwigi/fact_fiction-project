This
may be compared with the approximate formula b/,/(Ay) for the maximum height when
b>A. These two expressions would be equal at r= y if b?/Ay = 6/n7, i.e. b = A/a, which
suggests that the formula b/,/(Ay) for the maximum wave height gives a rough approxi-
mation for values of b down to about A/7. The fact that the maximum height is proportional
to b and not ./b when the gap is not very small means that the energy of the wave motion
passing through the gap is still propagated mainly in the direction of the incident waves. REFERENCES
