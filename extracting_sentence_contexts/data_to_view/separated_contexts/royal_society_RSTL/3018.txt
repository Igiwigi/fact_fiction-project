It was Berzervs, I believe, who first spoke of the aptness of certain particles
to assume opposite states when in presence of each other (959.). Hypothetically we
may s8uppose these states to increase in intensity by increased approximation, or by
heat, &c. until at a certain point combination occurs, accompanied by snch an arrange-
ment of the forces of the two particles between themselves as is equiyalent to a dis-
charge, producing at the same time a particle which is throughout a conductor (1700.).

1740. This aptness to assume an excited electrical state (which is probably polar
in those forming non-conducting matter) appears to be a primary fact, and to par-
take of the nature of induction (1162.), for the particles do not seem capable of re-
taining their particular state independently of each other (1177.) or of matter in the
opposite state. What appears to be definite about the particles of matter is their
assumption of a particular state, as the positive or negative, in relation to each other,
and not of either one or other indifferently ; and also the acquirement of force up to
a certain amount.

1741. Itis easily conceivable that the same force which causes local action between
two free particles shall produce current force if one of the particles is previously in
combination, forming part of an electrolyte (923. 1738.).
