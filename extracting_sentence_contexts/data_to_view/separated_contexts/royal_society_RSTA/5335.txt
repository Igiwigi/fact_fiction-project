Increases in CO, or in ocean temperature have the same effects. The other two equations describe the dynamics of CO2 and the response
of deep-ocean temperature to changes in ice volume. It is further assumed
that the mean state of the climate varied slowly throughout the Pliocene
Pleistocene; in particular, in response to a ‘tectonically driven’ decline in the
