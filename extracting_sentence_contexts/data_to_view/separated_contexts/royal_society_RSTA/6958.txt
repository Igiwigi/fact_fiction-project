Apart from androsterone, the lactone from Coe
digoxigenin and cholestane-5-ol-3-6-dione, it includes only oA / /
compounds such as ethers, esters and halogen and keto de-

rivatives, in none of which are there any hydroxyl groups. The length of 4 is fairly constant at 7-6-7-9 A; the plane of asing
the ring system is approximately in the a plane, asin # AP
corresponding to twice the molecular thickness. The slope of

the long axes of the molecules to the ¢ plane is generally pro-

nounced, varying from about 127 to 135°. (There are devi-

ations at either end of the series.) This molecular arrange-

ment (figure 2) can be considered as a fundamental from

which a great many of the others described here are built up, |

in fact, all the remaining normal type structures. Its relation poe

to the type of ergotetraene (b 211) (figure 3) in which the a tis
and } axes are interchanged is obvious from the nomenclature. |

But 4-4-cholestene-7-ol, ab (21)1 (figure 4), can also be very (
closely derived from it by a gradual tilting of the plane of the

ring system to the 4 plane. The structure type a 212 (thirty-six compounds) is essenti- |
ally the same as a 211 and can be considered to be built up it
of two units of this placed end to end in the c direction.
