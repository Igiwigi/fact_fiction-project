chanically together in the proportion of 14:3; the amount of radiant heat which they
then absorb is augmented more than a thousandfold Â® the moment they build themselves
together into molecules of ammonia. Neither the quantity nor the ultimate quality
of the matter is here changed; the act of chemical union is the sole cause of the enor-
mous alteration in the amount of heat intercepted. The converse of these statements
is of course also true ; dissolve the chemical bond, either of the nitrous oxide or of the
ammonia, and you instantly destroy the absorption. As a proof that our atmosphere is
a mixture, and not a compound, no experiment with which I am acquainted matches in
point of conclusiveness that which demonstrates the deportment of dry air to radiant heat.

But the molecules which can thus intercept the waves of ether must be shaken by
those waves, possibly shaken asunder. That ordinary thermometric heat provokes
chemical actions is one of the commonest facts of observation. These actions, considered
from a physical point of view, are changes of molecular position and arrangement con-
sequent on the acceptance of motion from the source of heat, Radiant heat also, if
sufficiently intense and if absorbed with sufficient avidity, could produce all the effects
of ordinary thermometric heat. The dark rays, for example, which can make platinum
white-hot, could also, if absorbed, produce the chemical effects of white-hot platinum.
They could decompose water, as now in a moment they can boil water. But the decom-
position in this case would be effected by the virtual conversion of the radiant heat into
thermometric heat. There would be nothing in the act characteristic of radiation, or
demanding it as an essential element in the decomposition.

The dark calorific rays are powerfully absorbed by various bodies, but, as a general
rule, they do not appear competent to set up that particular motion among the consti-
