They are absent in
the Diptera. Their mode of origin is always similar and they arise, like the other
body appendages with which they are homologous, as evaginations of the body-wall. But, notwithstanding the fact that they are temporary embryonic structures, their
development and final fate apparently varies considerably in different insects. Thus, in the Orthoptera, they shrivel up during late embryonic life and are probably
(certainly in the Acrididae) mechanically cast off during hatching. A similar fate
has been recorded in some of the Coleoptera (Melolontha vulgaris, GRABER, 1888, 6) ;
the Cicadidae (WHEELER, 1890; Hrymons, 1899); Blatta (WHEELER, 1890) ; and
some of the Hymenoptera (Hylotoma, GRaBer, 1890 ; and ants, TANQUARAY, 1913).
