The calcification, proceeding from the middle of the vertebrae, and investing the
intervertebral cartilage by its head- and tailward extension, produces two hollow
cones, which meet point to point in the middle of the vertebra (7.Â¢., in the transverse
level of the arches), while their bases coincide with the middle of the intervertebral
cartilage (level of the future joint). When, lastly, the cartilaginous arches themselves
are ossified, macerated vertebree look strikingly like the biconcave vertebree of many
Teleostean fishes,

The invertebral ring of actively growing cartilage hinders the chorda in its further
growth, reducing it to a thread (occasionally called funiculus chord), or even
destroying it completely. In many Urodela, especially in the Perennibranchiata, the whole intervertebral
cartilage acts as the joint, being, in fact, a flexible mass intercalated between the
bases of the hollow calcified cones of the successive vertebrie. However imperfect
this joint may be, it does fultil the requirements of these long-bodied and long-tailed
aquatic Urodela. Even in the more terrestrial Urodeles the formation of the intervertebral joint does
not always lead to a complete severance of the cartilage, but, as GuGENBAUR has
already fully described, only a differentiation of its cells takes place, while the inter-
cellular substance remains continuous.
