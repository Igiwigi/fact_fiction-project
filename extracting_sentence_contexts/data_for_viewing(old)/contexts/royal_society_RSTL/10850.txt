But if the load has been 3 kilos., or anything greater (sill nob exceeding the limit
of elasticity), the effect when it becomes cyclic is that on gives fall and off gives rise
of magnetism. This corresponds to the effects shown in fig. 36 for the cycles of load
from 0-3-0 up to 0-9-0.

Now it would seem, from the fact that when 1 kilo. only is applied and removed on
gives rise and off gives fall of magnetism, that there is essentially a maximum of
magnetisation in this annealed wire corresponding to a very small load, and this view
is confirmed by curves taken with vibration, for in these a maximum appears ab or
near 1 kilo. of load. But this maximum does nob appear in eyclic curves given by
applying and removing higher values of the load. Tts absence is, however, satisfac-
torily explainable as one of the effects of hysteresis. Tn fact, it still exists, bub
hysteresis shifts it to the lefb of the origin, &o that successive applications and
removals of pull lie on one side of it. If we could trace the effects of push as well as
pull, the presence of this maximum would be immediately detected. The diagram
below will make my meaning more clear.

Starting from A (a point reached, say, by tapping the annealed wire, when the load
is zero), and beginning to load, we find the magnetism change in the manner repre
sented by A B C. Then on removal of the load, the curve is C D BE, E being tho
value of magnetisxm corresponding to no load. The off curve is still rising ab this
point, and my explanation of this rise, and of the apparent absence of a maximum
point, is that the maximum point is shifted to the left by hysteresis 80 much as to.
