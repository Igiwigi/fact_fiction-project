residual air was first washed out by hydrogen, the hydride flutings were brilliantly
visible as soon as the are was struck, and the oxide flutings were not observed.
When dry nitrogen at atmospheric pressure was introduced into the globe, neither
the hydride nor the oxide flutings were seen. In hydrogen at atmospheric pressure
the hydride spectrum was present, but was less bright than when the pressure was
reduced.

In his earlier paper, Mr. Brooks suggested that water vapour might be an essential
factor in the production of the hydride spectrum,* and the experiment on the are in
hydrogen was accordingly repeated, with a quantity of phosphoric anhydride intro-
duced into the globe. After standing for 24 hours, however, the flutings appeared
at once on striking the are, as in previous experiments, and with undiminished
brightness. In fact, the absence of water vapour would seem to be sufficiently
indicated by the absence of the oxide group 5007. Subsequent experiments made by
Mr. Brooxst have similarly led him to conclude that the presence of water vapour
cannot be regarded as an essential condition for the production of the hydride
spectrum.

All the experiments accordingly tend to show that magnesium and hydrogen are
together concerned in the production of the flutings, and the simplest supposition is
that they originate in the combination magnesium hydride. Assuming such com-
bination of the two elements, it appears to take place directly under the influence of
the are, especially at low pressures, or of some forms of the spark discharge, or by the
combustion of the metal in an atmosphere containing hydrogen either free or in
combination.
