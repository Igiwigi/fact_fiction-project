When we bear in mind the development of these various organs, such intimate
anatomical connections, and occasionally even apparent confusions, are not
astonishing.

4, Histology of the Thyroid and Parathyroids, considered as one Tissue.

At first sight, the histological features of thyroid and parathyroid appear to be so
strikingly different that the majority of authors, at any rate in recent years, have
looked upon the two as totally distinct organs. This was the emphatic view of
Kouy, whose account is referred to above, and it has been shared with more or less
modification by nearly all experimental physiologists and pathologists. A careful
examination of the glands throughout a series of mammals reveals the fact that the
fundamental histological features of the two tissues are, if not identical, very signifi-
cantly similar. Some stress has already been laid on the wide-spread occurrence of
intervesicular cell masses in the thyroid, whose cells are of the same character as
those lining the vesicles. Now it must have occurred to many students of thyroid
histology that this thyroid intervesicular material is very like the parathyroid. More
detailed histological investigation seems entirely to support the view that the
essential elements of thyroid and parathyroid are the same, This becomes clear only
when a large number of animals is studied. Occasionally a parathyroid, or a portion
of a parathyroid, is seen, which from its degree of compactness, staining reaction, and
