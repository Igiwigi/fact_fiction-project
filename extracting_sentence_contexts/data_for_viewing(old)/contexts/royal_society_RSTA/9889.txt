From this and the equation (4) we finally obtain the inequality

where F,(u, v) is the integrand of (5).

The function F, (w, v) is, of course, dependent on the real constants x, and a; let
us suppose it possible to choose them in such a way that

F, (0, 0) = ay« (8, 4) + 2ayaoK (8, $2) + 2° (So, $2)

takes a negative value, say —a, Owing to the fact that «(s,¢) is continuous, it is
then clear that we can chose 7 so small that

F, (u, v) < —4a,
for |u|=y, |v|Sy. From this we deduce the inequality
nro S 2€ (2+) (|a,| + |x|)? M,

as in the corresponding place in §6; and hence, as this is impossible for sufficiently
small values of ¢, it follows that, when s, and sy lie in the open interval (a, b), and a,
and x, are real, F, (0,0) is not negative. Accordingly, since « (s, ¢) is continuous, it is
easily seen that every function «(s, t) which is of positive type in the square ass Sb,
a@Stsb is such that, when x, and x, are any real numbers,
