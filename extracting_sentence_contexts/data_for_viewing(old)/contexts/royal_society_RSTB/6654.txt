Beta, and H.X.; these are always associated with the apices of cusps and they do not
reach the surface of the enamel organ.

A lateral enamel strand is found in the earlier stages of development in connexion
with most of the enamel organs of the cheek teeth of Ornithorhynchus; it is present in
teeth “w”’, “x” and “‘y” of both jaws, though it is much more evident in the upper
than in the lower teeth, and is only doubtfully present in the case of the lower tooth
“y”. In ‘“‘x” and “‘y” the strand is best marked towards the posterior end of the
enamel organ (fig. 39, Plate 37; figs. 45, 46, Plate 38). I think that what Witson and
Hix described as structural differentiations ‘‘of the nature of a series of invasions or
deep indentations of the neck of the dental lamina, on its labial aspect, near the level
of its continuity with the deep surface of the mouth-epithelium”, and which they
considered to be the forerunners of the epithelial nodules of later stages, in fact represent
the mesodermal contents of BoLk’s enamel tunnel which is bounded laterally by the
lateral enamel strand. A comparison of fig. 46, Plate 38 with Witson and Hi1’s
fig. 1 leaves little doubt that the structure seen on the lateral side of the dental lamina
is the same in both cases; fig. 46, Plate 38 shows a section through the posterior end
of the enamel organ of the upper tooth “y’’, and, traced forwards, the lateral boundary
of the indentation described by Wrison and Hixu is continuous with a well-marked
lateral enamel strand (fig. 45, Plate 38). This strand with its contained enamel tunnel is
of almost constant occurrence in the mammals and cannot be related to the peculiar
epithelial nodules found in the enamel organ of Ornithorhynchus.

What the significance of this lateral enamel strand may be is doubtful. In Ornitho-
rhynchus at least it is not a mere crumpling or folding of the dental lamina or enamel
