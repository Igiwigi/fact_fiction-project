An
example includes the node indexed as 7 =3 along the red curve in figure 3a, whose maximum
displacement occurs for a non-integer value of n. As expected, figure 3aâ€”c shows that all displacements for n < 0 do not exceed u;, represented
by the horizontal dashed lines in these plots. In fact, the displacements of even nodes are
approximately uniform along the upper horizontal row of the chain when 7 < 0. The same is true
for the odd-numbered nodes, which have displacements of approximately the same magnitude
but with opposite sign. The result implies that the structure possesses an alternating strain
deformation ahead of the bridge crack front [36].
