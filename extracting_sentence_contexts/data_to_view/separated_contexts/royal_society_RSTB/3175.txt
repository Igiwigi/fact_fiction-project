This author also states that the same force is required to overcome
the resistance to a definite rate of flow, whether applied as a pressure or as a tension. This is, however, only the case when the conducting elements are completely filled
with water, and even then the resistance to flow is two or three times greater than
would be expected from a viscosity calculation. The latter fact is partly due to the
internal thickenings on the vessels, which reduce their effective radius, and partly to
the existence of transverse partitions in long pieces of stem, which add to the
resistance to longitudinal flow. The average resistance to flow through the side wall
of a vessel or through that of a tracheide of a Conifer may be from 2 to 10 or more
times the resistance to flow through the entire length of the same vessel when filled
with water, although when large numbers of air bubbles are present the tendency
to lateral exudation from a given longitudinal path is much increased. In this way
water can be transmitted rapidly and with but little lateral exudation through tracts
where the supply is abundant and the local demand small, so that the vessels are
filled, whereas in a region where the loss by transpiration is excessive, the appearance
of air bubbles in the vessels partially blocks the upward flow and increases the
lateral exudation until the local needs are supplied.
