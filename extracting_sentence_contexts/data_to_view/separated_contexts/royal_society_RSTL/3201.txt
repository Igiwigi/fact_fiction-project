The Chorion.

221. When in describing the thick transparent membrane of the ovarian ovum in
the © First Series” of these Researches (/. c. par. 52.), I stated my opinion, in unison
with that of Cosrs and R. Wacxgs, © that this membrane is really the chorion of ova
met with in the uterus,” I had not discoyered the disappearance of one membrane and
the coming into view of another membrane in the Fallopian tube. Such, however, is
the fact, as made known in an earlier part of the present paper (pars. 174. 172.)
