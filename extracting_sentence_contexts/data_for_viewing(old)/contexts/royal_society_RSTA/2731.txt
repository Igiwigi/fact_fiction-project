The fact that translational symmetry of the electric field is explicitly broken, resulting in the ;
generation of time varying magnetic field and radiation, is expressed by Maxwellâ€™s equation

where E is electric field intensity and B is magnetic flux density.

The above arguments also apply in the case of radiation from a dipole antenna connected to
a parallel two wire transmission line excited by a time varying voltage source (figure 3c). If the
parallel section of the transmission line is assumed to be infinitely long with an infinitesimally
small separation, the electric field has translational symmetry along the transmission line which
is broken along the flared end where rotational electric field is generated, resulting in radiation.
Here, it is assumed that the currents not aligned to the axis of the transmission line at the supply
