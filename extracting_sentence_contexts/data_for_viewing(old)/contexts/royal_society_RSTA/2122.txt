spacelike x-y, (x) is not a gauge-invariant observable. Gauge observables can be constructed

[25]°, by ‘dressing’ $(x) to give a new operator (x) that also creates the gravitational field
associated with a particle created by $(x).

Since @(x) creates a gravitational field, which extends to infinity, now generically [25]
[®(x), ®(y)] £0 for spacelike x-y. In fact the nonvanishing commutators match well to the ‘locality
bound’ that was proposed in [28-30], to characterize the regime where LOFT fails to be an accurate
description of physics.

This shows that the fundamental gauge-invariant observables in gravity do not obey a
local algebra, and thus we must have some other mathematical structure on H, providing the
foundations of the theory. This ‘substrate’ is not clearly based on any underlying manifold
structure, despite what is commonly assumed. In LOFT, the net structure on A is directly
associated with the manifold, but for gravity it is an important question as to what replaces this.

Indeed, without some version of locality, providing a notion of separability, it is not clear how
to even proceed to describe physics. In quantum systems, a more primitive notion of locality
is that of subsystems. For finite quantum systems, subsystems are described in terms of tensor
