fluorescence plays a role in this system.

Fruit colours are also a colour attractor for many animals (e) Birds
and several types of fruit fluoresce. Although no thorough A number of bird species possess fluorescent feathers, most
studies of its significance in nature have been conducted, famously, 52 species of parrots, but also penguins and tou-
fruit fluorescence is used in machine vision to determine cans. Psittacofulvins are unique to parrot species, and
fruit quality (reviewed in [1]). the fluorescence of these carotenoid-like pigments was

discovered by shining a UV light on dead parrots in a dark
museum [38]. Studies on a small parrot, the budgerigar
Melopsittacus undulatus, in fact fulfil all criteria (a—e) [7]
including visual modelling of the 14% additional fluor-
escence component to the yellow crown and cheek feathers
under natural illumination conditions (figures 1 and 2). The
potential signal is not sexually dimorphic, and it is interesting
that fluorescent crown and cheek feathers are placed amongst
non-fluorescent also yellow feathers, making this fluorescent
signal pop out (similar to the fist tattoos in figure 1), lending
weight to their potential visual function. There is a good
match of the fluorescent emission of these feathers to the
yellow and red oil droplet—filtered long-wavelength spectral
sensitivities of budgerigars (figure 2). Furthermore, the fluor-
escent cheek feathers are associated with UV reflecting, to us,
