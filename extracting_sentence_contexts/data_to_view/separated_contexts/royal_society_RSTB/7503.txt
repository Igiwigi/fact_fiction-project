There may also be some variation in chemical wave-length. Neighbouring values of the ratio circumferences to wave-length should therefore be more
or less equally frequent, and this must mean that neighbouring petal numbers will have
much the same frequency. But this is not borne out by the facts. The number five is extremely
common, and the number seven rather rare. Such facts are, in the authorâ€™s opinion, capable
of explanation on the basis of morphogen theory, and are closely connected with the theory
of phyllotaxis.
