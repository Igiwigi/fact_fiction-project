SCAMs have been identified as
contributing to the delay of regulatory action on many health and environmental problems, :
including climate change [3]. SCAMs are politically effective because they asymmetrically draw =
attention to the possibility that because a problem is uncertain, it may be less serious than 3
anticipated. In fact, in many instances—including with climate change—the reverse is true: mathematical nee)
analyses of the risk associated with climate change have revealed that as uncertainty increases, :
so often does the risk [5,6]. Similarly, potential surprises are more likely to be calamitous than [4
benign, because the probability of extreme climate events (such as sea-level rise) increases with DN
increasing uncertainty, all other factors being equal [5]. Uncertainty can therefore be a source of [5
actionable knowledge rather than an indicator of ignorance.
