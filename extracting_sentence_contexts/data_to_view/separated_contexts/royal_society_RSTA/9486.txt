The vertical lines indicate compression waves,
and the curved lines flame-fronts. The numerals inserted are velocities in metres
per second at the positions shown. At the outset, 1, the strongly radiating flame-
front A is seen approaching a compression wave BB’ (composed of a condensation

* ‘The lowness of this resultant velocity of 320 m/sec is due to the fact that the wave concerned is
travelling through a medium which is moving as a whole in the opposite direction; the two
component velocities being about 1100 and 780 m/sec. PHOTOGRAPHIC INVESTIGATION OF GASEOUS EXPLOSIONS 39

the compressed medium in B, both raises its temperature and strongly excites the
