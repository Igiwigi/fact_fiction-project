strip in the air are generally followed by a decrease in the rate of the waves, and some-
times by their being completely blocked. Other methods by which the passage of
waves in contractile strips admits of being blocked will be alluded to further on.

(f) Such are some of the facts I have been able to collect bearing on the question
concerning the physiological character of the general contractile tissues of the Medusz.
That these facts are of a somewhat paradoxical nature is evident ; and whether or not
there is any theory by which they admit of being satisfactorily reconciled is doubtful.
1 may say, however, that I think there is such a theory, and that I only refrain from
publishing it at the present time because I think that at this early stage of the inquiry
it is desirable, as much as possible, to avoid speculation.

V. ADDITIONAL FACTS TENDING TO PROVE THE IDENTITY OF THE SPECIALIZED MARGINAL
TISSUE OF MEDUSA WITH NERVOUS TISSUE IN GENERAL.

$1. Sense-organs,—It has long been thought more or less probable that the s0-called
* eye-specks” of Medusz are rudimentary or incipient organs of yision ; but T am not
aware that any one has hitherto endeavoured to test the supposed probability by experi-
ment. TI say © supposed probability,” becanse, in the absence of any structural resem-
blance to an ocellus, I do not see how speculation as to the function of these organs can
be of any further value than a guess*. The guess, however, in this case happens to be
correct.

* [Posrscrrer TL.,—It is with considerable pleasure that T am now able to add the following very judicious and
philosophical confirmation of this opinion by 80 high an authority as Prof. Harorer :—* Die Deutung der Sinnes-
