Two new species of Land-Planarians from Ceylon are described :—one belonging to the
genus Pipalium (Stimpson), Þ. Ceres; the other to that of Rhynchodenus, R. Thwaitesit,
80 called after Mr. G. H. K, Tawarrss, F.R.S., the illustrious curator of the Peradeniya
Gardens, by whose assistance the specimens made use of were procured. Lists are given of all the known species of Bipalium and Rhynchodemus. With regard to the habits of Bipalium, the most interesting facts noted are that these
animals use a thread of their body-slime for suspension in air, as aquatic Planarians
were obseryed to do for their suspension in water by Sir J, DALYELL, and the cellar-slug
does for its suspension in air. 'The projection of 8mall portions of the anterior margin
of the head in the form of tentacles, originally observed by M. HuaBeRrT, becomes
interesting in connexion with the discovery of a row of papille and ciliated pits in that
region. The anatomy of the Planarians was studied by means of vertical and longi-
tudinal sections from hardened specimens. '
