In contrast, the model including interactions
with ‘feed first’ as response variable did not (ALogLik = 5.36,
Ad.f. = 10, p = 0.380), so we retained the more parsimonious
model without interactions. Although the models with inter-
actions outperformed simpler models for feeding on banana
slices and taking specific slices first more often than others,
the details are somewhat difficult to interpret, perhaps because
the number of banana slices being examined makes this a com-
plex interaction. In fact, none of the interacting predictors
explained significant portions of the variation in the response
in either model (GLMM, all p > 0.05; electronic supplementary
material, table S5). However, for the feeding model at least, the
indication is that males may be more risk-averse than females
regarding ingesting items in contact with faeces, but more
likely to ingest slices further from it (slices 3 and 5 compared
with slice 1, both p < 0.100; electronic supplementary material,
table S5; figure 2b). In addition, immatures tended to be more
risk-prone than mature individuals regarding consumption
of slice 1, whereas there was little difference between age
groups in consumption of slices 2—4 (all p < 0.070; electronic
supplementary material, table S5; figure 2c).
