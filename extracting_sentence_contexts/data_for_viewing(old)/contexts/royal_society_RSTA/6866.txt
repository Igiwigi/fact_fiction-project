The tensor A,,, is thus separated into two subtensors which remain separate so long as the
group is restricted to pure rotations. An orthogonal transformation of negative determinant,
however, by changing the sign of the alternating tensor, will interchange these two parts.
This procedure will have the same effect whatever set of v suffixes is taken from A,,,
provided that A,,, is alternating in this set. This will be seen if one operates simultaneously
on two sets of v suffixes. This will involve the square of the alternating tensor. But the
square of the alternating tensor is a concomitant of the quadratic g’, and can be expressed

in terms of g/, Hence the whole operation can be expressed in terms of A,,, and the tensors
g! and g,;. In fact the suffixes are first raised by g! and then lowered by gj. The tensor A,,) is
unaltered.

The case of the symplectic group is similar but rather simpler. The invariant linear complex
is taken as h,;x7, where x‘ is the Clebsch variable tensor of type {1?}. If this is to be a non-
singular form there must be an even number of variables. Put n = 2v. The alternating tensor
is a concomitant of h,;, so that every transformation has determinant +1.

As with the orthogonal group, any suffix of a tensor can be raised or lowered by con-
tracting with one of the suffixes of 4; or its reciprocal hk. As with the orthogonal group also,
if A, is alternating in a set of r>v suffixes, these may be contracted with the alternating
tensor, and the remaining —r suffixes lowered using /,;. Thus every tensor can be expressed
in terms of tensors of types corresponding to partitions into <p parts.
