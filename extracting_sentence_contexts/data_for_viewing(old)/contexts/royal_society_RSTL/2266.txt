errors of the clock, or the difference of the sun's observed
transits, and of his computed right ascensions, do not agree,
as it is known, with the errors found by the transits of the
stars. The former errors are always less. In this general
result, the observations I have made agree with the Greenwich
and Dublin observations, and with Mr. SouTa's. The mean
of the differences of the errors of the clock, as estimated by
the sun and stars, is about six tenths of a second. And this

can be partly explained from the fact, that the mean right
ascensions of the stars having been increased in late cata-
logues by Mr. PoxD, by about Â©o'.s, are greater, by that
quantity, than in the catalogues from which the solar tables
are computed. But the differences are very variable ; they
are greater in summer than in winter. It is far from my
intention to be cautiously aiming at a merely safe opinion,
when I state that, probably, the inequalities of these differ-
ences arise partly from the errors of the solar tables, and
partly from instrumental derangement. Certain I am that
such a derangement, in degree at least, cannot fail to have
taken place with the transit instrument of this observatory
when exposed to the sun, and also with the Greenwich
