Similarly F broods were regarded as suppressed sinistral broods. It was thought
possible that these two types of suppression might be associated with the two types of
heterozygote, though the possibility that the phenomena might be the expression of
genetic factors was recognised. The establishment of the fact of dextral dominance necessitates some modification
of these views. In particular the interpretation previously offered of dextral break-
throughs and with them of E broods falls to the ground. The simplest way of regarding
dextral break-throughs is as reverse mutations.
