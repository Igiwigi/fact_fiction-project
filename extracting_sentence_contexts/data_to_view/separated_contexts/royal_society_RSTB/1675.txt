cambium. In good preparations the group of primary phloém belonging to
medullary xylem strand can be clearly recognized at the corresponding point of
phloém-zone (see Plate 21, fig. 1 and Plate 22, fig. 7, ph.). The leaf-traces in the external part of their course demonstrate the same fact,
Although there is small-celled tissue on the internal side of the bundle, yet the m
delicate phloém (Plate 22, fig. 6, ph.’) is perfectly distinct and is evidently limited
the outer side of the xylem. The collateral structure is equally evident in bundles in
the intermediate position, which have a cambial are of their own. Here there i
secondary as well as primary phloém, both of which are found on the external side of
the bundle only (see Plate 22, fig. 5, ph.”, also Plate 28, fig. 9).
