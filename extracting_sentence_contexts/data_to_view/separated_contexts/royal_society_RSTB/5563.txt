J. BERRILL: STUDIES IN TUNICATE DEVELOPMENT.

became recognisable as such from 14-15 hours from fertilisation, while the highly
refractive “ caudal” cell mass became visible after 20 hours. The later appearance of
these phagocytised cells may be due to the fact that in anural embryos they do not
become by any means so highly refractive as the corresponding cells in urodele embryos,
probably as the result of the non-vacuolisation of the chordal cells. Therefore, in com-
paring the development of these two species it is seen that there is but very little
difference between the time of attainment of the various stages of development in the
two forms. Hatching occurs a little later in the anural form, but as this is effected by
the swelling of the larval test, and as the swelling also marks the onset of degeneration
of the “ caudal” elements and appearance of ampullee, these last two phenomena are
somewhat earlier than in the urodele form.
