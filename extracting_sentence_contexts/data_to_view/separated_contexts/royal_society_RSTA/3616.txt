The whole of the equilibrations performed with the final form of apparatus are
given in the table. An improvement of the filler was introduced subsequently and
anomalous results were obtained for the only experiment carried out. This was
traced to the fact that the wire had become damaged during the filling, and the
results for this experiment were rejected. In the case of the first experiment the water was equilibrated at the beginning
and end, and the mean value was used for computation. The ice in this experiment
was not examined.
