FILON: LONGITUDINAL

which is correct to the first order when q and ¢ are tangents and to the second order
when q and ¢ are sines. In the above A, B, C are polynomials in M of degrees 4, 3, 2 respectively, so that
the empirical formula is well justified for the simple refracting surface. In this case,
too, it is possible to calculate + directly, and, in fact, a simple geometrical construction
is given for it. When this is followed for varying image-positions, it is found that
outside a certain range of M, the + so obtained becomes irrelevant, and that, in fact,
if the correct factor 1—é/7* is retained in the denominator of Av, although it
improves the fit by removing singularities in the range round M = ©, it introduces
entirely fictitious singularities in other and important parts of the range, and makes
the formula worthless,

A good deal of light is thrown upon the problem when it is found that, if we

develop 1 in descending powers of M in the neighbourhood of M = , the two
is

leading terms are discovered to be identical with the two leading terms of the
cubic B, previously obtained. This makes our B approximate more and more closely
to = precisely as the effect of the denominator term becomes more important, and it
ss
is this fact which is the key to the numerical value of the method.
