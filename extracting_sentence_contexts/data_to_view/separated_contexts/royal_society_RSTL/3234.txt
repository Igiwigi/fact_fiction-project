From this structure it will be evident, that in order to form Glen Roy into a lake
at either of the two upper levels, it would be necessary to erect two barriers, one
across Glen Collarig, and the other principal one across the mouth of the Roy. The lines are here represented as if abruptly cut off, but this is not 80; and the
following remark holds good in other cases, namely, that where a shelf terminates
without any visible change in the nature of the slope, snch as being rocky, &c., its
disappearance is s0 extremely gradual, that it can be traced, sometimes to a further
and sometimes to a lesser distance, according to the point from which it is viewed. Of this fact the shelves on the south-east side of Glen Collarig offer an excellent ex-
ample. In the map, the extremities of the lower of the two upper shelves are re-
presented at the four places where they terminate, as extending beyond those of the
upper one. I tate this on the authority of Sir Lavper Dick with respect to those
in Glen Roy, and it is conspicuously the case with that pair in Glen Collarig which
I have described as disappearing in 80 insensible a manner.
