require a $horter process to convert them into chyle than
vegetables; but why the whale tribe, which live on fish,
Should have a more complex $tomach, it is not easy to ex-
plain: since fish are very readily converted into chyle, in the
stomachs of animals of their own class, as well as in the
human stomach, and there is therefore reason to believe that
they require as little preparation for that process, if not less
than animal substances.

The fish bones swallowed by the whale tribe being retained
in the cuticular bag, till they are reduced to jelly, explains
the circumstance of cows, and other ruminating animals being
able occasionally to live on fish, (a fact, of which there is no
doubt, both in the Orkneys and in Iceland,) since, if the bones
are dissolved in the paunch, the other stomachs, are in no
danger of being injured from the animal living on this kind
of food.

Whether these cavities, which I have called preparatory
stomachs, are solely for purposes connected with digestion,
or are also in any way connected with the formation of secre-
tions peculiar to those animals, cannot be ascertained in the
present state of our knowledge of digestion.
