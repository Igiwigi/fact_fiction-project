When the latter occurs, it has a definite shape, but equally definitely
it may be absent. There is a similar structure between the lower tips of the scuta where they
are connected to the base of the rostrum, and these plates also carry small boss√©s in this
region (figures 3 and 4).*

The constitution of the tergal bosses is as puzzling as their function. They are always
irregular in outline, a fact noticed by Darwin (1851, p. 368), who describes them as
roughened. The difficult point to explain arises from the method of growth of the capitular
plates of Lithotrya. These grow by adding on new zones at their bases, and polarized light
shows very clearly the manner by which new calcareous matter has been laid down
(figure 26).
