Results and discussion reason behind sampling the top hill depth profile at a slightly

All data are presented in table 1. Regarding the depth profile higher elevation than the alluvial terrace, but in an area with-
samples EKA18 and EKA19, one can observe two groups out any signs of the deposit that may be the cause of the
of data delimited by the interface between the alluvial variability. In fact, at this position, the expected exponential
deposit and the saprolite (figure 1b). Within the saprolite decrease is observed (stars in figure 4 in the two upper

expected exponential decrease due to the attenuation of cosmic deeper ones within the saprolite (samples mentioned above);
