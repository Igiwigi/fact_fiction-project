This deduction is perfectly illustrated by experiment. Tt is manifest that the effect
of the pole S upon the cube adjacent to it is to increase the moment of rotation of
the rectangular box : the same reasoning applies to it as to the pole N.

Referring to fig. 27a, page 41, it will be seen that we have here dealt with the
second and gravest objection of M. MarTevecr, and converted the facts upon which
the objection is based into a proof of diamagnetic polarity, s0 cogent that it alone
would seem to be sufficient to decide this important question. Holding the opinion
entertained by M. Marrevect regarding the nature of diamagnetic force#, his objec-
tion must have appeared to him to be absolutely unanswerable: I should be glad to
believe that the remarks contained in this *Appendix* furnish, in the estimation of
the distinguished philosopher referred to, a satisfactory explanation of the difficulty
which he has disclosed. Let me, in conclusion, briefly direct the reader's attention to the body of evidence
laid before him in the foregoing pages.
