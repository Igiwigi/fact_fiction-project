their existence.

2Caustic comes from the greek word xavor:xd¢ (kaustikés), meaning, ‘burning’; this terminology is related to optics and
refers to the envelope of reflected or refracted rays of light, namely concentration of lights that can potentially lead to burns.


Definition 3.2. We say that a curve I” is a caustic for the billiard in Q if every time a trajectory
is tangent to it, then it remains tangent after every reflection. Moreover, a C! convex caustic is a
caustic consisting of a closed C! curve bounding a strictly convex region inside 2.

Remark 3.3.

(i) Observe that every convex caustic has a well-defined rotation number. In fact, the
dynamics tangent to it induces a circle homeomorphism from the boundary to itself; the
rotation number of the caustic corresponds to the Poincaré rotation number of this circle
homeomorphism.

(ii) One could wonder about the relation between caustics for the billiard in 2 and invariant io
curves for the corresponding billiard map Bg. One can show that a C! convex caustic in 2 :
corresponds to a homotopically non-trivial invariant curve for the billiard map; however, =
the converse is not entirely true. In fact, homotopically non-trivial invariant curves of Bg a
(which are graphs by Birkhoff’s theorem) do give rise to caustics, but these caustics need a
neither be convex nor differentiable.

Remark 3.4. The notion of caustics is often connected to the so-called whispering gallery, a Ww
