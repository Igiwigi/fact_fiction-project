are not in perfect contact; it is necessary, therefore, that the
crystal, or fragment, which possesses this property, should be in
the state most favourable to its developement. On this account,
it must not be completely transparent; there being, in that
case, too perfect a contact between the lamine; so that the
light, not meeting with any medium to reflect it, but being
entirely refracted, cannot occasjon any appearance of the pro-
perty here spoken of. Neither must the crystal, or fragment,
be quite opaque; it being necessary that the light, in order to
undergo the reflection which produces this pleasing phenome-
non, should at least be able to pass through the exterior laminaz
of that part of the crystal against which it strikes. The above
circumstances are, in fact, those which appear to take place
with respect to corundum. The imperfect corundum of the
Carnatic, the crystals of which are generally more or less
opaque, show no trace of this property upon their terminal
faces; whereas, it is frequently observed upon the terminal faces
of the crystals of imperfect corundum from China, and also of
that from the coast of Malabar, because those crystals generally
possess a slight degree of semi-transparency. This character is
still more common in the perfect corundum, whether sapphire
or oriental ruby. There is not, however, the smallest appear-
ance of it, when these stones possess the beautiful transparency
belonging to them in their highest degree of perfection ; where-
as, on the contrary, it is frequently seen to take place in a very
