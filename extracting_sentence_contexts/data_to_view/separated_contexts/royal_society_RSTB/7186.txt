The
= apparent width of the bright lines was, therefore, about 1-5 times the width of a cone,
5 assumed in the previous section. Now part of the apparent width of the bright lines was
& due to their actual width, viz. 2mm. If the lines could be made infinitely narrow their
2 apparent width would probably be less than in fact it is. In other words the apparent
§ width of the images of the bright lines on the retina would be little larger than the diameter
of a foveal receptor. This confirms the calculations referred to at the beginning of this
= section and shows that the effective definition of the retinal image is quite good, justifying
é an attempt to stimulate single receptors, or small groups of receptors by means of a con-
a= | trolled narrow beam of light.

g The above experiment has been repeated using silver-paper lines 1 mm. wide on a black
pal background.
