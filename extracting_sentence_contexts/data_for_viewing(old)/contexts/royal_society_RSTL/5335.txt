WD and a half; but | the majority were only partially fecundated, as only one of the

5 twenty-three eggs produced an embryo. The fact of this production, however, shows,

S plurality of spermatozoa, supplied to the egg, appears always to be necessary to
S ensure fecundation, yet that the result seems to depend less upon the abolute given
Ss number, or numerical relation of these bodies, to the egg, than on the measure of
S vitality possessed by those which are brought into actual encounter with it, as a very
