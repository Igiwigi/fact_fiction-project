The central recent achievements are that both quantified logic (as shown by Passman [51]) as
well as the admissible propositional rules (a result presented in this article) of many standard
constructive set theories simply coincide with quantified intuitionistic logic and admissible rules
of intuitionistic propositional calculus, respectively. The set theories covered by these results are
KP, BCST, ECST, CZF, CZF and CZF + AC. An important technical construction presented in this article that
allowed the classification of the admissible propositional rules for many of the mentioned theories
in fact showed a general phenomenon: almost any intuitionistic set theory built from certain
standard axioms will have the same admissible propositional rules as intuitionistic propositional :
logic. :=

This article lists a large number of open questions. One of the open problems in the area is to I=
find first-order logic and admissible propositional rules for IZF. Note that the fact that first-order :8
logic of IZF is larger than just intuitionistic first-order logic is a classical result of Friedman and 1p
Séedrov [52]. :8

g) Ordinal Analysis and the set-existence property for intuitionistic set theories [53] 78

The standard fact about Heyting arithmetic HA is that it has the number existence property: :s
whenever HAF Ax¢(x), for some n, HAF y(n), where n is the numeral of 1, i.e. the term

1+...41.
—S
n times
In the case of set theories, of course, there is no analogue of numerals for sets. A theory T is said
