Under these circumstances it will be necessary to consider the probability of making
such an error as this result indicates in the position of the normal to P with reference
to the prineipal axes.

But before doing this we must say a few words about the variations in the values
of p, produced by the correction now considered.

The final correction will not affect any of them except the first, which will be slightly
increased by it,

This follows from the fact that between lines 1 and 2 of Table IX. 0—0' varies
considerably, and increases or decreases with 0+0/, 80 that py, py increase or decrease
together.

The change considered has increased p,, it will therefore increase jg.

The difference in line 2 is considerable, but it may be noticed that the experimental
value is clearly too small, falling as it does (Table I., line 18) between two con-
siderably greater values. In the other cases the differences between theory and
experiment have been diminished but remain of the same sign as before.

A till further displacement in the same direction would therefore produce still
further agreement.
