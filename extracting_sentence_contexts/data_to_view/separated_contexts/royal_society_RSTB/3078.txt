to this second nucleus taking place. It is somewhat incorrect, therefore, to speak of
the nephridial rudiments as composed of three cells, when, as a matter of fact, they
represent uniform strands of protoplasm in which three nuclei have taken up their
positions. While the strands show the subsequent grouping of their cytoplasm
about these nuclei, as in figs. 32, 30, and 36, which simulate the appearance of three
distinct cells, no actual cell boundaries are to be discerned. In fig. 24, which represents a transverse section at right angles to the axis of the
cesophagus taken obliquely through the margin of the young larva, the section shows
the head-kidneys as thin strands.
