5. The slope of
the curve is much sharper than for any of the gases previously studied. This fact, as
we shall see from the results given below, cannot be entirely accounted for by the
higher temperature of the enclosure. I hope shortly to undertake a research on the emissivity of platinum in gases at a
much higher pressure. For the present the results are too incomplete to allow any
general theory to be formulated.
