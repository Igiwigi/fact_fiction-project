I have already stated that I do not know whether the continuous background
which is seen at higher pressure when the line spectrum appears has its origin in
a separate cause, or whether it has to be brought into connexion with the continuous
apectrum of low temperature. The following experiment may assist those who like
to form an opinion on the matter â€”

Mr. LockYER has made use of the fact that when a spark is taken between metallic
poles, and a lens is employed to form an image of the spark on the slit of the spectro-
scope, the lines of the metals do not stretch across the field, but are confined to the
neighbourhood of the poles. As the pressure is decreased, gome of the lines decrease
rapidly in length, and finally disappear, while the effect on others is little perceptible. I find that when oxygen is the gas through which the spark strikes, the lines of the
gas as well as the metallic lines seem to stretch away from the poles and fade away
towards the middle.
