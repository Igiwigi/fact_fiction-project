between the enteric neurones themselves.

All these observers are in agreement concerning the endings of the vagal fibres on the
enteric neurones in the form of pericellular arborizations, but in regard to the origin of the
more diffuse type of ending there is considerable difference of opinion. In my own
preparations, where the fibres are coloured intensely, it is possible to trace processes of
cells of Type IL for a considerable distance through the fibre-tracts into other enteric
ganglia, There they terminate in relation to other neurones in the diffuse endings in
question. Moreover, the endings of processes of the cells of Type I on cells of Type II
are so clearly visible in silver preparations that it is impossible to accept JoHNsoN’s
view as to the non-existence of synapses between the local neurones. CARPENTER’S
suggestion that these diffuse endings might be derived from the sympathetic or splanchnic
fibres has never been confirmed, and the facts put forward earlier in this paper (ante p. 370)
show that these fibres have no connection whatever with the enteric neurones.

The view that the enteric nervous system is composed, at least in part, of a syncytial
nerve-net is held by a number of investigators. Brrut (5) and R. Mixer (53) described
the enteric plexuses in the frog as composed of anastomosing cells in the form of nerve-
nets, and Cork (19) has also stated that he has found isolated groups of anastomosing
nerve-cells in the myenteric plexus of the same animal. Eri Murr (51), whilst he
believed the enteric plexuses in the Elasmobranch fishes were true nerve-nets, described
those of birds and mammals as consisting partly of nerve-nets and partly of free neurones.
He believed, however, that the non-synaptic nerve-net possessed a definite polarity in the
higher vertebrates, whilst the reflex actions which take place through the mediation of
the myenteric plexus he regarded as of the nature of axone reflexes. His conception of
