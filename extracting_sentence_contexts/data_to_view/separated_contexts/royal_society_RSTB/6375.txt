Interpolated between the pigmented cells of the optic cup are numerous bodies
which must be regarded as constituting the visual cells of the cup. The visual
elements are most difficult to demonstrate, and are not visible at all after fixation
with non-osmic fixatives (fig. 19, left-hand cup). They have, in fact, not been seen
in their entirety in any one preparation, and it must be pointed out here that the
interpretation of their structure, as indicated in fig. 19 (right-hand side cup), has

treatment with a variety of stains. The visual sensory cell is divided into two well-
defined regionsâ€”a peripheral portion (oft.
