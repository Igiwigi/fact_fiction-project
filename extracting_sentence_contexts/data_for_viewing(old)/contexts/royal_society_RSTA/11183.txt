have used these values in all cases to represent the conductivity of the free flame,
subtracting them from the gross readings given by salt solutions to obtain the
conductivity of the salt vapour itself.

ARRHENIUS, in his experiments on this subject, noticed an increased conductivity
of the free flame immediately after a salt solution had been sprayed. He attributed
it to a deposition of salt on the electrodes, the deposit remaining on the electrodes for
some time after the spray of salt solution had been stopped. The effect in question
was not important in the case of salts of the alkali metals on account of their ready
volatility.

In our experiments we noticed this effect, but we believe that in our apparatus with
the salts used by us it was fully accounted for by the fact that after the spray of salt
had been replaced by one of water, salt spray lingered for some time in the apparatus
between the sprayer and the flame tube. We noticed that the flame remained coloured
below the electrodes, and that as the colour faded the galvanometer deflection fell
steadily to the normal value. We have therefore used the normal value as the true
correction. Even if our explanation of the higher value, found immediately after
stopping the salt spray, is incomplete, the arbitrariness in our case of taking any other
value than the normal one as the correction, would forbid us attempting further
refinement, where, as a matter of fact, the difference involved could not seriously
atfect our final results.
