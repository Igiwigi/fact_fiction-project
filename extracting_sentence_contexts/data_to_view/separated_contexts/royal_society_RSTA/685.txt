This rise of a modern version of pre-seventeenth century thinking, which places too
much emphasis on the power of haphazardly gathered data, is problematic for the following
reasons. First, not all data are reliable. The fact that ‘most published research findings are false’, as
famously reported by John Ioannidis in PLOS Medicine [9], suggests one important dataset—the
conclusions of peer-reviewed studies—consists of predominantly bad data and cannot be relied
upon without evidence of good experimental design and rigorous statistical analysis. Second, we need models and theoretical insights to help guide the collection, curation and
interpretation of data. The relatively meagre initial returns from the human genome demonstrate
that data do not translate readily into understanding, let alone treatments.
