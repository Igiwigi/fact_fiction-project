Roserts,} in 1860, noticed the occurrence of plants in the rocks along the Dowles
Brook, in particular at Town Mills, in Dowles Quarry, and in brook cuttings below
Munster’s Hillf in the Shatterford Region. Several of the specimens recorded were no
doubt wrongly determined, and the list has so little value to-day that it is hardly
worth while repeating it here. Apparently these specimens were among the large
collection of fossil plants from the Wyre Forest which, in 1861, the British Museum
obtained by purchase from Mr. G. E, Roperrs, Mr. T. BAueH and others of Bewdley.
Very few of these bear any record of the localities from which they were obtained,
though some are labelled as having been collected “near Bewdley,” from ‘“ Dowles
Quarry,” and from the “ railway cuttings near Dowles Bridge.” These specimens were
determined in 1886 by Dr. Kipsron, and recorded in his ‘Catalogue of the Paleozoic
Plants in the British Museum.’ The collection is, however, of little value for my
present purpose, owing to the absence of locality records, and in view of the fact that
two palobotanical horizons are represented in the Forest, as I hope to prove in the
present paper. I however add here a revised list of these specimens, with some
additional records.
