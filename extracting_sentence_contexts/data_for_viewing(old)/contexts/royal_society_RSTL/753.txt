elastic force need not be equal to the first, in order to-pro-
duce the double tension. This view now given accords with
the experiments of Mr. WATT, alluded to in the beginning
of this memoir. He found that © the latent heat of steam is
less when it is produced under a greater pressure or in a
more dense state ; and greater when it is produced under a
less pressure or in a less dense state.” *

BERTHOLLET thinks this fact 80 unaccountable, that he has
been willing to discard it altogether. Whether the view
which I have just opened, of the relation subsisting between
the elastic force, density, and latent heat of different vapours,
harmonize with chemical phenomena in general, I leave to
others to determine. It certainly agrees with that unaccount-
able fact. Whatever be the fate of the investigation of the
general law now respectfully offered, the statement of Mr.
Warr may be implicitly received under the sanction of his
acknowledged sagacity and candour.

CONCLUSION.
