able to obtain [P;, Pr] = O(f°°). In many classical examples, an exact quantization is known; see,
for instance [187,188]. Symmetry considerations should help greatly. This is a typical local-to-
global obstruction problem, and one expects a corresponding cohomology complex. In the case
of polynomial symbols in C", the complex was constructed in [189].

Problem 7.2 (S. Vi Ngoc). Given a set of semiclassical operators that verify conditions 1 and 2
above, can one detect the independence axiom 3 in a purely spectral way? More precisely, can
one tell from asymptotics of joint eigenvalues or eigenfunctions of (P},..., Py) that the principal
symbols are almost everywhere independent?

A great achievement of microlocal analysis of pseudo-differential operators is the formulation
of complete Bohr-Sommerfeld rules to any order. Given a quantum integrable system, these rules
are, in fact, some kind of integrality conditions (or cohomological conditions), depending on a
parameter E € R", that are satisfied if and only if E is a joint eigenvalue of the system, modulo an
arbitrarily small error of size O(h™).

Historically (both in physics and mathematics), these rules have been written for regular
Lagrangian tori, ie. E should stay in a small ball of regular values of the classical moment map.
Mote recently, non-trivial extensions to some singular situations have been found; see [190-192].

To treat even more physical examples, and to appeal to the geometry community, it is
important to extend these rules to Berezin-Toeplitz quantization on compact Kahler manifolds.
This was done recently for regular tori [193], and for one degree of freedom systems with Morse
singularities; see [194,195]. It should be possible to treat also the focus—focus case, along the lines
of [196].
