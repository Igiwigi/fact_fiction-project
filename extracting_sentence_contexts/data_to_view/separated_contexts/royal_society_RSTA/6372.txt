According to the critics of the received view, the presence of gauge symmetries cannot be
reduced to a mere redundancy of the mathematical representation, but rather encodes some deep
fact about the ‘logic of nature’ [21] that has to be properly understood [53,118,125]. The main
argument to justify the search for a deep meaning of gauge symmetries is that these symmetries
seem to have non-trivial physical consequences, notably

(1) the relation between gauge symmetries and fundamental physical interactions encoded
in the heuristic gauge principle [113] (see also [21,117,121,126,127]),!5

(2) the role played by gauge symmetries in renormalization theory [128],

(3) the role played by gauge symmetries in the definition of the so-called topological
solutions—like instantons—associated with fibre bundles that are topologically non-
trivial,

(4) and the supposed ‘physical reality’ of the gauge potential in the Aharonov-Bohm effect
and similar escenarios [129-134]. This position could be traced back to Kretschmann’s objection against the supposed physical scope of the principle of
general covariance in general relativity [123].

'SBriefly, the gauge principle encodes the heuristic fact that the a global symmetry of a Lagrangian can be made local by
adding a gauge field, that is, a potential of a physical interaction. In order to try to unravel the mysteries of gauge symmetries, different research avenues
have been explored. Rovelli, for instance, argues that gauge symmetries are a manifestation
of the relational nature of physical observables.'* In turn, Greaves and Wallace use Galileo’s
ship thought experiment [135] to argue that local symmetries can have empirical significance
or observable consequences [118] (see also [136-140]).
