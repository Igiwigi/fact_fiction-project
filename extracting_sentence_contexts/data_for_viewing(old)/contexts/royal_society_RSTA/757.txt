machines, for example, resulted in new ways of doing laundry (e.g. mangles becoming redundant
and washing machines becoming commonplace) and changed standards of cleanliness (e.g. the
frequency of washing clothes).

By performing practices such as ‘doing the laundry’ practitioners are associated with:
inconspicuous consumption (e.g. embodied energy costs in manufacturing and the energy
consumption of the appliances); conspicuous consumption (e.g. ownership of washing machines,
tumble dryers, detergents); the act of making a purchase itself; and the use of services [17].
Instead of focusing on any one of these particular ‘moments’ in or aspects of the life cycle of
products, practice theory takes a more holistic approach. It focuses on the social and cultural
context of which products and services are a part. Practice theory can be seen as a ‘big picture’
