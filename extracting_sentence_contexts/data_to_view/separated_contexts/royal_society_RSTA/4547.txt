We then use complex models to argue that the simple
model is correct and consequently use simple models to predict future warming. Alternatively,
we use a complex model directly and relate whatever observations we have straight to model
quantities, and use a constrained set of models for prediction [43,45,123,124]. In this case, the
mapping of a palaeoclimate sensitivity to a modern ECS is not prescribed, but is implicit in the
GCM by the fact that feedback changes spatially and as a function of the climate state in the GCM. In all of those questions, the treatment of uncertainties is key. In an energy balance approach, the
uncertainties for different time periods are dominated by either uncertainties in radiative forcing,
feedback, ocean heat uptake or natural variability.
