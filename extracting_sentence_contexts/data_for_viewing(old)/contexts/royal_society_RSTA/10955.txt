The spectrum is independent of n as regards composition, if 7 is large. The total
intensity, however, varies as 7; thus a variation in the crowding of the pulses
causes a corresponding variation of the brightness of the spectrum—a result which
might have been expected.

§ 28. Let us consider how these results are affected when the individual pulses are
of infinite breadth. Suppose that we examine the type which Lord Ray.ercn
suggested,

iter

The displacement becomes comparatively small when the distance from the centre
of the pulse is great compared with 1/c. In fact, we are tempted to regard these
pulses as practically equivalent to pulses of finite breadth 1/c or thereabouts.

Suppose that the least observable interval T comprises a large number of central
points of pulses. Suppose also that T is great compared with 1/ce. The interval
will contain a contribution from each of the infinite succession of pulses. But, since
je-“dz is small when b is great, only those pulses which contribute finite displace-

ments will affect the aggregate content of T. Now the centres of these will lie
either in the interval, or at a distance from its extremities of order 1/c. As 1/c is
small compared with T we shall practically be concerned only with the large number
of pulses which lie almost entirely within T. We are, therefore, justified in
regarding 1/c as the effective order of breadth of these strictly infinite pulses.
