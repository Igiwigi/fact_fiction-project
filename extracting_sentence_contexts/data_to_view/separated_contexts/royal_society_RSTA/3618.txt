Our geometrical model, coupled to the aforementioned method, may therefore be used to tune
the parameters of the experiment, Vy or H, in order to ‘program’ the thread and drive its buckling
instability in a controlled and constructive way. We note the contrast between the simplicity of
the nozzle’s motion, simply translated at constant speed in the x-direction, and the complexity of
the print, which presents features in both the x- and y-directions. This richness is the sole result
of the fluidic instability that, in fact, shapes matter through geometrical nonlinearities, thereby
offering an avenue for patterning complex media, such as glass, in a controlled and tunable way. Here, the
coiling instability is used as an instability-assisted design tool, which can be taken advantage of
towards the assembly of larger structures.

4. Patterns as building blocks

In this section, we show how coils and other related patterns may be used as building blocks
towards the fabrication of larger structures.
