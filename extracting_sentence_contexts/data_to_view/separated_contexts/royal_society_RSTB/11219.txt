An extensive amount of empirical data has
shown that cortical premotor areas in non-human primates
are endowed with sensory properties. They contain neurons
that respond to visual, somatosensory and auditory stimuli. On the other hand, posterior parietal areas, traditionally con-
sidered to associate purely sensory information, in fact, play
a major role in motor control. The premotor and parietal
areas, rather than having separate and independent functions,
are neurally integrated not only to control action, but also to
serve the function of constructing an integrated representation
of actions together with objects acted on and locations towards
which actions are directed. This functional organization sup-
ports two important functions: (i) providing coherent frames


of reference for actions of various types and (ii) providing gen- set by bodily action.
