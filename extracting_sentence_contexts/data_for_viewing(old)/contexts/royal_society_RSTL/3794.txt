the number of the spirals. Nor is this supposition inconsistent with the fact, that
muscle by constant exercise increases in its bulk.

59. My observations on the form of the ultimate threads in voluntary muscle,
firs: made on the larva of a Batrachian Reptile, have been confirmed by an examina-
tion of this structure in each class of vertebrated animals, including the scaled Am-
phibia, and Cartilaginous as well as Osseous Fishes. Such of the Invertebrata, also,
as happened to be easily obtainable, were examined, and afforded ample confirmation
of those obseryations. They included animals in the Crustacea (Crab), Mollusca
(Limpet, Clam, Cockle, Mussel, Garden Snail, Periwinkle, Whelk), Annelida (Earth-
worm), and Insecta (a kind of Caterpillar).

Facts observed in the Formation and Structure of the Crystalline Lens.

60. In the Philosophical Transactions for 1841, I delineated cells, first arranged,
like the beads of a necklace, in a line; and then, by the disappearance of the inter-
vening septa, forming a tube, the foundation of the fibres of the Crystalline Lens||.

61. I bave now to state, that within this tube there are formed, in the first place
dises (fig. 129), and then filaments (fig. 130 Â«), having precisely the same structure
as the filaments of other parts. Nowhere have I obtained more satisfactory evidence,
than in the lens, that these filaments are composed of two spiral threads (fig. 131 B, y),
and that the spirals give origin within their winds to other filaments.

62. The toothed fibre discovered by Sir David Brewsrer in the lens, is formed
