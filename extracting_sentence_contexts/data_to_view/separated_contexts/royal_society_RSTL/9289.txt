Tt is worthy of remark that
this portion of the spectrum we come to a locality in which it is continuous. At fir
sight this seemed inexplicable, and many endeavours were made to obtain p
graphs of such definition as to show absorption lines of some description. I have
guecceeded in 80 doing, nor do I believe that they are to be found, except they
of the very finest description ; in fact, much finer than any I have met with below
A. In this conclusion I am borne ont by a reference to the prismatic spectrum of
this portion, in which the same locality exhibits a perfect blank as regards absorpÂ»
tion. From smaller photographs taken with the grating I believe it will be found
that this region extends beyond wave length 12,000.
