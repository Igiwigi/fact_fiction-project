Hence the
gametes in the primitive sac of the Gnetoid type were free nuclei. â€˜The view that
the Angiosperm-sac is a derivative from the same type is advanced below. One of
the signs of its higher degree of specialisation is the fact that its gametes, functional
and reduced, are no longer free nuclei but cells. It remains to be considered whether the Gnetoid endosperm is unique or whether,
on the other hand, it may not be regarded as representing a primitive condition, from
which that of the higher seed-bearing plants has been evolved. The former is the
product of the division of many fusion-nuclei, the latter of one; in both the fusion-
nucleus results from the union of nuclei of the same generation as the functional
gametes.
