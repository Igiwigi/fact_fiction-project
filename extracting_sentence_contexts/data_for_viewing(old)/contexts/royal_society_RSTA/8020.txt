and December 1928, and at Oldbury in 1927 and again in 1930-31, did not indicate
that the behaviour of the balance was materially different from its behaviour in Australia

observational experiences.

successive observations, it is necessary that the sextant arm should be moved slightly,
so as to reduce the twist of the fibre. This is necessitated by the fact that the lever.

This upsetting of the lever would alter the strain in the fibre much more than ever
happens during a set of ordinary observations. On several occasions during the work
the lever did upset, and remained upset for periods up to several days. The zero
reading and daily rate were proportionately altered. This involved considerable loss of
time, as after the daily rate has been suddenly changed a considerable periodâ€”several
