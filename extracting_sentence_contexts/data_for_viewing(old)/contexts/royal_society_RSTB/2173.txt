Ihave made several experiments on the digestive ferments of the gastric gland

of Aplysia, and I arrived at exactly the same conclusion as recent observers who
have worked at the same subject in other Mollusca, namely, that it is capable of
digesting fibrin in acid and alkaline solutions, and of changing starch into sugar.
We have, in fact, peptic, tryptic, and amylolytic ferments present.*

I have not thought it necessary to describe in greater detail the other cell-
inclusions found in the above or other gastric glands, because FrEenzEt has, in his most
recent papers, done this so thoroughly that he has left little to be described. He,
however, draws, in my opinion, too hard and fast lines between the granular and
ferment cells.

The Gastric Gland of Decapod Crustacea.—In those Decapod Crustacea which I
have examined I have found much less entero-chlorophyll or other pigment than
in the Mollusca. The gastric gland is of simpler construction, the ccecal tubes
composing it are not as a rule bound to each other by connective tissue, but hang
freely into the body-cavity. The kinds of cells found, and described by Weber and
