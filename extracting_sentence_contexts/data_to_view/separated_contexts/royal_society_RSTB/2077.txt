stomata of shut leaves even when the ligbt was concentrated by a lens. * I had, in
fact, concluded that the experiments with colour-sereens and artificial light must be
made with the above water-plants when I happened to find, in the cotyledons of seed-
ling Ipomeas and Cucurbitas, material sensitive enough for my purpose. The light
of the incandescent gas was concentrated on the experimental plant by passing
through a large globular flask before passing through the colour-sereens into the
experimental box. In this way it was found possible to cast a brilliant light on the
plant, and at the same time to keep it cool.
