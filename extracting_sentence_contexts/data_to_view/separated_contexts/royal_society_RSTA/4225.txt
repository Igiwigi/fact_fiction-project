As a consequence, the drop has infinite volume in
three dimensions, but finite cross-sectional area in two dimensions. The surfaces and ¥ are a
completely determined by the two-dimensional curves (x,z) and (x1,¢), and the model on the :
rectangle becomes :§

for the liquid-air interface, where «r is the curvature of the (x,z) curve, and [oS

In the above, a prime denotes differentiation with respect to u and a dot differentiation with
respect to s. For the boundary conditions, we have used the facts that in the three-dimensional
set-up dJ” is parallel to ez, that its co-normal is given by vp = (+%(+¢), 0, +2(+0)), and that y(v) :=
§(41 + x1(41), 0). It is informative to compare equations (3.2) to other models for two-dimensional capillary
origami, which typically assume inextensible plates, in situations where strong contact line
pinning is expected. Specifically, such models read [11,23]

representing the air—liquid interface and the plate, and where prime denotes differentiation with
respect to arc-length.
