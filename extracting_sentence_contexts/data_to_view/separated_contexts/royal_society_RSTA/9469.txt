When we reflect that the vibrations of greatest wave-length are
exactly those which are common both to compressible and incompressible masses, we
see readily that, in this respect at least, compressibility is likely to make but little
difference. q

The vibrations of greatest wave-length are put in evidence, both in the compressible
and incompressible mass, by the displacement of the surface. A vibration in which
the displacement is proportional to a zonal harmonic P, may be thought of as having
a wave-length approximately equal to za/n. In accordance with the principle that
vibrations of great wave-lengths are most effective towards instability, we should
expect the lowest values of n to give the vibrations which first become unstable, and
this is, in fact, found to be the case. But here a very real distinction enters between
the compressible and the incompressible mass. In the incompressible mass vibrations
of order Â» = 1 are non-existent, the displacement being purely a rigid body displace-
ment; in the compressible mass vibrations of order n = 1 can certainly occur, and so
might reasonably be expected to be the first to become unstable.
