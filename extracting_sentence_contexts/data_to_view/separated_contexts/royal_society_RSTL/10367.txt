On the other hand, as compared with plot 4-1, with superphosphate of lime alone,
plot 8, with its continuous supply of soda and magnesia, and its residue from previous
applications of potass, in addition to the snperphosphate, yielded, on the average, more,
and sometimes considerably more, of almosb every gramineous species, the excess being
the most prominent in the case of Festuca oving and Avena elatior. Q The results of the complete separations show (and the fact is fully borne out by
Dobservation in other years) that the great reduction in leguminous herbage, consequent
Son the exclusion of the potass, is mainly due to a greatly reduced growth of Lathyrius
atensis, bub also to a decreased growth of Trifolium pratense and Trifolium repens ; ewhilst, though in less amount than without manure, there is on plot 8, compared with
wot 7, eyen a slight increase in the yield of the deep-rooting, self-reliant Lotus
Sorniculatus. In fact, ib will be found throughout the experiments that the Legu-
Foinosz are only specially favoured by purely mineral manures containing potass, and
Shat, under the inflaence of such comparatively superficial supply of potass, it is the
BLathyrus pratensts which becomes by far the most prominent.
