Thus it appears that the green colour of the tubercles of the “ back”’ is due to the
superposition of yellow pigment upon the blue “ layer,” the blue colour of the margin
is due to the “ blue layer’ in the absence of yellow pigment, the orange colour of the
“bands” is due to the orange chromatophores and the absence of the “ blue layer”
from this region. Maximum darkening is of course due to extreme distal migration
of the melanophore pigment in all tubercles. It is a fact of considerable interest that the bright colours seen in adult chameleons
are not present in young ones. As is well known, Lophosawra pumila is a viviparous
species. Many births have occurred in the laboratory.
