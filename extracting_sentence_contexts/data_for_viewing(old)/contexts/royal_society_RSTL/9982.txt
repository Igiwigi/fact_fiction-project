the motion of the machinery in the works kept up a continual vibration in the ground.

An automatic circuit-breaker was next introduced into this arrangement and the
distance reduced to 200 feet. A correction for instrumental error was in this case
determined from observations ab 100 feet. With this arrangement a mean velocity of
transit equal to 563 feet per second was obtained.

The state of the ground was in this case affected to some extent by frost, the
temperature the previous night being 9* Fahr. below freezing.

The circuit-closer was next altered and three more determinations made, the mean
result of which gave 379 feet per second. In this case, however, the previously
determined correction had to be nsed owing to the fact that @ new correction could
not be made that day, and was nob afterwards made.

This resalb is &0mewhat uncertain, becanse a new circuit-breaker was here used and
> more improvements introduced in the closer.

Neither of these methods having given results with which we felt at all satisfied, we
turned our attention to the registration of the motion of the ground in conjunction
with the time. We were led to this method of experiment through some trials of a
seigmograph, designed by one of us, which we had taken advantage of these experi-
ments to make. This instrament (Gray's rolling sphere seismograph) proved 80 8en-
Sitive that the motion of the ground could be plainly written at a distance of about
400 feet. The first trial of this method was made as follows:â€”A glass plate mounted
