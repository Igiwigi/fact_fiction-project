[65,66]. When synthesizing imaging observations as obtained, for example, by AIA, one can take
an even simpler route and use the temperature response function for the various filters sampling
different temperatures. These have been made available through SolarSoft and are documented,
for example, for AIA [67].

These synthetic observations can be compared directly with solar observations. One can
compare the structures found in the model. Examples are the intensity distribution along and
across loops, the expansion of coronal structures, or the spatial structures and average value of
the Doppler shifts (most of which will be discussed briefly below). If the synthetic and observed
properties match, one can say at least that the forward model provides one possible explanation
for the observed feature. Of course, other explanations might exist. However, when comparing
complex models to complex observations, there is a fair chance that, if the synthetic and real
observations match, the model is in fact a good description of the real Sun. In this context,
‘complex’ means that not just one single aspect is matching, but that many observables (in the best
case any one can think of) do match. To illustrate such synthesized observations, figure 2 shows
an emerging active region model covering 150 x 75 x 75 Mm’ after two sunspots appeared. Many
loops have formed and evolve quickly on a time scale of 10-30 min.

If a match is found, the real challenge is to isolate the process(es) that are responsible for
creating the respective features in the model. These processes might then be the ones that are
responsible for creating the features on the real Sun, too.
