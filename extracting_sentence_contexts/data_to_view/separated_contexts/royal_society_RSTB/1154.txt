D. Spinal Cord. It will be scarcely realised, except by those who have made a special study of the
literature of the physiology of the spinal cord, how little has been done which would
enable us to carry out, strictly speaking, the differentiation of the subject, of conduc-
tion in that organ, by arranging the facts in the same way as we have just done for
the higher parts of the nervous system. So much so is this the case that we do not
intend to do more at this stage than indicate what we believe to be a fair estimate of
the experimental work already accomplished. In introducing our own work later on,
which directly bears on the points at issue, we shall draw attention to many of
the more salient details which require attentive discussion.
