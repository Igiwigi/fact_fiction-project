When ashore the maximum shearing-
force is, of course, 1230 tons. By comparing this ship with the * Bellerophon ' and
* Minotaur,‚Äù it will be seen that the maximum sagging-moment bears a larger ratio to
the product of the displacement by the length than it does in the two ironclads. 'This
is due to the fact, already illustrated, of the greater concentration of weights at the
centre of the paddle-wheel steamship. These three examples afford us the means of approximating to the limiting values of
the shearing-forces and bending-moments of ships supported at the extremities only,

and from them we obtain the following limits.
