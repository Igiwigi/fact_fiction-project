Zits geometrical meaning, if we conceive the rigid body to be a solid composed of
Ebarical Shells having a common centre at the origin, each shell will be converted
Sinto an ellipsoid by the distortion. The sphere whose radius is unity will be changed
Zinto an ellipsoid whose axes are Az, BB, Cy; and the axes of the other ellipsoids will
S be parallel and proportional to these.

By

E Au+BB8+Cy
&is an important determining element. If we assume »' to denote what @ becomes in
Z consequence of the distortion, it may be easily seen that o' is a distributive function of
8» and Az+BB+Cy; and from this fact a number of curious symbolical relations
5 may be deduced. But I must not dwell upon this subject of distortion now further
= than my immediate purpose requires.
