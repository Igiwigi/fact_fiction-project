S error, could only in the worst case account for a portion of the discrepancy.

Ss Two further determinations ((d) and (e) Table II), made at the N.P.L. with Ni 16 as
é basis, served to confirm very closely the values previously obtained. So far the N.P.L.
2 results had been satisfactorily consistent, but in February, 1921, comparisons made in a
€ closed set of four bars with Ni 16 again as basis, resulted in values ((/) Table IL) that
3 were very close to the Sévres values of 1920. This result differed so much (about 0-6 u)
3 from the values previously obtained at the Laboratory that but for its agreement with
g the Sévres values its accuracy would have been immediately placed under suspicion,
8 and in spite of the agreement with Sévres this suspicion still could not be avoided when

it was found that another bar included in the observations, No. 139, had also apparently
changed by 0-6 u. The facts appeared to point to some change having actually taken
place in the length of ‘Ni 16, though it was difficult to affirm that this was really the
case. The result in any case was deemed to be unreliable, an opinion confirmed, as
will be seen, by subsequent events. It remained throughout the rest of the work, an
isolated result differing from all the others and apparently inexplicable.

Further closed sets of observations with Ni 16 as basis made in the succeeding months
served to give results ( (g) and (A) Table II) that confirmed the original values obtained
for Ni 184.
