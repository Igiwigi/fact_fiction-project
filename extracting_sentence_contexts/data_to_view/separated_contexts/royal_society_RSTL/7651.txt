These sets of numbers, expressed graphically in terms
of the altitude, are seen on Plate XXX. fig. 3; the dotted curye indicating the intensity
of the diffused light, the black curve that of the direct sunlight. These two curves inter-
sect at an altitude of 50*, at which elevation, therefore, the place of equal chemical illu-
mination occurs for a surface placed in the plane of the horizon. The fact that the curve of direct sunlight cuts the base line at 10* bears out the con-
clusion which one of us has already announced, namely, that at altitudes below 10?
direct sunlight is robbed of almost all its chemically active rays,

The curves (fig. 1) show the daily march of chemical intensity at Lisbon, as a mean
of all the observations, compared with that at Kew for the preceding August, and at
Pari for the preceding April. The number representing the mean chemical intensity at
Key is 94:5, at Lisbon 110, and at Pard 313:3; light of the intensity 10 acting for
twenty-four hours being taken as 1000. If we now arrange the observations according to the sun's altitude, we haye :â€”
