practice, is a linear one, within the limits of accuracy of our observations. We may
therefore include all the effects of a change of temperature in a single coefficient.
Equation (1) may be written

p= MSN _ (4 — oy),

As ¢ and ware independent of the temperature, and as @ decreases as the tempe-
rature rises, to make this a working formula we must re-write it thus

g = MSY (1 — at) — (6 — 2) . ea ae Pe

where « is the temperature coefficient and ¢ is the platinum temperature. In con-
sequence of the fact that the constants in this equation can only be approximately
determined, we are limited to the consideration of relative values of g, so we may
write the equation
6= Kg (1 + at) —C,
where K and C are constants.
