By grounding computer science in the physical [8
world, questions of ontology and semantics for computational formal systems can also be .
addressed, and we will focus in particular on lambda calculi in this regard. In the presence of AR theory, computer science becomes the natural science of the computing
abilities of physical systems. While seemingly a very different foundational view of computing,
it is in fact a supplement to, rather than a repudiation of, standard computability theory. It
is a theory of computing to add to our current theories of computation. AR theory allows
more physical devices, both individually and as heterotic systems, to be brought under the
umbrella of abstract computation theory, while remaining agnostic about questions around their
universality and/or Turing completeness.
