As one can see in time series in figure 12a, a phase of
the small-amplitude oscillations near the stable equilibrium almost disappears, and the stochastic
system exhibits quasi-periodic large-amplitude stochastic oscillations. Time series in figure 12b
are not much different from the curves in figure 12a. Thus, in the presence of the noise, the population system can demonstrate the large-amplitude
oscillatory regime despite the fact that its deterministic model predicts a stable equilibrium.

4. Spatial pattern formation in the model with diffusion

In this section, we consider a spatially distributed variant of the deterministic population model
(2.1) with the diffusion. In the analysis of this distributed system, we focus on the case of one
