Here again we may notice the experiment mentioned by
Nucx, which, though under similar circumstances, was at-
tended with a different result. Some who feel themselves
disposed to venerate his authority, will probably oppose his
experiment to mine, and think it incumbent on me to account
satisfactorily for the difference. I can by no means acknow-
ledge such an obligation; for to confer validity on experiment ]
by reasoning, is to inyert the order of inquiry, and support
facts by conjectures. It is sufficient for my credit to be able
to adduce evidence of the truth of what I advance, and for |
this evidence I rely on my preparations. '
