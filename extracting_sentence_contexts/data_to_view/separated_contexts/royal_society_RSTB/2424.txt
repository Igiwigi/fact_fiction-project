The addition of sodium and magnesium sulphates to potassium sulphate, in presence
of phosphates, seems to have exercised a distinct influence in retaining potash
in a citric-acid-soluble and presumably available condition, the apparent tendency of _
a portion of the potash to pass into a stable form of combination with the soil being
diminished. It is also found that, even where no potassium salts are used, sodium and
magnesium salts, in presence of phosphates and nitrogen, have exercised a marked
influence in increasing the proportion of citric-acid-soluble potash, in the soil in all the
depths examined. This accords well with the fact that, although no potassium salts
have been applied to these plots for fifty years, their crops are larger, and contain a
larger quantity of potash per acre than those grown on the plot manured with super-
phosphate and ammonium salts alone. The soils of certain of the plots which, for the greater part of the experimental

period, had been manured in exactly the same way, will be seen to show, when’
examined by the dilute citric acid method, differences which can be traced to
variations in manurial treatment more than forty years previously. With these prefatory observations we may proceed to consider the results, taking
them in two separate sections, viz., those relating respectively to the phosphoric acid
and to the potash contents of the soil.
