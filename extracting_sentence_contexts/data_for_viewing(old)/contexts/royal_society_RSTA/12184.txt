bsorption in the interficial layer, which is unsatisfactory for the same reasons as
pply to Krrcnnorr’s doctrine of extraneous forces; the quality above mentioned,
or which Sir Grorce Stokes proposes the name of the adamantine property, being
ufficient.

Reflexion by Partially Opaque Media.

_ 94, The ordinary formule for reflexion at the surface of an absorbing medium may
now be derived from the analytical functions which express the averaged dynamical
onstitution of the wether for the case of its vibrations in ponderable bodies. If the
eneral argument is correct, it is to be expected that these formule would be verified
reflexion at the surfaces of such media as are not too highly absorbent in com-
ison with the length of the wave. There are in fact two extreme cases; first the
reflexion of electromagnetic waves of sensible length from metallic surfaces, where the
flexion is complete and there is no absorption at all; and second the reflexion of
aves from perfectly transparent media, where the reflexion is incomplete because
art of the energy goes on in the transmitted wave. The reflexion of light from
netals may conceivably be more nearly akin to the first of these limiting cases than
© the second ; but for media more transparent than metals we should expect closer
greement with the ordinary theory, now to be developed.
