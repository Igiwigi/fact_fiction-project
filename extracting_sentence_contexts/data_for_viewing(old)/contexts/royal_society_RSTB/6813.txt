X% or X* are present with either of the three tobacco virus strains, and in 11-15 days
when any of the remaining X strains take their place. The lesions are fully necrotic and
in the case of either X¥, X°, X or X* are similar both in number and in the de-
struction of leaf surface involved. When °, and to a still greater extent when X” is the
partner, the local lesions are so rapidly formed, so deeply necrotic and extensive, that
they cause the inoculated leaves to wither and drop.

The systemic lesions also fall into two groups: those occurring when X”, X°, X? and
X* are partners, and those when X*% or X% take their place. In the first group the
reaction is remarkably uniform and is accompanied by a considerable amount of
rather superficial necrotic destruction of tissue. When A? was the partner of any of the
three tobacco strains the reaction was somewhat less severe than that produced by any
of the others not excluding X¥ (see fig. 40). This fact affords further evidence for the
substantive nature of this strain. In appearance the reaction consists of the well-known
mottle of pale and dark green areas common to simple tobacco mosaic infection, but
on the pale areas are superimposed lightly necrotic rings. When the aucuba strain is
present the plants later exhibit brighter yellow areas which distinguish them from
plants infected with mixtures in which the two other tobacco mosaic strains are present. -
The leaves are narrower, reduced in size, the surface slightly rugose and the contour
irregular, but the actual destruction of tissue does not involve the whole thickness of
the leaf. In the second group, when X% and X* are partners, necroses are greatly
increased both in extent and severity; often the damage is so great that the earlier
formed leaves succumb, and if very young plants have been used, they generally die.
The X* mixtures always produce more severe symptoms.
