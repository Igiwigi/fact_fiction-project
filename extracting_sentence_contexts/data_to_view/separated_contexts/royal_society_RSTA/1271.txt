We see that the
Griffith equation used in the Liberty ship disaster analysis does not emerge because the lap joint
crack is essentially a low angle peeling delamination rather than a tensile stress-driven Griffith
crack in a stretched sheet. Thus, the following analysis can confuse Fracture Mechanics students
who understand only the Griffith equation, since the final equation for lap joint interface crack
equilibrium, based on the Griffith Principle, is quite different from equation (2.1) though it has
similar dimensions.

5. Theoretical analysis

One of the deficiencies of fracture mechanics textbooks [23] is that peeling fracture is not normally
described, despite the fact that peeling gives the simplest crack equilibrium equation as first
discovered by Rivlin in 1944 [9], while also giving failure at the lowest force possible, making
it mechanically easy. Additionally, the peel crack propagates at constant speed under steady load,
so does not accelerate catastrophically as in the Griffith crack, giving easier observations of crack
speed. The same is true for the lap joint crack, showing its relation to peeling and bending cracks,
which are also absent from most fracture mechanics courses, possibly because solutions produced
by the Griffith Principle do not produce the Griffith equation for peeling, bending, double torsion,
compression, JKR, compact tension and almost every practical cracking test.
