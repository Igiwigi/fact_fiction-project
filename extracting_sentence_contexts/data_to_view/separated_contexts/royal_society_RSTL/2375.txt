A summary of certain points already ascertained respecting electrolytes, ions.
and electro-chemical equivalents, may be given in the following general form of pro-
positions, without, I hope, including any serious error.

826. 1. A single ton, i. e. one not in combination with another, will have no ten-
deney to pass to either of the electrodes, and will be perfectly indifferent to the pass-
ing current, unless it be itself a compound of more elementary ions, and 80 snbject
to actual decomposition. Upon this fact is founded much of the proof adduced in
favour of the new theory of electro-chemical decomposition, which I put forth in a
former series of these Researches (518. &c.).

827. ii, If one 7on be combined in right proportions (697.) with another strongly

opposed to it in its ordinary chemical relations, i. e. if an anion be combined with a
cation, then both will travel, the one to the anode, the other to the cathode, of the
decomposing body (530. 542. 547.).

828. iii. If, therefore, an ton pass towards one of the electrodes, another ion must
also be passing simultaneously to the other electrode, although, from secondary action,
it may not make its appearance (748.).

829. iv.
