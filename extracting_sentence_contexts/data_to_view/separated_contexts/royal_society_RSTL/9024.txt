Slightly cutting the margin of a naked-eyed Medusa exerts a very
deleterious influence upon the vigour of the animal ; and violent nervous shock,
while it always suspends both spontaneity and irritability, will sometimes also destroy
coordination for a considerable time after spontaneity returns. The poisons whose effects T have described are chloroform, nitrite of amy], caffein,
strychuia, veratrium, digitalin, atropin, nicotin, alcohol, and cyanide of potassium. The
details of this part of the inquiry are rendered particularly interesting from the fact that
in the case of Sarsa we haye the means of testing the comparative influence of any
poison on the central, peripheral, and muscular systems ; but it is needless here to re-
peat details, In general, it will be remembered that the effects of the various poisons
on these respective systems are almost uniformly such as occur in the case of the higher
animals, In one important particular, indeed, the actions of nearly all the poisons differ
from their actions on the higher animals; for there is no poison in the above list which
has the property, when administered to the Meduse, of destroying life till long after it
has destroyed all signs of irritability. I have sought to explain this apparent anomaly
by the considerations, first, that the Meduxe present to the action of the central-nerve
Poison no nerve-centres of vital importance to the organism ; and, second, that my
method of administering the poisons to the Medusz was very different from that which
is usually employed when administering these poisons to yertebrated animals,

Fresh water acts as a deadly poison to the Meduse. The naked-eyed species usually
cease their movements the instant they touch the fresh water, and are killed by it after
an exposure of a few minutes ; but the covered-eyed species are slightly more tolerant
of its influence, 'The cause of this deadly influence exerted by fresh water depends on
the absence of sea-water, and not on the difference of density between the former and
the latter, Chloride of sodium alone, added in appropriate amount to fresh water, de- E
prives the latter, to a yery great extent, of its deleterious influence; but this is not the
