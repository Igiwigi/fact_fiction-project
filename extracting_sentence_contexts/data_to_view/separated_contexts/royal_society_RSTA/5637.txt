In conclusion, this strategy allows to ‘hide’ all the non-Abelian content of the gauge
theory (and the calculus of Clebsh-Gordan coefficients) in the definition of the dressed logical
basis and the effective Hamiltonian operators over that basis. The TN algorithm handles the
Abelian nearest-neighbour Link Laws, as well as the Abelian global symmetries (global charge
conservation), both of which can be easily accounted for with the numerical TN suites available
nowadays.

(a) Quantum electrodynamics dressed bases and defermionization

An additional advantage of this approach emerges in the QED case. Due to the fact that the
fusion rules of the gauge group (U(1)), equivalent to Z, contain Z2 as a subgroup, it is possible
to make rishon modes fermionic. In turn, this will produce an algebra of effective operators,
overdressed logical bases, which are genuinely local, meaning that they commute at different sites,
thus defermionizing the theory. This technique, explored in [55,84], will be briefly reviewed below for a special case.
