of the alburnous Vessels of Trees. 295

many advantages, both as a gardener and farmer, ( particu-
cularly in the management of fruit and forest trees,) from
the experiments which have been the subject of my former
memoirs, that I am confident much public benefit might be
derived from an intimate acquaintance with the use and office
of the various organs of plants ; and thence feel anxious to
adduce facts to prove that the conclusions I have drawn are
not inconsistent with the facts stated by my great predecessors.

It has been acknowledged, I believe, by every naturalist
who has written on the subject, (and the fact is indeed too
obvious to be controverted, ) that the matter which enters into
the composition of the radicles of germinating seeds existed
previously in their cotyledons ; and as the radicles increase
only in length by parts successively added to their apices, or
points most distant from their cotyledons, it follows of ne-
cessity that the first motion of the true sap, at this period, is
downwards. And as no alburnous tubes exist in the radicles
of germinating seeds during the earlier periods of their
