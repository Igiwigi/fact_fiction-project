I propose that the mechanisms underlying the resistance of the
maternal X against inactivation in the extraembryonic tissues of
the postimplantation embryo pointed out by Takagi and col-
leagues should be distinguished from those that operate at
the preimplantation stages, when only the paternal but not
maternal Xist is expressed. Available evidence suggests that

the paternal and maternal X chromosomes during very early in non-rodents [37] may be related to the fact that they undergo
stages of preimplantation development. I envision that such more cell division or DNA replication by the time XIST starts a
