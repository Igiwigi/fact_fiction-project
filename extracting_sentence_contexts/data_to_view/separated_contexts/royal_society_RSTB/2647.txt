Fig. 18 shows a knot in yellow pine,
and although the knot itself is dark its immediate surrounding, which is resin, is
almost without action. In fact, resins evidently vary very considerably in their
power of acting on a photographic plate, and their different degrees of volatility
or general activity may be shown by placing the sensitive plate at a distance above
the specimen of the wood and noting the result; for instance, a plate $ inch above
a piece of deal will give a dark . picture, whereas larch, pitch pine, or oak under
similar conditions act only very slightly on the plate. Of course, the absolute amount
of resin in each case is not known and varies considerably, but this variation in
quantity does not seem to be the sole cause of the different effects produced.
