B. COOPER ON THE BRITISH

comparison with the rhythmic time signals transmitted by the Post Office Wireless Station
at Rugby (G.B.R.), the mean rate can easily be determined with this accuracy, but it
requires an exceptionally good chronometer to ensure that the rate shall remain constant
throughout the interval between time signals. In the past mechanical chronometers have
been used, but the fact that these must operate electrical contacts, and the unfavourable
conditions on board a submarine, make it difficult to ensure the necessary constancy of rate. Matters may be improved by using two or more chronometers, but it is quite possible that
the conditions experienced during a dive, such as the change in temperature and pressure
and the cessation of violent motion, may introduce systematic changes in the rates. A great advance in the accuracy of timing was made by the American submarine gravity
survey of 1936-1937 on board the U.S.S.
