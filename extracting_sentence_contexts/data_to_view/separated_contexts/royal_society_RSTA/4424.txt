Hence, it is very reasonable to maintain that the differences between [4
and I',, between I, and I, between Ip and I’,, and between Ig and I are not due to chance. What :
can we infer from this result? Probably, it is the fact that a concept or its negation is measured that :=

makes a difference in the values of these functions, which again supports our claim that the non- Sy
classical mechanism we have identified is more due to conceptual formation than to conceptual 2
combination. D&S

The still much higher p-value of I4 versus Ig (0.85) when compared with the p-value of [4 22
versus Igy (0.08) could be due to A and B being ‘completely finished and stable in their formation : Sg
as a concept’, while A’ and B’ are more momentous and hence fragile in their concept formation’— DN
we plan to investigate these aspects further in the future. For example, if A and B were taken to : a
be ‘adjectives’ rather than ‘subjectives’ as concepts, their negations might be less fragile. : S

The results attained here could already be considered as crucial for claiming that the violation
of classicality occurs at a deep structural conceptual level, but this is not the end of the story.
