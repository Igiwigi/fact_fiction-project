Conclusion.

The fact that we are describing a flora of which nothing has hitherto been known
means that the points which have come to light about the individual plants here
described are of necessity very much more isolated, and form a less connected whole,
than is the case in dealing with a relatively well-known fossil flora, such as the
Carboniferous, As regards the Cretaceous period, we are to-day in an even less
advantageous position than were the writers on the Carboniferous thirty years ago,
and are in reality only laying foundations of a building the form of which does not
yet appear.

Of the majority of the plants described in this paper we have only a single part,
and where two or more parts, such as stem and leaves, or stem and roots, are known
from the same plant, we must think ourselves very fortunate. This makes it
difficult, indeed, to bring the fossils into relation with the plant families as a whole,
