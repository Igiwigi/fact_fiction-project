As in Perophora, many tadpoles settle and grow normally while still in possession
of a mobile tail, as though there is a relative independence in the development and
function of tail and trunk. The peculiar feature in the development of Clavelina lepadiformis, as also in
Clavelina rissoana, and Clavelina oblonga (egg 0-31 mm diameter), is that only 2 rows
of stigmata are formed in the post larva. This will be discussed later, although it
may be stated here that this fact is not evidence that the primitive number of
protostigmata in ascidians is two and not three, as some authors have suggested. bâ€”Clavelina picta (VERRILL), egg 0-48 mm diameter. The development of this
form is almost identical with that of Clavelina lepadiformis.
