Given the diverse time scales and amplitudes of the MAOOAM variables, the noise parameters
are all scaled on a climatological standard deviation of high frequencies ob ¢ RN:, which is
defined as the temporal standard deviation of the state vector after filtering out slow variations of
a period longer than one month. This high-pass filter is carried out by subtracting the one-month
running average.

The parameters of the experiments are presented in table 1, in the column labelled MAOOAM.
The true model is integrated over approximately 62 years after a spinup of 30000 years, in the
same configuration as in [35]. In all experiments with MAOOAM, the state is fully observed every
27h (At = 27h) (corresponding to N, = 1,000). A small modification was made to the observations
from equation (2.8) to account for the fact that observations of the ocean are not at the same
scale as those of the atmosphere: before being assimilated, instantaneous ocean observations
are averaged over a 55-day rolling period centred at the analysis times. The EnKF-N is used
as DA algorithm. The noise on the model forecast is added only to the atmospheric variables
with a standard deviation of ¢™ = 1073 oft. As mentioned in §3(b), the analysis obtained from
the DA is filtered. The slow processes are expected to occur mainly in the ocean, so only the
ocean components of the state vector x}., are filtered to produce x}... Differently from the L2S
model experiments, filtering the analysis has proven necessary to train the hybrid model using
MAOOAM.

The NN-architecture is a simple three-layer multi-layer perceptron; see table 1 for full
details. As opposed to the L2S model, the state vector has no locality properties (because it is
defined in the spectral space), so the convolutional layers are not applicable (see the discussion
