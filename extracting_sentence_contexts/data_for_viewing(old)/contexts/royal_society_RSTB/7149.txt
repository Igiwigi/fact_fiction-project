haltere.

(5) The gyroscopic torques during rotation of the whole fly act about the same axis as
the torque mentioned above which ensures that with the fly at rest the centre of gravity of
the moving portion oscillates in a plane at right angles to the main hinge line. Unlike that
torque, however, the mean value of the gyroscopic torques is zero, and they cannot
therefore affect the mean lateral position of the moving portion. The same fluid viscosity
which smoothes out the pulsating forces keeping the haltere on the arc of maximum radius
(YY, figure 6) ensures that the secondary articulation does not give it freedom to follow
the rapidly oscillating gyroscopic torques, and the full stresses will therefore be developed
in the cuticle at the base of the moving portion of the organ.â€™

(6) The fact that the gyroscopic torques during pitching and rolling movements differ
only by a constant depending on the sweep-back of the halteres from the transverse axis
of the fly necessarily implies that the fly could only distinguish between these two planes
of rotation by a comparison of the phasing of the torques from the halteres on the two

sides of the body, the two torques being in phase during pitching movements and in anti-
phase during rolling movements. The experiments quoted by Fraenkel (1939) showing the
slight effect of unilateral haltere extirpation suggest that such a phase comparison is not
an important part of the nervous mechanism associated with the haltere, a conclusion
which is supported by the fact that under certain circumstances it is possible to make the
