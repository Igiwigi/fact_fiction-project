We do not find sufficient data to enable us
to say how this matter was dealt with by former observers. It is obvious that both the above matters might affect not only the absolute values,
but also the relative values obtained at different parts of the temperature scale. Whether these causes in fact account for the differences in the values obtained for
the 15째 calorie, and in the still larger differences beyond 35째 C., it is impossible to say
with certainty. It is particularly unfortunate that such differences should exist with reference to
so widely accepted a standard as the 15째 calorie. But it is clear that, apart from the
points above mentioned, there is a general consensus of observers that the value of J
for 15째 C. comes on a very sloping portion of the curve and may therefore be affected
by small temperature differences.
