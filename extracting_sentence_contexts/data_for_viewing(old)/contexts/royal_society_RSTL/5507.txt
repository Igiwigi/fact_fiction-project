MR. P. H. GOSSE ON THE DIQECIOUS CHARACTER OF THE ROTIFERA. 325

both the sexes, is the only example in which I have not seen the penis ; but the organ
is probably wholly retractile within the body, and my observations, on the only indivi-
dual of this sex that I saw, were insufficient to determine anything concerning it.

45. For a parallel to the curious facts thus established we must look only to the
CrusTacea. The economy of the ectocotylus of certain Cephalopod MoLLusca, though
perhaps even still more abnormal, is only remotely analogous. Nor is the paralleligm
yery close of those ExTozoa in which the males are organically united to the females,
as the genera Zeteroura and Syngamus, described by Professor Owen ®.

46. In the Class CRusTacea, however, many examples occur of a sexual difference,
which may instructively be compared with the one before us. 'Thus, among the T80poda,
Ie find the parasitic genera Bopyrus, Phryaus, and Tone, in which the males are notably
Ynaller than the females, very diyerse in form, and in some respects inferior in structure.
Dn the Siphonostoma © the males are extremely small, and do not in the least resemble
Ie femalesF,” though those of different genera bear a strong resemblance inter 86, even
Shen the females are very dissimilar. So low is their grade of organization, that Buk-
