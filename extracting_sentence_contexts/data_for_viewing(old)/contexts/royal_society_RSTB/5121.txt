The structure of these vessels is thus in every way far more like that of an artery
of corresponding size than that of a vein. The walls of the latter (in the thyroid body,
for example) are practically without muscle and show but little concentration of connec-
tive tissue to form an adventitia, and only a very slight development of elastic tissue,
with no very clearly defined elastica interna. Still less do the walls of the “ fine ”
vessels resemble those of the spacious channels of the lymphatic system, which consist
practically of a layer of flattened endothelium alone, with little or no concentration of
fibrous and elastic tissue around it.

In describing the networks of minute vessels derived from the larger trunks of this
system of ‘* fine ” vessels, it was observed that they were often in close contact with the
blood-vessels and lymph sinuses. This close connection is, in fact, one of their most
striking peculiarities, for, although the networks permeate in a general way the connective
tissues throughout their area of distribution, they are especially rich in and near the
walls of the lymphatic sinuses and around the blood-vessels. Their relation to the
arteries in particular is of the most intimate character, resembling that of vasa vasorum.
From the meshes of the networks that accompany the various arterial branches small
offshoots arise here and there and immediately break up against the wall of the blood-
