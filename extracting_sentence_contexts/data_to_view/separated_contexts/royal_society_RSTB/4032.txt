Out of the many hundreds of species
introduced into Ceylon at different times, not more than about 60 at most have
become common. Commonness chiefly Dependent on Age. The second conclusion that we may, I think, justly draw from the remarkable Tables
which have been set out is that, on the average, the commonness of a species
depends upon the time that has elapsed from the period when it was first evolved
in, or arrived in, the country.’ No other explanation appears to me to fit the
striking facts that the species of wide distribution are commoner than the species
confined to Ceylon and India (even within one family), and these commoner than
the species confined to Ceylon, while at the same time the first show numbers
increasing towards VC and the latter to VR. The widely distributed species must,
on the whole, be the oldest, the Ceylon-Indian the next, and the Ceylon endemics the
youngest. There is no evidence that any are dying out,

In other words, species are, on the whole, developed quite indifferently to local
conditions, but, having evolved, they spread, if their degree of local adaptation is
sufficient, and as they must have descended from others already growing in the
neighbourhood, this should, in general, be the case.
