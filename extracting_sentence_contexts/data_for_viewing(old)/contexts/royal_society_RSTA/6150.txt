in which the coefficients of the various tensor expressions on the rh.s. are given explicitly by
equations (6.8). If we take the 00th-component of this result and use the formulae given in the
appendices of [57,58] to perform the identifications on both sides we encounter once more the

3We use DR to cancel divergent terms only for convenience. The subtraction (6.6) ensures already a finite result. However,
the intermediate UV-terms can be cancelled quite efficiently with DR. If desired, one can obtain the same results with the
subtraction procedure used to renormalize the EMT. We illustrated already this fact in the appendix B of [57]. The important
point here is not about regularization but about renormalization: indeed, the subtraction prescription (6.6) involves not just
the UV-divergences but the full expression obtained from the sum of the first three terms (j = 0, 1,2) in the DeWitt-Schwinger
expansion (6.4). This is, of course, entirely different from the MS renormalization prescription.


result (5.2) and, with it, we end up anew with the renormalized VED as given in equation (5.5)
(q.e.d.)

Finally, we can derive the RG equation for the VED. The explicit quantum correction 5p, (M)
computed in (6.8) adds up to the classical term p,(M) in the original action (2.7) (written
with renormalized parameters), such that the combined quantity —p,(M) + 5p,(M) must be RG
invariant. From this simple observation, the 6-function coefficient for the coupling p,(M) obtains
