of the
existing and fossil Marsupials changing one single tooth, and one only, and the small
remainder merely differing from them in a direction away from and not towards that
fuller tooth-change of which it is said their ancestors were once possessed. Of the one form of evidence needed to give any weight to the opposite theory,
namely, that derived from Palwontology, there seems not to be one atom, no fossil
Marsupials having ever been found showing traces of a larger amount of tooth-change
than the recent ones, nor do I think such a discovery likely to be made, as, to the
best of my belief, no such animal has ever existed. This view is very much
strengthened by the fact that, as already noted, one of the oldest Mammals known,


SUCCESSION OF THE TEETH IN THE DASYURIDA. 451

the Mesozoic T'riacanthodon, had precisely the same, and no more, tooth-change than
the modern Marsupials. For these various reasons, therefore, we may, I think, take it for granted that the
ancestors of the Marsupials never had at any time a more complete change of
dentition than they have now, and that they arrived at their present state at an
immensely early period, since which time they have as a whole practically stood
still, except that a few isolated forms have, comparatively recently, lost again even
the small amount of change they once possessed.
