one for determining absolute values with great certainty, I feel bound, from my own
experience, to give a decided preference to TyNDALL's method, not only on account of
the greater facility with which it furnishes qualitative [quantitative] results, but also
in consequenece of its greater delicacy. Tt is principally in consequence of this greater
delicacy that, notwithstanding the negative results furnished by Macxus's method, T

maintain that the greater absorptive power of moist air, as compared with d

ry, has

been fully established by the experiments made according to TYNDALL's method ; and

IT am of opinion that meteorologists may without hesitation accept this new
their endeavours to explain phenomena which hitherto have remained more
enigmatical.”

In 1866 MAGxvs varied his method of experiment, seeking to solve the question of
absorption by observations on radiation. ©T have,” he says, © made a few determina-
tions of the radiation of dry and moist air, and of some other gases and vapours. Up
to the present time,” he continues, © the capacity of these bodies to transmit heat has
alone been determined.”
