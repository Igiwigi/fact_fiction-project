It here forms an effective barrier against osseous union, the ossific formation
being absolutely limited by the periosteum, and fibrous union results.

260 SIR W. MACEWEN ON THE ROLE OF THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS

In compound fractures many opportunities have been afforded of demonstrating
how frequently the periosteum is torn from one fragment and laid over one or other
of the fractured surfaces, where, had it been allowed to remain, non-union would
have occurred, :

On several occasions during operation for un-united fracture, the interposition of
the periosteum between the fragments has been found by me to have been the sole
cause of non-osseous union. Were it not for the fact that the periosteum is normally
so tightly stretched over the bone, delayed and non-union would be more frequently
met with after fractures due to the interposition of the periosteum between the
fragments,

Is tHE PropucTiON OF CALLUS INHERENTLY GREATER IN THE LOWER
ANIMALS THAN IN Man? Fracture in the Lower Animals.—It is believed by many that the lower animals
are inherently prone to excessive formation of callus after fracture, and especially does
it seem great in them when compared with the amount which is poured out after
fractures in man. Abundant formation of callus is found after fracture in the lower animals, but
instead of the large amount being inherent to them, may it not be incidental to the
single factor of excessive and prolonged movement allowing the dispersal of the
osteoblasts through the rupture of the periosteum?
