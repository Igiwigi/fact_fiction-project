it is the symbol of an (m — 1)-flat. In fact, we can reduce this function to the form
(585) and the proposition is evident by (590).

163. The symbol of the flat xeciprocal to [a], with respect to the auxiliary
quadric (587), S. gq? = 0, in an n-space ts

where Q is the product of “n” mutually rectangular vector units in the n-space, or

In fact, from (585) we obtain

and n + 1 — m defining points of this new (n — m)-flat are (590)

But all these points are conjugates, with respect to the auxiliary quadric, of the
m points (590); and therefore the flat [@],@ is the reciprocal of the flat [q].,.
More symbolically, we have the relations

Vu [e]a-2= Vem [G]u23 Vn-r[the-2= —Vi-wsr-[G]aO - (596);
and in particular for three dimensions we deduce the relations
