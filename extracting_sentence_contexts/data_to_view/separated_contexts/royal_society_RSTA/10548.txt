Too much
weight is given to the observations at higher temperatures, which are necessarily less
accurate than the rest. The results obtained are in a great measure dependent on
the particular type of formula assumed, which is frequently inadequate to represent
the phenomenon, and is generally quite unsuitable for extrapolation. Moreover, the
method gives a fictitious appearance of completeness and accuracy, which is quite
2 misleading, as the calculated values of the probable errors contain no reference to
possible sources of constant error. It also generally happens that the terms of the
empirical formula are large and of alternate sign, so that the small variation required
is given as the difference between large quantities, which must be calculated to
® several figures in applying the formula. The following formula of Lipry supplies a
§ good illustration of some of these points :—

$s = 1 — :00076668¢ + 0000195987? — Se andl (4)

+ 0000025 + 000004 + ‘000,000,083

The probable errors of the several coefficients, as calculated by Liprn, are given in
the second line below the coefficients to which they apply.
