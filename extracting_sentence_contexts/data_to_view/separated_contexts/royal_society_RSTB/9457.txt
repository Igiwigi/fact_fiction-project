Doolittle and Zhaxybayeva [15] argue for the continued
utility of the term ‘prokaryote’, its traditional definition is
indeed largely negative.

(b) Circular chromosomes and operons

We consider these traits only somewhat more specific and of
limited onerousness in terms of independent achievement
(convergence). Circles and lines represent two of two logical
configurations for information encoded as it was from stages
prior to LUCA, and in fact both can be found in prokaryotes
[54]. Similarly, within Bacteria and Archaea, operons are con-
served in gene order only over short evolutionary distances,
although certain clusters of genes do recur [55]. Some cluster-
ing is expected as the result of ‘selfish operon’ selection [56],
and various regulatory regimens may favour the proximity of
genes for related functions (sometimes even in what have
been called super- or ‘uber-operons’ [57]).
