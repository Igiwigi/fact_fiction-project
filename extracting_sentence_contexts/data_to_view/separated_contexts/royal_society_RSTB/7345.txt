Unlike the
Lucilia-C. chloropyga combination, in which only those two species occur together, the over-
lapping populations of Lucilia and C. albiceps are rarely free from the intervention of a third
species. Either C. marginalis or C. chloropyga is usually present on the carcass at the same
time, so that it will be on comparatively rare occasions that a straightforward competition
between Lucilia and C. albiceps will take place. Apart from the fact that these occasions do arise, we require to know the separate effects
of C. albiceps on each of the species. This fly is the only one of the blowflies, co-existent on
carcasses in South Africa, which is both predatory and cannibalistic. Its relationships will
therefore differ from those of the more docile species.
