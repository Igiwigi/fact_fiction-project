of the former analysis can be relaxed in place of direct observations. As such, the analysis that
follows employs the first two wires in the rake described in ยง2.

A sample of the fluctuating streamwise velocity signal in inner scaling from the inner probe
and the large-scale fluctuations from both probes are given in figure 3 for case B. The inner probe
is at yt ~ 20 around the near-wall peak, and the outer probe is at yf} ~ 210 in the log region
where the energy of the large scales is dominant. A high degree of correlation is visible from the
large-scale fluctuations at the two different wall-normal locations. This correlation is found to be
approximately 80%. This is higher than 65% found in [11] for a canonical turbulent boundary
layer that was justified as a result of the footprint caused by the superstructure-type events in the
log region. The fact that the correlation is higher in FST cases supports the direct penetration of
the FST large scales into the boundary layer and down to the near-wall region (this correlation is
even higher for case D, approx. 85%).

Given the similarities of the scale interactions with that of high Reynolds number canonical
boundary layers, there is grounds to test the predictive inner-outer model of Marusic et al. [10],
also detailed in Mathis et al. [11], for the turbulent boundary layers in the presence of FST.
This would confirm the analogy between the two flows and validate the applicability of the
model to this non-canonical case. Their model is able to predict the near-wall turbulence using
only the large-scale information input. With this input, the predicted velocity signal at a wall-
normal location is linked to a universal signal (a signal that is free from any large-scale influence)
through the model coefficients. Figure 4 shows a schematic for the mathematical formulation of
