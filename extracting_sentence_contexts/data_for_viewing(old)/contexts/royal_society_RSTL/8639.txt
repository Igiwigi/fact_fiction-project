are more general, and with which alone T am now dealing ; but I may observye that at
Darjeeling (7000 feet), even in the cold-weather months, southerly elements of wind-
direction predominate over northerly, and according to Dr. HookR's observations, at
great heights in the interior of Sikkim, a southerly current prevails throughout the year,
At the stations of Chuckrata and Nynee Tal in the north-west Himalaya, at about the
same elevation as Darjeeling, Dr. Murray 'Tnowso0N's registers show that the winds are
almost exclusively from the south or some southerly quarter at all seasons of the year,
In Lower Bengal, sonth and south-east winds are not very common from November to
January ; but their representatives (viz. easterly winds) are more common in Upper India,
specially in proportion to winds from the opposite quarters, calms being most frequent
of all. T have already mentioned that these easterly winds bring the winter rains; and
it will presently be shown that the latter are more regular and copious in the Punjab
and upper part of the Ganges valley than in Lower Bengal. From these facts we must,
T think, conclude that a portion of the upper or anti-monsoon current, following the
same course in the upper atmosphere as the summer monsoon does in the lower, descends
on the plains of Upper India, while another portion impinges on the southern slopes of
the Himalaya or even crosses them into Tibet. In the narrower valley of Upper Asam,
at least at Seebsaugor, this current appears to be less felt, and winds from north and
east blow steadily and persistently ; but the omission of the-observer at this station to
record calms, and the frequent occurrence of rain in the winter months, lead me to doubt
whether the effects of the return current are not felt to a great extent in that region
also.

With the advent of the hot weather the winds of Northern India draw round to the
westward, and dry currents (partly perhaps derived from the mountainous and desert
