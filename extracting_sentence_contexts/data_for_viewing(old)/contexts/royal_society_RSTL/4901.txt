Q
8 We have previously stated under what circumstances oxalate of allyl is formed, we
Awill not therefore recur again to its mode of preparation. Purified by a simple rectifica-
Aion, this compound presents itself as a colourless limpid liquid of a specific gravity of
9-05 at 15%5 C., and boiling constantly between 206? and 207? C. (Bar. 0=:754),
So88essing an aromatic odour recalling that of oxalic ether, with a faint admixture of
She 8mell of mustard oil. A similar remark in fact applies to all the allyl-compounds ;
-Shey smell like the corresponding ethyl-compounds, only somewhat more pungent.
AVhen mixed with water, oxalate of allyl undergoes gradual decomposition, but it is much
ore rapidly decomposed when boiled with a solution of caustic potassa. Solution
wIf ammonia attacks it rapidly, and transforms it into oxamide and allylic alcohol. An
Slcoholic solution of ammonia added with caution 80 as to avoid the formation of
Sxamide, produces a substance analogous to oxamethan, which, for this reason, we shall
Mexignate by the name allyloxamethan. 'This substance separates in magnificent crystals
Ayhen its alcoholic solution is allowed to evaporate spontaneously.

Sf heat, an evolution of carbonic oxide ensues, whilst there passes over on distillation a
