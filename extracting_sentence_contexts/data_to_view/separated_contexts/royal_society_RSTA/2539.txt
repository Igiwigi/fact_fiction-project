% EFFECT OF PRESSURE UPON ARC SPECTRA.—NICKEL. 248

The existence of another group is indicated by the occurrence of five lines which are
displaced towards the violet. The amount of their displacement is approximately the
same as that of Group Ik. if no allowance be-made for the fact that all the measure-
ments were made at 10 atmospheres pressure. We may designate the nickel groups as follows :—

Group 0, d= — 4°38 x10-")*
eee Oat 25 x 10T MD
yo ae = 4-570 x 10-4 XE,
x pees =e 10°75: 10-4 AF:
& In the above groups several lines are included whose displacements under pressure
ave not been measured ; their classification is based upon their general behaviour and
Sresemblance to lines whose grouping has been ascertained. eo
