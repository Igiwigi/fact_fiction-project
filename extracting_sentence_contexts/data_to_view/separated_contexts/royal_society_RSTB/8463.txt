For example,
changes in savanna fire regime of Southern Africa have
been observed as a result of agro-pastoralism, especially in
the past 4000 years, which may have potentially affected
forest expansion [98]. In addition, in central West Africa, a
recent study [99] has challenged the common belief that an

arid event at around 2500 cal year BP caused a major decrease
in forest [100-102], proposing instead that human land-use
change was responsible for this vegetation change. Although
this hypothesis remains under debate [103,104], it highlights
the fact that more attention should be paid to past human
impacts and their legacy on the current vegetation/climate
of tropical Africa. This is a point often missed in modelling
approaches and something that future studies should address
when considering the relationship between vegetation and
climate in Africa. Funding statement.
