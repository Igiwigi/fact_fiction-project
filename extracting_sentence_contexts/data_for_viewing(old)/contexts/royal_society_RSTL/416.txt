is a great quantity of apparently unpolarised light reflected
at the polarising angle, so that the image which would have
vanished by the application of calcareous" spar, had the re-
flexion been made from water or crown glass, possessed in
these cases a considerable brilliancy. The comparative inten-
sity of the light of this image is indeed $0 great, that only a
very small portion of the incident light seems to be polarised.
I was at first much surprised at witnessing this phenomenon,
as I had been led to believe from the first Memoir of MaLvs,
that one of the pencils formed by calcareous spar vanished
when the light was reflected from all other bodies as well as
from water and glass. There is some reason to think, however,
that MaLvs afterwards observed the same fact, for in a subse-
quent Memoir, he makes use of the term mazimum polarising
angle, in which the knowledge of it seems to be implied.

The extreme difficulty of accounting for such an unex-
pected phenomenon, probably deterred him from even men-
tioning the subject in any of his Memoirs; and I am not
ashamed to avow that the investigation of this point alone has
cost me more labour than any other branch of the polarisa-
tion of light. The existence of a quantity of apparently un-
polarised light, in a pencil reflected at the polarising angle,

appeared completely paradoxical, and it was obvious that no
