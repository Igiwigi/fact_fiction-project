plutei, but rather diminished it. The opposite, however, was the case in the reciprocal
cross.

In 1902 Sremeruck (83), from a study of the cross Spherechinus granularis 2 X
Strongylocentrotus lividus $, came to the conclusion that the hybrid larvee showed
immense variation, all intermediate examples being present, from the paternal to the
maternal types. In some cases he found mosaic inheritance, half the skeleton
resembling that of the father and half that of the mother. He studied the skeleton
and the outward form, but the latter can have been of little value as he used
preserved material. He noted in his pure cultures of Strongylocentrotus the frequent
occurrence of multiple rods in the postoral arm skeletons.

In 1903 Logs (52) attempted to obviate the difficulty arising from the fact that
with the Echinoids used up to that period for experiments in heredity, there must
always be some doubt concerning the inheritance of characters so much resembling
one another. He devised a method which enabled him to hybridize forms so far
removed from one another as Asferias and Strongylocentrotus. While the early
larvee of the former have no skeleton, those of the latter have one. In the hybrids
the skeleton of the maternal form (Strongylocentrotus) appeared.

In the same year Doncaster (21) crossed Echinus microtuberculatus 2 x Strongy-
locentrotus lividus 2? , and reared many of the larve to a late stage and some through
metamorphosis. He decided, however, that the parental larval forms resembled each
other too much for any conclusions to be based on the characters of the hybrids.
Following the example of Vernon, he drew most of his results from the cross
