HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES.

suggested by the case of Cu in which their values are comparatively small. But it
required the support of the larger values afforded by Ag and Au to firmly establish
the relations, Similar relations have been found in many other elements. The spectra .
of the rare gases from Ne to RaEm are built on a precisely similar plan, and in fact a
map for some of the Kr lines was drawn many years ago on the plan of those given
here for Ag and Au, although at that time the origin of the differences was not
known. :

The notation used is that of previous papers in this series. The letters p (m), s (m)
are used to denote the sequences N/(m+ f)? which in the alkalies give the variable
parts of the Principal and Sharp series. The wave-numbers of the Principal series
are then s(1)—p(m) and of the Sharp p(1)—s(m).
