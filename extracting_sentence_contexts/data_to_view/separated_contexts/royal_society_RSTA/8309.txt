It is seen that-this is a special case of our /?-extrapolation. Suepparn’s fact that the
coefficient is — ;'; for curves of all shapes that satisfy (5) is indeed remarkable. If
instead f(«) =1 when —a <a <a and f(z) = 0 elsewhere, then a theory, familiar in
connection with moments of inertia, shows that the coefficient is still 1, but with the
positive sign. As a detailed illustration in marked contrast with the frequency curves to which
Suepparn’s correction is applicable, we may take the frequency y defined by y= a*
when — 1 =#=1 and y=0 elsewhere.
