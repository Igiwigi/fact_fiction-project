any acid fumes from the sulphuric acid rocker, without introducing any gas other
than carbon dioxide. The iron bottles when supplying the gas were fitted with an
automatic pressure reducer, which prevented the pressure in any part of the apparatus
attaining a dangerously high value. The T-piece A (fig. 2) was replaced by a large
glass tap, followed by a piece of rubber tubing which could be partially constricted
by a clip, thus all possibility of air diffusing back into the carbon dioxide was
prevented. The flow of gas into the pressure regulator could be roughly adjusted by
means of the tap, and more finely -by means of the clip. It was impossible to get rid
of all the air in the CO,, but I found that, after a large quantity of gas had been taken
from a bottle, the remaining gas was practically pure, the percentage of air falling
from about 0°6 per cent. in the case of a full bottle to about 0°01 per cent. in the case
of a bottle which was nearly empty. Unfortunately I had used a large quantity of
the gas before I discovered this fact, but I was able, however, to calibrate the fine
tubes with pure CO, taken from bottles which were nearly empty, and in the later
calorimetric experiments I adopted the following device. Two bottles, A and B, were
arranged so as to be able to supply gas in parallel. The automatic pressure reducer
was fixed to the tube joining the bottles. A was half empty and B was full. Gas
was passed through the apparatus from B until the temperature conditions were

nearly steady. A was then opened and B shut off, so that the final readings were
taken with the pure gas from A passing through the apparatus. The process could
be repeated until A was empty, by which time B was half empty. A was then
