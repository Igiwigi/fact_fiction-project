ZYGOPTERID TREE-FERNS FROM WESTERN SIBERIA. 467

Summary.

The new genus Asterochlenopsis is founded on a well known silicified stem, picked up
about 50 years ago near Pawlodar, in the Kirgis Steppes, Western Siberia. The original
fossil having been cut into several pieces, two of these were described independently and
almost simultaneously (1889) by StenzeL and by A. ScHENK respectively, under the
names A sterochlena (Clepsydropsis) kirgisica and Rachiopteris ludwigu. The identity of
these species with each other, and the fact that the two type-specimens are fragments of
one and the same stem, were suspected by the present author in 1919 and have now been
proved by a comparison of the type-specimens, which have been found to fit together.
At the same time other fragments of the original fossil have been brought together and
several of the pieces have been examined for the first time in thin sections. This re-
investigation has yielded the rather unexpected result that the fossil combines in itself
the Clepsydropsis-like petiolar strand with a leaf-trace sequence resembling that of
Asterochlena, while the stem stele, hitherto practically unknown, is of a new type some-
what intermediate between those of Asterochlana and Ankyropteris. In the structure
of the leaf-trace at its point of origin there is a close resemblance with the Osmundaceous
ferns Zalesskya and Thamnopteris, from the Permian of Western Siberia.

Asterochlanopsis thus constitutes, on the one hand, an interesting link between
