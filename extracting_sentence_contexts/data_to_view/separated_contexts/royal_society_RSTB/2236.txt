By means of this treatment the tendency was combated,
and the ultimate complete recovery of function attained. Almost complete recovery
dated from the 45th to the 90th day after the operation. In the case of the third experiment it was found that the fact of the divided
nerves being united in their old position without any crossing, did not result in a
recovery of function any sooner than in the experiments where nerve-crossing had
been done. Thus the earliest signs of recovery of function were exhibited on the
25th day, but at this date the animal was only occasionally using the leg, and in a

few days, just as in the other experiments, it ceased using the leg and held it up
while running and walking. Even after the 90th day, a tendency was exhibited to
flexor contracture, but the object of the experiment having been attained, the
animal was not allowed to live longer.
