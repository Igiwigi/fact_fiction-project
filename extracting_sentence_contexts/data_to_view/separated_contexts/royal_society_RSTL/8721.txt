I never but once saw a similar motion in the perfect animal,
and this was in the case of a specimen which was dying from having been poisoned
with iron-rust. The motion, I think, may be explained by supposing that the various
parts of the muscle-layer are contracting without coordination ; but why they should
sometimes do this in response to stimulation, and why, when they do this, they should
continue the action 80 longâ€”these questions I cannot answer. In the case of 80
peculiar a phenomenon, however, it is necessary that I should detail all the facts T have
been able to collect. I haye never seen any similar or corresponding action performed
by the paralyzed bells of other Medusids, and even in the case of Saris its occurrence
is comparatively rare. When it does occur, however, it is always continuous; that is
to say, it never spontaneously recommences after having once ceased.
