The experiment is conclusive as showing that a large
response may be evoked which is confined to the led-through tract. There is thus no
propagation of the excitatory state from one plate to another. This most important
fact has its cause in the structure of the organ. Whatever may be the microscopic characters of the nerve terminations in the plates,
-and the part which they play in the production of the excitatory electromotive
‘change, there is no evidence of any continuity of protoplasm between one plate and
dis neighbours. It appears that each plate is physiologically completely severed from
Bll other plates, In order, therefore, to secure the simultaneous response of a whole
-yolumn, either the nerve trunk supplying the column must be excited or an induction
“ghock must traverse all the septa of the column.

2 Experiments referring to Excitation by the Voltaic Current.

+s The use of the rheotome has thus revealed the fact that the passage of an induction
Seurrent through a strip of organ excites the tissue.
