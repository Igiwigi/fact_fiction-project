Ethy! acetate faa, 7615 7440 + 2°4

The agreement is good except in the case of methyl formate; here, however,
negative value, judging from experiments with acetic acid and with the alcohols,
be due to molecular association. The positive value of the other two substances ma
be due to the fact that measurements were made in a different tube of wide
capillary bore, and that the arrangements were necessarily less perfect than i
determinations at higher temperatures. We consider, therefore, that we are justified in stating that the linear relatio
between molecular surface-energy and temperature holds for ether within a rang
of 240°; approximately for methyl formate, of 270°; and for ethyl acetate, of 290°
