Amaba eucumis (n. sp.).

Ameba cucumis was also met with in the cucumber soil, and it appeared in the
cultures of manure-agar plates associated with Vahlkampfia soli. It could be readily
distinguished from the Vahlkampfia form in life since it is a very sluggish form with
very characteristic pseudopodia. Dividing forms were most frequently found on

cultures three to four days old, and cysts were not frequent until the eighth or
ninth day. Active forms associated with cysts have, in fact, been met with in
cultures over a month old, though these forms were then of rather small size. In
young cultures the typical appearance seems to be an almost spherical form with
rather fine radiating pseudopodia composed almost entirely of ectoplasm. Frequently,
however, forms are met with in which a kind of wave of ectoplasm is thrown out.
As far as can be seen there is no definite contractile vacuole. This form is not nearly
such a typical devourer of bacteria as Vahlkampfia soli, since it not infrequently
ingests small flagellates, cysts, ete.

The cytoplasm has a tendency to take up stains rather deeply. The nucleus is
almost central, it consists in young cultures of a large, darkly staining karyosome
separated by a considerable space from a distinct membrane, and in this space small
particles, composed apparently of chromatin, lie, their presence being more noticeable
