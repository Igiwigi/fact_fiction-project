that in which I and 81/8P were determined.

At first it was intended to do this, but afterwards it was thought sufficient to use
a wire of the material (of length very great in comparison with its thickness) in both
parts of the experiment, thus assuming that the elongation of a long thin wire is the
same as that of an ellipsoid of revolution having the same dimensional ratio.t The
general agreement between the results of different experimenters, who in measuring
magnetic elongation have used wires, strips and ellipsoids of various shapes and
degrees of purity, shows that this is at least approximately the case.

It can also be proved independently that in a uniformly magnetised wire the
term }H pS
represents the elongation due to those stresses which arise in consequence of the fact
that magnetisation depends upon strain. For the potential energy, which unit
volume has in consequence of the magnetisation, is — SHI.{ Hence, if the body
has dilatations e, f, g, parallel to the axes of a, y, z, respectively, the part of the
Lagrangian Function depending on magnetisation and strain coordinates is (supposing
the quantities to vary infinitely slowly)

, which is generally by far the greatest on the right-hand side of (3),

* The symbol « is here used for the observed elongation of the specimen, i.e. the ratio of the observed
increase of length to the whole length.
