Hum-


AND METEOROLOGY OF DUKHUN. 167

BoLDT, on the authority of HorsBurGn, has been led into the expression of a belief
that they are masked or suspended on the western coast of India during the pre-
valence of the south-west monsoon. I am, however, enabled to state that this is
quite unfounded with respect to Dukhun, as they were never interrupted, even for a
single day, during six monsoons; and the same fact was observed at Kotgherry on
the Neelgherry mountains at 6407 feet above the sea during part of the monsoon of
1828, Of their occurrence on the coast I am also enabled to offer some evidence
from registers kept at the Engineer Institution in Bombay, and regularly trensmitted
to me; but the hours selected for observation, 9 noon and 3 p.m., were not exactly
adapted to fix the full amount of the tide; but on the whole the fact of their oc-
currence during the monsoon of 1829 in Bombay is undeniable; and they were
similarly remarked at Calcutta in 1822 by General Harpwicks, and by Mr. Prixszp
in 1829, 1830, and 1831. This fact will relieve HumBorpr from some of his diffi-
culties in his reasoning on the tides. With respect to the tides in general, I have to state that in many thousand obser-
vations made by myself there was not a solitary instance in which the barometer
was not higher at 9—10 a.m. than at sunrise, lower at 4—5 p.m. than at 9—10 a.m.,
whatever the indication of the thermometer or hygrometer might be: nor was there
a 80litary instance in the year 1830 in which the maximum night tide was not higher
than the 4—5 o'clock day tide, although it rarely, if ever, rose 80 high as the 9—10
A.M. day tide.
