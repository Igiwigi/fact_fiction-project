adopted it, as they did not cultivate cereals and would not have the knowledge with
which to prepare it as food. I understand, however, that in very recent years maize
has been grown in parts of south-east Papua, but here there has been strong British
influence.

A main difficulty Van Nouhuys then had was that he was not satisfied that the
tobacco cultivated by the Péségém and Timorini was N. tabacum. In the section on
‘The species of tobacco cultivated in New Guinea’ it is seen that this species is grown
by the Nogullo who live on the northern flanks of the Nassau range, and by the natives
of the Utakwa river who live up to 8075 ft. in the Nassau range, south of Carstensz
Top. So this difficulty no longer exists.

The fact revealed by Van Nouhuys that J. de Menezes wintered in Geelvink
bay in 1526-7 has already been referred to, and it is possible, though there is
no evidence for it, that smoking and tobacco growing were then taught to the
natives. At all events, as Van Nouhuys points out, Schouten found that tobacco
was smoked and cultivated in that area in 1616. The piteeapnes is that this tobacco
was N. tabacum.

T have here given all the information known to me concerning the early introduction
of tobacco into New Guinea. I have no desire to make guesses as to what may have
happened, and it does not seem probable that we shall ever be able to say definitely
when and how tobacco smoking and cultivation were established in the mountainous
regions of north-west New Guinea. This tobacco is certainly N. tabacum and must
