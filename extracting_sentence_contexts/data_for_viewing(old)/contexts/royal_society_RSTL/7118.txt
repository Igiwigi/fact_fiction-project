Nitrogen . . . 81-82

It is here observed that there has been a marked difference in the action of the two
bloods. The puff-adder poison seems to have accelerated the transformations and
decompositions upon which the absorption of oxygen and the exhalation of carbonic
acid by the blood depend. By placing the results in the form of a Table, this fact is
rendered still more apparent.
