Galago, Nycticebus, and Loris.â€”All the species examined, viz., Galago Garnetti,
G. Maholi, G. Monteiri, Loris nycticebus and Loris tardigradus, have black pigmented
dises with green margins. The fundus of these animals is a golden yellow of extra-
ordinary briilianey, like burnished gold, the peripheral area being composed of more
or less dense black moss-like patches of pigment, which frequently invade the retina
itself in the form of minute detached branches. This appearance strikingly resembles
the condition of the human Fundus oculi in the congenital disease known as Retinitis
pigmentosa, a fact which I shall refer to in detail on page 55. The brilliant orange-yellow colour, which we here meet with for the first time, will
be found peculiar to almost all Mammals of nocturnal habits. The brilliantly coloured zone surrounded by a heavily pigmented peripheral area,
and the invisibility of choroidal vessels, are indicative of the so-called Tapetum
lucidum, common to almost all the Carnivora.
