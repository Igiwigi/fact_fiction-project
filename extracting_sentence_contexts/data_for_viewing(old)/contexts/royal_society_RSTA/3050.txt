observable.’ Only relations between variables, not new entities. The philosophy is not to inflate
ontology: it is to rarefy it.

Felix Bloch reports an enlightening conversation with Heisenberg [11]: ‘We were on a walk
and somehow began to talk about space. I had just read Weyl’s book Space, Time and Matter,


and under its influence was proud to declare that space was simply the field of linear operations. 3 |
‘Nonsense,’ said Heisenberg, ‘space is blue and birds fly through it.’ This may sound naive, but I

knew him well enough by that time to fully understand the rebuke. What he meant was that “3
it was dangerous for a physicist to describe Nature in terms of idealized abstractions too far 78
removed from the evidence of actual observation. In fact, it was just by avoiding this danger in :<
the previous description of atomic phenomena that he was able to arrive at his great creation of : Zs
QM. In celebrating the 15th anniversary of this achievement, we are vastly indebted to the men 1g

who brought it about: not only for having provided us with a most powerful tool but also, and
even more significant, for a deeper insight into our conception of reality.’

What is thus this ‘deeper insight into our conception of reality’ that allowed Heisenberg to find
the equations of QM, and that has no major use of the quantum state y?
