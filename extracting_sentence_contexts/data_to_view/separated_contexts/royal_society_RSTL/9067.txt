Two land birds, both
peculiar, are common in the Tristan group, and they possess a water hen, which has
a representative in Africa and $. America. T am not aware whether land birds
are found in Amsterdam TIsland ; if 80, they may help to account for the wonderful
fact of the Tristan 1'Acunha Phylica and Sparting being found also in it, though
separated by 3,000 miles of ocean. In conclusion, T have to state that no trace of the mountain flora of S. Africa
has been found in any of the southern groups of islands.
