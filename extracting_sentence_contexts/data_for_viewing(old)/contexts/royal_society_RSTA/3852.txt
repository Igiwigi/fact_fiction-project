The existence of quantized orbital angular momentum at the single-photon level was
beautifully demonstrated by Zeilinger and co-workers who measured the angular momentum



(or more precisely the phase vortices) for pairs of entangled photons generated in spontaneous
parametric down-conversion [36]. This results from the conservation of angular momentum in
the conversion of a single pump-beam photon to the signal and idler photons. The sum is fixed
in this way but the orbital angular momenta of the individual photons are not, so the resulting
superposition is an angular-momentum entangled state [37]. This advance has provided a new
avenue for exploring entanglement in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces [38].

The high dimensionality of the orbital angular momentum state space contrasts with the fact
that there are only two orthogonal polarization or spin angular momentum states. This suggests
the use of orbital angular momentum for information processing and communication tasks.
Padgett and co-workers demonstrated the use of orbital angular momentum as a key component
in a free-space communication link in which eight different orbital angular momentum beams
could co-propagate along the same optical path and then be separated by the receiver [39]. This

was followed by further studies of orbital angular momentum mediated communications, both : =
in free space and in optical fibres and also in the optical region of the spectrum and at longer : S
wavelengths. 2

Orbital angular momentum has an important influence in imaging, where shaping the point aed
spread function of the imaging system leads to new possibilities in image processing, both in 22
