The error introduced in the
determination of the specific volume of the clays under the experimental conditions,
due to limitations in the accuracy of the instruments used, is about 10‘, this being caused
by errors of 0-1 mg in the weighings and 0-05° C in reading the temperature in the
thermostat, these two sources of error being about equal. The only large sources of
error are loss of clay from the bottles during wetting under vacuum, entrapping of air,
and loss of liquid by evaporation between taking the bottle out of the thermostat and
weighing it. Each of these three sources of error will make the specific volume of the
clay appear too large, and as a matter of fact no case has yet arisen where the specific
volume appeared to be obviously too low. Duplicate determinations were not made
together, and everything possible was done to make the maximum amount of systematic
error occur as random error between duplicates. From a study of the actual deviations
between 400 duplicate determinations of the specific volume of the clays available,
only 43% had divergences less than 2-5 x 10°‘, in 25% it was between 2-5-5-0 x 10°,
in 12% between 5-10 x 10-4, and in 20% it exceeded 10°%.
