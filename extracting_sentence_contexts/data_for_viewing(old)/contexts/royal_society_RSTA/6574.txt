and I, therefore, am justified in assuming that the negative rotations in M. THorr’s
apparatus will equally well be explained by the same theory.

ADDENDUM.

Isent M. Tore a detailed account of my experiments, asking him to favour me
with any comments or remarks he might wish to make, and offering to communicate
them, if desirable, to the Royal Society. I have just received a long communication,
partly printed and part in MS., in which he describes many fresh experiments, and
adduces arguments to show that my dynamical explanation is not sufficient to account
for more than a few of the facts he describes, and saying that he “ persists in still
believing that this force emanates from the observer, or else that the observer is the
indispensable intermediary for its manifestation.”

The experiments are numerous, and are devised with great ingenuity. It is
impossible in the space of a brief abstract to do more than refer to a few of the
principal facts here brought forward. M. Tuore commences by objecting to my
having experimented in an enclosed space, saying that he always operates in free air.
He thinks that enclosure may almost or quite suppress his force. To this I can reply
that I have myself verified nearly all M. THorn’s facts of rotation (including those
just now communicated) when working in the free air of a large room, and it was only
when I found the delicacy of the observations was impeded by draughts and currents
that I put screens round the apparatus. I have not found glass screens interfere
