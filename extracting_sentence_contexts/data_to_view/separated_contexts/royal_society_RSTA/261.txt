AN EXTENSIONAL EXAMPLE

35. Our last example concerns extensional stresses due to specified edge tensions,
a problem of the class to which photo-elastic methods are most commonly applied (§ 1). It has in fact been so treated by Coker and Filon (1931, § 7-06). METHODS APPLIED TO ENGINEERING PROBLEMS 449

Figure 21 records the dimensions of the B.S.I. standard ‘briquette’ for the testing
of cement, with an indication (shaded) of the ‘jaws’ by which tensile loading is applied. The waisted form is intended to ensure fracture across the minimum section, and (on
the ground that in this neighbourhood the boundary is not stressed) a definite stress-
system is assumed to obtain at the waist, notwithstanding that the applied tractions are
not known with great precision.
