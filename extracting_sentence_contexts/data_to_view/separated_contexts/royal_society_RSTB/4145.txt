The series of skulls figured in Plate 1 shows the gradual
outgrowth of two processes from the anterior edge of the periotic, which meet and
fuse with each other and with the ala pterotica mastoidea, of VAN BEMMELEN, and
grow forward to acquire a connection with the orbitosphenoid, the temporal wing,
and the process growing down to it from the orbital wing of the palatine, and the
ala temporalis. Comparison of this description of Echidna with the criticisms of VAN BEMMELEN’S
description of the Ornithorhynchus skull on p. 336 and the detailed description of
Specimen 8 of Ornithorhynchus shows that the two living monotremes agree in that
the sphenoparietal fissure is not closed by an ossification of the ala temporalis, that
is an alisphenoid, but by the gradual growth forward of an ossification which is
always continuous with the anterior ossification of the otic capsule, and only very
late in life acquires any connection with the ala temporalis. This fact, which is obvious in presence of suitable material such as that figured
5 from untouched photographs of Echidna skulls in Plate 1, is of fundamental
= importance in any discussion of the homologies of the bones of the monotreme skull,
& but seems to have escaped the attention of all previous authors, with the partial
2 exception of Prof. Gaurr.

2 VIIA. Discussion of THE Otro CarsuLE oF MoNoTREMES.

a It is now necessary to discuss the homology of the anterior process of the periotic.

a Such discussion divides itself into two parts: (1) Are the processes in Echidna and

g Ornithorhynchus the same? and (2) what do they correspond to in Reptiles and

3 later mammals ?

3 It will be remembered that when describing the anterior process of the periotic

5 in Specimen B I pointed out its relationship to the vena capitis lateralis, the

6 superficial temporal artery, and the seventh nerve, and that it directly continued the

1 line of the crista parotica, or rather of its processus perioticus superior.
