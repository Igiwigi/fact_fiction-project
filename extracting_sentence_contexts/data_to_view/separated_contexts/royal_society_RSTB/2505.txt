A very strong argument against the validity of SrrasBuRGER’s interpretation of
this and similar cases is that it takes no account of the facts of development, and
makes the same sheath in the upper part of the stem a true phloeoterma, and in its
lower, presumably more primitive and typical region, a mere histological layer of no
morphological importance. It further offers no explanation of the fact that, even in
the case of the adult, the layer which he regards as the phloeoterma is not continuous,
but passes inwards on the flanks of the bundles. It seems difficult to retain a
morphological hypothesis which is so obviously in opposition to the facts of develop-
ment. The above reasoning in regard to the endodermis is obviously not affected by
the question as to whether this layer is in all cases really the innermost stratum
(Phleeoterma) of the cortex, because if it be not the most internal layer of the funda-
mental tissue, then, @ fortiori, it follows that everything outside is cortical tissue. Asa result of developmental study recorded in an earlier memoir, as illustrated
in the above example, the writer has come to the conclusion that in the Angiosperms
the pith is to be regarded as always belonging to the fundamental tissue, and that
as a consequence VAN TIEGHEM’s hypothesis of medullated monostely cannot be
maintained.
