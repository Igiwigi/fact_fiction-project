cut the surface at widely spaced intervals from 14° at a mid-lake position to 7° at the
windward end. Table 1 gives further proof that the water, at that time lying at the surface
at the windward end, was in fact hypolimnion water which had welled up to replace the
original epilimnion totally removed by the wind. While it is not the purpose of this paper to
discuss this phenomenon in detail, it may be pointed out that when bottom and intermediate
water has been forced to the surface it will become incorporated in the rapid surface drift,
if the wind continues long enough, and so mix into the epilimnion, which will consequently
