collision, then ib must happen that while the change is proceeding a number of steam
molecules strike the sides of the yessel. Now a vapour diffused through a gaseous
mixture is condensed to a liquid by a cool surface when the pressure of the vapour in
the mixture is greater than the tension exerted by the liquid at the temperature of
the cool surface. On the contrary, when the 8urface is at 8uch a temperature that a
liquid film upon it exerts a tension greater than the pressure of the vapour of that
liquid present in the atmosphere in contact with it, the liquid volatilizes from the
gurface, Under the latter conditions no vapour would be condensed from a gaseous
mixture. For a surface at a given temperature, condensation depends upon the
tension of the vapour in the mixture, and for a given tension of the vapour, condensa-
tion depends on the temperature of the surface.

These facts permit the question to be readily tested by experiment. In the first
series of temperature experiments, if 37 be taken as the constant coefficient at bigh
temperatures, then in the last experiment the tension of the steam formed by the
unimpeded reaction would be 162 millims. at 60% A+ this temperature the tension
exerted by a film of water is about 150 millims. During the'explosion, therefore, the
8ides of the vessel might condense a small quantity of steam, and the coefficient might
in consequence be slightly raised. In the previous experiment at 40*, the tension of
steam formed by the unimpeded reaction would 8till be 162 millims. at 40*; but at
this temperature the tension exerted by a film of water is only 55 millims. So that
a considerable condensation might take place, and the coefficient be considerably
raiged. At lower temperatures the effect would be greater still. In the same way, if
3'7 be taken as the constant coefficient in the second series of temperature experi-
ments, then in the second, third, fourth, and fifth experiments the tension of steam
