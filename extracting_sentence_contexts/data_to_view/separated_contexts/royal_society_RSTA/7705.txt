N, is the critical electron density which has to be attained in the ionosphere
in order to produce reflexion of the extraordinary wave. Corresponding remarks apply
to the ordinary wave. The symmetry of the curves in fig. 6 about the N-axis expresses the
fact that the quartic (6) for q is actually a quadratic for q°.

equations as in the case when # = 0, we again obtain a quartic equation for g, which,
however, is no longer simply a quadratic for q?: as we shall see explicitly in § 7, the equation
is of the form
