Comparing these mean results with those in the preceding
table of maxima, we find the times in general earlier : the
observations are however much too limited to point out a
very correct mean in either case.

After having made these observations I entirely removed
the magnets, and found that the needle made thirty-eight
vibrations in one hundred seconds, so that its directive power
continued nearly the same as at the commencement.

For the purpose of exhibiting at one view the facts pointed
out by these observations, I have, in the following diagram,
CPI. XX1V.7 placed the deviations as ordinates to a curve, the
distances between them representing the intervals of time.
The axis of the curve corresponding to zero, the westerly, or
plus deviations, are measured to the right, and the easterly,
or minus deviations, to the left. The days on which the obser-
vations were made are placed over the respective curves, and
