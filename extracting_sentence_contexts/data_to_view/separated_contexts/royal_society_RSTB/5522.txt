According to Darwiy, * species
are multiplied and genera are formed ” by the application of the principle of “ Divergence
of Character,” while his reference to the opposite principle is only a passing one. Brra
(1926), on the other hand, says, “ Darwin represents evolution as a process of
divergence of characters. As a matter of fact, predominative importance belongs to
convergence of characters.” There is hardly any doubt that since Darwiy’s time
extensive study of characters has shown that quite a number of apparently homogeneous
genera and families are in reality polyphyletic in origin. Thus, in evaluating the
relative importance of characters the problem of the morphologist has become very
complicated indeed. In fact, a certain number of biologists have given up all ideas of
useful adaptation and explain the variations or divergence in characters as due to some
innate tendencies of heredity. ‘

“ Divergence of Character” is a simple principle. for there is no doubt that as a
general rule “ the more diversified in structure the descendants from any one species can
be rendered, the more places they will be enabled to seize on, and the more their
modified progeny will increase’ (DARwiy).
