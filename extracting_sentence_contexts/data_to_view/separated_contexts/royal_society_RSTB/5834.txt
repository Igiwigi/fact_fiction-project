The fact that so many metamorphosed
in the tow-net, as recorded by WoLrEREcK, is strong evidence that contact stimulus
is a natural condition for the metamorphosis to take place. Possibly in the sea Poly-
gordius larvee do not change into worms until they touch the bottom. Therefore the
fact that S6pERsTR6w’s larve in his stirring jar did not metamorphose is not surprising
and is no argument against the naturalness of cataclysmic metamorphosis. There remains S6pERsTROM’s own theory of the course of the normal Polygordius
metamorphosis to be mentioned. This he conceived as a gradual transformation process
and he gives figures (1924, a, figs. 15-18) of what he believes to be stages in this process.
