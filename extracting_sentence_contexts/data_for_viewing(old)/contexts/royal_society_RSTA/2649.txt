the role of the exsolved gas phase in modifying the physical properties of the magma reservoir,
reviewed by Segall [73].

Post-eruptive subsidence can be linked to a viscoelastic response associated with a ductile
region of melt-bearing crust [229-232]. The deformation consequences of a viscoelastic aureole
surrounding a spherical magma chamber can be modelled [73]. This scenario might correspond
to the case where magma is intruded and heats the surrounding country rock, or when magma
intrudes (or leaves, during explosive eruption) a mushy region of the crust. Interestingly, the
post-eruption inflation may occur (without recharge) if the magma is volatile-free or volatile-
poor (i.e. incompressible); this result holds for both oblate and prolate geometries. If the magma
is sufficiently compressible, post-eruptive deformation will be deflation. These models raise the
possibility of reconciling petrological inferences related to pressure changes with observations
of deformation. In fact, the timescales derived from diffusion studies described in ยง5 have been
linked directly to the occurrence of earthquake swarms and deformation prior to, and during,
eruptions [162,165,233,234]. These correlations show that the monitoring signals are linked
to significant pressure and/or temperature perturbations, such as those expected for magma
movement and/or mixing in shallow crustal reservoirs.

Gas emissions during and between eruptions also hold a clue to processes occurring in
crustal magma reservoirs. Some volcanoes exhibit strong correlations between the mass of


erupted magma and the mass flux of SQ (e.g. Kilauea; [235]), suggesting that degassing
occurs in a shallow reservoir and that gas is advected by the magma to the surface, making
the SO flux a good proxy for eruption rate. In other settings, however, the patterns of gas
