One of the keys to constructing such a theory that includes an RET theory of rarefied : S
gases as a special case in the rarefied-gas limit is the duality principle introduced in [31], which : 3

indicates a possible way of passage from a theory of rarefied gases to a theory of moderately
dense gases. In some polyatomic gases, such as H2 gas and CO? gas [32,33], the dynamic pressure may play
an essential role in nonequilibrium phenomena, for an example, the formation of shock wave
structure [34], but the shear stress and the heat flux are negligibly small. This is due to the fact
that the relaxation time of the dynamic pressure is much larger than the other relaxation times
of the shear stress and of the heat flux in a polyatomic gas. In the preliminary works in RET of
dense gases [31,35,36], the case where all the dissipative fluxes except for the dynamic pressure
are negligible was studied in detail in order to highlight the importance of the dynamic pressure. This is the RET theory of dense gases with six fields (ETP) that takes into account one relaxation
process with the assumption that molecular rotation and vibration can be treated as a unit.
