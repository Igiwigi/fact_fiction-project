In my firs: communication on the s8pinal cord, I stated that the posterior roots of the
spinal nerves are attached exclusively to the posterior white columns. T have since
found that the same assertion was made by RoLaxD0: he says, © tutti i fili nervosi delle
radici posteriori 8 staccano esclusivamente dai cordoni posteriori del gran funicolo spi-
nale; cio che puo essere comprovato in yarie e differenti maniere#*.” S7T111x6 denies
the fact, and maintains that in the lumbar region a few fibres traverse the posterior part
of the antero-lateral column. I have again carefully gone over the ground, in the cord
both of Man and different animals, and find that my statement is correct. ST1L11NG has
probably confounded nerve-fibres with the blood-yessels which traverse the posterior part
of the antero-lateral column much in the way that he represents.
