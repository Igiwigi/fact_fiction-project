But the
effect which is produced upon the experimental helix is not proportionate to the
whole amount of these currents, but to the maximum intensities to which they rise. When the core moves slowly, this intensity is small ; when it moves rapidly, it is
great, and necessarily 80, for the same current of electricity has to travel in the two
differing periods of time occupied by the journeys. Hence the quickly moving core
should produce a far higher effect on the experimental helix than the slowly moving
core; and this also I found to be the fact.

2683. The $hort copper core was adjusted to the apparatus, and the machine
worked with its average velocity until forty journeys to and from had been completed ;
the galvanometer needle passed 39? west.
