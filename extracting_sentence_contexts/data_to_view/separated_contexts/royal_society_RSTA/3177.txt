C, Experiments with Copper Oxide. It had been our intention at the outset of the research to study the catalytic action
of copper, as well as that of its oxide, on electrolytic gas. All attempts to obtain
reliable velocity measurements in the case of the metal were, however, frustrated by
the fact that at even the lowest temperature, where there was any marked action
on the gases, the formation of steam was always accompanied by an independent
oxidation of the surface, at least during the initial stages of an experiment. Nevertheless, it will be necessary to refer to one experiment with copper gauze,
since the same gauze, thoroughly oxidised, was employed in the two following series
of experiments. The experiment with the reduced gauze is, for purposes of comparison,
included in the first series.
