KBOs appear to have a wide range of relative ice
compositions from almost pure rock to almost pure ice with smaller objects tending to have lower
densities, suggesting they are more ice-rich [97]. For example, a large object such as Pluto has a
relatively high rock:ice ratio of approximately 3 : 1 [98]. Recent observations and modelling show
that a rock fraction of approximately 0.7 can in fact fits many of these objects, with variations in
porosity explaining the density-size trend rather than variations in ice content [99]. If Neptune
were formed from such objects the interior would be rock-dominated and have a much lower
O/H enrichment, perhaps around 30-130 times solar. A lower O/H enrichment would also be
more consistent with the 50-100 C/H enrichment, assuming typical Neptune formation scenarios,
except those in which the heavy elements derive from clathrate hydrates (e.g. [100]).
