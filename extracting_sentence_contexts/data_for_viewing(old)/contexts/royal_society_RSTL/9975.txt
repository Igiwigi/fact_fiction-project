ontwards of the side walls of the head (Plate 55, figs. 17, 18; Plate 56, fig. 23;
Plate 57, figs. 29 and 31), leaving a gap leading towards the dorsal part of the hyo-

Q mandibular cleft (region of membrana tympani). The growth outwards of the wall of
A the head incloses a median thickening, which contains the ventrally curved extremity
S of the mandibular cartilage (Plate 55, fig. 18); the dorsal region of this growth becomes
= bent upon itself, forming a fold of the integument, which unfolding after birth becomes
= the long dorally directed pinna of the Rodents (Plate 57, fig. 31).
J The anditory vesicle, after it has been shut off from the external epiblast, has an
S oval form (Plate 54, figs. 2 and 3), and is situated between the hind brain and the
8 external epiblast. Ventrad of the vesicles runs the seventh nerve, the primitive
2 jugular vein and dorsal aorta. The ganglion acusticum and auditory epitheliam are
B very intimately connected, a fact already noticed by BALrouR and MARSHALL (Plate
= 54, fig. 2; and Plate 55, fig. 17). The ganglion has two well marked divisions, corre-
'5 8ponding to the cochlear and vestibular portions of the nerve (Plate 54, fig. 9; Plate
2 559, fig. 18; and Plate 56, fig. 23), although in embryoes near the period of birth i is
2 s8ingle (Plate 57, fig. 32).
X In &lightly older embryoes the vesicle has undergone the ordinary Mammalian
S complications (Plate 55, fig. 17 ; and Plate 56, figs. 20 and 23) ; the ventral end of the
vesicle pagses inwards towards the base of the skull, forming the canalis cochlearis and
S acculus hemisphericus; in the hollow of the canal lies the ganglion acusticum ; from
â€” the dorsal end of the vesicle, on the side nearest the brain cavity, there passes off an
VY elongated diverticulum, the recessus labyrinthi, external to which, and running for
= 8ome distance parallel with it, lies the superior semicircular canal.
5 The external semicircular canal passes from the vestibular cavity outwards, dorsad of
