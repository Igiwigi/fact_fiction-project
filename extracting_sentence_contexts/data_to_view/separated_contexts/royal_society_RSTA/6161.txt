22R¢f accounts for depletion in the susceptible population as a result of infection-induced immunity.

Figure 4. Time variation in reproduction number. (a) The inferred value of the reproduction number R; as a function of time
(solid red line gives posterior mean and dashed lines indicate the 95% credible interval). This is proportional to the overall
effective contact rate (see equation (2.3)). (b) The effective reproduction number Re (which accounts for the fact that a fraction
of the population is not susceptible). Above/below the horizontal black line shows where COVID-19 is increasing/decreasing. The
vertical blue lines denote important milestones during the epidemic [31].
