However, as commented above, there is still a lack of clarity on
research bottlenecks and effective impact. It is thus necessary from the scientific perspective to
increase effort not only to develop new scientific routes but also to effectively assess the issues
in moving from idea to innovation. In fact, only when enough critical mass of research effort
is dedicated to the topic of CO2 utilization will it be possible to translate to fact the technology
roadmap tentatively identified in figure 5. A combination of public and private funds is necessary
to reach this goal. From this perspective, it is important to mention that the cited SPIRE initiative
[85] is a public-private partnership, which has seen CO) utilization as one of the pillars to move
to a sustainable, but competitive, future for the chemical industry.

(c) An analysis of emerging patent areas in relation to the technology roadmap

In order to complete the analysis of the technology roadmap in CO) utilization technologies,
it is useful to analyse briefly the emerging patent literature trends, limited to the last 5 years
(2008-2013) and patents in English.
