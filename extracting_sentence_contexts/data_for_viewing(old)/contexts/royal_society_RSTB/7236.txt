variance methods used in the present paper.

359. Thirdly, he discussed the effect of correlation between adjoining plots on what
has been called the variance function. He noted that ‘since the regression of variance on
plot size is a function of the correlation of adjacent areas, it appears theoretically inevitable
that the shape of plot should have some effect, since the correlation of ends of long narrow
strips must usually be less than that at the opposite sides of a square of equal area. . .it
might be worth while to make use of two b-coefficients [which we call g-coefficients] with
assigned directions to describe the heterogeneity’ (p. 22).

360. Fairfield Smith refers to two papers of J. A. Harris (1914, 1920) in which he had
demonstrated that ‘a hypothesis of zero correlation between adjacent areas cannot be
regarded as probable’ (p. 2). In fact, Harris appears to have proposed using the intra-class
correlation coefficient of yields from adjacent areas as a coefficient of heterogeneity (p. 3).

361. It would be seen that the basic ideas underlying Fairfield Smith’s work are similar
to those adopted in the present paper, although the actual spheres of application are
widely different. But here again the work was done independently. Although Smith’s
paper had been received for publication in December 1936 it was actually published in

January 1938 and reached India several months later. In the meantime, working on a
widely different problem, namely, estimating the acreage under the jute crop in Bengal,
