Future perspectives

The experiments and the proposals described in the previous section are mainly focused on the
applications of quantum communications in space for secure communications over long distances
or for implementing standard quantum protocols or realizing fundamental-like tests in the new
space scenario. Of course, testing the validity limits of a physical theory is of extraordinary
importance, as each theory is valid only within the limits in which it has been experimentally
confirmed. However, we want to stress the fact that space represents an incredible resource for realizing
new experiments aimed at highlighting some physical effects, for example, the ones due to
gravity, that are highly challenging, if not impossible, to detect staying on the Earth. In particular,
quantum optics technologies, and their availability and robustness even in the hostile space
environment, provide long-distance photon propagation as a exploitable tool to investigate one
of the biggest puzzles in modern physics, that is, the interplay between gravitation and quantum
mechanics. For example, in the review by Rideout et al. [1], a collection of experiments of increasing
difficulties and ambitions are reported.
