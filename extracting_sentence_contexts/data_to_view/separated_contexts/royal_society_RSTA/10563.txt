There is no discontinuous or sudden change occurring at this point
that is indicated either in the outward physical state or in the density of the water,
nor do we see any connection between the curious anomaly in the density curve at
4° C. and the specific heat at that point. It is evident we have to do here with a
new, and as yet unexplained, phenomenon. The ideas advanced by Row1anp in this connection are not, it seems to me,
altogether correct when he says :—‘“ However remarkable the fact may be, being the
first instance of the decrease of the specific heat with rise of temperature, it is no
more remarkable than the contraction of water to 4°. Indeed, in both cases the
water hardly seems to have recovered from freezing. The specific heat of melting
ice is infinite.
