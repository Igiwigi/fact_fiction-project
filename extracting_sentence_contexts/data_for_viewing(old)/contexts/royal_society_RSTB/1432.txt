NIZATION OF THE FOSSIL PLANTS OF THE COAL-~MEASURRS. 935

rom the upper surface of the coherent dise near the axil. The extent to
adhere to the surface of the disc varies greatly ; in some cases they
e at once; in others they do not become wholly free until the point is
ere the bracts themselves begin to separate from one another.* | It does
, however, that there was ever more than a single verticil of sporangio-
mging to each verticil of bracts; appearances to the contrary seem to be
varying degree of adhesion between the two organs (Plate 85, fig. 54).
rse section of the strobilus may show one or two circles of sporangia
Â» whorls of bracts ; sometimes even a part of a third circle is present.
riations are observable in tangential sections. These differences can only
ed by the fact that the sporangiophores overlap each other, so as to bring
ngia to different levels. Where additional sporangia appear within the
rnode, their position is both exterior and superior to those of the first circle
6, photographs 25 and 26, and compare with the figures in WILLTAMSON,
SII.). Hence the longer pedicels must have passed to the outside of the
borne on the shorter ones, as is often well shown both in transverse and
i sections.t
ger sporangiophores considerably exceed an internode in length, for we find
elonging to two successive verticils of bracts appearing in the same trans-

angiophores follow the upward curvation of the bracts, keeping at a little
from their superior surface. Each bears at its end a single sporangium,
attached in a very characteristic manner. The pedicel bends inwards at its
