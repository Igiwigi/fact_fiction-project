Virtually, Sarnt-VENANT’s semi-inverse method has been used in all the three cases. Frequent applications have also been made of his “ principle of the elastic equivalence
of statically equipollent systems of load.” IIl—Cyuinper Supjectep To A Unrrorm Tension T

7—Comparison with experimental results

Various authors have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced
in a wire is not always proportional to the stretching force even when we remain

within the limits of perfect elasticity. GrrstNer* assumed an empirical relation
of the form
