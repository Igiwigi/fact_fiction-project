Michael Brecht 1. Introduction

e-mail: michael.brecht@bccn-berlin.de We might rub and scratch or laugh and wriggle in response to ticklish sen-
sations. In fact, ticklishness describes two very different percepts: one follows
touch that is light and feathery, like a spider crawling upon oneâ€™s skin
(termed knismesis), the other touch that is heavy and rhythmic, and commonly
associated with playful and interactive behaviour (termed gargalesis; [1]). While knismesis is readily elicited on any part of the body, and may be self-
evoked, gargalesis is invariably more intricate. It occurs only in response to
touch at certain parts of the body, is dependent on mood and context and gen-
erally not evocable through self-touch [2].
