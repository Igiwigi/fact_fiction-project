under the assumption that the initial vorticity satisfies a reflection symmetry. For analytic initial
data, local-in-time existence of analytic solutions was proved by Sulem-Sulem-Bardos-Frisch [4].

The singularity formation was conjectured by Birkhoff—Fisher and Birkhoff [20,21]. For analytic
initial data, the possibility that the curvature may blow up in finite time was supported by
asymptotic analysis of Moore [22] and also verified by numerical simulations by Krasny and
Meiron-Baker—Orszag in [23,24]. Note that the system (1.1) and (1.2) is known to be ill-posed in
H® for s> 3 [25]. For more comprehensive discussion on the well-posedness theory, we refer to
[3,26,27].

(a) Steady solutions of the vortex sheet

There are very few known examples of nontrivial steady solutions, and in fact, other than the
circle or the line, the list only comprises the segment of length 2a and density

y(x)=2Vae—x2, xe [-a,a], (1.4)

which is a rotating solution with angular velocity @ [28] and the family found by Protas—Sakajo
[29], made out of segments rotating about a common centre of rotation with endpoints at the
vertices of a regular polygon. We remark that none of these are supported on a closed curve.

Numerically, O’Neil [30,31] used point vortices to approximate the vortex sheet and compute
uniformly rotating solutions and Elling [32] constructed numerically self-similar vortex sheets
forming cusps. O’Neil [33,34] also found numerically steady solutions which are combinations of
point vortices and vortex sheets.
