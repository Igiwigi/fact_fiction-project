In all cases we read
a lesson with which zoologists have already made us familiar in many other chapters
of animal life, viz., the economy practised in the workshop of evolution, how old struc-
tures become adapted to perform new functions. Where no adaptation takes place
the tendency is for these old structures to retrograde or vanish. The fertility of
resource in the adaptation is shown by the fact that both radial and basal structures
could be transformed into a central columella. The new requirement on the part of
the coral polyp was apparently always one and the same, and it was attained by the
simple means of a central support in the visceral chamber. Before we consider what
the new requirement was, it is important to note that the different skeletal modi-
fications to produce a columella must have been in every case associated with a
change of shape in the skeletal support of the polypâ€™s visceral chamber.
