456 MR. BE. J. REED ON THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF

building,” where he refers to the results of a series of experiments on the endurance of
iron-jointed beams when subjected to changes in the loads put upon them. He says
« the joints of an iron-rivetted beam sustained upwards of three million changes of one
fourth the weight that would break it, without. any apparent injury to its ultimate
powers of resistance. Tt broke, however, with 313,000 additional changes when loaded
to one third the breaking-weight, evidently showing that the construction is not safe when
tested with alternate changes of a load equivalent to one third the weight that would
break it.” In the case of ships, however, Mr. FARBAIRN thinks the strain brought upon
the material should not exceed one fourth or one fifth its ultimate strength, on account of
the fact that the changes of strain are not merely effective as regards its amount, but
also as regards its direction. His final conclusion is that in iron ships * it seems highly
probable that a strain of 5 tons per square inch on the material acting alternately in
opposite directions would at least injure, if it did not ultimately fracture, the material
after a great number of alterations.” Professor RANKINE, I may add, also considers that;
the strain on the material in iron ships should not exceed one fifth of the ultimate
strength, and thus provides for the changes of strain of which I have been speaking.

It has sometimes been taken for granted, by writers on this subject, that while the
straining-actions in 8mooth water become greater as the figure of the yessel becomes
finer and sharper, the additional straining-actions produced by waves become less, and
that these two opposite changes in a rough way compensate for each other. This con-
clusion is based, however, upon hypothetical cases, and not upon actual ships. On
