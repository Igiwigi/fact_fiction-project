1. The posterior boundary of the pre-frontal lobe was determined in each case by
electrical stimulation, and the non-excitable portion of this lobe only removed. Our recent researches have not added anything to the facts already known in
connexion with the functions of this area. 2. In a case in which both frontal lobes were removed in front of the pre-central
sulcus, certain phenomena were observed which had not been previously noted in
experiments upon this region.
