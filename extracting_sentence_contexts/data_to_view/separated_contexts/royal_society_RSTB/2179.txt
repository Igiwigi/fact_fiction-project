The “Hemmung” processes are, I believe, more
marked in some animals than in others, and vary with the condition of the cortex. If
dogs be left quiet for an hour, after the completion of the operation, then the cortical
reactions are far more uniformly obtained. A partial explanation of the confliction
of evidence concerning the excitability of the anemic dog's cortex may be found in
this fact. Moreover some workers may by operative methods cause greater loss of
blood and depression of the vaso-motor centre than others, and thus influence the
results obtained on ligation of the cerebral arteries. EXPERIMENTAL REsuLts.
