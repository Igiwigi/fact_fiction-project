RODGER ON THE RELATIONS

correction, whieh also included a small scale error, to the distance between the
scales. The variation in length of the manometer between the mean and extreme
Lempernbires of the lyberatory say be neglected. The true length of the water
columy on a stale coreect at 4", haying the temperature of the atmosphere, coulll
tins be got with ease. ‘To express this as « head of water at the temperature of 4°)
advuntuge woe taken of the fact thot when the same two scales were tsed the pres-
sure Lead was olrnost the same, and thus the correction of the lead for change tty
density of the water depeciled only on the temperature, A table was theretore cm-
structed from whieh lip inspevtion the eorrection ta be applied to the head at any
Leraperature in order to give the leight of a colamn of unit density could be obtained,
In order to fixed the mean effective pressape, two corrections lave to be applied to
this head of water.

tL, Correction for Luequalities iv the Atnospheria Pressuve on the Liquid Suvfaces
in the Monometer and Ohsehrometer—A head of air, assumed to haye the mean
atmospheric temperature and pressure, wil having w beight equal to the difference
between the ypper level of liquid in the manometer aud the mean leyel of liquid Dy
the ylisuhrometer, opposes the Hosy of liquid throngl the capillary, Acting in the
game direction is & Lead of wir leaving the ntinogspherie temperubure and © pressure
eqnul to that of the atmosphere plus that indicated by the manometer, and having a
height equid to Lhe difference in lewel of the Inwer liquid surfaee of the manometer
aud the mean liqnid level io the glisehrometer, The mein valae of this correction
for Le ortor seqles wae U-17 centim. of water wt 4°: for the winer sealus the correction
was O19 sentim. These yalues an nob appreviably atfveted by changes in atmospheric density, and
were theneline applied once sud forall as Corrections to the distance between the scales,

4. Convention for Ohonge af Llead of Liquid in the (Hiselirometer,—Tlis correction,
which is heeded to eliminate the effeet of the alteration in the heads of ligaid in
the two lirahs, is hy far the more dificult to ascertain.
