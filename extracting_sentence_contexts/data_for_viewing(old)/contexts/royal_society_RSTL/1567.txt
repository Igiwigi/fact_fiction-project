on the calculation of PeTavivs respecting this very eclips?,
observes © i] ignoroit que /e moindre raion, qui commence a

remarkable expression of HenopoTus, who says Ty mtg»

passage which has been ignorantly censured by some of his
commentators.

It appears to me, that an' inattention to these singular facts
has been the principal cause of the various opinions that have
arisen respecting the time when this eclipse happened. For
each chronologist, having a system of his own to support, has
satisfied' himself merely with ascertaining that a'solar eclipse
did take place' in the year that he had assigned for it; and
which'eclipse he supposed might be visible in that part of the
world” bordering on the two hostile countries : but without
taking” into his account the magnitude of the eclipse' at the
place where'the battle'is/supposed to have been fought. Now
