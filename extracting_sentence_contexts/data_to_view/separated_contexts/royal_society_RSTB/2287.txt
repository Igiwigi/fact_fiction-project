The following is a typical example of the results so obtained :—

* The case in fact would be analogous to STEFAN’S evaporation problem reversed, when the partial
pressure p’ of the vapour at the surface of the liquid is not at its maximum for the temperature and
pressure of the experiment, and its true value is unknown. All other conditions being the same, we
shovld still expect the value of M to vary with the diameters of the discs, but the value of & would not be
determinable.

+ It is desirable to smear the edge of the tube with a trace of vaseline to prevent creeping of the
solution and efflorescence of the soda,

It is seen from the last two columns:that the amounts of CO, absorbed in equal
times are almost exactly proportional to the mean ratios of the diameters and areas. The same result is also shown by the following two experiments :—

If the air above the discs were in very slight movement, it would tend to produce
exactly the effects observed ; that is to say, we should expect under these conditions
to find the ratios of absorption of the carbon dioxide falling somewhere intermediate
between the ratios of the areas and those of the diameters.
