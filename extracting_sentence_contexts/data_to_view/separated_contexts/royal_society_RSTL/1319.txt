Now, s/phuret of potash produces sulphuretted hydrogene
by the action of an acid; and if the sulphur had not contained
oxygene, the hydrogene evolved by the action of the potas-
sium in both these experiments ought to have equalled at least
two cubical inches, and the whole quantity of sulphuretted
hydrogene ought to have been more: and that 80 much less
$ulphuretted hydrogene was evolved in the second experiment,
can only be ascribed to the larger quantity of oxygene fur-
nished to the potassium by the larger quantity of the sulphur. I have made several experiments of this kind with similar

results. Whenever equal quantities of potassium were com-
bined with unequal quantities of sulphur, and exposed a≈øter-
wards to the action of muriatic acid, the largest quantity of
sulphuretted hydrogene was furnished by the product con-
taining the smallest proportion of sulphur, and in no case was
the quantity of gas equal in volume to the quantity of hydro-
gene, which would have been produced by the mere action of
potassium upon water.


on the Nature of certain Bodies. 67

From the general tenour of these various facts, it will not
be, I trust, unreasonable to assume, that sulphur, in its com-
mon state, is a compound of small quantities of oxygene and
hydrogene with a large quantity of a basis that produces
the acids of sulphur in combustion, and which, on account of
its strong attractions for other bodies, it will probably be very
difficult to obtain in its pure form. In metallic combinations even, it still probably retains its
oxygene and part of its hydrogene. Metallic sulphurets can
only be partially decomposed by heat, and the small quantity
of sulphur evolved from them in this case when perfectly dry
and out of the contact of air, as I found in an experiment on
the sulphurets of copper and iron, exists in its common state,
and acts upon potassium, and is affected by electricity in the
same manner as native sulphur.
