* (Part IL, pars. 99, 100), only there the
cylinder was of magnesium, and the platinum spiral was bare. With my old apparatus
the noteworthy fact was ascertained that the incandescent spiral attracted the
suspended cylinder to a moderate extent at normal atmospheric pressure ; the attrac-
tion diminished to a minimum between a tension of 50 mm. and 150 mm., then- rose
as the pressure diminished, until, at a tension of 1Â°15 mm., the attraction was nearly
four times what it was in dense air. Above this exhaustion the attraction suddenly
dropped and changed to repulsion, and at the best vacuum I could get the repulsion
was nearly thirteen times stronger than the attraction in air. With the present apparatus I was able to verify the broad phenomena formerly
