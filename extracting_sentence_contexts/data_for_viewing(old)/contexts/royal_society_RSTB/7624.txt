Microtus sp. In Series IA, three right second upper molars, M?, without roots and with
only two inner salient angles, represent this genus; they certainly do not belong to
M. agrestis, the living short-tailed vole of Great Britain; but may indicate a member of
either the arvalis or ratticeps groups. A right M%, without roots, with an anterior loop,
three closed triangles and a long crescentic posterior loop, presenting three outer and
four inner salient angles, may also be referred to this genus. i

Microtus arvalis/agrestis groups. Series II, no. 1, contains two (one right, one left) first
lower molars, M,, both unfortunately too damaged to be figured; close study shows that
these teeth have the pattern characteristic of voles allied to M. arvalis and M. agrestis.
The less damaged left tooth is mutilated at both ends; but enough remains to show six
closed triangles in front of the posterior loop and also the outer wall of the anterior loop;
the pattern of the tooth closely resembles that of the M, in M. orcadensis, a fact which
suggests that the tooth is really referable to M. corneri Hinton, described from the fissure
deposits of Ightham, Kent, which is the Late Pleistocene mainland forerunner of M. orca-
densis and related island forms.

Microtus anglicus Hinton. This species is represented by two examples of the character-
istic M,. In Series IT, no. 6, there is a right M, (figure 7u), which in form, despite a little
oblique wear, closely resembles the specimen from Ightham, Kent, shown in figure 68-28
of Hinton (1926); and in no. 10 there is another right M, which, although too broken
to figure, shows the fourth inner prism closed in front and an anterior loop of quite typical
form, resembling that of the tooth from Ightham shown in figure 68-10 of Hinton (1926).
