Analysis and mathematics only take us so far. We have to judge how best to make certainty out of
uncertainty. These two functions of applied science and judgement can variously be described as the
known and the supposed, the factual and the conjectural, the deductive and the intuitive, the rational
and the instinctive.

The third element is equally important. We are required to act in the public interest and must
therefore live up to high ethical and professional standards. These three elements apply to each
individual actuary in his or her daily work but they are reinforced by our professional bodies in the code
of conduct and guidance we give our members.

It is hard to think of a better example of the need to use applied science, professional judgement and
ethical standards than the subject of genetic testing. The objectives for the actuarial profession are first
to ensure that our members are as well informed as possible on the facts and the information coming
from genetic scientists and the medical profession so that they can exercise their professional judgement,
as we do in other areas, on an informed basis. The second objective is to ensure that our members
consider the ethics and fairness which insurance companies must apply, recognizing that actuaries are
in a position of considerable influence over these companies. I am not just talking here about
mathematical and actuarial fairness. There are social and political issues affecting the public interest
that actuaries must consider as well, and in all this, and particularly in the debate at this Symposium,
we must distinguish between the trusted professional role which the Faculty and Institute expect our
members to live up to, and the commercial role which individual members may express when speaking
on behalf of their employer.

The Symposium will be a fascinating two days and we are delighted that it is being held under the
joint auspices of the Royal Society and the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries.
