Each of the three involves the mature plasma cells in the
first set at 12 days; all the constituent cellular reactions of the 8-day-old second-set grafts are
correlated with them, but only the mature plasma-cell reaction of the 12-day-old second
sets. It is remarkable that there were no correlations between the 8-day grafts of the
first’ set and either stage of the second set. This may well be a reflexion of the fact that
only at 12 days was the first set at a stage of destruction comparable with the second set;
the two stages which are most alike in degree of destruction (twelfth day of the first set
and eighth day of the second set) show most correlations. It is also noteworthy that the
first- and second-set grafts were not correlated in respect of their lymphocytes or immature

pyronin cells but only the mature plasma cells; however, these other cells may have been
correlated in the pre-breakdown period which the observations did not cover—for a corre-
lation of mature cells tends to imply a previous correlation of immature ones. For the correlation between mature plasma-cell concentrations in the first- and second-
set grafts there are two main lines of interpretation.
