Note that the configuration of beads shown here is typical for an instanton in the
inverted regime, although the numbering scheme is identical in the normal regime. (Online version in colour.)

which is defined such that 2s, = sO for the instanton configuration and r= {10,...,1N/2} has
been redefined for the half ring polymer. Note that the bead labelling has changed compared with
equation (3.2), since cyclic indexing does not apply to the half ring polymer and there is only a
single hopping bead (figure 2). When optimizing an instanton for a new system, one can use the fact that at high temperatures
the instanton will be compact and located near the MECP, which can itself be found with standard
methods [84-90]. A good initial guess for the value of rt is given by the classical, short-time limit
of the action (see discussion above equation (2.21)) [41]. It is therefore relatively easy to optimize
an instanton at high temperature, which can then serve as a starting point to slowly cool down
the system.
