On the Conditions Favourable to Cross-fertilisation. An examination of the notes attached to the tables of experiments shows that the
proportion of eggs fertilised varies to an immense extent, and that these variations
seem to be influenced in many cases by the external conditions. A considerable
number of papers have been written on the causes of such variations, but their con-
clusions differ greatly from one another, and this is not surprising, since the facts
seem frequently to be contradictory among themselves. VERNON, for example, in his
earlier papers (5), concludes that eggs which have been kept are more easily fertilised
by foreign sperm than fresh eggs, but in his last paper (9) he shows that this is not
always the case. Similarly, the effects of temperature and other external conditions
seem to vary in different cases, so that conditions which in one instance seem to favour
cross-fertilisation, at another, appear to be adverse to it.
