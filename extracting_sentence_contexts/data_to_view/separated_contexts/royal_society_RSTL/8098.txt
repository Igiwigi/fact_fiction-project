Na I and Na Br gave all the metallic lines of
Sodium, which were very brilliant; whilst Na Cl gave D and the double red very bright,
Zand stretching all across the spectrum. Na F gave also D and the double red line; but
Bthe latter only extended three quarters across the spectrum, and neither D nor the red
line was 80 bright as they were in the chloride. Further observations showed that under
Zcertain circumstances all the lines appeared even in these latter salts; but they were 80
Sdim as to be scarcely visible, and the fact of these compounds behaving in direct contra-
Syention to the observations with lead was established.

TiTHUM.

Â£4 The following experiments were made with lithic iodide and chloride in coal-gas. s Lithic Todide gave the red line of this metal, 6705, extending all across the spectrum,
S but it was very faint.
