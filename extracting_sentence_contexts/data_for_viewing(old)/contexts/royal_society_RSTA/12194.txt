_ The monad elements (§ 70) out of which a magnetic molecule of this kind is built
up are electric centres or nuclei of radial rotational strain. From what is known of
molecular magnitudes, in connexion with electrochemical data, it would appear that
to produce an intensity of magnetization of 1700 ¢.g.s., which is about the limit attain-
able for iron, these monad charges—or e/ectvons, as we may call them, after Dr. Joun-
STONE StoNEY—must circulate very rapidly, in fact with velocities not many hundred
times smaller than the velocity of radiation.* Even a single pair of electrons revolving
round each other at such a rate as this would produce a practically perfect secular
Yortical circulation in the medium; so that a magnetic molecule may quite well be
composed of a single positive or right-handed electron and a single negative or left-
handed one revolving round each other in this manner. We may in fact rigorously
apply to the present problem the principle used by Gauss for the discussion of
secular effects in Physical Astronomy. Instead of proceeding by addition of the
elementary effects produced by a planet as it moves from point to point of its orbit,

to the velocity the planet would have when at that point. Just in the same way
here, the steady flow of the medium, as distinguished from vibrational effects, is the
eas if each electron were distributed round its circular orbit, thus forming effec-

the action of other systems.t
