chose-asocial—received-social condition (M = 45 s; s.d. = 100 s)
were significantly faster than those in the chose-asocial—
received-asocial condition (M = 188s; s.d.=152), p= 0.014.
Similarly, 5-year-olds in the chose-social—received-social con-
dition (M = 68 s; s.d. = 111) were significantly faster than those
in the chose-social—received-asocial condition (M = 185; s.d. =
153), p = 0.011. However, interestingly, there was no significant
difference between 5-year-olds in the chose-asocial—received-
social condition (M=7s; s.d.=9s) and the chose-asocial—
received-asocial condition (M= 66s; s.d.= 119s), p=0.781.
The large standard deviation scores for latencies reflect that
28% of all children were unsuccessful and had their score
capped at 360 s. To account for this and the fact of uneven cell-
sizes and variances, it was especially important to take the
robust measures mentioned above; levels of lack of success are
reported with the further statistical description of conditions in
the electronic supplementary material, S1. Taken together these
results indicate that for 3-year-olds, those who received social
input, whether choosing it or not, were faster at the task than chil-
dren who learned asocially. This effect held for 5-year-olds who
chose to learn socially, but 5-year-olds who chose to learn aso-
cially were equally fast at the task no matter the learning style
they were allocated to receive (as depicted in figure 2).
