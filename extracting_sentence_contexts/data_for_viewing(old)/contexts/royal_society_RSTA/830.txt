At present, we have not isolated a rotating PO above saddle s2 of alanine dipeptide;
nevertheless, it is quite tempting to attribute the persistence of the blue trajectories to perform
full rotations in y to the existence of remnants of invariant structures above saddles of index â€”1.

For chiral molecules and with the appropriate spectroscopy [20] one could expect to use these
internal free rotational states as a probe to distinguish the two enantiomeric counterparts of the
molecule. These subjects are at the focus of current research interest and promise an exciting
future for chemical dynamics.

To summarize, modern spectroscopic techniques may discover new states (bifurcating states)
and follow the fast dynamics of molecules, such as dynamical resonances, which have arisen from
nonlinear dynamical effects. Basic theory has been given to emphasize the fact that in molecular
dynamics calculations, not only should we work in phase space, but also we should analyse the
results in terms of phase space structures. To predict and control chemical dynamics, a phase
space exploration to identify the invariant structures or remnants associated with these structures
turns out to be indispensable.
