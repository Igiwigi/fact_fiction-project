Note.—Those punctual lines which are not “lines at infinity” (to be explained
later) will be proved as the result of the axioms to be the punctual associates of the
various objective reals,

*20°23. Definition.—The point, if there is one and one only, which contains a class
u is called the dominant point of u. The dominant point of v is denoted by ug, The
symbolic definition is

Un, = (1p) {pepnty, . wecls‘p} Df

Note.—The idea of a dominant point obtains its importance from the fact that,
according to the axioms given below, each interpoint is contained in one and only one
point,

*20°231. Definition.—The nonsecant part of u is that subclass of uw of which no
member is a member of any interpoint which is a subclass of vu. The nonsecant part
of u is denoted by nscx,‘u. The symbolic definition is

nscpu = e{veu. — (qv). veintpnt,, n cls‘u . rev} Df

Note.—This definition takes its importance from the fact that (assuming the
subsequent axioms) a point in general consists of a nonsecant part and of a part
made up of interpoints contained in it. Either the interpoints or the nonsecant
