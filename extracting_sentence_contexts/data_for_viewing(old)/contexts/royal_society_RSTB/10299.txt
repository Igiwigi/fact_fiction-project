cortex if the sound is executed by the hand or the mouth [8].
Interestingly, tool sounds activate brain areas overlapping
with those recruited when participants pantomimed the
manipulation of the same tools [9]. Finally, listening to non-
verbal vocalizations automatically engages the preparation of
responsive orofacial gestures [10]. These brain activities are
located in the posterior aspect of the inferior frontal gyrus,

which on the left hemisphere, corresponds to Brocaâ€™s area. In
parallel, other studies investigated the brain mechanisms
associated with the processing of music (another instance of
action-related sound) with a particular focus on the role
of expertise. In fact, musicians are a particular example of
sensorimotor expertise. Experts have been particularly useful
in cognitive neuroscience, being an interesting model
of over-learned sensorimotor associations [11,12]. Indeed, play-
ing music is a multifaceted ability requiring years of practice
to master, as it is based on the coordination of many different
skills. Expert musicians are indeed an extraordinary popu-
lation to study how specific training can shape
somatosensory [13], motor [14], and auditory representations
[15], as well as multimodal integration brain networks [16].
Musicians allowed the investigation of long-term structural
[17] and short-term functional [18] plastic changes in the
brain. In fact, sensorimotor integration in music could be the
