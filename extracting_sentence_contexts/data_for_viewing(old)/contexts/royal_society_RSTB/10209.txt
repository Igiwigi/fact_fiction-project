sizes maintain high herbaceous fuel loads by preventing
recruitment and establishment of mature trees [86-88].
Reciprocally, browsing can be promoted by intense fires as
they top-kill woody plants [89-91] so frequent fires keep
forage within browse height [45]. These reciprocal impacts
have been formalized by Van Langevelde [92].

The longer-term interaction between fire and browsers
via effects on woody species composition has not been
investigated but is probably neutral. Fire and browsing cer-
tainly select for very different woody functional traits
[93,94] but fire-adapted species are not necessarily less pala-
table than browser-adapted species, and in fact, are often
preferred by browsers [95]. One further complication is
that many browsers appear to avoid the tall grasslands pro-
moted by fires: black rhino and impala presence is higher
in short-grazed environments [96]. If so then there might be
some negative impacts of fire on browsing via impacts on
grassland structure (and positive interactions between
grazers and browsers).

(c) Expected consequences of these interactions

The expected effect of grazer numbers on fire extent is clearly
negative, but this response is unlikely to be linear. Fire spread
