satisfy the AoT constraints and, in particular, each {0,1}-valued probability (i.e. a deterministic [3
function) cannot be written as a convex decomposition of other probabilities, hence it is extremal. : S]
Conversely, each p(a|x), p(b\a; xy), p(clab; xyz) can be decomposed as a convex combination of : 8
deterministic functions. One can compute the number of extremal points for the polytope PY’ - : 8

In summary, all correlations of a temporal scenario, for a fixed number of inputs, outputs and
length of the sequence, can be generated by deterministic functions of the previous inputs and
outputs. Since both classical and quantum models are able to generate deterministic functions, it
is clear that some restriction are necessary in order to understand the difference between classical
and quantum correlations. A natural candidate is the restriction on the amount of memory that
can be stored in the system. In fact, if the system is not able to ‘remember’, at a certain step s,
all previous inputs and outputs in the sequence, it will not be able to generate the corresponding
deterministic function associated with the sth step. We may, thus, identify ‘memory’ as a resource
needed to generate temporal correlations, and speak of the ‘memory cost’ of simulating temporal
quantum correlations with classical models. Of course, one can extend this idea and speak more
generally of the ‘memory cost’ of generating certain correlation with a given theory, e.g. in the
framework of GPTs, as discussed in [17]. In the present paper, however, we will not discuss the
case of GPTs.

The idea of memory cost has been discussed in [13,14] in relation with the simulation
of contextual correlations associated with the Peres-Mermin [11,12], stochastic processes [44]
and causal asymmetry [45]. The analogous idea in the spatial scenario, ie. the notion of
communication cost needed to simulate non-local correlations has also been extensively
