or identity between crest and hernia, for we have found one instance in
which an uncrested fowl has transmitted hernia.”

No further details of this case are given, and evidently no strain showing hernia
without crest has been produced from this bird, as could have been done if she
really contained the gene for hernia without that for crest. Without such con-
firmation this single example remains inconclusive. That the authors were also
influenced in their conclusion by the belief that their data showed that crest was
not closely linked with pile, or “ dominant white,” is shown by the following further
comment :—

“The possibility of a close linkage between the two genes is made improbable by
the fact that, although hernia is very closely linked with the recessive allelo-
morph of dominant white, crest appeared in our previous data to be inde-
pendent of this colour gene.”

It has, however, already been shown above that the data for crest and colour are
entirely consistent with very close linkage between these factors.

The identification of the genes postulated for crest and hernia establishes and
simplifies an interesting linkage-group in poultry recently proposed by Hurt.
In 1932, SurTLe and Sree had shown that crest was linked with frizzled plumage.
In extensive and consistent back crosses they obtained 67 recombinations out of
239 or 28-3°%, ; exactly the same value, though much more precisely determined,
as we have obtained from Davenporv’s data for the recombination between crest
