monia is in no way essential to the fluidity of the blood while it is surrounded by healthy tisxues. Another
point, which the simple experiments upon the sheep's foot show clearly, is that a certain amount of am-
monia in the blood will retard without preventing the deposit of fibrine upon a needle or other ordinary
slid introduced into the vessels; and it appears yery doubtful whether healthy blood eyer contains sufſicient
ammonia to prevent 8uch an occurrence.

may be the case with other tissues.
ut though some of the facts above mentioned furnish clear evidence that ordinary solid

In are necessarily merely neutral in their conduct towards the blood in this matter. Tt is
quite possible that they may: exert an active influence upon it, in consequence of which
the particles of fibrine may experience a mutual repulsion, in the same way as would
