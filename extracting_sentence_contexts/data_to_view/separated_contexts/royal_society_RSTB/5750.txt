In a general way differences in the brain correlated with the shape of the skull were
already recognised by Catori (1870), Meyer (1871), and Riprnaer (1877), who called
attention in a general manner to the more curved character of sagittal sulci in brachy-
cephalics and the more frequent occurrence of transverse fissures, without dealing with
the arrangement of special sulci. ZUCKERKANDL (1883) showed the influence of early synostosis of certain sutures on the
convolutional pattern, and Ampr1aLer (1893) described the brain form correlated with
artificial deformation (see p. 25, and Plate 415). This did not lead, however, to a descrip-
tive brain anthropology, probably on account of the fact that these authors had
not at their disposal such a variety of well preserved brains of different races as is desir-
able for this purpose. As a basis for my researches I used the fact that the population of Holland consists
mainly of two groups (BoLK, 1920), a mesocephalic largely Nordic group,} and a brachy-
cephalic hypsicephalic Alpine group, the latter occurring chiefly in the province of
Groningen (DisKsTRaA, 1927). This gave me a chance to get mesocephalic (and dolichocephalic) as well as brachy-
cephalic brains; the latter being also higher, more hypsicephalic than our dolicho-
cephalic brains (and skulls).
