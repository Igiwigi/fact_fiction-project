From this per-
spective, declining fecundity would seem to be a simple
extension of menopause itself. This process, however, may be

Figure 3. Age at last birth compared to age at menopause for Bangladeshi
women (same sample as in figure 2): (a) Kaplan-Meier survival curves for
age at last birth (dashed line) and age at menopause (solid line), (b) histo-
gram of number of years between last birth and menopause (mean: 11.2,
median: 11, range: 0-33, s.d.: 6.05) and (c) boxplots of age at last birth
on the x-axis according to age at menopause (divided into five 3-year age
groupings) on the y-axis. (See figure 2 legend for explanation of boxplot fea-
tures.) (Online version in colour.)

Both number of live births and number of stillbirths are quite heterogeneous, with more fecund women reproducing
positively correlated with ages at last birth, with number of to later ages [52,56], despite the fact that rates of pregnancy
live births being the strongest predictor in the model. These loss increase with age [48]. For example, among Utah women
correlations do not reveal a causal direction or imply inten- who continued to reproduce into their 40s, there was little evi-
tional stopping behaviour, as women with later ages of last dence of declining fecundity with increased parity once age
birth may simply be able to ‘fit in’ more births.
