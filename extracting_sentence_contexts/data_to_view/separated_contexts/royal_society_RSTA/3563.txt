Respiration is a confounding factor for both HP-SAP and MSNA-DAP dynamical relations. Indeed, HP variations at the respiratory rate, usually referred to as respiratory sinus
arrhythmia [10], might occur even in absence of synchronous modifications of SAP as a result
of the modulation of the motoneuron vagal responsiveness by respiratory centres [11]. As
a matter of fact, disambiguating direct influences of respiration on HP is mandatory for a
reliable assessment of cBR in both animals [12] and humans [13]. Similarly, MSNA burst rate
modulations at the respiratory rate might be present in absence of respiratory-related DAP
fluctuations. Indeed, the magnitude of the respiratory-related MSNA burst rate modulations
is usually considerable [14], while synchronous modifications of DAP are negligible [15].
