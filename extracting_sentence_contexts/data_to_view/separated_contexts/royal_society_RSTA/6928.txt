The contribution of the
L,-edges has been eliminated. The instrumental line widths are indicated, and theo-
retical points from equations (6) and (7) are plotted. It must be remembered that
these assume that N,(#) is constant; in actual fact, it is increasing with increasing E
up to the edge, so some slight misfit on the low-energy side is inevitable. The un-
corrected points are badly off the curves corresponding to 110Â° K, especially for Al. But in this case, when the correction for slit width is applied, the discrepancy is nearly
accounted for.
