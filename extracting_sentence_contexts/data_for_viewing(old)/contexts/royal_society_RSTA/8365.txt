(6) We may have a base plane of ¥ corresponding to the neighbourhood of a base line
» of ©.—This happens when it requires only one condition to make -quadrics
touch any given surface of intersection of two of them, I,, along the line 2, 2.e.
when -quadrics have a tangent plane already prescribed at each of three points
of 4.* Any prime, then, will contain one point of the section of the neighbour-
hood of % by I, ; and all the points of this section will therefore be represented
by a base point of a base plane of ¥. Any base line, for example, which meets
three other base curves will in general give rise to a special base plane of ¥ of
the kind in question.

(c) We may have a base plane of ¥ corresponding to a certain class of points near l~—
In fact it may require only one condition to make ®-quadrics osculate any surface
of intersection of two of them along the line /; and if this is so, and if | be given
by equations z = ¢ = u = 0 and x by equations z = ¢ = 0, then it can be shown
that to points near 1, for which w is of the first order of smallness and z and ¢
both of the second, there correspond points of a base plane of Y’.

This completes our brief indication of the peculiarities that can arise in the reverse
systems ‘’; and as we have already remarked that the transformations under con-
sideration are not of a sufficiently general character to justify further elaboration in a
paper like the present, we shall leave them here and pass on to those of the next type
for which the general ®-surface is Is.
