The line of symmetry through the
centre in the direction of translation may then be termed the polar axis, Whether
awe deal with ring-shaped or singly connected aggregates, the surfaces p will always She ring-shaped inside. In fact they are so also at the boundary, for the surface value
of w really consists in the latter case of the outer boundary together with the
lar axis.
& 3. Conceive now the aggregate divided up into a large number of ring-surfaces
riven by values of a parameter w differing by dy, and confine attention to what is
Going on between the two surfaces ys and w + dp. We shall suppose wp to increase as
Bie pass from the outside inwards.
