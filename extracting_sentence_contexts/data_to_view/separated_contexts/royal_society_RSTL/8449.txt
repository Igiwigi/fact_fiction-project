As the tooth approaches completion, there is a peculiarity in the form which its
base assumes which I haye not noticed in other animalsâ€”namely, that the dentine at
the widely open base of the tooth is often abruptly bent inwards, as though the base of
the tooth were about to he closed by a sort of operculum of dentine (se fig. 5). An early germ is represented in fig. 4, measuring in its total length 445 of an inch ;
it differs from a mammalian tooth-germ by its elongated form, and by the fact that the
two layers of cells which necessarily result from the manner of formation of enamel-
organs, namely the outer and inner epithelia of the enamel-organ, are s0 closely in
contact as to be indistinguishable except at the base, there being no intermediate stellate
tissue; while from the tooth-germs of Batrachia and Sauria it differs in no respect save
its exceedingly elongated shape. A till earlier stage, when the tooth-germs may be
said to consist solely of a preparation for the formation of an enamel-organ in the shape
of a czcal process of epithelial cells, is shown at e in fig. 3.
