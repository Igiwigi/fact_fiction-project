and the distance between the eylindrical surfaces, when the velocity, the radii of
curvature of the journal and the brass, the length of the brass, and the manner of
| loading are known (1.e., when U, BR, a, 0, L, and p are known) ; and, further, if M the

moment of friction is known, the equations afford the means of determining « when þ

S The quantities U, R, 0, and L are of a nature to be easily determined in any experi-

- By no known means can the difference of radii («) of the journal and its brass be

= order to obtain a precise value of a. As a matter of fact eyen a rough measurement
'S of @ is impossible. To determine a, therefore, it is necessary to know the moment of

Z ments 8uch as those described for olive oil (Section II.), a can be deduced from the
be equations for any particular value of p. But although the values of y may have been
E determined for all temperatures for the particular oil used, and that value chosen
5 which corresponds with the temperature of the oil bath in the experiment, the ques-
= tion still arises whether the oil bath (or wherever the temperature is measured) is at
