Then we have

* Bout) AB(S)=1, B(do(x)) = B(x). We deduce that B(¢;(x)) = B(x) + t and hence the open set Mj is a trivial fibration T? x I fora real
interval I in the case that the level sets have no boundary. The same holds when the level sets are
cylinders (due to the fact that in the complement of the set C the level sets of B intersecting the
boundary have a transverse intersection). Since the vector field X commutes with curlX it follows
that it is conjugated to a linear flow on each level set diffeomorphic to a torus. For the cylinder, all
orbits are periodic as an easy consequence of the Poincaré—Bendixon theorem and the fact that X
preserves the area form i* 12. | |
