In proportion as this takes place the clot be-
comes darker ; and when the whole of the serum is removed, perfectly black. When
in this state neither atmospheric air, nor eyen pure oxygen, is capable of changing
its colour; but when we immerse this black clot in a clear saline solution, it in-
stantly changes from jet black to a scarlet, or arterial colour. From these facts we
may conclude, that oxygen is a secondary agent in the change of colour from yenous
to arterial; and that if the scarlet colour of the blood be essential to life, it is pro-
duced, not by oxygen, but by another cause. The mere remoyal of the carbonic acid
from venous blood would not produce any change of colour, were it not that there
is in the blood itself another agent which produces the arterial tint, the moment
that the blackening effect of the carbonic acid is remoyed : this is effected by the
action of the natural saline ingredients of the blood on the colouring matter. When
oxygen is added to blood it may have a slight share in brightening the colour,
but it can only perfectly effect this when the colouring matter is in contact with a
saline fluid.
