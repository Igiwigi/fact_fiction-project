Some fiſher-
men, {weeping for anchors in the Gull ſtream (a part of

FI My. x1NG's Account of a

the ſea'near the Downs), drew up a very curious old
{wivel gun, near eight feet in length. The barrel of the
gun, which was about five feet long, was of braſs; but
the handle (whereby it was to be turned or traverſed)
which was about three feet in length, and alſo the ſwivel
and pivot on which it turned, were of iron, and all round! \,
theſe latter, and eſpecially about the ſwivel and pivot,
were formed exceeding hard incruſtations/of ſand, con-"
verted into a kind of ſtone, of an exceeding ſtrong tex-
ture and firmneſs; whereas round the barrel of the gun,
except where it was near adjoining to the iron, there
were no ſuch incruſtations at all, the greater part-of it
being clean, and in good condition, juſt as if it had ſtill
continued in uſe'”,

The incruſtation round the iron part of this gun was
alſo the more deſerving of attention, becauſe it incloſed
within it, and alſo held faſtly adhering to it on the out-
fide, a number of ſhells and corallines, juſt in the ſame”
manner as they are often found in a foſſil ſtate. There
were plainly to be diſtinguiſhed, on the outfide of this
maſs of incruſtation, pectens, cockles, limpets, muſcles,
vermiculi marini and balini; and beſides theſe, one bucci-

X 'This remarkable incraſtation, therefore, thus confined
