PCP is elicited in animal embryos
internal cell states, adjoining portions of a cell mass can by Wnt, but (in contrast to A/B polarization) acting through
become immiscible if the density of cadherins on cell sur- other (‘non-canonical’) cytoplasmic intermediates such as the
faces, or cortical tension, are modulated in a spatially membrane protein Van Gogh/Strabismus (Vang /Stbm) [45],
dependent fashion by a molecular gradient, a phenomenon which is only present in the eumetazoans. Cells oriented by

fact, all known animals, from the early-branching placozoans a narrowing of the tissue mass in the direction of intercalation


accompanied by elongation in the orthogonal direction
[46]. This effect is seen in germ-band extension in insects
such as Drosophila [47] and convergent extension in ver-
tebrates, each of which establishes the elongated body axis
during gastrulation [48], and a variety of other morphogen-
etic processes [49]. Although this mode of behaviour of
liquid tissues is a novel property that enhances the morpho-
genetic capabilities of the organisms that exhibit it, it does not
appear to define a major evolutionary transition in its own
right.
