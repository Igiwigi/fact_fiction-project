ball, and in a 8hort time the current will cease entirely from B, and the whole
will now strike off from C.

As the ball B was at a considerable distance from E, its temperature re-
mained uniform : we are therefore led to the conchusion that the electric fluid
finds an easier passage along hot than cold iron; or, to use the ordinary
language of the science, iron when red hot is a better conductor of electricity
than when cold.

Whether the cause of this be found in the diminished attraction which hot
iron has for the electric fluid, in the diminished pressure of the ambient air, or
in both causes combined, is a question which has not yet been solved ; but
whatever be the canse, the fact is certain, though at complete variance with
our preconceived notions on the subject, and even with the results of former
experiments. -

Exe. IX. Suspend a magnetic needle by the glass thread as in Exp. VIL
Place a rod of iron heated white hot opposite either end of the needle, apply
either pole of a horseshoe magnet to the other end of the iron, and the devia-
tion of the needle both by attraction and repulsion will be found to be greatest
when the rod reaches a red heat, and will continue to diminish as the rod
cools. From this experiment it is obvious that iron at a red heat conducts
the magnetic influence better than when cold. Though this experiment bears
some resemblance to those of Mr. BarLow, yet, as far as I know, the fact has
not been previously obseryed; and it affords us another striking analogy
