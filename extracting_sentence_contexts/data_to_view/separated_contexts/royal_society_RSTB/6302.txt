It is possible that this peculiar state of affairs is due to the rapid growth of the
teleoptile. Usually a quiescent period sets in between the formation of the two
generations of feathers, but the feather papilla of the rectrix of the duckling is
obviously in a very active state throughout the nestling period. This offers striking proof of the facts disputed by previous authors that (a) the
second generation of feathers is formed in the same follicles as their predecessors,
and (6) that the feather papilla resumes activity prior to the shedding of the old
feather.

(iii) Starlings
The first coat worn by the starling consists of a very rudimentary nestling down

similar fundamentally to that of the chick. It was unfortunately impossible to
obtain sufficiently early stages to study the development of these protoptiles.

The youngest stage obtained had feathers visible macroscopically on the head
and round the eyes and ears ; on the neck, ventrally two rows of feathers converging
below the head and extending backwards almost to the cloaca, and dorsally,
extending from the head to the tail in the middle line ; on the thighs and wings,
with a few on the legs.
