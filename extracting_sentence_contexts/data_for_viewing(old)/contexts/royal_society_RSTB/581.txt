work, even with a large and good map ; and, moreover, as far as my plants go, it does
not effect a good separation on the primary tabulation. For a very large number of
western plants on the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains are also found on their
eastern slopes. On the other hand, the line of 100° west longitude sorts off the
Eastern United States’ flora well ; in short, I find it both an easier and a more natural
boundary than the water-parting.

The fact is that, in the final result, I come very near to Mr. Wauuace. In order
that the dividing-lines of my tabulation areas may effect a good sorting of the plants
on the primary tabulation, these lines must be made to coincide approximately with
the boundaries of natural biologic regions. If we bound these regions by broadly-
marked and easily-remembered limits (to quote Mr. Watxace’s words), his biologic
regions become practically my tabulation areas. But, if the details are filled in to
his regions and sub-regions, the boundary lines become too complex to tabulate upon.
