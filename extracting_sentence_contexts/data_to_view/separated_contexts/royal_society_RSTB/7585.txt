Gunn et al. (1948, p. 46) have brought forward a particular form of the optomotor theory
of wind orientation which is embodied in their expression ‘the forbidden course’. Obser-
ving that locusts did not maintain steady flight while being carried backwards by the wind,
however small the backward component in their ground speed might be, but did fly on
a track nearly at right angles to their course, the authors suggested that a course which
would lead to any degree of backward drift was ‘forbidden’ for, that is to say avoided by, the
locusts. This theory fits some of the facts and enabled Gunn et a/. to narrow down the possible
range of courses along which swarms could have flown in given wind conditions. But the
optomotor responses of flying locusts involve more than the mere avoidance of backward
drift. Figure 11 (p. 191) illustrates the finding that locusts have a preference for up-wind
orientation even when winds are gentle enough for there to be no risk of backward drift
while so oriented.
