So that in these cases also, acuity does not
appear to be dependent on diffraction at the pupil, but on some other factor. It seemed
unlikely that this factor would be chromatic aberration, because if it were, a coloured light
should give a better result than a white one, and such is not found to be the case. Neither
does the difference threshold for light intensity seem a likely factor, because in this case the
fact that the white light was twelve times as bright as any of the coloured lights would have
caused the visual acuity for white light to be substantially better than that for the colours,
and this was not found to be the case. The most likely factor appeared to be the retinal mosaic. But if this were the case, it
would be expected that the result with white light would be markedly superior to that given
by any coloured light, because, as has been pointed out above, white light stimulates all
the foveal receptors, while coloured light stimulates only a few.
