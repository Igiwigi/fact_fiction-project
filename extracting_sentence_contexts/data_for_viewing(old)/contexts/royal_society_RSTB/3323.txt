length from below upwards, but, as I shall prove hereafter, this is far from being
universal, indeed, many branched herbs provide exceptions.

Only few explanations of this increase and decrease of internode-length have so far
been put forward, Hates correlated the increase with increased vigour of nutrition,
associated with enlarged leaves and rise in temperature, and he attributed the final
decrease to rapid hardening of the tissues in the dry, hot summer and to cool
autumn nights. Other botanists, too, have ascribed the preliminary increase to
rise in temperature in spring, and the final decrease to fall of temperature in autumn,
or to deficient supply of water to the growing-points.

These explanations, involving the assumption that external factors are the cause
of the phenomenon, are excluded by the following facts :â€” .

(1) In European trees, whose twigs exhibit these internodal features, the inter-
nodes have completed their growth in length before the cool autumn days or nights.

(2) In some species of European trees, when two crops of foliage are produced in
one normal vegetative season, the internodes produced during that season display a
double rise and fall in length (see BuscEn, 7).

(3) Trees growing in permanently humid, warm, tropical forest show the rise and
fall of internode-length (RacrBorskr, 8), even though the twigs concerned on one
and the same individual tree may have grown out at utterly different times of the
year (A. F. W. Scutmpsr, 9).
