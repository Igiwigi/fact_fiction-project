of expertise. In fact, musicians are a particular example of
sensorimotor expertise. Experts have been particularly useful
in cognitive neuroscience, being an interesting model
of over-learned sensorimotor associations [11,12]. Indeed, play-
ing music is a multifaceted ability requiring years of practice
to master, as it is based on the coordination of many different
skills. Expert musicians are indeed an extraordinary popu-
lation to study how specific training can shape
somatosensory [13], motor [14], and auditory representations
[15], as well as multimodal integration brain networks [16].
Musicians allowed the investigation of long-term structural
[17] and short-term functional [18] plastic changes in the
brain. In fact, sensorimotor integration in music could be the
result of repeated co-occurrence of action and perceptual pro-
cesses, with the additional advantage of being spread with
different degrees of expertise among the population [19]. In
fact, it has also been shown that specific postural and kinematic
features associated with playing one instrument shape the
activity of sensorimotor cortical areas during music listening.
This result further suggests that motor training affects music
perception [20]. Musicians, through years of practice, develop
a strong functional association between a musical note, its
visual representation, and the movement required to produce
it [21,22]. As a consequence, stronger motor activity in expert
pianists was found while they were listening to piano pieces
