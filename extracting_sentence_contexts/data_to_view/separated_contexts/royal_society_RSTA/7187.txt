They are the
combinations 4s2S—7s2S and 4s?2S—852S. The lines are strong and of the same character,
and their positions are sufficiently exact to dispose of any doubt of their correct assignment. No other 4s 2S-ns?S lines have been found in spite of the fact that most of them would fall
in spectral regions much more easily observed. ZEEMAN EFFECT

The Zeeman effect in Cur was used in the early papers to assist in the identification of the
terms. No further observations appear to have been made since that time, and the old
observations with one exception are not sufficiently consistent to warrant a calculation of
g-factors.
