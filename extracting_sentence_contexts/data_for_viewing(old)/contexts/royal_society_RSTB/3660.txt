such as the breaking of the shells of molluscs, bones of animals, and hard vegetable
products, in the preparation of food. The use of the heavy massive one-sided picks
as picks, is obvious. Such picks would serve not only in digging into earth but also
in extracting flint nodules from natural chalk escarpments. The massive implements
of great size and weight, mentioned above, would serve wherever great weight and
strength of blow was necessary. It is possible that their exceptional size may be
related to their use as weapons for attacking very large animals, such as the
mastodons and rhinoceros, which were contemporary with man on the Pre-Crag
land surface.

It seems to be a matter of some importance, in endeavouring to estimate the
indications afforded by flint implements as to the culture and habits of the men
who made and used them, to take note of the fact that the kind and size of the
flint nodules available for manufacturing into implements must have differed very
considerably in different localities in ancient days, and that the form and finish of
the implements made must often be determined by the greater or less size of the
flint nodules available, and also by their abundance. Thus we should be wrong to
conclude that large and well-trimmed flint implements necessarily imply that their
makers were more advanced in culture than other groups of workers in flint—who,
in other localities, made smaller implements of rougher and readier workmanship.
The Pre-Crag men of the Icenian area had the finest flints in the world to
serve as their material—nowhere else are such huge nodules of fine unflawed flint
accessible in such abundance. The men who made the flat amygdaloid and the
large triquetro-hastate flint implements (usually referred to by the unmeaning
term “coups de poing”) of the river gravels of the south of England and north of
