If the puffs contain much salt vapour they have a greater conductivity than the
rest of the flame so that the electric field will be less in the puffs than in the rest of
the flame. In this case the salt inside the puffs will not be acted on by the whole of
the potential fall, V, so that the deflexion of the puffs will be smaller than that
represented by the equation just given. In the case of sodium and strontium salts,
which have small conductivity and intense luminosity, it was possible to observe the
puffs when the amount of salt in them was not enough to change the conductivity
appreciably so that with these salts no error could be produced by the conductivity of
the puffs. The fact that the conductivity with small amounts of these salts was not
appreciable was shown by measuring the current with the stop-cock open all the time
so as to get a continuous streak of the salt vapour. With small amounts of the salts
the current was not increased by the salt more than 50 per cent. With the
apparatus described it was found that the pufts of salt vapour did not appear to move
at all when the battery was connected or disconnected. A motion of 0°5 mm. could
have been detected, and V was increased to over 2000 volts in the case of some salts.
This shows that / was less than

2000 0°0075 em. per second per volt per centimetre.
