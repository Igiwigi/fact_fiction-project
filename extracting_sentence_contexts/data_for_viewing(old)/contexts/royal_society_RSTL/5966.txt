the segment is vertical. The ends of the loop are situated closely together. In gene-
ral figure the organ is intermediate between that of Terebella and that of Nerine. The
Sexes in Cirrhatulus are situated on separate individuals.

The author has made numerous attempts to arrive at a correct knowledge of the seg-
mental organ in Glycera alba, an Annelid which is remarkable for the entire absence of
the blood-vascular system. He has been able to do little more, in consequence of the
dense character of the tegumentary structures, than to prove the presence of the organ.
It has been observed by DE QUATREFAGES, but never anatomically defined. It is an
irregularly looped organ, destitute of a vascular tuft, and wnciliated. In another parti-
cular it is remarkable: the ova in the female are retained within the proper limits of
the membranous walls of the organ itself, after the type of the ovarian segmental organs
of the Hirudinei. This fact the author has proved repeatedly by direct observation ;
but it may also be established negatively. The branchize are capacious hollow processes,
communicating in the most open manner with the perigastric-cavity. The fluid of the
latter circulates freely in the former. In this branchial fluid the ova are never observed.

In looking back over the preceding description of the segmental organs of the Nereid
group, it is impoxible to resist the belief that, notwithstanding the numerous varieties
of size, figure, poxition, structural peculierities, mode of the looping of the ciliated tube,
the place and method by which it is connected with the mass of the generative products,
and other diversities, in one and all the genera, it is beyond all doubt the same organ.
If the identity of the organ in the several groups of this family be admitted, then the
homology between the Nereid type of the segmental organ and that of the other families
of Annelids already referred to in this memoir, must also be admitted. This conclusion
