Second, using the quantum fidelity as a area
measure of quantum reversibility requires an overlap integral, either of two forward propagated aN
quantum states or one propagated forward and backward in time with the original state. In either .
case, the nature of the overlap integral is markedly affected by this classical structural stability,
and generally is not in a regime in which it is amenable to a saddle point method. This fact allows
for the quantum and classical dynamical reversibility behaviours to differ.

2. Predictability and reversibility

Our attention is focused on d degree-of-freedom systems that are strongly and fully chaotic,
meaning they possess significant positive Lyapunov exponents [20], there are no hidden
dynamical symmetries, the phase space is overwhelmingly filled with chaotic trajectories, and
the system has a finite phase space volume; the possible existence of an extremely small relative
volume of stable trajectories does no harm to any of the main ideas. The system is assumed to exist
in both its classical and quantum realms and d is not large enough to be on the thermodynamical
scale.
