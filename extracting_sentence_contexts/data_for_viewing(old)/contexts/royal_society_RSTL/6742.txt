The fact that a given amount of Nitrogen in the form of combination of a nitrate wag

more efficacious than the same amount supplied in either of the ammoniacal salts exPe-
rimented upon, was held to show that the nitrate was taken up by the plants as such, |
and was not previously transformed into ammonia. l

M. Vuuz's experiments, as a whole, thus indicated that plants can take up Nitrogen
in three forms—namely, as nitric acid, as ammonia, and as free Nitrogen. He enume-
rates the following conclusions — , x

1. By means of nitre we may Prove, without the aid of an enclosing apparatus, that
plants absorb and assimilate the gaseous Nitrogen of the atmosphere.
