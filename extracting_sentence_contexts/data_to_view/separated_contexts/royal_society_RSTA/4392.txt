The pore blocking current was highest
for the 1.6 nm CNT, and decreased for the smaller and the larger diameter tubes, consistent with
MD simulations and the experimental predictions on the discontinuous scaling of water transport
with CNT diameter [18-25]. This strong non-monotonic diameter dependence is essentially due to
a step change in confinement effects for CNTs smaller than 2 nm in diameter [18]. In fact, recently
Pascal et al. [53] demonstrated that water molecules inside 0.8-2.0 nm diameter CNTs have
lower free energies than the bulk water, with a non-monotonic trend in entropic and enthalpic
contributions to the free energy with respect to the diameter. We did not find any significant
diameter trend for the dwell time of the ions. Moreover, the pore blocking current did not exhibit
any significant correlation with the metallicity of the CNTs.
