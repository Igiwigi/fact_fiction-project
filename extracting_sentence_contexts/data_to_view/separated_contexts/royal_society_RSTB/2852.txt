This fructification, our knowledge of which is
entirely due to the work of Count Soums-LauBacu,t was not definitely placed by that
author in the genus Sphenophyllum, though there is no doubt as to its close affinity. As the structure of the axis is not yet known, it is wise to keep this species at present
in the provisional genus Bowmanites.{ The fact that in B. RÃ©meri each sporangio-
phore bears two sporangia is in itself a striking point of resemblance to Sphenophyllum
Jertile; in the detailed structure of the fertile lamina and the mode of attachment of
the sporangia there is also a fairly close agreement. Count Sonms-Lavusacn finds
that in his species the pendulous sporangia were inserted far to the outside on the
lower edge of the expanded summit of the sporangiophore.{ He compares their
position with that of the ovules in Zamia or Encephalartos.\|
