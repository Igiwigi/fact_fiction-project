It will be observed that this dependence of the phenomena on a relation between the xize of the 8urfaces
and the mean path of a molecule is essentially different from what has been a common, but as is herein
shown, erroneous supposition, that the phenomena egsentially depend on distance separating the opposite
gurfaces. The one supposition makes the action of the radiometer depend on the 8ize of the yanes, but
leaves it independent of the size of the envelope, while the other makes the action depend on the 8ize of
the envelope, but leaves it x0 far independent of the size of the yanes.

The assumption that the coefficients A, m, X,, and Ng, also m' and Ng, equation (99), are the same for
8tucco as for meerschaum is equivalent to assuming that the only respect in which the interstices of these
plates differ is that of conrseness. There is no « priori ground for making this asxumption, The fact that the
logarithmic homologues for stuceo fit those for meerschaum through snch a considerable range of densities
proves the approximate trnth of the assumption ; but ib is possible, since c and c,, are arbitrary dimensions,
that the curves for transpiration under pressure depending on A, 14, Ny, and N may approximately fit for
one value of ©, and the curves for thermal transpiration depending on Az, m, AM, Ay in, and XN, may

approximately fit for another yalue of —. Tf this were 0 log. (= :); the shift necessary to bring the onrves

into coincidence would not be the same for transpiration under pressnre as for thermal transpiration, and
as has been pointed ont (Art. 41), this is to a certain extent the case, this ratio having the yalues 6:5 and 5:6—
a diſference which was sufficiently decided to call for notice, but which is no 80 large but that, as pointed
