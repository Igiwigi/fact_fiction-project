consider that the formation of such compounds* affords the best explanation of the
behaviour of solutions of organic substances in the halogen hydrides and in
sulphuretted hydrogen.

We are led to this conclusion by a consideration of the following facts :—

(1) Large quantities of heat are evolved when conducting solutes are added to
either of these solvents. This heat evolution we take to indicate chemical union.

(2) Compounds containing a varying number of molecules of solvent haye been
isolated (ARCHIBALD and McInvosu, ‘ Jour. Chem. Soc., 1904, vol. 85, p. 919).

(3) The ionisation of a compound such as ((CH;),CO),HBr is much easier to
understand than that of a simple polymer such as ((CH;),CO),,.

In order to apply the foregoing conclusions to a specific case, we will consider a
solution of acetone in hydrogen bromide.
