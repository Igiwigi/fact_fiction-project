subcutaneously. On MrLLANBY’s explanation, it seems necessary to assume from
these data that the kinase of Echis venom is only very slowly absorbed from the
subcutaneous tissues. Other evidence, of the following nature, may be adduced for
assuming that the toxins of Echis venom are only slowly absorbed from the
subcutaneous tissues. Hzemorrhages in various tissues are produced rapidly by
intravenous injection, and hemorrhage comes on rapidly at the site of injection.
Therefore, the injury to the vessel-wall produced by the venom is not in the nature
of a degeneration which requires any considerable time for its production. In spite
of this, after subcutaneous injection of five times the minimum lethal dose in a
rabbit, the distal hemorrhages are usually not severe until 24 hours subsequently.
We have also observed that the greatest prolongation in the coagulation time of
the blood after subcutaneous injection of Echis venom is not reached till at least
24 hours. The fact that five times the minimum lethal dose does not kill much
more rapidly than a single minimum lethal dose subcutaneously administered may be
explained by slowness of absorption.

ON THE ACTION OF THE VENOM OF ECHIS CARINATUS. 25

In order further to investigate this point we compared the minimum lethal dose
subcutaneously and intramuscularly in pigeons (see Tables VI and VII). It was
found that a dose of 0°003 grm. per kilogramme injected intramuscularly killed in one
