at a fixed distance apart, and at various pressures.

It was found by Mr. Peace (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 52, p. 99) that the striking
potential between two parallel plates in air diminished as the pressure diminished till a
certain point was reached, and then began to rise very rapidly. The pressure at which
the striking potential was a minimum depended on the distance between the plates, and
increased as the distance was lessened. The minimum potential itself, however,
varied very little with the distance between the plates,

This minimum potential was of the same order as the cathode fall of potential in
air, as has been pointed out by Professor J. J. THomson (‘Recent Researches in
Electricity and Magnetism,’ p. 158). The following explanation may be offered of
the fact that this is a minimum striking potential, and that it is approximately
constant.

The negative glow in any gas [as has been shown by Warpure (‘ Wied. Ann.,’ 31,
p. 579)] requires for its production a definite potential difference (about 340 volts in
the case of air), independent of the pressure, and constant, so long as the glow is not
crushed into a smaller space than that which it would naturally occupy. If the glow
is crushed, the potential fall is more. Let us now suppose that the discharge takes
place between two parallel plates; a part of the space between these plates is

occupied by the negative glow, a part by the positive column, So long as any of the
