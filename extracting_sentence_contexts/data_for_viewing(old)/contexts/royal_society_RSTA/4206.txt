6. Plenitude and possibility

I will now argue that the principle of plenitude, suitably applied, provides a fundamental
grounding for the definite outcomes of individual quantum measurements in the context of
Schwinger’s reconstruction of the theory. The principle of plenitude is perhaps most famous in its
use by Leibniz in the realm of logic (cf. [21]). A distinction between logical and physical possibility
has emerged since his use of it, as has its application in relation to them both. The goal here is to
show how the principle of plenitude applied to physical descriptions, in particular, to the phases
associated with the possible states of an individual quantum system initially belonging to a given
pure ensemble, helps explain the observed phenomenon of the appearance of definite outcomes
as results of measurements of quantum systems.

First, it should be noted that definite measurement outcomes are matters of fact, just as in
classical mechanics, despite differences of the physics of the interactions involved when they
take place. In that sense, the existence of these outcomes is not in question as an aspect of
the physical world. The open issues are, rather, (i) that of their definiteness and (ii) that of
their relation to the laws of quantum mechanics, not simply the mutual consistency of the
two that has been brought into question in the form of the measurement problem, which
Schwinger dismisses because he views the theory as inherently one of ensembles rather than
ensemble members directly, but rather of the relationship between the behaviour of the individual
members of the quantum ensemble that is subject to the law of motion which describes them
only indirectly.

A traditional ‘explanation’ of the appearance of definite measurement outcomes has been the
invocation of the so-called projection postulates, the most widely accepted being the Liiders rule,
