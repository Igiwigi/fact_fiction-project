Fic. 7 illustrates the case in which there are two real solutions for 2, 4, 2, in powers of 1 (6 — y).

§ 10. Direct Construction of Periodic Solutions in the Neighbourhood of a Known Periodic
Solution. Convergence of the Series.

In default of a proof that the formal power series (5.13) giving the general solution of
the equations (5.1) are convergent, the investigation of §§ 5-9 is of only formal validity.
In point of fact the series (5.13) are in general divergent, but the arguments by which this
may be proved are of an indirect nature.* A new line of attack is therefore needed to
prove the convergence of the series giving the formally periodic solutions. ‘The procedure
is to give a process for the direct construction of these solutions, and then to prove that
the series involved are convergent by the method of “ dominant series.” The process
makes no direct appeal to the Hamiltonian form of the equations, but to show that it is
successful in constructing periodic solutions we invoke the existence theory of §§ 5-9,
and to this the Hamiltonian form of the equations is, of course, essential.

* The argument is briefly that any system for which the transformation (5.20) is convergent is “‘ soluble,”
so that its periodic solutions are in general “ ordinary,” whereas in general a Hamiltonian system possesses
no ordinary periodic solutions.
