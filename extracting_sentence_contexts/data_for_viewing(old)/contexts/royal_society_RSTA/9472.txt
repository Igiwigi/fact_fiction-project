Austin’s earlier work. The values of received antenna current, obtained from the
“smoothed curve of observations,” are recorded, and compared with the* results that
would be obtained from the author's formula (§ 20 above), and with those that would
be obtained from a formula described as the ‘‘ Sommerfeld transmission formula,”
which is effectively equivalent to (57). I find that, in this case also, the ratios of the
quantities recorded as observed currents at different distances are nearly the same
as the square roots of the ratios of the magnetic forces at those distances, as
calculated from Macponaxp’s formula. |

23. From this critical discussion I draw the inference that there is nothing in the
experimental evidence, at present available, to compel us to adopt the view that the
diffraction theory fails to account for the facts. On the contrary, that evidence can
be interpreted in such a way as to support the view that the results of the diffraction
theory accord well with those of daylight observations. Until more complete experi-
mental data are available the question of the success or failure of the diffraction
theory must remain open.

However this question may ultimately be settled, the discussion shows that it is
impossible to accept the hypothesis that the law of decrease of the forces of the
electromagnetic field with increasing distance is a combination of the law of spherical
divergence with a law of absorption, expressed by an attenuation factor of exponential
type. However closely such a law may represent the facts it can have no value
except as an empirical formula. In particular, it is not admissible to draw from it
any inference as to the amount of absorption. Independently of any absorption which
