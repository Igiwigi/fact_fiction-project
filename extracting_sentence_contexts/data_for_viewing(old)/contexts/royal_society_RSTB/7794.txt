but was not then successful owing to the lack of power of these markers and the scarcity of large families
with a sufficient number of living affected members. It was the advent of DNA polymorphisms, along with
recognition of the value of the large and extended Venezuela kindred with HD, that made localization of the
gene possible, added to which should be mentioned the foresight of the Hereditary Disease Foundation in
supporting the long-term effort needed and in attracting high-quality scientific groups to work on the topic.
In fact, the initial localization, to everybody’s surprise, came much earlier than expected with the finding
(Gusella e¢ al. 1983) that one of the first DNA polymorphisms available clearly localized the gene to the
short arm of c

From this point on, the eventual isolation and identification of the gene was never in doubt, even though
it took ten years to achieve this goal (Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research Group 1993). It should
be remembered that at the outset of the work in 1983, the actual isolation of a gene by positional cloning
was entirely a conjecture rather than an established fact. Again, the formation of the Huntington’s Disease
Collaborative Research Group, its funding and its coordination and general nurturing by the Hereditary
Disease Foundation through years of apparently slow progress, provide an object lesson on how a truly
collaborative major scientific project can be sustained and ultimately succeed.

It should not be thought that the work of the Collaborative Group proceeded on a fixed plan; on the
contrary, new techniques were introduced as they became feasible, whereas new ideas from other fields of
