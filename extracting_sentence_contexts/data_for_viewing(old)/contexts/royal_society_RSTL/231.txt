Notwithstanding the authority which an opinion of Dr,
Maxcrr's on this subject justly carries with it, I must take
the liberty of asserting, that although I agree with him in the

experimental facts cited as the causes for it, yet that I draw
a different conclusion from his, because, instructed by my
experiments on the nature of the triple prussiates, I find that
all those inconvenient effects are easily prevented from ensu-
ing ; and I therefore conclude that the ferruretted chyazate
of potash is in general the most appropriate test of the quan-
tity of iron in solution of any employed in chemistry ; the use
of it for this purpose only requiring attention to the following
facts,

18t. That if the ferruretted chyazate of potash after being
dissolved in water gives immediately a blue precipitate by the
addition of muriatic acid, it is not pure, and will give a falla-
