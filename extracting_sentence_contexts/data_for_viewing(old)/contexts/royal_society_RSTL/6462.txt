* We have found in the case of Pigs, that by far the larger portion of the nitrogen consumed in the
fattening food, passed off in the form of Urea. This was the case with animals kept almos entirely without
movement ; and ib was equally 80, whether the food contained the proportion of nitrogenous to non-nitro>
genous constituents, as in the Cereal grains ; or the much higher amount and proportion of the former, a5 bo

of the nitrogenous ones. In fact, when we reflect upon what we already know
relations of the constituents of the animal body to those taken into it as food—
more particularly to M#LDeR, to BousSINGAULT, and to L1epG—and when we
ther consider the facts now adduced as to the Composition of Increase, it would seem
else than a truism to say, that as our fattening food-stuffs go, their comparative
laes, as $4ck,*, are not determinable by their percentage of nitrogenous compounds.
In the absence of sufficient direct evidence, such as we have endeavoured to supply, as
to the probable compoxsition of the increase of animals feeding for the butcher, an oppo-
ste opinion has generally been maintained. A consideration of the essentialness of the
gitrogenous compounds of food, for the formation of the most important animal struc-
D has doubtless had much to do with determining the view in question ; and it
ould scem, that keeping this point very prominently in view, it has been assumed,
out the requisite experimental data, that these essential nitrogenous compounds
generally relatively deficient in our current foods. It would be more nearly true
© say, that the digestible and assimilable non-nitrogenous constituents are generally in
