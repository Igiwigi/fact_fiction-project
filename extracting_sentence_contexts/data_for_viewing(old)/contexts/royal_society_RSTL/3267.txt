less than +4”. I have seen the stage now before us in a considerable number of
ova measuring 2” and 2+.

187. Authors on the ovum of the Bird describe their * primitive trace” of the em-
bryo as originating in that which has been denominated the © central, thickened part
of the germinal membrane.” In the mammiferous ovum now under consideration
(fig. 113.) the vesicles lining the membrane f appear to me to represent the s0-called
* germinal membrane” (or what has been denominated its * serous lamina”), and the
remains of the mulberry-like structure seem to correspond to that which has been con-
sidered its © central thickened part.” If, however, facts to be hereafter stated should
render it very probable that the foundation of the new being is that contained within
the mulberry-like object, figs. 109 to 113, it will perhaps appear that this foundation
is no part of any membrane. The layer of vesicles (am.) lining the membrane f
(fig. 113.), with those previously constitating the external part of the mulberry-like
object, we hall find to form a structure of snbordinate importance—the amnion (par.
199. 200.) *

Fourteenth Stage of Development. —The Area pellucida.

189. The vesicle described as contained in the mulberry-like structure, and as
coming into view in the preceding stage, was no longer to be discerned in the oyum
represented in Plate VI. fig. 114. In its place there was an elliptical depression (a. p.),
