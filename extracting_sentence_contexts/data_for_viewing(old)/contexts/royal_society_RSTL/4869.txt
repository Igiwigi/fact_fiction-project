pass, and the consequently invincible barrier presented to the passage of a rigid
cake of ice through a strait or narrow aperture when it occurred. This is the more
remarkable, because he conceives that the inequalities of the bed or bottom may be
overcome by the hydrostatic pressure of the water, which he supposes may be impri-
8oned between the rock and the ice, s0 as absolutely to heave the latter over the
resisting obstacles.

I believe that in no part of De SaussuRE's writings will there be found any, the
slightest reference to the possibility of the glacier when fairly formed moulding itself
to the inequalities of the surfaces over which gravity urges it ; nor is there any trace
of the correlative fact of an unequal motion of the sides and centre of the ice, which
may in some sense be considered as the geometrical statement of the preceding
pbysical fact. The fact of plasticity was suspected by BasiL Har, and more distinctly
announced by Renpv, as shown in the first part of this paper; but it could not be
proved until the geometrical fact of the swifter motion of the centre of the glacier
relatively to the sides was established in 1842+. The contrary opinion at that time

action of the water thawed from the glacier ; © Lorsque les c6t6s de Vamas [de glace] qui touchent la montagne,
