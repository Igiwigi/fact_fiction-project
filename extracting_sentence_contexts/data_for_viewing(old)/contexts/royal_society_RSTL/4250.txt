according as the thermometer is low or high. At all eyents he does not, generalize
this singular result, which, according to him, belongs only to the acids ; but as a great
many 8aps have an acid reaction, the result onght to be, that, according to the state
of the temperature in those cases, the sap should enter the tree or flow out of it:
this seerns to be in opposition to all known facts.

In all the experiments I have tried, and they have been numerous, I have never
been able to ascertain that heat had any apparent influence in promoting endosmose.
It is obviously necessary to deduct the effect produced by the dilatation of the liquid
by the caloric, or wait until it has returned to its previous temperature, before mea-
suring its bulk. With this precaution, the quantity of water introduced into tubes
perfectly similar and containing the same solution of sugar, was found to be exactly
equal in the same time, though one of the tubes was maintained at a tempera-
ture of 65? C. (149* Fans.) and the other at 10* C. (50* Faur.). The ascent of the
liquids by endosmose proceeded at exactly the same rate when the tube was kept
at a constant low temperature as when it was much more heated, and then brought
back again to the usual temperature of the atmosphere. Heat does not appear to me
