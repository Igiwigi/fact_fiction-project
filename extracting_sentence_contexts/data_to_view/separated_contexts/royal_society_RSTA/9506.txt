The principal
known facts regarding the lunar magnetic variation are first summarized, and it is
shown that, so far as they go, they seem most easily explicable in the manner
proposed by Scuusrer for the solar diurnal variations. Nothing in the nature of a
proof is yet possible however. Some new facts, deduced by harmonic analysis of
existing material for the lunar variation at the separate phases of the moon, are then
described, and it is pointed out how they confirm the hypothesis of the variable
conductivity of the atmosphere in a very direct way, and provide a powerful means
of quantitatively investigating the changes of the conductivity. The details of the
calculation of these new harmonic terms in the lunar variation, and the actual tables
of results, are collected in Part III. of the paper. In order to discuss the bearing of
these observational results on the theory, it is necessary to extend ScuusrEr’s
calculation of the effect of an atmospheric oscillation, under the influence of the
earth’s radial magnetic forces and the variable conductivity of the air, in producing

* That there is a highly condueting layer in the upper atmosphere is also indicated by the bending of
electric waves round the earth,
