Received December 30, 1878, —Read January 16, 1879. Iv my previous papers on this subject the considerations are sufficiently explained
which originally induced me to defer any systematic investigation concerning the his-
tology of the Medusz, until the more important of the physiological observations
should have been completed. While preparing the material for these papers, I was
not blind to the fact that it served still further to ripen the promise that a careful
development of the histology of the Meduse would prove highly remunerative in mor-
phological results. But I felt that, even if no other workers should enter the field
from the side of morphology, it was more desirable that the physiology of these
primitive nervous tissues should be speedily worked out than that their structural
peculiarities should be 80. Whether or not this view was a wise one, in the result it
has proved beneficial; for nob only was I fortunate enough to procure the co-operation
of 80 competent an histologist as my friend Mr. SoHArER in working out the histology
of the covered-eyed Medusz, but contemporaneously with his researches there was also
being carried on by Messrs. O. and R. HerrwiG a most painstaking and thorough
investigation of the histology of the naked-eyed Medusze, At the same time, als0,
Professor E1MER had been continuing his microscopical researches.
