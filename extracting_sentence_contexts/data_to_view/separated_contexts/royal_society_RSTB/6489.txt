These first appear at the point of angulation of each arch between the epi- and
cerato-branchial, and form a short series with a very characteristic festoon appearance,
the attached bases of the denticles making a narrow U. It seems certain that the
development of these structures began on the first arch, the others following in turn,

fication of the mandibular arch is complete. The fact of the existence of so many different species in Lebach makes it impossible
to trace the course of this calcification in detail. When fully developed in the largest
heads, e.g. D.M.S.W.
