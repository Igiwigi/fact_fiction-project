the cephalisation coefficient does not run strictly parallel to the increase of index,


ARIENS KAPPERS ON SOME CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SKULL AND BRAIN. 403

It is beyond the scope of this communication to deal with these influences, which would
require a paper of much larger size than this. They have been, however, briefly sum-
marised by Baster (1925) and Srockarp (1931).

The influence of body size on the index of the skull is, nevertheless, observed with
man. Prrrarp* and Donicr called attention to the fact that, ceteris paribus,
taller men tend to have longer skulls. It is also said that of all African Negro races
only the Pygmies “ tend to brachycephaly ” (SELIGMAN, 1900).

Still the influence of body size on skull form in adult man is of little importance
compared to other influences.

Whatever may be the cause or causes for the various shapes of the human skull the
correlation it shows with the brain is more evident than has hitherto been realised.

In a general way differences in the brain correlated with the shape of the skull were
already recognised by Catori (1870), Meyer (1871), and Riprnaer (1877), who called
attention in a general manner to the more curved character of sagittal sulci in brachy-
