The fact that the bacilli are attacked at first exclusively by the eosinophile cells
as clearly shown in the following way :â€”About 0-2 cub. centim. of a fresh bouillon
Glture of anthrax was injected into the peritoneal cavity of a pithed Frog. When
By minutes had elapsed the cavity was opened and film preparations made, and

# was found that no less than 82 per cent. of the eosinophile cells were in contact
With bacilli.
