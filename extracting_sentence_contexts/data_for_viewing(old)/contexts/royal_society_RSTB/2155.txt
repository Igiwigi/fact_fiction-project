2 But after all the crucial point is the serial number of the spinal nerves which supply
Sthe girdles, and this is, of course, absolutely independent of the number of vertebral
Scentra. This important truth helps us to understand or see our way through the
& following difficulties. Firstly, the fact that a nerve may partly pass through the
= girdle and partly not (fig. 3, and fig. 2, Nos. 4 (1.), 31 (r.), 36 (1), 37 (v.) ) does not show
& that rigidity of the girdle-piercing nerve, which is one of the points that the
"g acceptance of the excalation theory would lead one to maintain. Secondly, the
'B girdle nerve may vary on the two sides of the same individual (fig. 2, Nos. 5 and 6).
On the excalation theory we should expect to find half a vertebra somewhere or other
& striving to connect the two halves of the animal together. Such a case was not found.
Though the evidence against the excalation theory may not amount to very much,
yet it must be remembered that the evidence for it is also slender, and such being the
case it seems best to turn to a theory which offers an explanation of all the facts, and
to attribute these various phenomena to the migration of the limb. We must suppose
that the whole limb has secondarily wandered forward, and that simultaneously
with this process a formation of half vertebree from whole vertebre has occurred,
owing to division of the latter, due probably to mechanical reasons (GADow, p. 195).
A small piece of evidence bearing upon this point lies in the fact that in one instance
the last whole vertebra was on one side divided into half vertebree, whilst on the

other it remained entire (fig. 6), and similar instances have also been observed by
Professor Mayer. â€˜This condition must not be confused with the half of a vertebra
