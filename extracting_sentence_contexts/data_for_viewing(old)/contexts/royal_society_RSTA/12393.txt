this semi-solid mass longer to reach the equilibrium condition than is required for the
liquid in No 2.

To obtain the observations on December 22, the heating apparatus had been
turned off and the windows of the room left open on the two previous nights.
On December 21 there was a thick coating of ice on the bath which continued for
one or two days; longer observations were made on December 22. Dr. Scuusrer’s
cell, No. 97, had been taken to London a few days previously.

A number of observations on the difference between the Cell No. 90 and the
standard were made during the absolute determination of the E.M.F. Several of
fiese confirm the fact that No. 90 gained its temperature equilibrium more slowly
‘ian No. 1. Thus, between the morning and evening of August 14, the tempera-

of the bath rose by 1°. The difference between No. 90 and No. 1 increased from
220 5 units.
Other observations again showed that it takes some time for No. 1 to change its
Wlue. Thus, on August 15, the bath was at 18°1, and the air in the test tube
round No. 1 was about 0°'5 higher; the difference in E.M.F. between Nos. 90 and 1
vais 5. No. 1 was then taken out of the test tube and placed in the bath with
Ni. 90. In about three hours the difference had fallen to 3, at which it remained
for some time.
‘Similar effects were noted again during the early part of this year. On January 19
Be room had been cooled down to about 9°C. About a week later the difference
