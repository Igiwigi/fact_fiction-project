experiment by means of wires sealed through the walls of the tube, but this would
introduce considerable complication. The velocities per unit potential slope, obtained
as above, are not dealt with in the present paper; but it may be mentioned that they
show (in accordance with conductivity results obtained by ARRHENTUS and others) a
considerable percentage reduction in solid jelly as compared with aqueous solutions,
Shut a reduction which is, at all events approximately, the same for different salts.
“The values of the relative velocities of the different ions should, therefore, be fairly
“gcomparable with those found by the older methods.

Bot the assumption that the observed velocities of the boundaries are determined by,
Sand may be taken as indicative of, those of the intermediate colourless ions, or that
£no mixing of these with their coloured pursuers occurs. In support of this there are
Eboth experimental facts and theory.
2 At the end of an experiment in which the tube was originally full of a strong
“Zchloride jelly, the author has frequently melted out the yellow part (without dis-
Sturbing the blue, which consists of CuCl,), and tested it for chlorine without finding
Bore than, at most, a barely perceptible trace. After one experiment with KCI, in
‘Swhich a wide tube was employed, so that the quantities were considerable, only a
doubtful trace of potassium could be found in the blue part, after separation of the

= Less direct, but no less striking, evidence to the same effect is afforded by the fact,
gestablished by preliminary experiments, that the ratio of velocities of the blue and
& yellow boundaries is practically the same in different experiments with the same
BS concentration of the same salt, no matter how the dimensions of the tube be
