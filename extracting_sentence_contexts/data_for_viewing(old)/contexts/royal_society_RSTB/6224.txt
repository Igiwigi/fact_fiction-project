After the 90th day the few remaining female tachinoides died rapidly, the last
survivor on the 105th day. The experiments with submorsitans were discontinued
at the 40th day. It is felt that the figures show clearly that the experimental
conditions were not unsuitable for either species.

Facts relating to reproduction are also shown in Table IV. The birth-rates have
been standardized and are presented as puparia per 100 female-days. The figure
in the table gives the birth-rate for a five-day period (for a ten-day period after 50th
day). With Â¢achinoides, the first puparium was generally found between the 16th
and 19th day ; for submorsitans the period is a little longer, no puparia being found
before the 19th day, and none till the 20th or 21st in some cages. After this point
the normal production of puparia for tachinoides or submorsitans is between two and
six per 100 female-days, but there are great differences between different cages. Our
records only extend to 90 days (tachinoides) and 40 days (submorsitans), but up to
that point there is no evidence of falling birth-rate. Indeed in tachinoides, the rate
(puparia per 100 female-days) was consistently higher after the 45th day than
before, but the figures are not reliable as the total number of females was then
considerably reduced, and the temperature in the cupboard was rising.
