Higher Fungi oceurring as Impurities in the Ginger-beer plant.

I have now concluded the biological analysis of the Ginger-beer plant, so far as
the essential constituents, and the commonest foreign yeasts and Schizomycetes are
concerned. It remains to place on record, however, the existence in the specimens
examined of a number of higher mycelial forms of fungi, which, different as they are
in detail, may all be regarded as of the nature of “ moulds.”

Looking at all that is known of the lumps of Ginger-beer plant, and how they
are handed about in the fresh state, and remembering the way the ordinary fermenta-
tions are carried on in country houses, &c., it might be predicted off-hand that all
kinds of spores of common mould-fungi would get into the mixtures and contaminate
them. As matter of fact, I never had a specimen of the Ginger-beer plant sent to
me that did not contain several species of these mould-fungi. I attribute the
presence of these intruders to three chief sources :—

(1.) To the ingredients employed—ordinary unboiled epring-, well-, or tap-water,
common sugar and ginger direct from the grocer’s, and, of course, unsterilised. Proof
of this may be obtained by anyone who places a solution of ordinary sugar and water,
with a lump of ginger in it, in an open vessel, and in a rather warm room, for forty-
eight hours or so; the brew swarms with yeasts, bacteria, and mould-fungi of various
kinds.

(2.) Lo the vessels—ordinary jugs, jars, pipkins, &., of a household—the walls of
which are, of course, never biologically clean without special treatment.
