through them to fill in the interpolated values; I rub out the curve when used. It
must be remembered that close accuracy in these terms would be mere pedantry.

M, N are computed to the decimal of a minute, and the decimal part may be
useful for drawing the pencil interpolation curves, but the result should be tabulated
only to the nearest minute. Similarly the third decimal in P and Q may be dropped.

The interpolation of ¢ and f’ follows the same plan, but it must be borne in mind
that these functions change sign in opposite months, and this consideration is important
when we come to interpolate for © = August + 10°, and + 20°.

When there is an evanescent tide (as in the case of March, 18") the corrections
M, N, R become infinite. As a practical solution this is absurd, and the fact is that
there may or may not be a H. W. according to the values of 8 and I. Again,
in other parts of this and other lunations there may be no H. W., although the tide-
table predicts one. In all such cases there is a long period of four or five hours
duration of nearly slack water, and it is accordingly almost a matter of indifference
whether or not a small H. W. is predicted. It would necessitate very laborious com-
putations to make correct predictions in these cases, and the result would not be
worth the labour. I have adopted, therefore, a makeshift, and have replaced H. W.
by the height of water and time when the rate of change of water level is a minimum.

Tt has been proposed above that P, Q, S shall be computed with a conjectural
A= + 90°, and this is better than the plan which I actually adopted in my experi-
mental table for Aden, of which a sample is given below.* The practical point to
