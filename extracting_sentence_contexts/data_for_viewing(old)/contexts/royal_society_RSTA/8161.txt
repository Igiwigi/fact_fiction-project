in Kornta’s theory do not hold when ridges are formed ; they can be made to prevail
by reducing the intensity of the sound, but precisely when these conditions hold the
ridges, which _Kornie’s theory is constructed to explain, do not form at all.

In the following pages it is shown how vortex motion, combined with the general
circulation between antinode and node described in the paper just cited,t can be made
to account for the dust figures hitherto observed, and new features of the behaviour
of dust particles in a vibrating gas are described and explained.

2. The Older Dust Phenomena.

The observations hitherto published on the dust groupings in a sounding tube suffer
first of all from a lack of system, and secondly, from the fact that the observations
have all been made with intermittent sounds produced by stroking a rod. Not only
does this procedure mean’ that the observations and measurements are nearly all
carried out after the sound has ceased, but also the conditions which produce the
groupings are never maintained long enough for it to be certain that the final stable
arrangement, corresponding to the particular vibration of the air, has been reached.
Again, the intensity of the sound so produced grows to a maximum and dies down
again within the short duration of the stroking of the rod, so that, even in a rough and
qualitative way, it is hard to estimate the intensity to which the grouping corresponds.
