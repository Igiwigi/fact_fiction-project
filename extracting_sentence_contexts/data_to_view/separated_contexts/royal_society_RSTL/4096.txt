The mercury was excessively agitated, rising
up in the form of a cone when it was positive, and sinking considerably below the
positive point when it was negative. The quantity of vapour thrown off by the mer-
cury during this experiment filled the bell so quickly that it was not easy to observe
the details. I $hall terminate this section by stating a fact which appears to me to be import-
ant ; it is the influence which the nature of the metallic points forming the electrodes
exercises on the temperature which they acquire in relation to the production of the
voltaic are. If the two points are of the same metal, both platinum, or both silver,
the positive one alone becomes incandescent throughout its whole length. If the
Silver point be positive and that of the platinum negatiye, the latter becomes incan-
descent, and the silver one is much less heated.
