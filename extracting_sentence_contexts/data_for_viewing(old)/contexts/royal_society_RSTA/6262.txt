smoothed fits to the data. CFR graphs for people aged under 45 are excluded as they are so low. Shading shows uncertainty
introduced by smoothing day-to-day variations, excluding errors on the mean from small-number statistics in September 2020
and May 2021. The eye-catching peak for the 90-+ age group in June 2021 is probably a small-number effect, and it can be
eliminated completely by combining the 85-89 and 90+ age groups. (Online version in colour.)

The function ge is dependent on age group; we use separate functions for each five-year
age band. If the lethality of the infection had remained constant throughout the epidemic, then
80(t) would be constant. If fact, its changes as shown in figure 9 provide a powerful image of the
changing lethality of the epidemic. There are three salient features.

The Alpha variant was accompanied by a pronounced increase in the CFR 8 C(t), in all age
groups and regions through December, plateauing once Alpha became ubiquitous by 2021 [9]. The
sharp decline in 2021, and the onset of the effect in the oldest age group first, can be associated
with the effect of the vaccine on causing milder infections. The age-dependence of CFR is so
pronounced that for the under-45 population (not shown) statistics are too poor for reasonable
analysis.

A discernable blip in the drop of the CFR during May 2021 could be associated with the arrival
of the Delta variant (figure 9).
