where the time interval [fo,t;] contains one wave cycle and T = t; — to. Then we have 68(t) -
68 (tg) = 2m, which gives that

Using the fact that 6° is a smooth function which is approximately a constant over one wave cycle,
it follows that
[@YOIT~6°(h) — (to) = 2x, Vt [tot]

Using the above approximation, we get

Recall that the degree of nonlinearity is defined as
