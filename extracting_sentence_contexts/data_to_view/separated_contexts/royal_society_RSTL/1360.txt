bute the appearance to the presence of titanium ; but in this
we were 'mistaken; the fact was, we had unintentionally
made wootz. The button, by analysis, gave a little silex and
alumine, but not an atom of titanium ; menachanite, in a par-
ticular tate of preparation, was used : this might possibly
contain the‚Äù earths or their basis, or they may have formed
a part of the crucible. M.
