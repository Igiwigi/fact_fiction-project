The key conclusion from these results is that if a significant, let alone unbounded, growth
of enstrophy is to be achieved in finite time, it must be associated with initial data ug other than
the extreme vortex states Ug, saturating the upper bound in estimate (1.10) on the instantaneous
rate of growth of enstrophy, cf. (4.1). More specifically, assuming the instantaneous rate of growth of enstrophy in the form dé/dt =
CE“ with some prefactor C > 0, any exponent a > 2 will cause €(u(t)) to become unbounded at
some finite time to = to(@) if this rate of growth is sustained over the interval [0, to). The fact that
there is no blow-up when 1 < a@ <2 follows from the observation that one factor of € in (1.10) can

Evidently, as the rate of growth of enstrophy slows down when a — 2*, for blow-up to occur
this minimum growth rate must be sustained over windows of time with increasing length, i.e.
ty > co asa — 27. Toassess the feasibility of such a scenario, the following optimization problem
was considered in [13].
