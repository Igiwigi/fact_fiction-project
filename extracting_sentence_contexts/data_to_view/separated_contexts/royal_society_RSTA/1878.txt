In the first
place, it is incorrect to suppose that the obliquely emergent radiation will be given by
replacing o, by o, sec 9. In the second place, the formula must not be held to imply
that the initially incident beam is cut down in the ratio 1/(1-+-¢,) during transit
through the layer. The simple formula (22) somewhat obscures the fact that the
emergent radiation is the sum of two parts, the depleted incident beam and the light

mean coefficient of scattering of a thin plane layer for all directions. MR. E. A. MILNE ON RADIATIVE EQUILIBRIUM, 229

(originally derived from the incident beam) scattered into the beam ; and the formula
is better written in the form corresponding to its derivation,
