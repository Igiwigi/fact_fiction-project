driving these circulations (see Kuhlbrodt et al. 2007 for a review), although there
is no simple or necessary link between mechanical energy supply and oceanic
heat transport (e.g. Saenko & Weaver 2004). Ocean stratification determines the
structure and strength of the response to this mechanical driving. Inherent in the
use of the terms MOC and AMOC is the fact that wind and buoyancy forcing are
inseparable, and that wind and tidal forcing play a fundamental role in providing
the energy required for turbulent mixing within the ocean.

The existence and structure of the MOC is fundamentally connected with the
locations of deep water formation in the ocean. The two main constituent water
masses of the deep North Atlantic Ocean—North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW)
at the bottom and Labrador Sea Water at an intermediate level—are currently
formed in the Greenland—Iceland—Norwegian Seas and the Labrador Sea,
respectively. Deep convection also occurs at a number of locations around
Antarctica, but the dense bottom water is susceptible to being trapped by
topographic sills (as in the Bransfield Strait) or local circulation patterns (not
excluding the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, ACC). In the Southern Ocean,
