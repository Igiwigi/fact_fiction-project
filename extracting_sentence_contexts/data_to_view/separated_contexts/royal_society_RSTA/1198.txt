This has the advantage of reconciling Neptuneâ€™s CO and D/H
measurements and using known ice sources. A similar case can also be made for Uranus being a rock giant. The case for Uranus is in fact
more straightforward, as there is no observed tropospheric CO requiring an explanation, either
in terms of highly enriched O/H or external cometary source. Definitively distinguishing between ice and rock giant scenarios on Uranus and Neptune
will require a dedicated future mission with orbiter and entry probe elements [28,29,106]. A
key measurement to make with such a probe would be the CO profile down to at least 10 bar
from a mass spectrometer.
