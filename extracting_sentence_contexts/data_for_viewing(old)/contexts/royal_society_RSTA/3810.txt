within the logarithmic region of the boundary layer as seen in the mean profile. The outer peak is
located close to the knee of the variance profile, where the variance starts to decrease above this
wall-normal location. These features are consistent with existing data on canonical high Reynolds

number turbulent boundary layers. : 2

It can be seen that the energy of the outer peak grows with increasing turbulence intensity : =
owing to the increasing energy content of the large scales in the free stream. These high-energy is
scales in the free-stream penetrate the boundary layer and attain a local maximum within the Los
outer region of the boundary layer. In this sense, the increase in FST can be viewed as ‘simulating’ 1S
an increase in Re; for a canonical boundary layer. It should also be noted that the peak in the pre- [oS
multiplied energy spectrum occurs at length scales near 106, which is consistent with the energetic : S
scales of high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layers. This dominant scale was, in fact, a : S
deliberate choice made when establishing the scales of the FST. It is certainly possible to change : s
this dominant scale by altering the active-grid operation mode as well as by altering the location : S

of the flat plate relative to the grid. In this study, we are specifically interested in isolating the
scale interactions where the energy containing large scales are of O(105) and therefore, we chose
the mode of grid operation to produce these dominant scales.

The energetic scales in the free-stream (as well as the outer region) have a footprint in the
near-wall region. There is a shift of the energy towards long wavelengths (i.e. low wavenumbers)
very near the wall. The extent of the penetration depends on the FST level and this essentially
‘simulates’ the effect of increasing Reynolds number. Correspondingly, the amplitude of the near-
wall peak in the variance profiles is amplified with increasing FST level. In addition to this direct
