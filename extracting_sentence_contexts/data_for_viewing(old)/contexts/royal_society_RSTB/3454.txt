PROF. H. H. W. PEARSON: FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON WELWITSCHIA. 359

The identification of the male and female nuclei just prior to the process of
fertilisation is often difficult, even when the latter is quiescent in a large oosphere.
Here the male nucleus is easily distinguished by its cytoplasmic sheath, its
constantly large nucleolus and, very frequently, by its elongated form. More
serious difliculty is occasioned by the resemblance between some forms of the
tube-nucleus and the female gametes. In view of the fact that fertilisation occurs
within the male cytoplasm, it becomes especially important to distinguish the one
from the other. In well-fixed material the female nucleus is approximately spherical
in form and its nucleolus is almost invariably smaller than that of the tube-nucleus.
More important, however, is the fact that before contact between the two tubes is
elfected the tube-nucleus is either already absorbed or at least shows very distinct
signs of deterioration. Occasionally, however, undoubted female nuclei have been
seen which very closely resemble a common form of the tube-nucleus (ef: figs. 29
and 46). While these are almost certainly deteriorated in fixation their occasional
oceurrence renders necessary the exercise of considerable caution in identifying as
female a nucleus lying just in front of the male cytoplasm after communication
between the two tubes has been established.

While the direction of growth of the embryo-sac-tubes is in general more or less
away from the axial line of the nucellar cone, that of the pollen-tubes is rather
towards it. The meeting of the two sets of tubes occurs usually near the axis of
that part of the nucellar cone which lies between the lines B and C (text-figure).
