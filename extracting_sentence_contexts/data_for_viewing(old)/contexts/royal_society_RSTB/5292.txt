of the “ fine ” vessels is far more rich and elaborate than where the connective tissues
are more dense and fibrous.

By comparing the above account of the distribution of the main trunks of the “ fine ”’
system in the Cod with that already published for Lophius (4, p. 29), it will be apparent
that the two agree in their broader outlines, though differing in minor details. There
is, however, one very considerable difference : in Lophius the system is limited to the
head and forepart of the body, but in the Cod it extends along the aorta to the
caudal fin.

It is possible that this difference in distribution is apparent only and is due to dis-
continuity of the cephalic and trunk portions, so that injection of the one part does not
fill the other. That this may be so is suggested (1) by the fact that Favaro (7) figures
in a cross-section of the tail of Lophius a vessel similar in position and appearance to the
main aortic trunk of the “ fine ” vessel system in the Cod, and (2) because in different ‘
individuals of the Cod there is great variety in the size of the aortic “ fine ” vessel in j
the abdominal region. In some it is easy to find when empty, in others (though fish of
larger size) it could not be seen at all, and in one specimen, in which the system was
injected from the gills, it was small, and vanished about the middle of the abdomen.

The * fine” vessel system in Pagrus.—An injection of the “fine” vessels was made
in a large species of Pagrus, the mass being introduced into the branch of this system
that accompanies the ventral branch of the hypobranchial artery. The injection mass
penetrated well enough to discolour, in patches, the mucous membrane of the tongue,
gill-arches and palate. So far as I could ascertain it was confined to the “ fine ” vessel
