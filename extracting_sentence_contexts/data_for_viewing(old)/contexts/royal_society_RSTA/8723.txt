SusPENDING one pole of a carbon are and keeping the other pole fixed it was found
that there was an apparent repulsion between them. There is in fact a pressure
upon each electrode which tends to separate them. The first part of this paper is
devoted to the experimental methods of estimating this pressure, the second to a
discussion of its origin.

PART IL—EXPERIMENTAL.

Three series of observations have been made, the original observations and
preliminary series by DurrreLp in 1912,* the second series in conjunction with
Burnuaw, and the third in conjunction with Davis. In spite of the very small
forces examined the three series agree within reasonable limits. The general form
of the apparatus (fig. 1) was the same in each series, though there were important
differences in the dispositions of the carbons in different sets of experiments.
