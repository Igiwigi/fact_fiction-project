The
effect was also obtained in air at atmospheric pressure and in a vacuum produced by
liquid air and charcoal, where it was impossible for the wire to come in contact with
mercury vapour or vapours given out by phosphorus pentoxide. Whatever the cause of this effect may turn out to be, it is clear that it might have
completely vitiated the present measurements of the leak in oxygen and other gases. Tn fact, the following considerations will show that a small trace of the above effect
might easily simulate the effects investigated. When the gas pressure is very low,
