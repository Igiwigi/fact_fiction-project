the almost perfect yacuum surrounding the surface shone upon, or that it will produce

124. Facts tested and verified by numerous experiments, but scarcely more than
touched upon in the present paper, are, I think, gradually shaping themselyes in order,
in my mind, and will, 1 hope, aid me in evolving a theory which will account for all the
phenomena. But I wish to avoid giving any theory on the subject until T have accu-
mulated a sufficient number of these facts. The facts will then tell their own tale ; the
conditions under which they invariably occur will give the laws; and the theory will
follow without much difficulty. In the eloquent words of Sir Huxeary Davy, © When
I consider the yariety of theories which may be formed on the slender foundation of
one or two facts, I am convinced that it is the business of the true philosopher to avoid
them altogether. It is more laborious to accumulate facts than to reason concerning

them; but one good experiment is of more yalue than the ingenuity of a brain like
Newrox's.”
