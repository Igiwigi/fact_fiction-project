pinnules of this plant exhibit aspects which resemble those of figs. 13 & 14 in the
closest manner, rendering the conclusion that our Oldham fossil is generically, if not
specifically, identical with the above plant, an exceedingly probable one.

The acceptance of this conclusion demonstrates two facts connected with the Carbo-
niferous ferns :—first, that their vascular bundles are not necessarily, like those of
living ferns, surrounded by a definite investing cylinder of prosenchyma; and, secondly,
that the prosenchymatous fibres of their snbepidermal tissues (the sclerenchyma of
authors) do not, as in recent ferns, constitnte an uninterrupted investing layer, but
that it is broken up into a network of fibrous bands arranged longitudinally, and
through the long narrow meshes of which some of the parenchymatous cells of the
S middle bark reach the epidermal surface. We shall find these two facts of importance,
© throwing light upon some other examples awaiting examination.

Z One of the earliest discoyered of the. plants from the rich storehouse of the upper
S foot coal-seam near Oldham was one of which Mr. Bixxey exhibited a section at
S the meeting of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society held on January 9th,
& 1872, when he proposed to give to the plant the name of Stauropteris Oldhamia.
& As in the preceding instance, I have obtained specimens of this petiole in every stage
'Z of growth, from the largest examples down to the smallest twigs. One of the most
= beautiful, it is also one of the most perplexing of the plants of the Coal-measures—not
B as regards the details of its structure, since these are clearer than in most of these
> objects, but the interpretation of them presents several difficulties. 'The largest of the
S transyerse sections (Plate LIL. fig. 20) are ugually about 125 in diameter. The vas-
