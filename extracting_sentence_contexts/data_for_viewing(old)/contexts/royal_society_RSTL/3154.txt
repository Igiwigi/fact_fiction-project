tity is thrown off at once, Itſhould ſeem then;that theex-
ploſion in onecaſe, and the non-explofion in theother, de-
pended wholly upon the different quantities to be thrown
off: whence it will follow, that though a ſmall quantity
of electricity will paſs off ſilently upon a point, yet that
this power is very limited; for that if a fomewhat greater
quantity be applied ſuddenly to a ſharp point, it will not
paſs off filently, but create an exploſion 3 In wn to

The facts above related are a ſufficient anſwer to that
other experiment of Mr. NA1RNEY, in” which he exhi-
bited a ſharp point, that when perfectly communicating
with the earth drew off the eledricity ſilently from the
prime condu@or; but received exploſions freely, when
the communication was broken by interpofing little
iſthmuſes of ſealing wax, This experiment, it is true,
