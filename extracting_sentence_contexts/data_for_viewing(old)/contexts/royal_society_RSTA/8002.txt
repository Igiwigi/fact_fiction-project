When n = 8 the values of
é3 Cy Dg and 5,9
are somewhat simpler.
From (17)
&3 = 4 (F¥s*7 +1+ 1138"),

the other terms being quite negligible. With little error in fact
és = 4.
C3 = — a1 + 1 — Yas,

and we find easily, since the terms containing higher powers of « than the second are
quite negligible, that

With sufficient accuracy we may put
