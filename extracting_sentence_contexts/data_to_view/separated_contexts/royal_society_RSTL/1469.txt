This power writers upon this subject have been at great
pains to investigate and explain. The motion of the crystal-
line humour forwards and backwards, was asserted by some to
be the cause ; while others supposed in the eye a power to al-
ter its shape, so as to shorten or lengthen its axis, which
altered the distance between the crystalline humour and the
point of impression ; but we should consider that a part of the
eye is itself a refractor, and that if its shape be altered s0 as to
remove the crystalline humour from the point of impression, in
order to enable it to bring a distant object to its proper focus
on the retina, this effect will be in some degree counteracted
by the anterior part of the eye refracting more than before, by
being rendered more convex. But we have, in fact, no power
capable of producing this effect ; for the straight muscles, s0
far from appearing to have this power, have been even sup-
posed to flatten the eye, and shorten its axis: and it is very
possible that the action of these muscles is such as tends to
both effects; but being in opposition to each other, the eye re-
tains its shape, the insertion of these muscles being much
more forwards than appears to be necessary for the simple
motions of the eye. Further, when we consider that in many
animals the shape of the eye is unalterable, as in all of the

whale tribe, the sclerotic coat being above half an inch thick,
and composed of a strong tendinous substance. In many fish
this coat is composed of cartilage; and in all birds the anterior
part of it is (I believe) composed of bone.
