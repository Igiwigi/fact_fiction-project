then the system C, will be called the shortest system of confidence intervals.

The justification of this terminology is clear. When using C,, the true value of
6, = 0,° will be covered with the prescribed frequency « and any other value
6’, # 0,°, with a frequency not exceeding that corresponding to any other system,
C corresponding to the same confidence coefficient «. This could be described by
saying that the intervals 5, (E) are not unnecessarily broad.

The problem of determining the shortest system of confidence intervals is
immediately reduced to that of finding appropriate regions of acceptance. In fact,

using the Proposition I and II or the Corollary I expressed by (26), we may rewrite
the condition (97) as follows :
PifBie As (0/1) |0,°} :P {(EeA.(6%)[ 81°), ©. 3 se (98)
where A, (6,) and A (6,) denote the regions of acceptance leading to the systems
of confidence intervals C, and C respectively.

If C, is the shortest system, then (98) should hold whatever 6,° and 6’, and what-
ever the regions of acceptance A (6;), provided they correspond to the fixed confi-
dence coefficient «. The condition (98) concerns the region of acceptance Ay (4'1),
and it must be combined with that expressed by the Proposition III, namely that
