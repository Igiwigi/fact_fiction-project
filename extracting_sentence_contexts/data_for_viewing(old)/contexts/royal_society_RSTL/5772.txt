218 PROFESSOR TYNDALL ON SOME PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ICE.

Such, if I mistake not, are the properties of radiant heat which modern physics have
revealed; and I think they render it evident, that the hypothesis of M. AGas81z and ay
Messrs. SCHLAGINTWEIT was accepted without due regard to its consequences. :

But as the sun does reach the lower strata of the atmosphere, it may be thought that
we are protected from its effects by the radiation from the air neutralizing its absorp-
tion. The fact however is, that air may be heated to an intense degree without showing
any measureable amount of radiation. The hot current from an Argand chimney pro-
duces, according to MELLONT, no sensible effect upon a delicate thermo-electric appa-
ratus. Hence it is not because the air gets rid of its heat by radiation, but simply
because its power of absorption is infinitely behind that supposed by the hypothesis of
M. A6a881z and the Messrs. SCHLAGINTWEIT, that animal and vegetable existence at the
earth's surface is possIble.

When air-bubbles occurred in those portions of the ice where the liquid disks
appeared, the associated water spread out on planes parallel to those of the disks,
evidently in consequence of the freer yielding of the ice in these planes. Keeping this
remark in view and comparing fig. 1 with fig. 10, plate 4 of M. Acass1z Atlas, the
resemblance of both phenomena will at once be perceived. The glacier ice, like the
