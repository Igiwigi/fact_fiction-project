of them to that'science, to have the kindness to join with me in
the investigation I had undertaken. The Royal Society will
* perceive, in the detail given by Mr. Cuexevix himself, of the
analyses which he has made, not only of the different varieties |
of corundum, but also of the substances which accompany this
stone in its matrix, how very satisfactory to science are the
results of those analyses; insomuch, that I can now offer to the
Society, as one of the best established truths, what, in the year
1798, I mentioned merely as a suspicion which had great pro-
bability in its favour; and can also, in consequence of the
particular study I have made of all the varieties of stones
that Ihave here joined together, under the general denomi-
nation of corundum, present to the Society a collection of facts,
for the most part unknown, which, altogether, may be considered
as forming a mineralogical history of this substance. Although the epithet oriental has been for a long time used
by the lapidaries, to express, in gems. or precious stones, a
degree of hardness superior to that. of other stones, (the
diamond excepted,) which made; them capable of taking a
more brilliant polish ; and although, following the example of
the lapidaries, naturalists had employed the same term by
way of distinguishing them, there still remained a great uncer-
tainty, respecting the nature of the analogy which really existed
between the various stones to which the above epithet was
applied. The nomenclature here spoken of was not, at its origin, the
result of any mineralogical knowledge; in consequence of
which, a number of stones, of a totally different nature, were
united together, for no other reason but because, among those
of the same colour, some were found to be of a much superior

degree of hardness to others ; and, as those which were the hard-
est most commonly came from the East Indies, all hard gems were
called oriental, as a general mark of discrimination.
