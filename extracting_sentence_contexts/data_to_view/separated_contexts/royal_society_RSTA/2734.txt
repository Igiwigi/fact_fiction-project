13 made it impos-
sible for silver to splash out during stirring, and there seems no way of accounting for
an indium content greater than that calculated from the weights of metals used. Duplicate analyses also gave direct evidence of segregation, but since it was desired
to save the alloys made from the very pure metal, it was not thought advisable to
dissolve all the ingots for analysis, and we have, therefore, plotted the liquidus curve
from the synthetic composition of the alloys. This policy appears justified in view
of the fact that the annealing experiments gave no indication of loss of indium by

volatilization, and that in the preparation of the chill castings the desired composition
was usually obtained very closely in spite of the small quantities used. As will be seen
from Table XXV, the synthetic compositions, and those determined by analysis, agree
within 0-36°/,, except for one specimen, where there is a very large difference.* The
liquidus points from the synthetic compositions lie well on a smooth curve, which is
about 3° lower than the curve which would be drawn if the analytical compositions
were used (omitting the one alloy in which the analysis is clearly wrong).
