However, the same paper shows that for each temperature t â‚¬ {2,3,4,...}
there is a tile set U, that is intrinsically universal for the class of two-handed systems that work
at temperature t. Also, there is an infinite hierarchy of classes of such systems with each level
strictly more powerful (can assemble more complicated shapes) than the one below. In fact there
are an infinite set of such hierarchies, as described in the caption of figure 2. These results give a
formalization of the intuition that multiple long range interactions are more powerful than fewer
long range interactions in the two-handed model. By combining results from [25,46], we get that there is a tile set for the two-handed model
that (at temperature 2) simulates any tile assembly system T of the abstract Tile Assembly
Model.
