Movement of Particles in the Gutâ€”I1. By Muscular Contraction of the Walls

The oesophagus and hindgut of Jorunna lie relatively free within the body cavity,
the only attachment to surrounding organs is by thin mesenteries of connective
tissue. This fact has considerable significance, since it admits of the possibility of
peristalsis, or some similar muscular movement of the gut wall, playing a part in the
transference of particles. The possible existence of such a mechanism is confirmed by the fact that if the
oesophagus, or hindgut, be removed by dissection and examined in sea water, they
undergo vigorous writhing movements due to muscular contraction of their walls. In addition, occasional waves of contraction, possibly comparable to the peristaltic
contraction of the gut of vertebrates, may be observed in the excised pieces of gut.
