ACTION OF SULPHURIC ACID UPON THE AMIDES AND NITRILES. 479

The formula adopted by M. Lins for the barium-salt is
CH, Bas, O,.
If we double this formula we arrive at the expression

which represents disulphometholate of barium with 4 equivalents of water of crystal-
lization. Our experiments have actually proved that this salt contains indeed 4 equi-
valents of water, and that this water is retained at. 100* C., the temperature at which
M. L1zsi6 dried his salt before submitting it to analysis.

More recently M. ReprENBAcHER and M. WETHERELL have investigated the same
Sdarium- salt, but neither of them appears to have remarked the fact, that this sult loses
Srater between 100? and 200%. M. RepTrenBacueR analysed a salt which M. LigsiG
Had prepared himself. M. WerTHERELL examined a salt which he obtained as a
Secondary product in his researches on sulphate of ethyl.
= Although we have no longer any doubt regarding the identity of methionic acid
zand disulphometholic acid, we should have liked to offer a direct experimental proof
Sf our opinion by an analysis of the barium-salt obtained either by M. Ligmi6's or
2M. WerTHERELL's process. We have therefore repeatedly endeavoured to prepare the
Zuethionate of barium both by M. LizBic's and M. WerTaegrELL's method. By follow-

Sng exactly the plan described by these chemists, we have actually succeeded in obtain-
-Zinga alt possessing all the characters of disulphometholate of barium. Unfortunately,
Salthough we worked upon rather a large scale, we did not succeed in obtaining by
