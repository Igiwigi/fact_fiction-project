muscles are inserted on the outturned margin of the thickened trough-like floor of the
pharynx (figure 8 H, I, d.c.m.).

It will be evident that the antagonistic action of these two components of the pharyngeal
musculature must result in the elevation and depression of the roof of the pharynx.

The description which I have given of the pharynx of Calandra agrees in general with
that given by McClenahan (1904) for Mononychus. It is to be noticed, however, that
McClenahan indicates in a sagittal half of the rostrum illustrated in figure 14 the presence
of spines on the floor of the rostrum as well as on the roof. In a transverse section illustrated
in figure 17, however, no such ventral spines are apparent, and no spines have been found
in this situation in Calandra. Both Ting (1933) and Murray & Tiegs (1935) refer to the
pharynx as the oesophagus, in spite of the fact that Ting mentions the ‘oesophagus’ as
possessing backwardly directed spines, and Murray & Tiegs illustrate the pharyngeal
dilator muscles.

(iii) The nerves and tracheae of the rostrum, and the ducts of the salivary glands. Dorsal to the
pharynx a median longitudinal blood channel (figure 10, h.m.) is separated from the
remainder of the haemocoele by laterally disposed membranous walls. Each wall is double,
its two layers enveloping the dilator muscles of the pharynx but being elsewhere closely
applied to each other (figure 10). In origin the median blood channel appears to be a
continuation of the aorta, which passes through the circumoesophageal nerve ring above
the gut and beneath the brain (figure 12, ao.). In figure 8 G, H, I, the median blood
channel lies between the right and left series of pharyngeal dilator muscles, and it will be
seen by reference to figure 8 F that it is confluent anteriorly with the remainder of the
