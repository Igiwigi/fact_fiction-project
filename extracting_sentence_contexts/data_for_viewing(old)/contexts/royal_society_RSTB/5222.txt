in comparable regions of the contrasted leaves. The data given represent the averages
of six counts, each of an area of one sq. millimetre. Some years ago the writer showed
that there was a certain degree of correlation between the area of a leaf and its vascular
supply (“ The determining factors in petiolar structure,” ‘ New Phytologist,’ vol. XI,
pp- 281-289, 1913), and hence we may assume that, for leaves at the same level on the
stem, the availability of water, as determined by the conducting tracts, although not
equal is approximately proportional to their needs. Ursprune and Bium have shown
that the absorbing power of the cell increases with its distance from the conducting
tissue, but determinations from comparable regions in each leaf eliminate errors due to
this factor. It is probable, therefore, that no appreciable difference obtains between
the internal factors affecting the two members of any pair, except those associated with
leaf size, but as regards external conditions, a slight error is probably introduced by the
fact that the two leaves at a node are not situated on the same side of the stem, otherwise
differences due to relative maturity and position on the plant are eliminated by only
comparing members of the same pair.

Consideration of the above data for Mercurialis perennis shows that, of all the fifty-six
pairs of leaves examined, in no less than forty instances (71-4 per cent.) the average
number of stomata per unit area was greater for the smaller than for the larger leaf of
the pair,
