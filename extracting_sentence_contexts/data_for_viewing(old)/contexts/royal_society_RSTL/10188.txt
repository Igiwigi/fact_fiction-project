appreciated, but I do 80 in order to point out the part which the presence or absence
of a siphonoglyphe may play in the arrangement of the group, and some other points
upon which the classification may turn.

There can be little doubt, I think, that the ancestral form of the Aleyonaria was
not colonial, but was a simple isolated individual differing but slightly from the
isolated genera which exisb at the present day.

The fact that the three genera of isolated Alcyonaria are remarkably rare, present
but few species, and have a wide geographical distribution (Monoxenia, coast of
Arabia, Haimea, Fiji Islands, and Hartea, west coast of Ireland), point to the
conclusion that they are the representatives of an ancient group which may have
been much larger than it is now.

It might therefore be advisable to separate these genera as a distinet group, which
might be called the PRoTO-ALCYONARIA.

The next step in the phylogeny was the formation from swch an isolated ancestor
of a colony. The formation of the colonies may have taken place in two ways :
first, by the formation of buds from the firs formed polyp ; and secondly, by the
intermediation of a stolon upon which the young buds were formed.
