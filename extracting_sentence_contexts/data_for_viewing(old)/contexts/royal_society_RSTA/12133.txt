us a beautiful and purely a band spectrum, while the third least volatile and more
metallic substance of largest atomic mass, and producing the densest vapour, yields a
band spectrum, together with a line spectrum. Several metals, such as nickel, yield
nothing but lines, others give us both lines and bands, as manganese and iron, while
tin, lead, silver, and gold yield very beautiful band spectra. Metalloids and non-
metallic elements are generally considered to be essentially different from metals,
since they emit channelled or band spectra at one temperature and line spectra
at another. It was, in fact, first laid down by PLtcker and Hrrrorr that “ There
is a certain number of elementary substances, which, when differently heated, furnish
two kinds of spectra of quite a different character, not having any line or any band
im common” (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ vol. 155, p. 6).

The discovery of this fact was of great importance, for it led to the conclusion that
as one spectrum of an element is replaced by another and totally different spectrum
of the same element, there must be an analogous change in the constitution of the
ether, indicating a new arrangement of the gaseous molecules, and this implies either
a chemical decomposition, or an allotropic condition of the vapour of the substance.
Piiicker and Hirrorr concluded that the same matter, in two allotropic states,
emitted different spectra, but the allotropy was dependent solely on temperature.
Band spectra they designated spectra of the 1st Order, and Line spectra, spectra of
the 2nd Order. The former have been fully recognized as the spectra of metal-
loids, such as carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, selenium, and tellurium, but it seems to
have been overlooked that Priicker and Hrrrorr observed spectra of the Ist Order
in the case of a few heavy metals, particularly lead and manganese. Metallic lead
and its compounds were found to yield the same band spectrum in the oxy-hydrogen
