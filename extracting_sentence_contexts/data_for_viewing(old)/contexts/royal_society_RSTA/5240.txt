of iron filings were dumped into international waters off the western coast of Canada, after
American businessman Russ George convinced a local aboriginal community to sponsor this as
an effort to replenish local salmon stocks while earning credits from global carbon markets. As
a result, the London Conventional and Protocol recently adopted a legally binding amendment
that would only allow ocean fertilization that is legitimate scientific research and subject to an
environmental impact assessment.

Another development of significance was the cancellation of the ‘test-bed’ stage of the SPICE
project in May 2012. A joint endeavour by a number of prominent UK universities, the SPICE
test-bed was intended to test the mechanics of aerosol delivery for SRM via a hose connected to
a balloon. The environmental impacts of this field test were known to be negligible; yet even a
preliminary version of the testing mechanism was cancelled in early 2012 due to opposition from
civil society groups and the fact that one of the involved scientists had taken out patents on a
related technology, as reported, for example, by Wilsdon [81].

The SPICE ‘test-bed’, despite its premature end, contained a degree of public engagement as
well as careful structuring and communication of the test’s goals and impacts in an attempt to
provide governance that goes beyond considerations of technical risk [82-84]. Meanwhile, the
transparency of the west coast OIF demonstration is characterized by different accounts [85]. Yet,
both may exemplify a number of challenges described earlier: the power of non-governmental
organization (NGO)-driven public concerns regarding climate engineering technologies, the
importance of whether patenting of climate engineering technologies should be permitted, public
fear of unilateral actions by individuals as well as governments, and the ambiguities surrounding
regulatory and public consultation frameworks.
