FURNACE REACTIONS UNDER HIGH GASEOUS PRESSURES. 447

Morssan,* taking an intermediate position, asserts that the two materials only react
when in the form of vapour.

The question, which for many reasons is of considerable importance, has never
received the detailed investigation which it deserves.

Our experiments at atmospheric pressure, as we shall see, pointed to the fact that
a well-marked thermal reaction does take place, but not until the fusing point of
alumina is reached.

Hérovutr,t while admitting that reduction occurs, attributes it to electrolytic
action. Having carried out some experiments in which the reacting substances were
heated by radiation alone and in which good yields of aluminium bronze were
obtained, we contend that the assumption of electrolysis is by no means necessary.

No information was available as to the temperature of vaporisation of metallic
aluminium, but various observations led us to believe that a large proportion of the
reduced metal was lost by volatilisation and subsequent combustion where the
furnace gases come in contact with the air.
