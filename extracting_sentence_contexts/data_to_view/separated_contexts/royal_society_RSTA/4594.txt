On the other hand, the 2006 Java and 2010 Mentawai ‘tsunami earthquakes’ were not, or not
sufficiently, recognized as such, and turned into tragic disasters. The disparity in colours along
the Sunda arc in figure 5 is of particular concern given that, to the south of the 2005 Nias rupture,
the 2007 Bengkulu sequence has failed to release the full strain accumulated since the great 1833
earthquake [95], resulting in a seismic gap that is widely expected to rupture through a great
earthquake in the next years to decades, bearing catastrophic tsunami hazard, especially for the
city of Padang with a population of 1 million [121,122].

(e) Summary

At least one positive conclusion can be drawn from the examination of the 16 post-Sumatra
tsunamis. The considerable progress in science, instrumentation and simulation capabilities, as

well as in hazard awareness, over the past 10 years has led to a much better control of the far : =
field: this is best illustrated by the fact that, to our knowledge, tsunamis have inflicted only three : Sy
casualties in the far field (generally defined as beyond 1000 km of the epicentre), two of the victims a
having deliberately violated an evacuation order. From the scientific point of view, our command : &
of the far field is similarly expressed by the often spectacular quantitative agreement between 22
wave amplitudes forecast in real time and eventually recorded at distant maregraphs located : Ss
across oceanic basins [79]. From the operational standpoint, the catastrophic nature of the 2004 DNS
Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku tsunamis, as well as the smaller intervening events, have raised and : =
helped maintain the awareness of decision-makers. : g

Our main area of repeated failure remains the problem of ‘tsunami earthquakes’.
