The sebaceous gland differs from the other exocrine glands which
have been considered in that it is of the holocrine type. That is to say, not only do the cells
produce a secretory fluid, but in releasing this fluid they break down. It was therefore
to be expected that the rate of cell replacement would be relatively high, and reference to
table 36 shows that this is in fact the case. Mitoses were generally seen in cells close to the
sides or the base of the glands (figure 34, plate 33), and the new cells formed were apparently
pushed upwards to disintegrate, after the disappearance of the nucleus, near the apex of
the gland. It should be noted that this is contrary to the usual accounts of cell replacement
in the sebaceous gland, and that Maximow & Bloom (1940), for instance, state that
the new cells are derived from the walls of the duct.
