as before, equation (203). This method (207) is analogous to (204). ยง37, There are several other ways of representing the attraction, employing fictitious
matter and current ; but now let us change the method, and observe how the attrac-
tion between the magnetic pole and the iron mass is accounted for by a stress dis-
tribution, and its space-variation. The best stress is the third, equation (188), ยง 31. Applying this, we have simply a tension of magnitude 4y,R,?
