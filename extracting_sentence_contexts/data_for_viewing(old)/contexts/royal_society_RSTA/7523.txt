It would seem then to be definitely established that except in the cases when the
field-change creates a very intense electric field, the recovery is on the average much
slower after discharges within 10 km. than for the more distant discharges. The most
direct interpretation of this conclusion would be to associate it with the fact that many
of the discharges, in this range of distances, will be near the reversal distance for flashes
in or below the cloud. The observation of a simple field-change does not necessarily
mean a simple discharge between charges in the cloud; two different types of dis-
charges may cause field-changes of the same sign, or in some cases, the detail may be
unresolved and only the net effect recorded as a simple field-change. The primary
process of regeneration of charges may then produce a small effect on the field until
the two charges become unequal, due to their different rates of dissipation.
