Professor WILLIAMSON was, however, quite wrong in some important, points, both in
the anatomy and anatomical relationship of the soldering particles. He asserts that
they are free, that they are unconnected with each other, and that they never become

Qanchylosed to one another: in all three particulars he is mistaken. A The soldering particles are always attached firmly, and in fact united to the elements

ZSof the tooth on which they are seen, and cannot be removed without violence. Indeed

Sit is by this absolute adhesion that the structures of the tooth are soldered together

Sand cease to be separable. 'The mere development of these granules among the other

Delements of the tooth, if still free, would only add to the complication of the structures

Swithout contributing to their cohesion. The nature of these particles can be best

-Sinvestigated by examining the plates when studded with them and in a state of con-

S8iderable advancement of growth, as is represented in Plate VIII. fig. 1.
