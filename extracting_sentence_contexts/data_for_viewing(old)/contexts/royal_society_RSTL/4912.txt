Sduct, where the strize disappear and the external membrane alone remains (fig. 42 h).
4 The spot where the ovary terminates and the oviduct (fig. 42 m) begins is marked,
Sas already stated, by a constriction (Plate XXX. fig. 90 c), causing such an amount
= of narrowing in the calibre of the generative tube (Plate XXVILI. fig. 42 m) as only to
& adit the passage of one ovule at a time (fig. 420). The whole length of the ovi-
duct (Plate XXX. fig. 90 c, 4) is characterized by transverse markings, evidently of
a muscular or contractile nature, and most developed at the ends where the constric-
tions (Plate XXVII. fig. 42m) occur. While the exterior of the oviduct is trans-
versely ribbed (fig. 42n), its interior is lined with large cells, distended with a dark
granular fluid, projecting into the cavity of the tube, and having all the appearance of
secreting cells.

That these cells do secrete s0me $ort of fluid, is proved by the fact that they
become turgid when the Ascaris has been feeding, and are, on the contrary, almost
invisible from flaccidity when it has had no food.

While the ovary is filled with an almost solid mass of ovules (Plate XXX. fig. 90 b),

the oviduct (fig. 90 c,d) contains a transparent, finely-granular fluid with only an
oyule here and there. It is therefore probable that a peristaltic action being set up
by the transverse muscular fibres of the oviduct, the ovules are detached and forced
