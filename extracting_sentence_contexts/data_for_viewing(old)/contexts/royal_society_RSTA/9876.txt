where f is a numerical factor; but here agreement ends. Maxwett,* dealing with
molecules which are point centres of force repelling one another according to the
inverse fifth-power law, found as a result of his theory that f= 4; this is, of course,
a very special case of the present theorem. Other writers, such as CLAustus,
Sreran, and O. E. Meyer, have found values for f varying from 0°5 upwards, many
of these calculations, however, being confessedly rough attempts, while MAxwett’s
theory attained a very high degree of accuracy.

Maxwet’s hypothesis is known not to be borne out by experimental facts (such
as the variation of viscosity with temperature), and the theory of conduction which
has hitherto found most acceptance is MryEr’s, which assumes that the molecules are
rigid elastic spheres. Mryerr’s work was a valuable attempt at an exact treatment
of the problem, but the method adopted (that used by Craustus and Maxwett in
their early researches, but afterwards abandoned by MAXWELL as being misleading)
did not really allow of great accuracy. The expression for f which was arrived at
involved a definite integral, which was calculated (using mechanical quadratures) by
Conravu and Neversaver.t Jrans{ improved the proof of Mryer’s theorem, but
his corrections did not affect the final result. The law obtained was
