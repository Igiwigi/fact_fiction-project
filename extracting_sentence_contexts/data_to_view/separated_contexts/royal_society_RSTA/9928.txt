As soon as the
product has frozen, further attack is limited, for the mgot of carbide is of a very
compact and impermeable texture, and is protected by the graphite film. Such a “skin reaction” would doubtless become predominant were the experiments
carried out on a few grammes of material, but when dealing, as we are here, with
larger quantities, the total loss is too small to influence appreciably the result. This
is shown by the fact that the yield is not increased when the carbon monoxide is let
off immediately upon stopping (¢f. Table III., C 26). The further question, as to whether the presence of an atmosphere of carbon
monoxide during the run has an unfavourable effect on the efficiency of the process,
is also answered in the negative by a comparison with furnaces operated at
atmospheric pressure, but otherwise under identical conditions.
