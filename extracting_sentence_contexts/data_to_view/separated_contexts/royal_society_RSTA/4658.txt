It should be pointed out that uniqueness for the tangent cone in minimal surfaces was proved
by Simon [1], who treated the problem in a way that is reminiscent of convergence for time
tending to infinity in an evolution equation.? For a minimal surface, the ratio E(r,S,z) = E(1,S;,0) grows from the plane configuration, Sp ~
plane, to a higher oscillatory surface S,. Another simple monotonicity formula is given by the fact that if u is harmonic, |V(w)|/? is
subharmonic and thus its average in B, increases with r, i.e. the average energy of a subharmonic
function over B,(z) increases in r. This can also be written as the average of the square of the
H'/?.norm of the trace. Ina similar vein, Almgren’s monotonicity formula A(r) (see [2]) the ratio, properly normalized
on the sphere of radius r, of the square of the H 1/2_norm of the trace over the square of the L2-
norm of the function, i.e for a harmonic function A(r) is the Rayleigh quotient of the H!/? norm
and it increases as we diverge from a point.
