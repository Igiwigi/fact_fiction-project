2. Length of tube = 4 centims. Average flow = 8°6 cub. centims. per hour.
When in 10 0°4 millim. lengths, Average flow = 8°3 cub. centims. per hour.

Evidently, therefore, PotsrurLte’s formula applies to tubes of only 4- or 5-millim.
lengths, as well as to longer ones, provided that the rate of flow is not too rapid.*
The slightly slower rate of flow is probably the result of the manipulation and of the
unavoidable entry of dust particles.

We are therefore justified in assuming that the only advantage a long conducting
vessel possesses over a short one of equal diameter is due to the fact that filtration

* The apparent failure of Po1srumLLe’s formula for short tubes is not real, but is due to an over
estimation of the head, some of which is used in bringing the water up to the entrance and giving it
kinetic energy. If we could measure the pressures at inflow and outflow, the formula would, without
doubt, still hold almost exactly.

under pressure through the end partition walls with its resultant increased resistance
to flow are largely avoided.
