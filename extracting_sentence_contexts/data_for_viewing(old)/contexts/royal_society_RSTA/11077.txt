cases ruled with lines. It would seem that the crystals are made up of minute rods
closely packed together,* and that section by a plane parallel to the rods gives a
smooth surface, perhaps a cleavage plane of the crystal. On the other hand, a section
> making an angle with the rods breaks off each rod along another cleavage plane,
which will not generally be that of the section, in which case the surface will be
serrated or pitted. This way of accounting for the markings on a section of a mass
of crystals has no doubt occurred to many persons ;¢ but it was suggested to us by
Professor Ewrne’s slip-lines. He has shown that the minute elements of a crystal,
even of metal, are rigid, and that they can only slip along certain planes. In the
same way it is almost certain that they can only break along certain planes.

The remarkable effects that one often sees on rotating a section under oblique
3, light are due to these serrations.{ The fact that the pitted crystals give this rotation
effect, shows that the sides of the pits have a definite orientation. The variation in
the appearance of different crystals of the same substance, dependent on their orienta-
tion to the plane of polishing, is liable to mislead anyone who trusts to microscopic
study only. For example, the alloy with 27°2 atoms photographed with normal
light (fig. 15) appears to consist. of at least two materials, while in reality all the
patches in it are of the same substance ; oblique light would be even more deceptive
as the slowly-cooled alloy with 2671 atoms (fig. 12) proves.

* An examination of the door-panel moulding of the alloy with 33°6 atoms almost forces one to the
conclusion that these minute rods or lamin came into existence during the crystallisation, and are not
a later product due to strain or other cause; that they are, in fact, the crystals of which the blob or
polyhedron is built up. This is the view insisted on by Mr. SteaD (loc. cit.).
