Following figure 4a,b, the Lorenz attractor may have many separate trajectories
that could look like connected regions. The (possibly existing) holes between trajectories, which
are very small relative to the big holes, have been ignored in this paper, because their existence
is questionable due to the presence of numerical noise. In fact, implementation of persistent
homology method is also expected to yield 2; ~ Z5 for figure 4a and 1 ~ Z? for figure 4b. Figure 5a shows the bifurcation diagram exhibiting the Poincare section in the (x,dx/dt) phase
space as a function of the parameter p of the Lorenz attractor. It is noticed here that a phase
transition occurs around p ~ 166.
