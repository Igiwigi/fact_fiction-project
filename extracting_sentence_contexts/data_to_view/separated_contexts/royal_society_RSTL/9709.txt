The details will be fully considered further on,
But, in the meantime, a clue to the source of the increased yield of nitrogen in the
mixed herbage would seem to be obtained. It would appear that, under the influence
of the mixed mineral manure, both the powers of collection, assimilation, and transfor-
mation, of the plants themselves, have been considerably augmented, and the accu-
mulated stores of nitrogen within the 80il have been rendered more available. They
have, in fact, served, either directly or indirectly, as manure for both the Graminee
and the Leguminosz. Woe have, too, in the facts, an addition to the previously
existing evidence in fayour of the supposition that the Leguminosw derive the large
amounts of nitrogen they assimilate from the stores of the s0il itself. Turning to the amounts of mineral matter taken up under the influence of the
liberal supply of ib by manure, Table V., page 308, shows that, over the first period
nearly one-and-two-thirds as much, over the second period more than twice as much,
and over the 20 years nearly twice as much, was taken up on plot 7 as without
manure.
