of size. These facts could be explained by two hypotheses; the first, that any
treatment of the eggs which reduced their vitality also reduced the dominance of the
characters transmitted ; or secondly, that a decrease of vitality prevents the larvae
from developing certain characters which require strength and energy for their
production. In order to test the truth of the second hypothesis, larvae were reared
in unfavourable circumstances which reduced their size and strength, and at first
(69A, 85A) no reduction was observed in the maternal features, and it was supposed
that this was evidence in favour of the first suggestion: But later (see Nos. 1214
and 121p, 180A, 221A, 241, 2424, 252, &e.) it was found that unfavourable conditions,
especially low temperature, acting during growth did reduce the Spharechinus
characters toa marked extent, and that where the contrary seemed to be the case,
the cause was almost certainly to be found in selective mortality. This showed that
the facts observed might certainly be due, at least partially, to the second hypothesis,
and this view is supported by other considerations. For if there is any reduction of
dominance caused by the treatment of the eggs, not only should there be a decrease
of the Spherechinus characters but also an increase in those of Strongylocentrotus,
viz. : in the clubs or the body-skeleton and in body-length. Neither of these, however,
were found, the clubs varied little and irregularly, but, on the whole, seem to be larger
in stronger and better developed larvee, and smaller in the weaker ones, so that, as a
rule, the percentage of clubs increases with that of cross-bars and anterior body-
skeleton. Nor is there any marked increase of body-length when the Spherechinus
characters are reduced, or at least this is not greater than that observed in larvee
grown at a lower temperature, which tend to have in some cases rather larger bodies
associated with shorter arms (Â¢f. 221 and 2214).
