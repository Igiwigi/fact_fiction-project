Attention may be drawn to some of the conspicuous features shown by the above
comparisons. In the first place it will be observed that, with the possible exception of lead, the
calculated values are too low at the higher temperatures; also that the departure is

most pronounced where the curvature is greatest ; in copper for example, at 130° C. abs.
and in zine at 150° C. abs. CAPACITY FOR HEAT OF METALS AT LOW TEMPERATURES. 349

Much weight shouid not be attached to the fact that the calculated values are
slightly higher than the observed ones in the case of lead at about 200° C. abs., since
there is an uncertainty in the value of C,—C,, due to lack of knowledge of the
variation in the coefficient of compressibility with temperature. At 80° C. abs., the
calculated value for this metal is also too low. Only for the metals iron and sodium does the difference between the observed and
the calculated values increase considerably with the temperature.
