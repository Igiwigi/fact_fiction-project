(a) Single or multi-hop communication?

We start our consideration with a look into the general design considerations for the
communication system. The choice of the first tier of the communication system depends basically
on whether the sensors attached to freight can be communicated with directly or only via
forwarding over multiple hops, e.g. for sending their measurements to a data collection unit
mounted inside a truck or container.

If reliable data transfer can be guaranteed by direct single-hop communication, this method
should clearly be preferred. Simpler radio protocols lead to lower energy requirements and thus
longer battery lifetime at lower costs. Even battery-less systems by passive RFID technologies
are possible for this type of communication [8]. But, unfortunately, the radio links are often too
weak for reliable direct communication, owing to the high water content of food products. In fact,
an important first step, to test radio link quality before system application, is often left out, and
system planning directly jumps into either a cost-efficient RFID system or an elaborate system
providing multi-hop communication. A well-founded decision should be based on an analysis of
radio signal attenuation in the target set-up [7], depending on radio frequency, product, packing,
water content and sensor placement.

(b) Surface or core measurement?

Because shelf life is related to product core temperature, sensors should ideally be placed in the
centre of boxes or packing units. On the other hand, sensors on the surface of pallets or boxes are
easier to install and less affected by signal attenuation. do Nascimento Nunes ef al. [3] present
an approach to predict the centre temperature by surface measurements. However, for some
