This artificial rhythm may be obtained with a portion of irritable tissue of any size,
and whether a large or a 8mall piece of the tissue employed 'be included between the
electrodes.

* This and all the subsequent tracings I obtained by the method already described in my previous paper.

(c.) As the fact of this wonderfully rhythmic response to faradaie irritation was
quite unexpected by me, and as it seemed to be a fact of great 8ignificance, T was led
vs as time permitted, First, I tried the effect
on the rhythm of progressively intensifying the sbrength of the faradaic current. I

to invesbigate it in as many of its bearings

found that with each increment of the current the rate of the rhythm was increased ;
and this up to the point at which the rhythm began to pass into tetanus due to gum-
mation of the snccessive contractions. Bub between the slowest rhythm obtainable by
minimal stimulation and the most rapid rhythm obtainable before the appearance of
tetanus, there were numerous degrees of rate to be observed. TI here append another
tracing to show the effect on the rate of the rhythm of alterations in the strength of
the current (fig. 2),
