tions of the several tissues, whatever «may be their own individual characters. And
this expression will also be found available for the well-known influence of mental
conditions upon the properties of the various tissues and secretions, since this influ-
ence can only be exerted through the medium of nervous agency. Further, it not
only appears that a simple withdrawal or disturbance of the nervous force supplied
to particular organs occasions a retardation or perversion of their vital operations ;
but there also seems evidence that an influence of an opposite kind may be transmit-
ted through the neryous system, which is positively and directly antagonistic to the
vital powers of the several tissues and organs ;—such, at least, appears to be the only
mode of accounting for the extraordinary effect of a shock, mechanical or mental, in
at once and completely destroying the contractility of the heart, and in immediately
bringing to a stand the vital operations of other parts; and it harmonizes well with
the fact that, in hemiplegia, the © palsy-stroke” rransmitted from the brain along the
spinal cord almost invariably affects the leg less injuriously than the arm, and for a
$horter duration, recovery first taking place in the leg, even when it has been at first
paralysed as completely as the arm. If the neryous force be regarded as a polar
force (as snggested by Messrs. Topp and Bowman, © Physiological Anatomy,” vol. i.
P- 237 et seq.), analogous in its mode of transmission to electricity or galvanism, it
is not difficult to understand that the reversal of the usual direction of its action may
produce the effects in question, regard being had to the opposite effects shown by
Prof. MarTevcer to be produced upon nervous excitability by the direct and the in-
verse electric currents,

It is hoped that the foregoing considerations (in support of which many others
might be adduced F) will have seryed to establish the general proposition, that 80
