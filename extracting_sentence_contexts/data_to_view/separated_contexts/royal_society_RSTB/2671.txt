The splitting of the rock takes place naturally during the winter frosts, and
the specimens thus set free are those which most readily catch the eye of the collector. Most of the specimens which we received from the collector, Mr. Donarp CALDER
of Thurso, were exposed on a more or less weathered surface, but at our request he
sent us some obtained by splitting the rock with a hammer ; on taking serial sections of
one of these slabs and its counterpart, we found, as we had expected, that the dorsal
moiety lay in one slab and the ventral in the other. Nothing, however, was gained
beyond the knowledge of this fact ; our best specimens were those naturally exposed. Good specimens are said to be rare, a collector who in a gathering of 20 finds a
single good one may be regarded as fortunate. The excellence of a specimen is
usually judged, however, not only by its completeness, but also by the perfection of
its exposure at the surface ; a factor of no account when the fossil is studied by serial
sections.
