There is strong evidence, then, that the origin of the lines of crystals is other than
such fine scratches as might arise from polishing or from ordinary handling.

Firms on OTHER SuRFACES

The results on silica glass lead us to the belief that the lines of crystals must indicate
the course of the extremely fine surface cracks, probably only a few atomic diameters
across, which are assumed by Grirrirus* and by Jorret and others to be the cause
of the abnormal weakness of all real solids. The fact that they withstand any
cleansing, however drastic, but disappear after a very recent polishing which only
removes about 10-® cm, is in agreement with such a hypothesis, for modern work has
confirmed Brrtpy’s view that cracks are flowed over by a surface layer during polishing.

To confirm this, other surfaces were used. In the first place mica, which is known
to have an unusually perfect cleavage surface, and to exhibit theoretical strength
when loaded so as not to stress the edges,t was tried. Smooth cleavage surfaces
were sputtered and heated to about 300° C. No lines of crystals were ever detected,
which agrees with our hypothesis. It seemed natural to try rock salt, which has
been so much used in researches on crystal structure. Fresh cleavage surfaces were
sputtered and heated, and a variety of markings obtained, but the whole film
became discoloured, probably due to the action of the chlorine ions on the metal
