I am indebted for much information on this point to
the kindness and industry of Mr. C. V. Warkes, who has occupied much time in procu-
ring me references to the researches of those electricians already alluded to, as also
to a long list of others whose names adorn the pages of science. I could easily have
added to those I have named, by referring to the experiments of many other authors
who consider that their favourite theory of contact has been fully established. It is
not, however, my object to advert to these speculations : we have before us certain
facts connected with the action of the voltaic battery ; first contact, or successive
juxtaposition, and simultaneously with it, effects of fension; then the completion of
the circuit, and simultaneously with it, development of chemical action and current ;
but in all these cases contact is first in order, developing tension. BECQUEREL
descrihes it by stating, © When two bodies are in contact the affinities commence
exercising their action before combination takes place.”
