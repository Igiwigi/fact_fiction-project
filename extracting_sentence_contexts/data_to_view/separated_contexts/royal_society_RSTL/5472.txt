7 . Whence, if 49*—3& be negative, 7. 6. if E> the values of A will be imaginary, but

m_ 4m? - 2
if 4?—3% be positive, or «< =, the values of A will be real. If a= =, then there

will be two equal values of A, which in fact corresponds to a cusp upon the axis of #. Whenever the curve is real there will be at least two real points on the axis of #; and
4am? : . when 4 < =, but not otherwise, then for properly selected values of A there will be
four real points on the axis of vx.
