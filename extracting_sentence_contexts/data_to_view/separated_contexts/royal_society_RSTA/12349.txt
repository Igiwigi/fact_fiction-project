To compare these results with what is known of the physical condition of
our atmosphere, we have first the obvious correspondence between the diminution of
molecular vis viva and of temperature in ascending. No sufficient explanation of this
has, I believe, been yet offered, for it is needless to attempt to do so by supposing the
specific heat of air to increase as its density diminishes, as no difference of specific heat
disturbs the equilibrium of the temperature of bodies placed in horizontal contact. The very fact of a gaseous atmosphere presenting a constant inequality of temperature
at different elevations seems to prove that the law of the vertical equilibrium of tem-
perature is essentially different from the law of horizontal equilibrium.

The actual rate of diminution is very fluctuating and uncertain, varying from 200
to 500 feet for each degree. The formula of our hypothesis applies only to the con-
dition of an atmosphere resting on a horizontal base ; such, indeed, as may be found
only during a balloon ascent. M.
