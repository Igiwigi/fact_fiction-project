My third illustration is taken from the * Bellerophon,' for which ship the curves of
Hal weight, weight of hull, and buoyancy shown in fig. 3 have been constructed in the
"Manner previously described for the * Victoria and Albert,” 'This case may be taken as
=] representative of the distribution of weight and buoyancy in iron-clads of moderate
Jength and proportions, with central batteries and armour-belts, and with a fall-back
Stem. The advantages of this bow in giving increased buoyancy are well illustrated by
She fact that the foremost water-borne section R' R* in Plate XVI. fig. 3 is only 40 feet
From the bow, and that the excess of weight over buoyancy on this length is only 45 tons. An the * Minotaur,” as we have seen, the foremost water-borne section is 80 feet from the
Sow, and the excess of weight on this length is 420 tons.
