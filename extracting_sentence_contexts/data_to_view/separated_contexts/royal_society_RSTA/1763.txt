In fact it involves the definite assumption
that no work is done by the magnetic forces during the motion of electric charges. Of course the usual expression for such force as proportional to the vector product of
the velocity and magnetic force confirms this assumption, but the derivation of this
expression by dynamical methods from results derived from the present discussion is
by so much deprived of interest. In fact, if to the assumption that these forces do
no work we add the further conditions that they are linear in the magnetic and
velocity vectors, it would appear that their form is completely determined, at least to
a constant factor, without further considerations either of a dynamical or any other
nature. â€˜

The form for the expression T is not usually regarded as being sufficiently definite
to be used in the present connexion, mainly because it is the more readily convertible
into equally simple alternative forms. We have in our previous discussions made
certain assumptions which have proved to be equivalent to taking

T= 1far
