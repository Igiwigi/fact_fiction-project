I have lately, in con-
junction with Mr. F. W. Rrxon, determined the specific heat of carbonic acid at
constant volume at 100° C., 200° C., 300° C., and 400° C., and find a steady rise in
the constant.* On the other hand, the facility with which carbonic acid breaks up
under the influence of electric discharges indicates that, as its temperature is raised,
work is done in loosening the chemical bonds—work which Berruetor ealls “ le
travail de désagrégation moléculaire qui précéde la décomposition.” Of the fact ot
the partial dissociation of carbonic acid and steam at the temperature of the detona-
tion-wave, Mr. H. W. Smirn and I have found. direct proof in the unburnt gases
left on cooling. t

Liverne and Dewar} showed in 1884 that the flame of an explosion of gases in a
