hand, but recognizing that only the botanists could decide the problem.’ He admits
the identification by Finsch of the tobacco of the south-east coast of British New
Guinea as N. tabacum. He (p. 136) was unable to find a single growing plant of tobacco
when he was in New Guinea, but, as referred to above (p. 234), a few dried leaves
were identified by C. F. Millspaugh as N. suaveolens, who admits ‘it is not possible to
determine the species of Nicotianae from the leaves alone’. Lewis alludes to Maiden’s
opinion of the dried leaves and petioles submitted to him that the species comes
nearest to N. rustica, but is not very remote from N. suaveolens; he definitely excludes
N. tabacum. Hugh Dixson regarded the same specimens as comparable with the variety
“grown in the Eastern Seas and China, of which the best is Manila tobacco’. This
‘variety’ is acknowledged by botanists as being N. tabacum.

Lewis, relying upon the data then available, says (1924, p. 10) : ‘Altogether the facts
seem to point to an ancient use of an indigenous New Guinea species of tobacco prob-

ably closely related to the Australian species.’ He stated later (1931a, p. 136): ‘The
Dutch expeditions of recent years have apparently found what they regard as N.
tabacum in the Dutch territory... . This did not seem to me conclusive evidence for the
whole of New Guinea.’ Lewis was not then acquainted with Gilmour’s investigations,
which as I point out on pp. 234—5 cover widely separated areas in Papua and the Man-
dated Territory of New Guinea, and also Rabaul in New Britain. This investigation
confirms the conclusions of Dutch botanists for Netherlands New Guinea and renders
