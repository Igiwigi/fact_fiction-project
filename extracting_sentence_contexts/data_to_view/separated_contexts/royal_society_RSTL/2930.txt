with only one eye at a time. Du Tour# held that though we might occasionally sce at the same time with both
eyes, yet the mind cannot be affected simultaneously by two corresponding points of
the two images. He was led to this opinion by the curious facts alluded to in \ 14. It would be difficult to disprove this conjecture by experiment; but all that the expe-
riments adduced in its favour, and others relating to the disappearance of objects to
one eye really proves, is, that the mind is inattentive to impressions made on one re-
tina when it cannot combine the impressions on the two retina together 80 as to
resemble the perception of scme external objects; but they afford no ground what-
