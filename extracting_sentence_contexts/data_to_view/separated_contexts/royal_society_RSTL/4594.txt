Hence we see that

will only fall within the limits p and q when # falls either between

/, and 9,, or between jp, and g,, &. Thus we have in fact

and still more generally, @(x) being a rational function of &,

which is a reproduction of (5.), art. 30. I deem it, however, an important fact, that in
the comparison of functional transcendents, formulz involving the sign of summation

ing their place.
36. One remarkable theorem must still be noticed. Since

sin@ =a(1—5 :) (1-5 :) (1=5)-->

we have, on taking the logarithms of both sides and differentiating,

Hence

The result may however be generalized.
