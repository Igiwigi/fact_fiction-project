| imngine, from the situations in which they are found, that the very existence of organs
| destined to facilitate such a process of oxidation would only be productive of evil
:rather than good. And the facts revealed by the anatomy of these animals tend to
; upport this @ prior7 aggumption. We meet with glandular structures and excretory
'organs in abundance, but with no trace of a special apparatus destined to secure an
:xcration of the tissues; 8uch a function is, T believe, almost in abeyance in the parasitic
'Nematoids, whilst the glandular and eliminatory function is more than ordinarily deve-
oped. It seems absurd to imagine that the two longitudinal tubes, in connexion with the
ventral pore in certain species of the genus Ascaris, could be destined to admit external
Hids for the purpose of respiration.
