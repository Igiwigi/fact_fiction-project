diminishes again in proportion to the nitrogen, falling at last to the normal proportion
of 21 per cent. as in the external air. Thus a balloon inflated by carbonic acid to 150
millims. in diameter, was found to lose nearly all its carbonic acid in the course of
twenty-four hours. It gave 150 cub. centims. of gas after treatment with caustic potash.
This was air of the composition,

and exhibited therefore no material augmentation in the proportion of oxygen.

It may be inferred, from the familiar fact that air dissolved in water contains s0 high
a proportion as 30 per cent. of oxygen, that if carbonic acid gas were divided from
atmospheric air by a film of water, the former gas would come to be charged through
the film with air bearing the same high proportion of 30 per cent. of oxygen. But it
is not easy to imitate this experiment unless the dividing film is s8upported by &
membrane of some s8ort. 'The air from the atmosphere, which entered a fresh ox-bladder
preserved humid and inflated with carbonic acid, was found to possess 24-65 per cent.
of oxygen to 75:35 of nitrogen, which is but a small increase in the proportion of
oxygen. But the thickness of the membrane here was too great, and other circumstances
of the experiment were unfavourable.
