C. It till continued, however, very intense till the thermometer rose to 235Â®,
Between that point and 240* the ozone reactions entirely disappeared, when the ozone
was in a very dilute state ; but when more concentrated, slight traces of ozone could
still be discovered, which no doubt would have also disappeared if the current of
gas had been passed very slowly. Time is in fact an element in this action. Even
at the temperature of 100? C. ozone is slowly destroyed.
