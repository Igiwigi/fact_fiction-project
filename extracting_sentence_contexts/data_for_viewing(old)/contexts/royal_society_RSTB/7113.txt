When the pump is in systole, as in figure 4, the folds are marked and deep, while in
diastole the distension smooths out the surface as in figure 12. If the hinder surface—that
is, the surface abutting against the front of the oral cone—is followed laterally, it is seen to
curve forwards to the margin of attachment of the body to the capitular walls, and this
margin closely follows the hinder surface of the scutal vessel (figure 3). The pulling inwards
of this body wall, that is, the beat of the blood pump, is brought about by a series of muscles
which run upwards from the lower corners of the scutal plates in the rostral region, to
attach directly to it. They are symmetrically arranged on either side of the median plane,
and so on either side of the actual cavity of the pump. Similar muscles have been figured
for Pollicipes by Nussbaum. He has, however, given names to each separate muscle (1890,
plate 5, figure 1), names such as adductor capitis and levator capitis which suggest that the
separate muscles function in different ways. This is certainly not the case. From their
common point of origin on the rigid skeletal plates and the fact that they all end on the
soft flexible outer wall of the blood pump they can only function in one way, as simple
compressors, pulling in this wall.

Inside the wall is a thick lining of very delicate, large-celled parenchymatous tissue
which is continuous anteriorly with the parenchyma surrounding and permeating the
adductor scutorum, This tissue does not fill the blood pump, but leaves a median space free
and it is this space that is continuous with the dorsal prosomal blood space that I have just
described. In addition, however, as can be seen from figures 4 and 12, it is continuous
through the rostral valve with the peduncular vessel.

I have now described a passage for blood right round the body and it remains to discuss
the mechanism by which the circulation is maintained.
