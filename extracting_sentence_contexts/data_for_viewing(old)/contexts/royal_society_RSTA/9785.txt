* Tt is known that an asymptotic expansion of Porncare’s type does not determine an analytic function
uniquely ; thus (1+)~! and (1+:)-!+¢~* have the same asymptotic expansion, viz, 1-«1+2*-...,
when |x| is large and |argx| < 47.

MR. G. N. WATSON: A THEORY OF ASYMPTOTIC SERIES. 283

The novelty introduced in these assumptions lies in the fact that we consider a,
and R, (or, more precisely, the moduli of these quantities) as functions of n for all
values of n, no matter how large.

Tt will be convenient to give names to the quantities A, B, /, 1, p, o; we shall call
k, l, p, © characteristics of the series (1); & will be called a grade, l an outer grade,
pa radius, o an outer radius of the expansion, The quantities A and B will be
called constants of the expansion.

Tf an inequality of the form (1A) can exist when k=, but not when k <k,, we
might, for greater precision, call /, the principal grade of the series ; and the smallest
possible value of p associated with /, might, in like manner, be called the principal
radius ; similarly we could define the principal outer grade and the principal outer
