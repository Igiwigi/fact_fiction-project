This could have been expected because residual motions, unresolved by the grid, must
be modelled, as is well known by practitioners of large-eddy simulations (LESs). The idea has
therefore been to use LESs and to model small-scale motions with a purely dissipative model
which inhibits energy production by the (unresolved) small scales [44,45]. The equations used in

2The term ‘coherent’ lift-up here is used to emphasize the fact that the optimal energy amplification is computed on averaged
streaks by explicitly accounting, for the Reynolds stresses associated with turbulent fluctuations and to differentiate these
results from standard lift-up computations, where Reynolds stresses are not taken into account and which give different
results. LESs are the usual ones [46,47] and can be obtained by applying a filter to the incompressible ls |
