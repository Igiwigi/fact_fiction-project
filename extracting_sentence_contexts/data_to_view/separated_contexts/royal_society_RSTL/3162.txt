All the variations at night were towards the east 4, whether the aurora was
actually visible or not ; and hence may we not conclude, taking it for granted
that it is an electrical phenomenon, and that it usually moves from about the
north towards the south, that it must be of the nature of positive electricity ? And, by a parity of reasoning, may we not assume the existence of an opposite
state of electrica√û action by day, in order to account for the diurnal westerly
variation, which is most considerable in the summer in these latitudes, when
the aurora prevails about the south pole? This idea seems to be strengthened
by a fact I have noticed, that the magnetic intensity is usually less considerable
in summer before the middle of the day than it is afterwards ; s0 that the
minimum intensity commonly occurs some hours before the maximum tem-
perature. It is evident that the elevation of the aurora must often be exceedingly great,
probably much more than a thousand miles, as it seems to be generally scen from
places very distant from each other at the same time, and in nearly the same

direction : thus, for example, the ohservations made on the beautiful aurora of
the 7th ultimo from the vicinity of London, and of this place, seem very nearly
to accord in almost eyery respect. In conclusion, I will venture to express a hope that the subject of terrestrial
magnetism may obtain the attention which it appears to deserve, and that
experiments may be made at the same time in different countries, in order to
deyelop its more obscure properties.
