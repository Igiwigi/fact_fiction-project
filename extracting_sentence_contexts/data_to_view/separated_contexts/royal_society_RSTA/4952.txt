The magnetic field lines are
smoothed in the picture to illustrate the evolution of the mean magnetic field. Reconnection diffusion should not necessarily be understood as a concept that makes the
earlier theories of star formation invalid. In fact, turbulence in dark cores giving birth to
stars may be reduced and this may make the traditional ambipolar diffusion, ie. the drift
of neutrals in relation to ions, important. However, reconnection diffusion must be a part of
the star formation paradigm. In fact, it can successfully explain many pieces of observational
data that are completely puzzling within the ambipolar diffusion paradigm.
