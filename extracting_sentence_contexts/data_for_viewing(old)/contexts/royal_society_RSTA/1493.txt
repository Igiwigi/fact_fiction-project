with detector array size, whereas for a confocal microscope the FWHM increases rapidly with
pinhole size.

Figure 5a shows the corresponding axial PSF for ISM. Figure 5b shows the FWHM of the axial
PSF, again normalized to unity for a conventional microscope. The FWHM for ISM remains almost
independent of detector size up to a size of 1.355 AU, whereas for confocal it increases [68].

The optical sectioning effect is the same for a confocal microscope or for ISM with the same
size of pinhole/array. This can be seen from the fact that for a featureless object, there is no
