and was preserved in stoppered bottles over sulphuric acid ; a precaution which was
desirable, as the preparations had to be preserved for a long time without any altera-
tion in the per-centage of oxygen.

The peroxide of barium thus obtained is a perfectly stable body. When dry, it is
only a very intense heat which can drive off its oxygen. It is nearly insoluble in water,
the filtered solution giving no gas with oxide of silver, which would be the case if
any substance were dissolved ; and when preserved from the action of the carbonic
acid of the air, ir may be long kept even in water without any sensible evolution of
gas. When the powdered substance is even boiled with water, no gas is given off; and
after long boiling, on examining the dried residue, I have found that the effect of
boiling has actually been to increase the per-centage of oxygen, the baryta, of which
a certain quantity is always present, being dissolved. These facts are contrary to the
usual statements*, and probably this stability only belongs to a very pure snbstance,
for a small quantity of the oxides of iron or of manganese would alter these reactions.

The peculiar experiments of the reduction of the metallic oxides, as stated by
Taxxarp and other chemists, are referred to the peroxide of hydrogen; and it is on
the peculiar instability of this body that the explanation of Lizp1G of these pheno-
mena rests, the spontaneous decomposition of the peroxide being considered as ante-
cedent to and necessary to set up the action in the other substances. I was however
anxious to see whether the peroxides of metals themselves would not produce similar
effects; and on placing the peroxide of potassium (the mass which is produced by
the action of potassium on melted nitre) in contact with moist chloride of silver in
water, I found that the chloride was reduced, just as it might be by zinc, and oxygen
