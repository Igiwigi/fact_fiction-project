case than the other; and, secondly, that the weight of the model being greater, this
inertia bears a less proportion to the amount of work required for inclining it than in
the other case.

The effect of this inertia adding itself to the buoyancy of the fluid, cannot but be
to lift the vessel out of the water and to cause the displacement to be less at the ter-
mination of each rolling oscillation than at its commencement*. This variation in
volume of the displacement was apparent in all the experiments. Its amount was
measured and is recorded in the last column of the Table; its tendency is to produce
in the body vertical oscillations, which are so far independent of its rolling motion
that they will not probably synchronize with it. The body displacing, when rolling,
less fluid than it would at rest, the effect of the weight used in the experiments to in-
cline it is thereby increased, and thus is explained the fact (apparent in the eighth
and ninth columns of the Table) that the inclination by experiment is s0mewhat
greater than the formula would make it.

12. The dynamical stability of a vessel whose athwart sections (where they are
subject to immersion and emersion) are circular, having their centres in a common
avis.

Let EDF, Plate XLVIII. fig. 3 or 4, be an athwart section of such a vessel, the parts
of whose periphery ES and FR, subject to immersion and emersion, are parts of the
same circular arc E'TF, whose centre is C. Let G, represent the projection of the
centre of gravity of the yessel on this section, and G, that of the centre of gravity of
the space whose section is SDRT, supposing it filled with water. This space lies
