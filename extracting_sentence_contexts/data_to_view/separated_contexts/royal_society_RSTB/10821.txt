Far from that, different possibilities
may unfold depending on their impact on the environment
and on further innovation. In particular, we show the
number of people that the planet can support will depend on
the kind of technology, the living standard deemed acceptable
and the impact of technologies on themselves and on the
provision of ecosystem services [90]. Particularly worrisome,
however, is the fact that over a large portion of parameter
space, the collapse of the human population is likely; also
likely is that our future is a world saturated with people on a
planet where the provision of ecosystem services is low and
the quality of life poor. Data accessibility. This article has no additional data.
