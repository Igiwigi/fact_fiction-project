silicates were inherited from the ISM. Along lines-of-sight through the ISM, absorption bands
can be fitted by spherical Mg-Fe amorphous silicates” [45-47] and non-spherical Mg amorphous
silicates [50]. ISM gas-phase depletion studies also show both Mg-silicates and Fe—-Mg-silicates
[17,51,52]. O-rich AGB stars readily form and contribute Mg-Fe amorphous silicates and Mg-
crystalline silicates to the ISM [53], but the near-absence of crystals in the ISM justifies an
amorphizing mechanism. An important point is that the lifetimes of grains in the ISM are too
long compared with the efficiency of shock sputtering and destruction so grains must re-condense
in cold, dense molecular clouds [54,55]. Recent experiments show the viability of this ‘ISM
cold condensation’ scenario [52,56,57]. Thus, the dominant component of ISM dust condensed
in molecular clouds, was released, reprocessed in the ISM by shocks and cosmic rays, and
recycled into and out of molecular clouds [58]. Cosmic-ray exposure causes amorphization [48]
and transforms Fe in the crystal lattice to nanophase Fe® (nFe) [17,44,48,52] and is hypothesized
to produce nFeS [59]. In fact, amorphous olivine or amorphous pyroxene are very unstable
and would rapidly crystallize. For an amorphous silicate to be metastable, it needs to be off-
stoichiometry, which also usually means highly ‘defected’ and having lots of dangling bonds,
such as occurs by cosmic-ray damage [48,52,60]. Cosmic-ray exposure typically is thought to occur
in the ISM. It is speculative to suggest that solar cosmic-rays associated with X-ray flares from the

2 Amorphous silicate means amorphous-type [17], glassy, non-crystalline. Amorphous silicates may have non-stoichiometric
compositions [48]. Optical constants exist for Mg-Fe amorphous olivine and amorphous pyroxene [21,49] that were made by,
respectively, rapid cooling of melts and the sol-gel method.


young Sun could amorphize grains in the tenuous atmosphere of the ppdisc, or in jets/outflows
[61]; alternatively, X-ray flares may be possible energy source for annealing silicates in the near-
