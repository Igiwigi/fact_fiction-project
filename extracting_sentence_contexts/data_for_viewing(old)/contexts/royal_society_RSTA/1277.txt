(3.1) where Br(0) = {x € R?; |x| < R}. The boundary conditions are taken to be:

Qp(x) = $4 (mo) @ ny(x) - ET) as |x} =R (3.2)

where the map ny : dBR(0) > S? is given in the polar coordinates by

k k
n,(R cos g, Rsing) = (cos (5+) sin (5+) 0) ,y €[0,2z), (3.3)

with k € Z. Here, s+ =(b+ Vb? + 24ac)/4c is such that Q) is minimizing the bulk potential fg.

It should be noted that Q, remains invariant if we replace n, by —ny at each point in its
definition. Thus Q; depends in fact on the pair {—n), np} not on np alone. It can be observed that
the set of matrices having the representation of Q) (for some np € Ss?) give a way of embedding
the space of lines, namely the real projective plane RP”, into the space of Q-tensors Sp. We can thus
think of Q; taking values into RP? (in fact into RP! given the specific form of np as ny - e3 = 0).

Moreover, one notes that the number k/2 for k even represents the number of times mp ‘winds’
around the circle dB, the topological degree of this map (see for instance [71]). Furthermore, one
can observe that if k is odd then mp(R cos y, R sing) = — lim,_,9 np(R cos((27 — €) + ¢), R(sin(2x —
€) + )) that is after a rotation of 27 around the circle dBr(0) there will be a discontinuity for
np. However, Q,(R cos 9, Rsin g) = lime_,9 Q,(Rcos((27 — €) + y), R(sin(2x — €) + ¢)) so a similar
phenomenon will not happen for Q). Thus Q; provides an example of non-orientable boundary
condition, namely a continuous RP!-valued map which cannot be simplified into a continuous
S!-valued map (see [72] for formal definitions). Nevertheless if we consider Q, as an RP!-valued
