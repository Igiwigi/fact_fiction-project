unions between the median and musculo-spiral, or of the combined median and ulnar
with the musculo-spiral. Recovery of function took place, and a physiological
examination showed in most of his experiments that the recovery was not due to
reunion of the severed trunks, but to the cross union. In some of his experiments he
exposed the cerebral cortex to ascertain how the cortical centres were affected by the
new arrangement of the nerve trunks, but his observations led him to the conclusion
that under such circumstances the cortical centres lost their excitability, as he failed
to get responses on stimulating the cortex.

Howe and Huser (4) followed with experiments in crossing the median and
ulnar in dogs, but their conclusions, while leading them to believe in the possibility of
recovery of the muscles through crossed nerves, were inconclusive by reason of the
fact that the nerves which they crossed supplied muscles of similar function instead
of those of antagonistic action.

The correct conditions were more nearly approached by CunNniNGHAM (5), who
published his results a few years later. Cunnincuam, after having repeated the
experiments of Howext and Huser, @.¢., cross union of the median and ulnar, with
similar findings, namely, that the operation was productive of little disability to the
animal, performed a series of crossings involving the median and ulnar with the
musculo-spiral, as had been formerly done by Srerant. In four, in which the
conditions had been successfully established, he found that no proper functional
recovery had occurred. Thus, at one year and five months, in one of the experiments,
although there was practically no atrophy of the muscles, there was in-coérdination,
which prevented proper use of the limb. His examination of the condition of the
