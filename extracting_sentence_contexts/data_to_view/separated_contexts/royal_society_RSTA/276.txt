Then, equation (2.3) becomes a balance equation for the entropy of the system
that relates the changes in entropy dS/dt with the entropy production a by
irreversible processes within the system, e.g. heat diffusion, and the net exchange
of entropy across the system boundary, Js net. The net entropy exchange captures
the fact that the energy which is exchanged with the surroundings is not of the
same quality. For instance, it captures the fact that solar, shortwave radiation is
of different composition to terrestrial, longwave radiation that leaves the Earth. Hence, the entropy balance is written as

with an isolated system represented by J net = 0. Note that when we deal with the system and its surroundings together, e.g.
