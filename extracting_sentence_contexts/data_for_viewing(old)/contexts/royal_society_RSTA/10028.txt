I here set forth support the theory that in the combustion of tubular propellants
there are two distinct phases: the first when excess pressure exists inside the tube,
and the second when internal excess pressure has ceased. With such a complicated
problem it is clear that those investigators who have only had tubular forms of
propellants to deal with would be faced with a most intractable problem in
endeavouring to discover the true law of combustion by parallel surfaces. It is this
difficulty which in part accounts for the various formulas which have been advanced.

Another somewhat important consideration is that, if you assume an equation of
the form S = aP‚Äù for a tubular propellant, all tubes that have the same annulus
should give the same ballistics. It seems clear from experimental firings in guns that
the size of hole for a given annulus has an influence on ballistics, There is no
explanation of this fact in the simple equation formula, but it is at once explained by
the system of calculation which I have here set forth. The system also explains the
splits in the tubes and all the various phenomena connected with the combustion of
tubular propellants.

At the same time it is possible to obtain also for tubes a reduction equation of the
form Redn, = aP+C. I originally obtained an equation of this form, which is set out
in Table D. By this table I am able to calculate time rises very approximately with
various tubes. But it is liable to break down, gives no explanation of the various
phenomena, and is scientifically unsatisfactory in that there is no reason why the
fundamental law of reduction should differ for tubes from cords.
