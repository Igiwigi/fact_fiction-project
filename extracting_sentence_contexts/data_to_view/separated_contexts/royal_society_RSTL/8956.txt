Indeed the pulsations followed one another s0 rapidly 1
that it was no easy matter to count them. It must also be stated that while the animal
was under the influence of oxygen, the duration of the natural pauses between the n
swimming-bouts was greatly curtailed—the s8wimming-motions, in fact, being almost
quite continuous throughout the five minutes that the Medusa was exposed to such |
influence. Lastly, it will be observed from the above Table that the unnatural amount
of activity displayed by the organism while in the oxygenated water entailed on it a
considerable degree of exhaustion, as shown by the fact that even a quarter of an
hour after its restoration to normal water its original degree of energy had not quite
returned. |

(b) Carbonic acid, —As might be expected this gas has the oppoxite effects to those
of oxygen. Tt is therefore needless to say more about this agent, except that if admi-
nistered in large doses it destroys both spontaneity and irritability. Nevertheless, if
its action is not allowed to last too long, the Meduse will fully recover on being again
restored to normal s8ea-water.

(c) Nitrous ozide.—This gas at first accelerates the motions of Sarsia, but eventually
retards them, I omitted, however, to push the experiment to: the stage of complete
anzesthesia, which would doubtless have supervened had the pressure of the gas been
sufficiently great. :

(4) Deficient atration.—It may now be stated that the Meduxe are exceedingly sensi-
tive to such light carbonization of the water in which - they are contained as results
from their being confined in a limited body of it for a few hours.
