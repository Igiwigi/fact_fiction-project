medicine reached its culmination in Britain in the Pneumatic Institution, founded by Thomas [5
Beddoes in Bristol in 1798 in order to explore the effects of airs other than common air on a [8
variety of familiar ailments; but the hilarious goings on with nitrous air (laughing gas) played into ,
the hands of conservative forces, including Edmund Burke and the editors of the Anti-Jacobin
Review, who viewed the Enlightenment as a period of follies, illusions and vain enthusiasms
which needed to be brought to a speedy end. The conservative backlash ruined Beddoes’s
reputation and eventually drove Priestley into lonely exile in Northumberland, Pennsylvania
[24, pp. 263-401].

Priestley’s broad philosophical vision issued in a powerful set of epistemological principles
and methodological guidelines which regulated his pneumatic inquiries according to a strict
distinction between ‘facts’ and ‘hypotheses’ [23, pp. 399-404; 18, Part 1, pp. 31-36]. The injunction
to police the boundaries between facts and hypotheses is immediately evident in Priestley’s
view of the phlogiston theory as a ‘mere hypothesis’, which like all hypotheses was necessary
for the discovery of ‘new facts’, but bereft of any lasting explanatory worth [28]. Priestley
modelled the version of phlogiston he used in ‘Observations’ on Cavendish’s appeal to the
standard Stahlian notion of a generic ‘principle of inflammability’ (present in all combustible
substances, including metals) to explain the production of inflammable air from dilute metal-
acid solutions [18, Part 1, pp. 43-45, Part II, pp. 104-105]. But Priestley soon loosened phlogiston
from its tradition identification with the principle of inflammability, turning it into a veritable
Proteus of cosmic proportion [18, Part III, pp. 158-164; 29]. He developed a phlogistic account of
the role of respiration, which emitted phlogiston, and vegetation, which reabsorbed it, in the
balanced economy of nature. Towards the end of his life, he detected a ‘regular graduation’,
from most pure to least pure, of dephlogisticated air, common air, phlogisticated air and
nitrous air, and suggested ‘all these kinds of air differ chiefly in the quantity of phlogiston they
