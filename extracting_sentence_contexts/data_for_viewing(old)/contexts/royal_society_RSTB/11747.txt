sense: this information is detailed enough for success in the
task with respect to at most 4 items, and at best less detailed
with respect to the remaining items. The interpretations
differ only on the question of which processing stage correlates
with consciousness.

Wu [30] criticizes the idea that subjects are conscious only
of partial information on the grounds that this requires a
‘decay of information’ not required by OH. Wu argues that
this commitment to a prima facie ‘pointless step’ in the proces-
sing places an explanatory burden on CH. If this were
correct, it would be true that P(OH|D) > P(CH|D). But, in
fact, the interpretations predicted by CH and OH involve the
same decay of information: the decay of information between
visual processing and the lower-capacity processes of cognitive
access. Similarly, Block criticizes the idea that subjects are con-
scious only of non-detailed information about items outside
the focus of attention, on the grounds that inattention does
not make early visual responses less precise [17,31]. But CH

and OH both predict that the loss of detailed information
occurs at the stage of cognitive access, not in early vision.

Given this common ground between the two inter-
pretations, any support for one interpretation over the other
