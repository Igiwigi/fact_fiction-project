Among
others, the approach [26,27] should be noticed, in particular. There, an auxiliary field is introduced
in order for the construction of the action functional for the Liouville-von Neumann equation,
and thus this approach is referred to as the auxiliary field formalism. A primary reason for
the introduction of such an extra field is due to the fact that the Liouville-von Neumann
equation is a first-order differential equation in time for a density matrix. Although the Liouvilleâ€”
von Neumann equation possesses time-reversal invariance (for autonomous isolated systems),
more general master equations may violate such symmetry. For example, the Lindblad equation
repeatedly mentioned above describes dissipative dynamics.
