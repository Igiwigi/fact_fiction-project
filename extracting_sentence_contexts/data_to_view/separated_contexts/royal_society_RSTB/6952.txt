In late winter and spring, when the gonads grow once more, the birds are
induced to return to their nesting areas. Applied to birds in general, this theory, which is
certainly oversimplified, means that the basis of the autumn southward migration is
negative (the absence of a stimulus), and that of the spring northward migration is positive
(the renewal of the stimulus). This theory is able to explain several peculiar facts. It has
frequently been reported (see reviews by Rollin 1932 and Nice 1933) that in many species
of birds the adult males regularly winter to the north of the adult females which, in turn,
may winter to the north of the young birds. Much more evidence is needed on these points
before detailed statements can be made, but in the case of the chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs L.)
and the song thrush (Turdus philomelos Brehm) in Switzerland, and in that of the Mississippi
song sparrow (Melospiza melodia beata Bangs) and the Cabanis woodpecker (Dryobates
villosus hyloscopus Cabanis & Heine) in North America, it seems fairly certain that the
females normally travel farther south in autumn than do the males.
