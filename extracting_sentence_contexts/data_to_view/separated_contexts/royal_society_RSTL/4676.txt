Besides its great tendency to decomposi-
tion, there is another circumstance which presents obstacles to almost all attempts
to prepare rubian in a state of purity. There is no investigation of madder which
does not make mention of a substance, which when its solution in water is mixed
with sulphuric or muriatic acid and boiled, gives rise to the formation of a dark
green powder. To this substance, which possesses no bitter taste, and is in fact
devoid of any characteristic property except the one mentioned, I have restricted the
name of xanthine. 'The xanthine of most other chemists is however a mixture of rubian
with this substance, and possesses therefore the bitter taste of the former, while
showing the characteristic behaviour of the latter towards acids. To avoid confusion,
I sball no longer employ the name of xanthine, and T $hall call the substance which
gives the green powder with acids Chlorogenine. Now these two substances, though of
very different nature, behave similarly towards many reagents.
