It might be considered that, when the theories of Porncaré and Bore had been
discussed with such vigour, there would be comparatively little room for further
general developments of the subject. In this memoir, however, I propose to discuss
an aspect of the theory which has hitherto remained unnoticed, and which promises
to have many useful applications. In fact, I have already found it to be of
importance in connection with the problem of expanding an arbitrary function in a
series of inverse factorials, and it is highly probable that the theory can be employed
with advantage in particular cases of the problem of expanding an arbitrary function
in a series of normal functions. A simpler application is that of determining an
upper limit to the number of terms that should be taken in a given asymptotic series
in order that, for a given value of the variable, the difference between the asymptotic
expansion and the analytic function represented by the expansion should be as small
as possible. It is convenient here to specify precisely the meaning of certain expressions used in the sequel :—

(i) If % be a real variable, the statement * > means that some positive number A (independent of x)
exists, such that c=a+A.
