result, telomeres decrease in length with age in most human tissues [3] and
frequently in somatic tissues of metazoans [4].This shortening can eventually
place limits on further cell replication. Environmental factors, like smoking,
inflammation and infection shorten telomere length (TL), but also have
TL-independent effects on biology. Thus, correlations between TL and health
outcomes should not be assumed to be directly causal. Still, converging
evidence from molecular biology, and experimental and epidemiological studies
strongly suggest that shorter TL can directly influence health, particularly by
impairing immune and cardiovascular function [5-8].

In contrast to the tendency for TL to decrease in length with age in most
human tissues, sperm TL shows a positive correlation with age [7,9]. In accord-
ance with the fact that DNA carried in sperm contribute half of each offspring’s
autosomal genome, offspring of older fathers have longer TLs [7,10]. This putative
paternal age at conception (PAC) effect on TL is intriguing because it appears to be
a rare case of intergenerational genetic plasticity in which the DNA passed on to
offspring is systematically changed based upon the age at reproduction of one’s
