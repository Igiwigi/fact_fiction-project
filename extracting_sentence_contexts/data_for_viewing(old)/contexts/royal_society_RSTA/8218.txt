had vessel 4 charged with EtOH instead of water, the alcohol would have lost relatively
more than the water ; on the other hand, had vessel 2 contained the alcohol, the water
in 4 would then have lost relatively more than the alcohol.

The discrepancies between the ratio of vapour densities when derived with water
leading and with EtOH leading are thus qualitatively explained.

Turning now to correction 6 (a). If we apply the preceding discussion to the losses
in two water vessels, which are joined together without any intervening H,SO,, it is
manifest that the second vessel will lose more than the first. If the dimensions of the
two vessels are the same and if the rate of change of temperatures is slow and its range
sufficiently restricted, the first vessel will on balance suffer no loss. This result is due
to the fact that in the first operation (that of heating) the first vessel loses a quantity of
vapour which during the subsequent cooling is returned to it by the air passing through
vessel 2 provided that no condensation takes place in the connecting U-tubes.

The following considerations, which avoid the postulate that an air-vapour mixture
obeys the gas laws give us a general method for calculating the maximum loss in any

* For simplicity we neglect the probability that the supersaturated vapour may carry with it condensed
vapour,
