90 PROF. W. M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERTES,

taking Saunvers’ values, except for the last but one, where Lenarp’s is taken,
Saunpers’ reading would give a difference about 2°5 greater, or 3°5.

When we consider the remainder, considerable difficulty arises owing to the
number of ill-defined lines so close together. In some cases K.H. and 8. give very
discordant readings for doublets, which yet are so close that they look as if the
measurements might refer to the same lines, whilst in other cases the same observers
agree much more closely. It is to be remembered that apparently the method of
illumination has a great deal to do with the development of some of these lines in
the spectra—in fact, they appear to come from different sheaths of the flame or are, as
if it were a question of temperature. The doublet at 5675 was observed by K.R.,
and was the only observation of theirs which did not fit in with the ordinary series.
It is peculiar in being diffuse towards the violet. Diffuseness to the red is a general
peculiarity of the diffuse series. If we look for the seat of this diffuseness in the
formula, it would appear to lie in the VD part of the formula through diminishing
denominator. If a series were such that the VD came to the limit—as, for instance,
in many of the new series—the VD would be additive instead of subtractive, and
the change in the denominator would now produce a diminishing wave-length or
diffuseness towards the violet. Rypperc’s tables show that this doublet 5675, the
doublet at 4976 K.H., and 4660 range near his formula. They give, if K.H.’s value
for the second is taken,
