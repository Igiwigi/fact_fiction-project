We have also shown that many
differences between the full nonlinear coupling function and its first-order approximation are
not so important for determination of the synchronization regions, although the full nonlinear
function provides better accuracy. Finally, we compare our approach with the analytical technique for strongly perturbed limit
cycle oscillators of ref. [40]. Except for the trivial fact that our reduction is merely numerical,
we mention the essential difference: we rely on the unperturbed definition of the phase, ie. we
remain in the framework of the perturbation theory. On the contrary, the authors of [40] define a
generalized phase, i.e. a family of phases for different values of a systemâ€™s parameter. Next, they
consider the case when the strong component of the forcing is very slow and then exploit the
generalized phase to obtain a close equation in the adiabatic limit.
