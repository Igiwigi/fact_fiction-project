the sulphur group, although, IT added, © I hesitate to assert this yery positively”*. In
speaking of a metalloid of the sulphur group, I should explain that T had in view, not
a decidedly non-metallic body like sulphur, but one of the connecting links between
metals and non-metals—a metalloid in the strict meaning of the word, like tellurium or
arsenic. If T had formed any particular view upon the matter, knowing s0 little of the
properties of the new body, it was that it might possibly prove to be a higher link in
the sulphur, selenium, and tellurium chain. It was not long before further research
showed me that the body under examination had, in addition to the characters already
mentioned, others which gave it strictly metallic characters; and although no formal
publication of this isolated fact was immediately made, the element was commonly
spoken of in scientific circles as a new metal, and was 80 described by me at the Exhi-
bition on the 1st of May last. I enter thus into details on 0 trifling a subject because
French chemists are inclined to attach undue importance to the term, and misinterpret
the meaning of metalloid.

Even with our present knowledge of the chemical and physical characteristics of
thallium, it is not easy to assign its true position in the scale of elements. T cannot
admit, with the French chemists, that it is an alkali-metal. Almost the only property
which thallium possesses in common with the alkali-metals is the solubility of its oxide,
and perhaps its forming an insoluble platinum-salt. But oxides of lead, silver, and
mercury are also soluble in water, reacting in many respects like alkaline solutions ;
and oxide of thallium is far more analogous to these than to potash and soda, inasmuch
