The epicardia are
fused and have lost the openings into the pharynx. There is a narrow vessel to
the test, containing a mesenchymatous septum; and budding is by abdominal
constriction (BERRILL, 1935, 6). The zooids and colonies are very small and are,
in fact, dwarfed diazonid types, there being associated with dwarfness a loss of the
internal longitudinal vessels and the papillae that give rise to them, and as in most
dwarfed ascidians, the eggs are few and large, giving rise to comparatively elaborate
tadpole larvae. Reconstructions of the abdominal region of Archidistoma, Eudistoma, and Pycno-
clavella are to be seen in fig. 6, showing the relative positions of gut-loop and
epicardium, and the U-shaped heart, which in these very small zooids is
comparatively short. Closely related to the above distomids are Distaplia and Colella, two forms that
have further elaborated the colonial state.
