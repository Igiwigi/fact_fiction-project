Mackerras (1930)
remarks that the uniformity with which competition is observed makes certain that the
blowfly population is always greatly in excess of the numbers that would be required to find
and occupy all the available carrion. While this may be true—and in some cases it seems
likely that the overcrowding of a carcass might be so severe that the resulting competition
will even produce the death of all the individuals thereon (see the laboratory results)—the
problem can be stated in the reverse manner. The fact that there is always a large population of blowflies in the field goes to show that
there is sufficient food in the environment to produce this excessive population in spite of
the overcrowding and consequent competition on carcasses. If competition is regarded as
meaning the result of an unfavourable ratio between the amount of food available and the
density of the adult fly population within a given area, then it is evident that the conditions
are not sufficiently unfavourable at the present time to serve as a successful factor in pro-
ducing an ‘economic control’ of blowfly populations. That this is due to a gradual increase in the amount of food which is available in the field
seems likely.
