However, on increasing the current
density further, the hexadecane CA starts to pick up and reach about 100° at 0.75 Acm™?, 15 V. It
was attempted to go beyond the current density value; however, the surface edges had started to
lose their structural integrity. This was owing to the fact that non-uniform pitting had occurred
across the surface with the number of pits being denser near the edges. Additionally, increasing
the current density made the situation worse leading to complete dissolution of the edges. As
discussed earlier, lowering the solute ion concentration results in fewer pitting sites and a larger
current density results in larger pits.
