As it might be supposed that even glass was. pervious to
water by such a force, a small phial was made air-tight, by
fitting into its neck a well-ground glass stopper. It sustained
pressure- of 500 atmospheres without change, and was per-
fectly dry within, although it remained under that pressure
15 minutes. It was next subjected to a pressure of 800 at-
mospheres, and when taken out was found to be crushed to
atoms.

In the course of my experiments on the compression of
atmospheric air, by the same apparatus which had been used
for compressing water, I observed a curious fact, which in-
duced me to extend the experiment; viz. that of the air
beginning to disappear at a pressure of 300 atmospheres,
evidently by partial liquefaction, which is indicated by the
quicksilver not settling down to a level with its surface. At an
increased pressureof 600 atmospheres, the quicksilver was sus-
pended about & of the volume up the tube or gasometer ; at
800 atmospheres, it remained about L up the tube; at 1000
atmospheres, 4 up the tube, and small globules of liquid began
to form about the top of it; at 1200 atmospheres, the quick-
silver remained 2 up the tube, and a beautiful transparent
liquid was seen on the surface of the quicksilver, in quantity
about 255 part of the column of air. The gasometer, fig. 9,
