will also converge,

for u“8 € (1, 00), to the same value at the end of sync, for each one of the six sectors (123), (132), .. .,
on the Kasner circles Ko, Ke, no matter the values they started with. They therefore give two sets
of identical BKL map values after the end of sync at the two different spatial points.

The same is true for the boundary u-values of each sector, namely the values u = 1, and u = 00
(this last value characterizes the so-called ‘Taub points’ T),T2,T3, pa = (1,0, 0), (0, 1,0), (0,0, 1).
In fact, the midpoints Q1,Q2,Q3 of the three arcs connecting the three Taub points on a Kasner
circle, which correspond to the LRS Kasner solutions, are also synchronized. This follows from


their parametrization, cf. [18], p. 132, namely, by setting Y+ = cos y, Y_ =sin y, one finds that,
1 1
pre = 3(1—2cosyA%), pyy = 51 + cosy* + V3sin y 4), (6.6)

with the Q points lying at the values y =0,27/3,47/3, respectively. When B receives data from
A and synchronizes, then [Tz — 2, and so we have that peo v4, hence, Q? Q4. That is, the
midpoints of the arcs connecting the Taub points on the two Kasner circles corresponding to B,A
also become indistinguishable. Hence, we conclude that the two u-values uA, u® have been reset
at the end of sync.
