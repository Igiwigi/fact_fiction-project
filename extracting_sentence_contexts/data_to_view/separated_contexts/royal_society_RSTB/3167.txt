Impregnation takes place in the Fallopian tube, and the ova pass into the uterus
within three days of the time of dehiscence. Dehiscence normally occurs during
cestrus, Ova, when dehisced, pass, whether fertilised or not, into the uterus
(AssHETON, 1898). ;

From the above facts it is clear that the ova arrive in the uterus during the
latest stages of the metcestrum or during the early part of the succeeding period of
rest. The time for the next procestrum would accordingly be between the 12th
and 16th days of pregnancy. It would be interesting to note whether this is
coincident with any marked changes in the uterine mucosa.
