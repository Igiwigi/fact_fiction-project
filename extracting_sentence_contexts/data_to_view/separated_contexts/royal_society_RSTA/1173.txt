However, the best-fit analytic
description of Perdita’s motion reveals a libration amplitude of 200°—a physical impossibility,
because libration cannot exceed 180°. Further analysis proceeds, but the implication of a large
libration is that Perdita is barely inside the resonance. It may, in fact, straddle the separatrix
that defines the boundary in phase space between resonance and near-resonance. Such a result
provides further, albeit preliminary, evidence for chaotic motion, perhaps on time scales much
shorter than the approximately 10° years discussed previously. Between the Portia group and the innermost classical satellite, Miranda, lie two additional
moons, Puck and Mab.
