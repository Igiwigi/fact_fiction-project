132 DR. E. C. JEFFREY ON THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT

beyond the fact that the young central cylinder in these species is throughout a
concentric fibro-vascular tube with foliar lacunze.

Photograph 35, Plate 5, represents the tubular stele of Antrophyum semicostatum.
The gap in the central cylinder is subtended by two concentric leaf-traces. Photo-
graph 36, Plate 5, shows the central cylinder more highly magnified. By looking
carefully, the sieve-tubes may be made out as small, apparently empty, elements
separated from the wood by a single row of parenchymatous cells. Although the
layer of phloem is continuous around the outside of the central cylinder, it quickly
disappears on its inner surface. Photograph 37, Plate 5, is more highly magnified,
and it shows the feature already described very clearly. The internal phloem comes
to an end not far from the left-hand margin of the photograph. ‘This peculiarity has
been described by Porrautr as of frequent occurrence in species of Antrophyum.
