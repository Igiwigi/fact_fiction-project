When this theory is
applied to other Arthropoda it again raises difficulties. It does not explain the amazing
uniformity of the plan of mesodermal segmentation found in the heads of the mandibulate
groups in spite of the difference in the numbers of adult head appendages. Snodgrass’s
statement that coelomic sacs in his extended ‘acron’ are best developed in the higher
arthropods is not borne out by the facts, unless he means that two somites occur in his
“unsegmented acron’ in the mandibulate arthropods while only one occurs in Peripatus. In the Crustacea, for example, a hollow antennulary somite has not yet been seen, and the
antennal somite is solid except for the cavity of the antennal gland. The cavity of the
antennal somite in Peripatus is relatively much larger than any in the Crustacea.
