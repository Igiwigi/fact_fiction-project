done without difficulty : but as s0on as it saw it, it swam to it, brought it to me,
laid it down at my feet, and again swam through the river to my gamekeeper. I
never saw a dog of any age acquit itself so well, yet it was most certainly wholly
untaught. \ I state the cireumstances with reluctance, and not without hesitation,
because I doubt whether I could myself believe them to be well founded upon any
other evidence than that of my own senses : the statement is nevertheless most per-
fectly correct.

I could add an account of a great many more experiments and observations which
were made with other yarieties of dogs and upon other species of animals, but as all
the facts which I have noticed are confirmations of the truth of the conclusions
which I have drawn from those above stated, I shall state the result of one other ex-
periment only, and that solely because it tends to establish a fact which appears to
me to be of a good deal of importance.

I stated in a communication to this Society many years ago, © upon the Compara-
tive Influence of the Male and of the Female Parent upon the Offspring of some Spe-
cies.of Animals,” that in cases where nature intended the offspring to accompany its
parent in flight at an early age, the influence of the parent of one sex upon the form of
the offspring differed very widely from that of the other parent, and that when the fe-
male parents were of small size and of a small breed, and of permanent habits, and the
male of a large size and large breed, and of permanent habits, the length of the legs
of the foetus were given by those of the family of the female parent. I imported some
Norwegian Pony Mares with the intention of obtaining cross-bred animals between
them and the London Dray Horse ; having satisfied myself that the experiment might
