The propagation length indeed increases proportionally to the gap thickness. For the metal (figure 5b) it is almost independent of the wavelength, in full agreement with (4.11),
while for InGaAs (figure 5d) the propagation length does depend on the wavelength. This can
be explained by the fact that, when the wavelength approaches the plasma wavelength, the field
penetrates deep inside the semiconductor. At any rate, comparing figure 5b,d one can see that the
propagation length in metal always exceeds that in semiconductor despite higher material loss in
the metal.

5. Conclusion

We have compared the performance of alternative plasmonic materials in the IR region with
that of metals using a simple fully analytical model.
