During the progress of the research it was found that there was a disagreement of
some two or three per cent. between the direct measurement of the equilibrium
pressure and the same when calculated by means of Porrer’s equation from the
lowering of the vapour pressure of the solutions. The cause of this discrepancy is surmised to be due to the fact that the experiments
were carried out in air at atmospheric pressure, while Prof. Porrer’s equation implies
vacuum conditions ; and although by modifying the equation to suit our requirements
we obtain results (infra) which are in close agreement, yet the values for the vapour

* This density was not used in the final computations—it is known to be wrong—suflicient time was not
given for the temperature of the solution to become constant at 0° C.

pressure and density of water vapour in air, which are used in the reduction, may be
somewhat in error.* It is, therefore, thought advisable to give somewhat full details
of the various devices tried and of the test experiments made.
