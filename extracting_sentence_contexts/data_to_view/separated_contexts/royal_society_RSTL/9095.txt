Whence K,(1—X,)*=-034, K(1—X)*=:080. Hence it follows that the time, in the first period of the integration of Section 15,
may have been over-estimated by some percentage less than some number lying
between 3 and 8. In fact, I have corrected the first period of that integration by a rather more tedious
process than that here exhibited, and I found that the time was over-estimated by a
little less than 3 per cent. And it was found that we ought to subtract from the
46,300,000 years comprised within the first period about 1,300,000 years. I also found
that the error in the final value of the obliquity could hardly amount to more than 1'or 2”.
