REPRODUCTION OF THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT 131

length from 60 mm to about 1400 mm. These animals are shown in table 1, where they are
arranged in order of the size of the foetus, and it will be seen that there are sixteen with
foetuses up to 8 kg in weight, and fourteen with foetuses over 80 kg, and only one specimen
intermediate between these two groups, with a foetus of 45 kg. It has been shown in
a previous section of the present paper (p. 102 and figure 1) that in all probability the
sixteen foetuses below 8 kg represent a series of stages of gestation up to about half-term,
while the fourteen of 80 kg and over represent a group of animals nearing full term, and
E117, with a foetus weighing 45 kg, was probably about 16 months post-coitum. Thus
there is a gap in the series of pregnancies, and stages immediately after half-term are not
represented. This has to be borne in mind in the interpretation of the condition of the
ovaries, together with the fact that early implantation and pre-implantation stages are
also not represented.

The ovaries of several animals at different stages of pregnancy are shown in figures 14,
16 and 18, plates 5 and 6. The available material covers the gestation period from an early
uterine stage to very near term, and post-partum animals are also available. Throughout
this period the ovaries are characterized by the presence of a number of apparently active
corpora lutea, bright yellow in colour in most of the specimens, and only beginning to
darken with the near approach of parturition. As the photographs show, many of these
corpora lutea bear a protuberance which can only be regarded as marking the point of
rupture of the follicle from which the corpus luteum developed. â€˜The pregnant animals fall,
however, into two groups according to whether or not the ovaries contain follicles with
antra. Some such follicles, sometimes very small and sometimes as much as 5 mm in
