The length of this latter system would be practically the same as that of the a-axis
(9-4 AU), whereas the former would be much too long. The Action of Sodium Sulphide—Knowing as we do that undamaged wool does not
give the reactions of —S—S— and —SH, it is perhaps not surprising that unstretched
wool and hair do not betray any of what we may call the “ free spacings ” of cystine. On the other hand, it is known—and this investigation has in a number of ways confirmed
the fact and supplied the explanation—that stretched hair is more vulnerable to the action
of reagents than unstretched hair, We are thus permitted to ask ourselves whether it is
not indeed much more than a coincidence that the most intense X-ray reflection given by
stretched hair has the same spacing as the most intense reflection given by cystine. In the

é-form of hair it is (200), spacing 4-65 AU., and in cystine (120), spacing 4-70 ALU. In both cases this spacing is at right angles to the chief crystallographic axis, and is
actually what we have postulated above to be the half length of the cystine molecule and
the full length of the cysteine molecule, SH .
