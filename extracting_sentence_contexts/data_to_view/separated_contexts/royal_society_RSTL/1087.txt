Whatever new lights new discoveries may throw upon
this subject, still the facts that have been advanced, shew that
a step nearer at least has been attained towards the true
knowledge of the nature of the alkalies and the earths. *

* Since the facts in this Paper were communicated to the Royal Society, I have
Seen an account of some very curious experiments of M.M. Gar Lussac, and
TrzNxard, (in Number 148 of the Moniteur, for 1808, which I have just received,)
from one of which they have concluded, « that potassium may be/a compound of
hydrogene and potash.” These gentlemen are said to have heated potassium in ammonia, and found that
the ammonia was absorbed, and that hydrogene gas equal to two-thirds of its
volume appeared, and that the potassium by this process had become of a grayish-
green colour. By heating this grayish-green substance considerably, two-fift!:s of the
ammonia were again emitted, with a quantity of hydrogene and nitrog2ne correspond=-
ing to one-fifth more, and by adding water to the mixture, and heating it very strongly
again, they obtained the remainder of the ammonia, and nothing but potash was left.
