(Note——Two coefficients that remained constant from one Standard group to the next have been

The fact that partial associations in undefective universes are higher than total associa-
tions, combined with my first impression (unjustified I think) that associations were, on
the whole, higher in the healthier groups, led me at first to believe that the effect of
selection would be to increase associations. I still cannot help thinking that this is
practically, as it is formally, possible, it being remembered that association will
decrease or increase simply according as
