mentioned, the insect shows several anomalies (p. 17). In the first place, unlike the
yellow spots, the wings are slightly iridescent, that is to say, they are reddish gold
at normal incidence, but greenish yellow at grazing incidence. Now this is exactly
the opposite of what would be expected of insects possessing a structure at right
angles to their scale surface. The cause was not at once apparent, even when
sections of the scales had been cut. At first they were thought to be exactly the
same as those of O. poseidon, but this was only the case upon the underside
where the scales are a pale green even at normal incidence. There are, however,
several matt yellow patches on the hind wings, which remain the same colour at
all angles. The strive of these scales are tooth-shaped (see Plate 3, fig. 30),
though not quite so coarse and comb-like as those on the corresponding patches
of O. poseidon. No colour, except that due to pigment, ean be produced by
structures of this description, but careful examination reveals the fact that the
transition to other portions of the wing is not so abrupt as was thought. Indeed,
scales may be found in which the triangular striz are so acute and compressed
that they become approximately parallel-sided plates. Moreover, with the best
apochromatic objectives, and in thin sections, it can be seen that in most scales
the pillars appear to have pointed or acute-angled tops, as shown in Plate 3,
fig. 3a, instead of square or round ones. Owing to the thickness of the sections
and other difficulties, the above figure rather exaggerates this appearance. In
addition, the plates are not quite as tall as in O. poseidon, and they are placed
rather further apart.

The explanation of the colour changes is probably as follows. If the upper
portion of each plate is an acute-angled triangle, part of it will be unable to
