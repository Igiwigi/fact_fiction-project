Fhe least complicated mode of experimentation for determining these effects would
azthat of directly observing the changes in the central end of a divided anterior
opt. This experiment, however, we have not yet successfully accomplished ; the
lificulties in the way of obtaining satisfactory connections with a divided anterior
out are augmented by its anatomical relations, and by the fact that, in order, as we
hall see, to obtain any changes in the root an intensity of stimulus has to be applied

he cord which evokes general movements, thus dragging on the short root. The

gers of inadequate isolation have been already dwelt upon in Chapter IV. Our
frempts in this direction were so unsuccessful that we determined to employ the
nore laborious method of division of all the posterior roots, and examination of the
slectrical changes in the sciatic nerve.

The plan of experiment, therefore, consisted in exposing the lumbar cord and
auda equina (see Plates 34 and 35, and fig. 18), and then dividing the posterior roots
of the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th lumbar, Ist and 2nd sacral nerves, so as to leave the sciatic
