selection suggests that there is more going on than just apart from the Indo-European ones with regard to number


systems is the fact that the former language family has pri-
marily languages with a restricted number system. So it
appears that both higher numbers behave differently from
low numbers, and languages with productive and consistent
higher numbers tend to behave differently from those with
restricted systems. As we progress from smaller quantities
towards larger quantities, the morphological patterns
observed become more regular and transparent, with an ele-
gant pattern capturing this development: ‘the degree of
morphological fusion varies inversely with the size of the
numerical value’ [38, p. 281].

Neatly, the regularities spill beyond number-formation
