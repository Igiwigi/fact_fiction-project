As an atom with a one-dimensional thermal
speed of 0.17ms~! would traverse 55m (half the transverse period) in about 300 ps, this is a
reasonable order of magnitude for a washout of a density pattern owing to the velocity spread of
the ensemble. This is explored further in ยง3.

3. Theoretical model

The analysis of the experimental results is somewhat complicated by the fact that in general
electronic and optomechanical nonlinearities are simultaneously present, so that an internal
state and a density pattern can be simultaneously present in the atomic ensemble. Internal-state
nonlinear effects can be accounted for in our theoretical model [16], but we neglect them here by
assuming low saturation values, because, at low temperatures, a spatial instability is expected
to occur even at low saturation levels owing to density redistribution effects only [15]. The
results presented in [16] provide experimental support for this claim in the appropriate parameter
regimes.
