The fundamental feature of this model is the direct influ-
ence of gating neurons on the synaptic spread of activity
between other neurons, which could arise via different pos-
sible mechanisms. This gating could involve synapses on the
dendritic tree of pyramidal cells that interact via voltage-
dependent N-methyl-p-aspartate (NMDA) conductances,
such that a conjunction of nearby synaptic inputs is necessary
to generate an output [19,20]. This model is supported by the
fact that neurons receive multiple different functional synaptic
inputs, but commonly only respond to a subset of these inputs
[21,22]. Alternately, it could involve axo-axonic inhibitory
interneurons that can directly regulate spiking output [23,24]. The range of human cognitive function could reflect a range
of neuromodulatory influences in different individuals [25,26].
