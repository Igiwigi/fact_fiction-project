However, if the relative heading of the neighbour
its neighbour. In D. rerio, figure 3a shows that the focal fish is turned to the right, alignment alone would induce the focal
turns towards its neighbour when they are close to each fish to turn right. This difficulty comes from the fact that a
other (dj *1-2BL) or when the neighbour is located function (5¢) that depends on three variables (dj, yi; and ¢;)
behind the focal fish (1 yj! >90°, whatever the distance). cannot be represented in 3D. To overcome this limitation,
When the neighbour is at dj * 2-3BL in front of the focal some authors use a kind of force map where the relative pos-
fish (1 yi; < 60°), the focal fish turns away from its neighbour, ition of a fish with respect to a focal fish is decomposed into
as well as when its neighbour is very close to it CF <0.5 BL). the left-right (LR) and front—back (FB) distances [13]. In
The reaction to the neighbour's heading is less intense than figure 2a, (d,, yij) are the polar coordinates of fish j in the
in H. rhodostomus, as shown by the wide white regions in system of reference centred on fish i pointing north.
