estimates of fossil age. The points in this plot have R? =
0.903. The median error (where the error is the difference
between the phylogenetic median and the geological
median) is 1.96 Myr. The median relative error (where the
relative error is the error divided by the geological median)
was 5.7% and the median relative standard deviation (RSD;
defined as the standard deviation of the marginal posterior
divided by the posterior median estimate) was 9.2%.
Asummary of the individual estimates are tabulated in table 1.
As judged by BFs, only one fossil exhibited strong evi-
dence (i.e. log BF <— 3.0) that the phylogenetic estimate of
fossil age was inconsistent with the geological age range.
The log BF for Paraptenodytes antarcticus was —3.4. In fact,
