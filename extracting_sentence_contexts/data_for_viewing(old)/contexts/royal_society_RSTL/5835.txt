and the consideration of such a system of equations leads to most of the fundamental
notions in the theory of matrices. It will be seen that matrices (attending only to those
of the same order) comport themselves as single quantities; they may be added.
multiplied or compounded together, &c.: the law of the addition. of matrices is pre-
cisely similar to that for the addition of ordinary algebraical quantities; as regards their
multiplication (or composition), there is the peculiarity that matrices are not in general
convertible; it is nevertheless possible to form the powers (positive or negative,
integral or fractional) of a matrix, and thence to arrive at the notion of a rational and
integral function, or generally of any algebraical function, of a matrix. I obtain the
remarkable theorem that any matrix whatever satisfies an algebraical equation of its
own order, the coefficient of the highest power being unity, and those of the other
powers functions of the terms of the matrix, the last coefficient being in fact the deter-
minant ; the rule for the formation of this equation may be stated in the following con-
densed form, which will be intelligible after a perusal of the memoir, viz. the determi-

nant, formed out of the matrix diminished by the WET considered as a single quantity
involving the matrix unity, will be equal to $650, The theorem "hows that every
rational and integral function (or indeed every rational function) of a matrix may be
considered as a rational and integral function, the degree of which is at ok equal to
that of the matrix, less unity ; it even shows that in a sense, the 8ame is true with respect
