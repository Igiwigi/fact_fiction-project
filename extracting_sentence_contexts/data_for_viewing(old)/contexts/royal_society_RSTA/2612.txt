also likely to occur upon emplacement of primitive
melts into the mush. Furthermore, replenishment
facilitates mixing between the replenishing melt
and interstitial melts of the mush. Hence, crystal
mushes facilitate reaction and mixing, which
leads to significant homogenization, and which
may account for the geochemical systematics
of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB). A second
consequence is cryptic fractionation. At mid-
ocean ridges, a plagioclase framework may already
have formed when clinopyroxene saturates. As a
result, clinopyroxene phenocrysts are rare, despite
the fact that the vast majority of MORB records
clinopyroxene fractionation. Hence, melts extracted
