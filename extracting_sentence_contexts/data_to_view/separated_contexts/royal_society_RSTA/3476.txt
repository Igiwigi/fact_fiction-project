A constant current was run through the wire so that its temperature and
resistance were invariable except in so far as they depended on the pressure of the
gas in the apparatus. Since the rate of escape of heat from the wire is determined largely by the gas
pressure, the temperature of the wire is a function of the pressure. In fact, the
galvanometer spot was a far more sensitive indicator of the pressure than the McLeod
gauge. By carefully watching the galvanometer and pumping accordingly, the
variations of both pressure and temperature were kept very small indeed. Under these conditions it was hoped that the rate of leak from the wire with a
constant voltage would remain approximately constant.
