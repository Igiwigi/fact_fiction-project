and the convergence in (7.1) is exponential. The fact that the limit projection has rank 1 is a
consequence of the irreducibility assumption (I). A semigroup {T(t),t = 0} satisfying condition
(7.1) is said to have asynchronous exponential growth. It should be mentioned that one can find
in the literature, e.g. [28], a more general definition of asynchronous exponential growth, where
it is only assumed that e~"T(#)x converges to a non-zero finite rank operator.
