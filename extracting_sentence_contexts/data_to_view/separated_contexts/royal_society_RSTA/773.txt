With the approach imagined here, we can state a much more usable property, composing
race-free and concurrency-feature-restricted component P with a context that is not restricted, C,
while maintaining the ability to reason about P using SC verification tools. We call this property
component SC,

[P-C]c++ E [Plsc # [C]o++-

Component SC strengthens the memory model that underlies P, so that with some adaptation
we may now use SC logics like CoLoSL [32] for validating properties of P. In fact, there is a range
of state-of-the-art concurrent logics with weaker underlying memory models (e.g. OGRA [33],
RSL [34], FSL [35], GPS [36]). Our imagined denotational approach allows one to choose the ideal
model for each component: strong enough to use a less intricate logic, yet weak enough to admit
a high-performance implementation.
