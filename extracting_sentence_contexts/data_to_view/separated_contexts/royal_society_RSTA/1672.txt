A shock wave in its early
stage is clearly visible at x; ~ 660 1m in figure 2c,d. The shock is generated following an electron
density pile-up in the region where ic < ne < 1, (inset in figure 1a). In fact, as noticed in [27], due
to fluctuations in y in this region, the target is not completely transparent to the laser and, thus,
the laser is able to push electrons at its front, launching the collisionless shock. The nonlinear
wave travels through the up-ramp plasma and reflects both ion species, as shown in figure 3a,b,
where the longitudinal phase space for hydrogen and carbon ions at later times is displayed. At this point, hydrogen and carbon ions are accelerated to different velocities.
