While the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) : zB
displays numerous advantages as a CFD tool, see [3,4], it formulates on an uniform Cartesian 1S

mesh, by default. Therefore, the task of prescribing boundary conditions over arbitrarily shaped
surfaces requires particular care in order to avoid the inaccurate staircase discretization. This
task is further complicated by the fact that LBMâ€™s working variables correspond to mesoscopic 8
populations, rather than macroscopic fields [5]. Thus, the LBM realization of hydrodynamic :
boundary conditions tends to be made implicitly, through conditions set at the level of the aaa)
mesoscopic populations. Such difficulties explain the relentless interest in this topic, which :
continues an active area of research [3,4,6].
