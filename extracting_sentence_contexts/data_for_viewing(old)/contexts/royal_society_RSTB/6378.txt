vertically but horizontally around the embryo. On hatching, therefore, the tail and
tail fin that were pressed against the body assume their proper vertical position.
There is no twist.

Since in the more primitive Styelids and Polystyelids the tail is coiled vertically,
this horizontal coiling can only be of the nature of an adaptation to the compressed
condition. Accordingly the fact that both groups, Botryllids and Polystyelids
(including Styelopsis), show the same adaptation is further evidence that there has
been but one primary instance of marked accumulation of yolk within the family.

In any case there has been divergent evolution in development, from Styelopsis
to Distomus and Stolonica, and from Symplegma to Botryllus and Botrylloides, whether or
not the large eggs of Styelopsis and Symplegma represent related or parallel develop-
ment among themselves.

In the change Symplegma——- Botryllus there has been what can only be called a
telescoping (cf. MacBring, 1914) of development. This must be due either to a rela-
tive retardation of tail development or an acceleration of trunk development, without
any important change in the nature of the developmental processes themselves.
