The Einstein equations do not impose any restrictions on the spatial topological complexity

of a solution, and this means that one may arbitrarily change the spatial topology of an original : =
space-time-solution of the field equations and still keep the resulting configuration as a solution. : =
Topological complexity, that is the complexity of a given topology of some solution to the field :B
equations, is something that is measured by the number of the moduli degrees of freedom, : =
namely, the number Nyy = 6g + 2k — 6, where g denotes the genus and k the number of conical :8
singularities of the underlying orbifold. (Although every manifold is trivially an orbifold, the [3
converse is not true. To get an idea of what an orbifold very roughly looks like, take a properly :s
discontinuous action of a group I” acting on a manifold M, then an orbifold looks locally like the :8
coordinate system chart M—> M/T. It is an orbit-manifold.) : =I

Returning to our discussion of Bianchi spatial topologies, it is an intriguing fact that when
compact spatial topologies are admitted to the standard Bianchi universes, the well-known
properties met in standard Bianchi cosmology change to such a degree that the situation becomes
almost reversed (see [128-134] for more information). Some Bianchi universes (IV and VI;,) no
longer exist, while those that contained the FRWL universes and were the generic ones with
trivial topologies, now are no longer generic. For example, the VII), universe must be isotropic
and hence not generic, and the Bianchi IX universe with compact topology of any complexity
is non-generic, but B-III and B-VIII now become the most general types, although they do not
contain FRWL universes as special cases and get arbitrarily close to them.

The conclusion of the consideration of anisotropic universes with compact topologies is that
they become heavily restricted, while isotropic ones are non-generic. Compact open universes
become necessarily isotropic if they are assumed homogeneous, and flat spaces are generally
