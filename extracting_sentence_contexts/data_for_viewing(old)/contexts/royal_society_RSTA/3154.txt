In any case, it is highly original to proclaim as a problem for the future, one that
mathematicians would think they had already completely possessed for a long time, such
as the axioms for arithmetic. What might the many laymen in the auditorium say? Will
their respect for us grow? And you will also have a tough fight on your hands with the
philosophers. [28, p. 129]

Frege’s reaction to the GdG proved Minkowski’s concern to be justified, as his main criticism
referred to the status of axioms as implicit definitions.

The next three problems in the list are directly related with geometry and, although not
explicitly formulated in axiomatic terms, they address the question of finding the correct
relationship between specific assumptions and specific, significant geometrical facts. The fifth
problem, for instance, relates to the question of the foundations of geometry as it had evolved
over the last third of the nineteenth century along two parallel paths. On the one hand, there
was the age-old tradition of elementary synthetic geometry, where the question of foundations
more naturally arises in axiomatic terms. On the other hand, there was the tradition associated
with the Helmholtz-Lie problem that derived directly from the work of Riemann and that had
a more physically grounded orientation connected with the question of spaces that admit the
free mobility of rigid bodies. Whereas Helmholtz had only assumed continuity as underlying the
motion of rigid bodies, in applying his theory of groups of transformations to this problem, Lie
was also assuming the differentiability of the functions involved. Hilbert’s work on the foundations
of geometry, especially in the context that led to GdG, had so far been connected with the first
of these two traditions, while devoting much less attention to the second one. Now in his fifth
problem, he asked whether Lie’s conditions, rather than assumed, could actually be deduced
