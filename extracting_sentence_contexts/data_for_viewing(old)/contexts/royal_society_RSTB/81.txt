That this ventral copulatory organ, now in the Reptilia restricted to the Crocodilia
and Chelonia, has been inherited by the Avian stock, and has been specialised in
the various ways fully and correctly described by Jon. Murtier. The struthious
form comes nearest to that of the monimostylic Reptiles, whilst that of the other
Ratitee and of the Lamellirostres shows great specialisation in being evertible. The
comparison of the organ, as it is found in various other Carinate, Â¢eg., in the
Tinamoos, the Cracidee, in Phcenicopterus, Platalea, Ciconia, shows a gradual diminu-
tion in size and a simpler structure, with all the appearance of a degraded organ.
Lastly, in the majority of Birds, especially in the highest, it has disappeared, and the
primitive way of everting the cloaca is again resorted to. The degeneration and final
loss of such an organ, the development of which must have been caused and favoured
equally by natural and by sexual selection, is a fact which we would not have arrived
at by @ priori considerations.

That the presence of a clitoris is not due to an originally hermaphroditic condition,
but to direct paternal inheritance, and that it is preserved because of its hedonic
nature.

That the extraordinary resemblance of the copulatory organs and the various
cloacal chambers of the Monotremata to those of the Chelonia and young Crocodilia
can hardly be explained by homoplastic coincidence, but that it strongly urges the
phylogenetic relationship of the Mammals with the Reptiles. This, however, is only
one more link in the long chain which, being anchored in the triassic Theriomorpha,
in spite of Mono- and Amphicondylism, makes the Amniota more akin to each other
