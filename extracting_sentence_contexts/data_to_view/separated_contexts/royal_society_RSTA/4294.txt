As a result, it seems clear that non-polar molecules,
possibly having strong absorption features in the NIR, should be preferred for many reasons:


collisions are less effective; the refractive index is smaller; moleculesâ€™ adsorption and desorption
from the cell walls are strongly reduced. This latter feature, in particular, makes it possible to
perform spectral averaging over long times, thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio without
the risk of line distortion caused by a pressure variation arising from the interaction with
the cell. There exists a line shape problem due to the fact that fully ab initio line shape calculations
are prohibitively complex for self-colliding molecules. Approximations and simplifications are
necessary for the construction of those models that have been mentioned in this article. In
the kinetic theory of spectral profiles, in addition to the standard binary collision and impact
approximations, there is the assumption that the translation motion can be treated classically
[82].
