and sold for thousands of dollars; his daughter was (in 1999)
also a keen artist, producing (then) the kind of drawings one
might expect from a 3-year old, for which most people would
not be inclined to pay. Cohen, however, rates his daughter's
creativity as much greater than that of his program [2]. Accord-
ingly, he makes a distinction between Big-C creativity and
Little-C creativity, also seen elsewhere in the literature [2],
where Big-C is Picasso level, and Little-C is what AARON
can manage. Margaret Boden [3] makes another perhaps
more tractable distinction between psychological creativity—the
act of generating an artefact that is novel and of value to an
individual—and historical creativity—that of generating an arte-
fact that is novel and valued in historical terms. However, this
notion must be generalized: rather than two discrete kinds of
creativity, value and novelty should not be thought of as
simple quantities, but as relations between observers and the
created artefact. Thus, for example, we can account for cycles
of fashion: retro styles may be valued by both teenagers and
their parents, the former enjoying their (relative) novelty and
the latter doing exactly the opposite. We return to the matter
of novelty below.

Value is dependent not only on the observer but also on the
context in which the observation is made. It is present in many
more pursuits than the artistic ones mentioned above, and
