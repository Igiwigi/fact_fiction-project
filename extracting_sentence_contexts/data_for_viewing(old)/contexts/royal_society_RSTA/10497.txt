As will be seen in fig. 1, some of the crystals do not reflect the light quite equally
from all parts of their surface, but seem to be shaded. The shaded appearance is
only visible in certain illuminations, the orientation of the crystal appearing quite
uniform in all others. When examined under the microscope, it was found that the
edges of the etched pits upon them were not quite parallel in the various parts.
Fig. 2 shows part of such a crystal magnified 12 diameters, and it can be seen
that the edges of the pits between the two dark bands running across the centre are
not quite parallel to those on the portions on either side; the difference is, however,
slight. The effect is probably caused by a slight disturbance whilst the erystal was
forming, one part being moved relatively to another when the metal between them
was still molten. Such a disturbance might be brought about by external causes,
such as a shaking of the mould, or by stresses set up as the metal cooled. The
difference of orientation is still further brought out by the fact that the acid has
acted more strongly where the two portions jom than upon the surrounding area;
this etching out has produced furrows, which appear as the dark bands in fig. 2.
Such an action is always seen between two patches of different orientation, and

where the difference is great, as it is between two crystals, a furrow which can
he easily seen without any magnification is produced. It may be accounted for
by electrolytic differences between the two portions producing a more violent action
where they meet.
