Mr. Ds La Rus (Phil. Trans., Vol. 169, Part I.) found a result decidedly 8maller,
the explanation of which is to be sought in the fact that in his experiments the cells
were making a current of about +55 ampdre, whereas in ours the electromotive force
is measured when no current passes. It may be useful to record also a comparison between our CLARK's and a new form
of DAxIErr, introduced by Sir W, THoms0N, This cell is charged with zine 8ulphate
of 8p. gr. 102, and with saturated solution of copper sulphate. The zine is not;
amalgamated.
