But
as 800n as the temperature rose above the coagulating-point of albumen, gas quite ceased
to be eyolved, although the pump was kept at work and the temperature raised to 160* C.
The experiment hence gave no support to the idea that the oxygen was occluded. The
constituent in plants which acts in relation to oxygen as the blood-corpuscles in animals
is quite unknown. It is a rather remarkable fact that growing cinchona bark, which contains a large
amount of a tannin greedy of oxygen, continually absorbs oxygen, retains it for days,
and excretes carbonic acid, without in the least affecting the easily alterable tannin. The main conclusions which are arrived at by the foregoing investigation are :â€”

1st. That nearly all parts of growing plants evolve carbonic acid in considerable
quantities, quite independently of direct oxidation.

2nd.
