their part to create publicly accessible data repositories for researchers studying public
communication associated with contentious issues or disinformation campaigns deployed
by state actors and affiliated organizations. Conversely, the scholarly debate over access to
social media data is largely focused on individuals’ rights not to have their information
harvested by corporations, with comparatively less thought given to the corporate ownership
of information of public interest. Indeed, researchers continue to face mounting obstacles
erected by social media companies that at times have actively blocked access even to
publicly available data [62]. On the rare occasions when data were made available to the
public, the dataset was anonymously released due to being in breach of Twitter’s Developer
Policy [63].

Notwithstanding data grants previously offered to research institutions [64], existing public
APIs are in fact not designed for the academic community. These endpoints for data collection are
intended for programmers building application software that adds to the growing ecosystem of
services offered by social platforms, whose business model remains focused on selling users’ data
by making them available to advertisers and campaigners targeting individuals with specifically
tailored content, a vulnerability under close scrutiny in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica
data scandal [50]. Social platforms thus balance the untenable task of convincing regulators that
rampant propaganda on social platforms is ineffective while telling advertisers the very opposite.
Concurrently, social platforms refuse being classified as media companies because they are in the
business of distributing rather than producing content [6]. In other words, the business model
of social platforms asserts that they simultaneously own users’ information while not being
responsible for it, thereby evading concerns regarding both the publicness and the private nature
of social data.
