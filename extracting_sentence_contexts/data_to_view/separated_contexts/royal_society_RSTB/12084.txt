Interestingly, stimulation in different
limbic areas produced different call types, while lesions in
the amygdala or hypothalamus suppressed distinct types of
spontaneously uttered vocalizations [108,151]. The relatively long latency of the vocal responses elicited
from these sites (greater than 1s) and their fast habituation
are consistent with stimulation-induced affective changes
rather than primary motor responses [120]. In fact, studies
of freely moving squirrel monkeys that could either seek or
avoid electrical stimulation support the idea that the vocaliza-
tions elicited from many of these limbic areas result from
stimulation-induced changes in affective state [120]. A
notable exception was the ACC, for which elicited vocaliza-
tion and specific affective states were not correlated. Compared to the other limbic forebrain areas, the influence
of the ACC on vocal behaviour thus seems to be more direct.

(ii) The volitional articulation motor network

The dominant vocal network of humans is a more recently
evolved cortical vocal system that is largely distinct from
the primordial vocal motor system.
