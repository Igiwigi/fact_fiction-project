“Ou bien pour M < M,, nous aurons trois figures d’équilibre, deux pyriformes
instables, une stable, l’ellipsoide, et pour M < M, une seule figure instable, l’ellipsoide—
auquel cas la masse fluide devrait se dissoudre par un cataclysme subit.

“Tl y a donc & vérifier si pour les figures pyriformes, M > ou < M).”

It seems very improbable that the latter can be the case; but this opinion is not a
proof,

Since o® is stationary for the initial pear, a small change in the angular velocity
will certainly produce a great change in the figure of the pear. If this investigation

~ has, in fact, its counterpart in the genesis of satellites and planets, it seems clear that
the birth of a new body, although not cataclysmal, is rapid.

§ 9. Summary.

It is possible by the methods explained in my previous paper on “ Harmonies” to
form rigorous expressions for the ellipsoidal harmonies of the third degree. Accordingly
in § 1 I proceed to form those functions. In § 2 the notation is changed with a view
to convenience in subsequent work, and for the sake of completeness the harmonics
of the first and second degrees are also given. In § 8 the corresponding solid
harmonies are expressed in rectangular co-ordinates x, y, z In § 4 I find the
Q-functions, the harmonic functions of the second kind, and express the results in
terms of the elliptic integrals H and F. It appears that both the P- and Q-functions
