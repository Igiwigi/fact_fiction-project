242 Mr. Davy's Researches on the

and hydrogene at the negative surface, facts which are certainly
unfavourable to. the idea of the existence of hyperoxygenised
muriatic acid, whether it be imagined a compound of oxy-
muriatic acid with oxygen?, or the basis of oxymuriatic acid.

If the facts respecting the hyperoxymuriate of potash,
indeed, be closely reasoned upon, it must be regarded as
nothing more than as a triple compound of oxymuriatic acid,
potassium, and oxygene. We have no right to assume the
existence of any peculiar acid in it, or of a considerable por-
tion of combined water ; and it is perhaps more conformable
to the analogy of chemistry, to suppose the large quantity of
oxygene combined with the potassium, which we know has an
intense affinity for oxygene, and\ which from some experi-
ments, I am inclined to believe, is capable of combining directly
with more oxygene than exists in potash, than with the oxy-
muriatic acid, which, as far as is known; has no affinity for
that substance.
