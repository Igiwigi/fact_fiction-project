When the metal, in the form of foil, is burnt in the oxy-hydrogen blow-pipe, it
gives a spectrum which is continuous, but in which some few lines or narrow bands
are visible. There can be little doubt that these are due to impurities, principally
iron. With the exception of three the lines are all very faint. 'The measurements,
which are only approximations, owing to the indefinite character of the lines, are the

ized except by the are and spark.* Evidence of this is afforded by the fact that an
uncondensed spark yields a very beautiful band spectrum. The lines of silicon have
been looked for but not detected in this spectrum.
