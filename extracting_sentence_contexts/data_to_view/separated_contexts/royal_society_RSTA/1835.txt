In the table shown in figure 12, the elements in group 3 are the
more traditional option consisting of Sc, Y, La and Ac. To maintain an increasing order of atomic
number increase the d-block is split into two highly uneven portions consisting of one column
for group 3 followed by the remainder of the d-block, consisting of 9 columns, that are widely
separated from group 3 by the intervening f-block. In spite of the highly uneven shape that this produces and the fact that such splitting of blocks
does not occur in other blocks in the periodic table, a surprising number of such tables have
appeared!Â°. For example, the version of the periodic table shown in figure 13 was featured as the
logo of the Inorganic Chemistry Division of the American Chemical Society until recently when
it was withdrawn specifically because of the controversies concerning group 3. The fourth possible presentation is one that abstains from specifying which elements belong in
group 3 or rather it is a presentation that only contains two elements, scandium and yttrium, as
being definitely in group 3.
