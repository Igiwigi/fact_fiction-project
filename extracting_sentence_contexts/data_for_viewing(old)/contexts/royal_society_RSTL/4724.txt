Cvuvigs, accordingly, designates them by the same descriptive phrases-F.

The general proposition that the © chevron bones” or © inferior annular part and
spine* of the vertebrz in the tail of fishes, are modifications of the hazmal arches in
the trunk, may be deemed to be unassailable. But the hamal arch is a complex
whole, and may include diapophyses or parapophyses with pleurapophyses, haxmapo-
physes and hwmal spine. In the abdomen of fishes the bony arch is incomplete
below, and in its most complex state consists only of parapophyses and plenrapo-
physes. With the exception of the clavicular and pubic arches, bony hazmapophyses
are developed in no part of the trunk of fighes. When, therefore, we rigidly seru-
tinize the composition of the haemal arches in the tail, we find them composed of
parts quite distinct from true hazmapophyses, and also composed of different
vertebral elements in different species of fishes, a fact which adds to the proof
of the essential serial homology of those arches in the tail with the hzemal arches
in the trunk. In many osseous fishes the hazmal arches in the tail are formed by the
gradual bending down and coalescence of the parapophyses: in some the union
