In order to clarify the notion of a half-order differential, recall that a differential of order k
(or more exactly, bi-degree (k,0), if also dz is allowed) on a Riemann surface is an object which
in each coordinate patch (with coordinate function denoted z, Z,... above) is represented by a
function (¢, ¢,...) in such a way that ¢= $((dz)/dz)* holds wherever the patches overlap. This
certainly makes sense for any integer k, but it can be shown, see [30,37], that also half integer
values of k are good enough. The crucial fact here is that it is possible to select branches of the
fractional powers (dz/ dz)k in a consistent way all over the surface. This can be understood in a
convenient way by passing to the universal covering surface, the unit disc in most cases, on which
a differential of order k is represented by a function ¢ which is automorphic in the sense that
(2) = o(T(z))(cz + d)~* for any Mobius map T(z) = (az + b)/(cz + d), ad — bc = 1, in the covering
group of the surface. In this picture, it is clear that 2k € Z is the appropriate condition.

Also a projective connection allows for certain covariant derivatives: for each m=0,1,2,...
there is a linear differential operator A,, taking differentials of order ((1 — 1)/2) to differentials of
order ((1 + m)/2):
