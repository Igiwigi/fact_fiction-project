somewhat simpler by the fact that some tracheids on maceration are found to show

certain cracks, parallel to the major extinction position which previous workers have
assumed parallel to the cellulose chains, forming a single spiral round the cell. If
we can show that the cellulose chains are, in fact, parallel to the cracks, any doubt
as to the existence of a single spiral in these walls would be dispelled. The X-ray
photography of such minute cells presents a difficult problem ; their scattering
power is far too small to give a diagram in the ordinary spectrometer. Under the
direction of Mr. Asrsury, and with his help and that of other workers in his
laboratory to whom the author is greatly indebted, a camera has now been con-
structed to overcome this and other difficulties. In this camera it is possible to
obtain good photographs, showing characteristic diffraction spots, from such minute
vegetable cells. The camera, a description of which will be given elsewhere by
Mr. AsrBury, gives photographs a few millimetres in diameter, which can later be
enlarged to a size suitable for reproduction.

For this part of the work tracheids of Sequoia were used on account of their greater
