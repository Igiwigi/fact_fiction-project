at least up to a given order p + q=N €N that depends on the physics of interest [82]. To recover

the isothermal behaviour of the NS equations, up to third-order moments of the Maxwellian must

be recovered by the discrete equilibrium. This is explained by the fact that the NS equations (2.1)

can be rewritten as

3y(MBOP) + d-(MMP) + 0,(Mh1) = 0,

ay(MYQ) + Be(M3Q°) + ay(MYT) = Ax(H20) + y(n) (2.6)
and (MMB) + d-(MMP) + a,(MNS) = ar(TT11) + dy (02),

where the diffusive term is further related to equilibrium moments through the Chapman-Enskog
expansion [83]

Th = (MMB) + dy(MMB) + a,(MNB),
