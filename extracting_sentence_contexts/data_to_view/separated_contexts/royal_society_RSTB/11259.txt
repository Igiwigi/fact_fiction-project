Figure 1. (Top panel) Types of strategies used to describe odours by Jahai and Dutch participants, and (bottom panel) time taken to name odours by language and
participant. Jahai speakers use overwhelmingly abstract odour terms and take around 2s to name odours; Dutch participants use predominantly concrete descriptors
and take around 13s to name odours.

(d) Ag reement suggesting weak associations between specific labels and par-
ticular odorants.
