possess at the same time 80 high an interest, that any one contributing, in however
Â«mall a degree, to increase our information regarding them, may hope to meet with
indulgence.

This consideration encourages me to submit to the Royal Society some observations
made during a few weeks spent at Dover and Brighton in the autumn of 1832, and the
last swmmer. I was led to engage in them from having two years before noticed the
existence of currents within the tubular stem of a species of Sertularia; and their
investigation has led me on to additional particulars relating to that family of zoo-
phytes, and other compound animals more or less resembling them, some of which
T am willing to hope may be new in physiology.

The facts being only such as presented themselves during a limited stay on the coast,
and in part indeed requiring further obseryations to ascertain their true bearing, the
form of the original memoranda is often retained, as being probably the most satis-
factory. Though too circumscribed and incomplete to form a ground for new
arrangements or theories, they will at least show that the field from which they are
culled is hitherto but partially explored, and may perhaps awaken the attention of
inquirers more favourably circumstanced.

Of the notices regarding tubular polypi, one on Tubularia indivisa relates princi-
pally to a peculiar circulation seen within it, and to some circumstances attending
its growth, absorption, and decay. Those which follow on Sertularice describe in-
ternal currents of a different kind, a more full observation of growth and absorption,
with a case of the development of ova, and some other particulars of this family.
