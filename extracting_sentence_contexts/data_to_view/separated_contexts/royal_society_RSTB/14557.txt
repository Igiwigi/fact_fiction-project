As it stands, cleaners make discrete decisions during foraging, where the act of
taking a mucus bite is ‘+’ for self and ‘—’ for the client. Replacing the term ‘cheating’ by ‘stealing’, thereby introducing a new
term for one particular system, could increase confusion rather than clarify the issue. Also, the use of the term ‘cheating’ helps
to emphasize the fact that clients need to exert partner control mechanisms to ensure that cleaners of genus Labroides provide
on average a net benefit rather than a net cost. Without partner control, cheating acts would become so frequent that Labroides
would turn into cheater species. Indeed, there are indications that L. dimidiatus individuals may be parasites of client species
that lack the manoeuvrability necessary to quickly evade a cleaner or to terminate an interaction at will.
