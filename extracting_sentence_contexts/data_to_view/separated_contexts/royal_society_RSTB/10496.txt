Electrophysiological recordings were done by

of E2 and ER-a agonist/antagonist is likely due to both the M.G. (mIPSCs and eIPSCs), J.L.W. (oestrogen), S.H. (uIPSCs and
feed-forward) and H.-K.L. (feed-forward). A.L. conducted GAD65

lipophilic nature of these compounds, which allows them to immunohistochemistry. $.M. ran the computational analyses. Data
cross the membranes easily, and the fact that they may act analyses were done by all authors. H.-K.L.,, S.M. and A.K. wrote
directly on oestrogen receptors present on presynaptic boutons the manuscript with the help of M.G., J.L.W. and S.H. S.M., A.K.


and H.-K.L. conceived and designed the experiments/simulations Funding.
