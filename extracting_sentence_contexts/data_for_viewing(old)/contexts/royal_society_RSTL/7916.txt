For the latitude and longitude of the Magnetic Observatory at Abbadia I am indebted
to the kindness of M. p'AyBapir, Membre de I Institut, who rendered us every assistance
during our stay in the South of France. The pillar on which most of the obseryations
at this station were taken stands at about 800 yards N. of the Astronomical Observatory.

In forming the equations of condition, by which the most probable value of the dip
at each station can be determined by the method of least squares, I have chosen Paris
as the origin of coordinates for several reasons. The chief of these arises from the fact
that Paris is practically the centre of France, and thus observations could casily be made
there at the beginning and end of the Survey of 1868, and also of 1869. Add to this
that frequent observations haye in past times been made there, and that the able ataff
under the direction of M. Ly VErriER keep up a continued series of determinations of
the magnetic elements, Lastly, the nature of the soil guarantees a perfect freedom from
the disturbing influence of igneous rocks, &c.
