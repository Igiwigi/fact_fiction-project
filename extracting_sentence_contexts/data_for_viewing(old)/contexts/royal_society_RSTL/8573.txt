Q characterizes the sound of the large American steam-whistle. At the Varne light-ship,
© therefore, the sounds had been heard towards the close of the day, though it is 124
Z miles from the signal-station. I think it probable that, at a point 2 miles from the
S PForeland, the sound at 5 P.M. possessed fifty times the intensity which it possessed at 2 P.M.
S0n our return to Doyer Bay at 10 p.xt., we heard the sounds, not only distinct but loud,
Zwhere nothing could be heard in the morning.

E In consequence of the position of the promontory yery curious winds and currents
Zextabligh themselves round the South Foreland. Mr. Hotaes was, as usual, at the
2 Foreland on July 3; and he informed me that from the motion of the smoke of some
Spaxsing steamers, and from the sails of sailing-vessels, he could recognize a curious circu-
*Zlation of the air. A slight wind would sometimes hug the shore to the N.E., then bend
7 round and moye towards the South Sand Head light-$hip. And, in point of fact, the
2 2 wind at the light-vessel had been S.W., with a force of 3, nearly the whole of the day ;
Z E whereas with us it had passed from $.W. by W. to a dead calm, and afterwards to S.E.
z On shore also it had shifted from S.W. to S.E. The atmospheric conditions between
E the light-vessel and the Foreland were therefore different from those between us and
= the Foreland; and the consequence was that at the time when we were becalmed and
Y heard nothing, the light-keepers at South Sand Head heard the sounds plainly.
