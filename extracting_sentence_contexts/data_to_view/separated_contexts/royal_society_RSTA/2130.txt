The signal for
this would be the production of several high-energy leptons (electrons, muons or neutrinos). Remarkably, sphaleron production and decay is associated with a net change in baryon
number B and lepton number L [29,30]. This is the result of an anomaly in baryon and lepton
number conservation laws, and related to the fact that a sphaleron has Chern-Simons number }
Sphaleron production is therefore potentially extremely important, as it may help us understand
the baryon asymmetry of the universe. The universe is dominated by matter (protons) rather
than antimatter (antiprotons) but the source of the asymmetry remains unknown (although there
are many ideas). Certainly, any observation of baryon or lepton number violation would be
revolutionary, as no experiment so far has ever detected such a violation.
