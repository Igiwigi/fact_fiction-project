An experiment of the same kind was performed upon another pair of
frogs with very similar results, the details of which it is not necessary to mention. T
afterwards found that the presence of the hood tends to check diffusion, or even in 80me
cases to give rise to concentration of the pigment, probably by making the animal
strugele to throw it off; s0 that in one instance a frog which was put in a perfectly dark
place, immediately after the cap had been put on, grew much paler in the course of two
hours, This circumstance prevents the skin from becoming as dark on the application
of the hood as it would do if the head could be covered without exciting the ani
"This, however, only renders the facts above mentioned more striking, 80 that they afford
of themselves sufficient proof that the direct action of light upon the integument is
incapable of affecting the pigmentary functions ; and thus the conclusion before arrived
at receives complete confirmation from these experiments. There is of course nothing new in the fact that other functions besides vision may be
excited in a reflex manner through the optic nerves ; the contraction of the pupil, and
the sneezing experienced by many pers0ns ON coming suddenly into bright sunshine,
being well-known examples of snch phenomena. On the other hand, the view that the
cutaneous nerves are sensitive to luminous impressi0ns Was destitute of any support from |

From the part taken by the second pair of nerves in bringing about the changes in the

tint of the skin under the influence of light, and also from the darkening of the hind

legs observed to occur after dividing within the canal the roots of the branches which

in regulating the functions of the pigment-cells.
