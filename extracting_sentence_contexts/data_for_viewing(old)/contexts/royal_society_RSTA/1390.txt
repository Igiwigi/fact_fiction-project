reconstruction [6,7] or an image-based decomposition algorithm is applied after reconstructing
the images corresponding to different photon energy spectra [8-11] by using tensor factorization
[12] or dictionary learning [13]. Separating these steps is sub-optimal because the full statistical
information contained in the spectral tomographic measurements cannot be exploited. Statistical
iterative reconstruction (SIR) techniques provide a data consistent approach to obtaining material
selective images using a statistical model of the projection measurements and incorporating prior
knowledge about the reconstructed material images. Unfortunately, the loss function induced
by the forward model which directly maps the expected spectral projection measurements and
the material images is non-convex and difficult to minimize; convex approximations of the loss
function such as convex-concave techniques [14-16] or semi-empirical models [17,18] have been
proposed but suffer from high computational cost because of the double-loop nature of the solver.

The main challenges which are attracting considerable interest are related to the fact that the
image to be recovered lies in a high-dimensional space and to leverage more sophisticated or
learned data-dependent priors are needed since the estimation problem is generally ill-posed.
Regarding the issue of reducing the per-iteration computational cost to solve the reconstruction
in the high-dimensional setting, numerous first-order solvers which leverage random numerical
linear algebra have been deployed in different machine learning and imaging applications.
Well-established algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) [19,20], order subsets [21]
and Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) have gained considerable attention
in spectral CT [22,23]. Unfortunately, the iteration complexity of the first-order methods relies
significantly on the condition number of a problem like SGD which has a sub-linear convergence
rate to only a neighbourhood of the solution [24]. Instead, the information related to the curvature
is decisive to improve the convergence by reducing the condition number to obtain physically
meaningful and accurate quantitative estimation. Therefore, accounting for a greedy selection of
