have examined samples of pigmented elvers from St. Croix (West Indies) (March),
from the Potomac at Washington (April), and from Little River, Massachusetts
(May). The average length in the two latter cases was about 57 mm.

From the data to hand, then, we may conclude that the American eel spawns
earlier, that its larvee grow more rapidly, and that the full-grown larva is smaller
than is the case with the European species. A result of this is that Anguilla
rostrata can complete its full development from egg to elver in about one year,
whereas Anguilla vulgaris, as we have already seen, takes about three years. The
photograph, Plate 17, fig. 1, in comparison with Plate 17, fig. 2, illustrates this, and
shows that the I-group of Anguilla rostrata in June are already metamorphosed elvers,
while this stage of development is in the case of Anguilla vulgaris only attained by
the IlI-group. Despite the fact that the two species are outwardly so alike as to be
hardly distinguishable, they differ to such an extent that the one takes about three
times as long as the other to pass through the same cycle of development.

The recognition of this difference between Anguilla rostrata and Anguilla vulgaris
is of decisive importance to the comprehension of the life-history of the two species,
and the fact provides a natural explanation of several points that seemed mysterious
before.

As already mentioned, an investigation of samples of eels from Bermuda showed
that they all belonged to the American species (Anguilla rostrata). This in itself

* It is not easy to distinguish the two Anguilla species in their early larval stages, when the hind-
