If impurities (other than “ structural impurities”) are to be invoked it
will be necessary to assume that diamonds found in different countries all have exactly
the same impurity to the same degree of concentration. Such diamonds should also
exhibit enhanced photo-electric effects due to the action of impurities in liberating
electrons or producing ionic centres from any metal ion. In fact, Type 1 diamonds
show much less photo-electric effect, so that on this view alone the assumption of
impurities must fail to account for the observations. On the other hand, if Type 2
diamonds are assumed to owe their properties to impurities of rare earth character,
we would have to suppose that the impurities have conferred transparency on the
diamonds in infra-red and ultra-violet regions of the spectrum. Such a view cannot,
of course, be reconciled with the known effect of impurities in causing absorption of
radiation in all other cases.
