Origami design, on the other hand, suggests ways of designing nanostructures with
particular patterns of neighbours.

(a) A family of two-dimensional origami structures with degeneracy

Degeneracies in origami design, i.e. the many ways to fold a crease pattern, are particularly
interesting in the context of the search for novel nanostructures. For example, if we identify the
vertices of an origami structure with atomic positions, degeneracy gives us many structures with
the same nearest neighbour distances for all the atoms. This follows simply from the fact that
an origami deformation is piecewise isometric. Below, we discuss degeneracies in the context of a simple, yet fascinating, family of origami:
rigidly and flat-foldable quadrilateral mesh origami [10,14-19]. Despite being a well-studied family
of origami over the years, interest in their degeneracies is a recent development [17,20,21] with
many intriguing directions for further exploration.
