condition. Therefore, the deficit in metacognition in crowding
seems to be primarily driven by overconfidence on incorrect
trials: when participants are wrong about what they see in
the periphery, they do not always know it, and have more
confidence in their perception than what is warranted.

As shown in figure 2, participants displayed better perform-
