each of us to this field. This theme issue, envisaged as a celebration, is therefore also an act of
remembrance. We dedicate it to Les and to his memory.

At the end of the article is a short appreciation of Les, written and read by one of us (S.M.B.) at
a celebration of Les’s life and achievements, attended by family, friends and the three authors of
this article.

2. Optical angular momentum

You have only to turn your face to the sun and feel the warmth to appreciate that light carries
energy. This property follows directly from Maxwell’s electromagnetism, as does the fact that light

carries (linear) momentum; indeed Maxwell himself calculated the correct value of the radiation : 2
pressure due to solar radiation on the surface of the Earth [2]. In the quantum theory of light, a : >
plane wave of angular frequency w and wavevector k has energy fiw and momentum hk carried by :8

each photon. In addition to linear momentum, optical beams can also carry angular momentum
which, in the quantum theory, is often expressed as the spin, +hk/|k|, of the photon. As with the
linear momentum, however, this spin angular momentum, and in particular its connection with
circular polarization, is also a feature of the classical Maxwell theory [3].

That the spin angular momentum of light cannot be all there is was realized very early in
the development of the modern quantum theory. Darwin considered radiative processes and
