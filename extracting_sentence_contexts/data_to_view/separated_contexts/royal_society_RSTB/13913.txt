There were probably multiple
incentives of this sort for investing in interactional partners. In
addition, Dunbar has suggested that language, because of its
broadcast character, arose as a form of mass grooming, so knit-
ting together large groups. However, this neglects both the fact
that chimpanzees often groom in large chains [90], and that
human conversational huddles are mostly in the twos or
threes. However, pointing to the primary social functions of
language is surely correct. Studies suggest that around two-
thirds of what is discussed in informal conversation concerns
social relationships [86,91].
