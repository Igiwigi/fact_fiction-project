figure, in connection with that of fig. 134, I particularly refer.

159. Very much the same general remarks apply also to the elements of the
medullary portion of the brain (fig. 134.).

The Elements of Muscular Tissue compared with Corpuscles of the Blood.

160. Some of the earliest appearances presented by muscle, in its formation out
of blood-corpuscles, were given in one of my former communications to the Society.
The muscles then examined, being involuntary, did not afford s0 interesting a field
for observation, as those the development of which has since had my attention,—the
voluntary muscles ; nor did I then prosecute the investigation farther than as oppor-
tunity was incidentally afforded. Nevertheless, it will be seen that the facts I have
now to mention, accord with those stated in that memoir.

161. Corpuscles more or less blood-red, and having the appearance of young
blood-corpuscles, apply themselves to one another in the manner represented in
fig. 135, and also in the memoir just referred to; by which a necklace-like object
is produced. These corpuscles are cells, which I have found filled with discs ().
The appearance of these discs, together with that of the nucleus and nucleolus, re-
sembled in a remarkable manner the corresponding parts in certain states of the
germinal vesicle and germinal spot. In no instance have I more clearly seen the
nature of the s0-called © nucleolus” of authors; and that at this part there exists an
orifice, communicating with the exterior of the cell (fig. 135. 8). By degrees, the
appearance of a cylinder is produced (fig. 136.), which becomes more perfect, as the
