This observation reflects the sensitivity of the individual excitation sources towards these
pigments, with the 532nm wavelength coincident with carotenoid absorption, resulting in a
resonance Raman effect, leading to enhancement of carotenoid Raman signal [44,45]. However, since the structurally similar carotenoid compounds often produce similar Raman
spectra, which generally differ only in small Raman shifts of key bands, the identification and
confirmation of the specific carotenoid is quite difficult. The situation is further complicated by the
fact that natural samples typically contain a more-or-less complex mixture of carotenoids. Other
analytical methods, such as chromatography, allow for the separation of individual pigments in
the mixture and are favourable to use in conjunction with Raman spectroscopy to produce more
robust results. Table 1 presents the positions of the characteristic carotenoid bands (electronic supplementary
material, Sla means sample 1 analysis 1, etc.) for each area that was analysed within one layer
or between different samples.
