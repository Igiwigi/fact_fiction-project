Ib will be seen in conformity with the conclusions already stated thab
increases the vulue of chlorine always diminishes. It is alsa noticeable that whe
is the same, the value of chlorine yaries slightly with the series to which |
substance belongs, This is again evidence of the fact already mentioned t
substituting hydrogen in a methyl group, the effeet also depends upon the nat
the radicle to which the methyl group is attached,

On comparing the ditferenees between the specific inolecular yolumes of conipem
bulonging to the above series a similar variation is noticeable, as is seen in tl
following table :—
