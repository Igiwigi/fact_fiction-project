reflect perceptions of SuDS in general and were based on the images of SuDS shown at the start
of the test, only one of which was of an NGP SuDS feature. We used images rather than words
to reduce any potential bias introduced by a lack of lay understanding of SuDS terminology;
however, using words would have required participants to rely on their internal understanding
of the SuDS concept to complete the tests, which would have resulted in responses that were
more dependent on experience, and knowledge and awareness of SuDS. Further investigation of
the level of representation of the stimuli would benefit future LATs in this research area. In reality,
the NGP residents may value the greenspace provided by the NGP SuDS without acknowledging
that they are sustainable drainage features.

The fact that preferences for public greenspace were not influenced primarily by residential
location in our sample may be inherently linked to how the respondents value different
benefits provided by blue and green infrastructure, e.g. amenity, biodiversity, flood and water
management, or recreation, and represents an avenue of further research. Other attributes of
SuDS and greenspace that were not covered in the explicit tests may also influence overarching
perceptions, e.g. knowledge of SuDS functionality, the respondentâ€™s environmental attitudes more
generally, e.g. around climate change or presence of nature in cities, or past experience with
flooding, as implicit attitudes, as well as explicit, can also be altered as a result of a powerful
affective experience [35].

Behaviour has been shown to be best predicted by a combination of implicit and explicit
