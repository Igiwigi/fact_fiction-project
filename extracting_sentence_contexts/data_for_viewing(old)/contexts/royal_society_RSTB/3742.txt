passed almost unnoticed, possibly because others felt, as Sreney did, that it should
have been more fully illustrated. However, his figures are clear and his text
succinct, and many of his statements have now been justified. He was the first to
notice the columella cranii and the descending plates of the parietal; he saw and
figured two bones, the post-orbital and post-frontal, behind the orbit, and described
and figured correctly the transpalatine bone.

Corr regarded the Anomodontia as “the most generalised order of Reptilia of

7

which we have any knowledge ” and he added that as they occupy almost the first
place in geological time among Reptilia, they illustrate the fact that the older forms
of any group are the more generalised.

SEELEY} (in 1889) was the first to attempt to determine the form of the cranial
cavity. His paper is also the fullest and most complete description of the Dicynodont
skull of its date. The vagueness of some of his figures gives a good idea of the
difficulties he had to contend with in the determination of sutures : we may refer for
example to his Plate 13, which represents a skull specially prized for the clearness of
these lines. In a second paper SEELey$ attempted to determine the constituent
bones of Huxuey’s median vertical plate, and described some new points of detail,
but his additions to the existing knowledge are not really very considerable.
Modern zoologists will hardly be interested in his theories of the homologies of parts
of the skull with parts of a neural arch.
