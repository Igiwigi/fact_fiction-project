the second period than over the firs, Tt should perhaps be noted that one end of the
plot was apparently to the eye to some extent injured by the roots of a large tree, and
this injury was the greater in the later years.

The actual falling off in the amount of mineral constitnents taken up over the
second period was considerable, and it was pretty equal in the 8oda, the chlorine,
the lime, and the sulphuric acid ; it was about twice as great in the silica, but very
Slight indeed in either the potass or the phosphoric acid. The decreasing amount of
soda, chlorine, and sulphuric acid, taken up and retained, with at the same time an all
but maintained assimilation of potass and phosphorie acid, would indicate increased
tendency to stem and seed formation, and to maturation.; whilst, the deficiency of lime,
and of silica, is also consistent with a less amount of leaf and greater amount of stem.
In fact, the percentage in the dry matterâ€”of lime, magnesia, soda, sulphurie acid, and
8ilica, was lower than in the produce either without manure or with the ammonia-
salts alone ; whilst that of the potass was nearly twice as high as without manure, and
more than twice as high as with the ammonia-salts alone, and hat of the phosphoric acid
was also very much higher than either without manure, or with ammonia-salts alone.

The probability is, that the reduced assmnilation of both nitrogen and most of the
mineral constituents over the second period was less connected with any real deficiency
of either within the soil, in a condition capable of being yielded up, than with the
description of plants favoured, and the character both of their underground and their
aboveground development, with which would vary, not only the range and power of
collection from the resources of the 80il, but also the requirement for this or that
individual constituent. And it is probable that, in addition to these conditions
