Sof the sodium alt was slightly yellowish, but a beautifully white product was obtained
Sby precipitation from a highly concentrated liquid by the addition of pure absolute
Salcohol, in which the formate is much less soluble than in water. The crystalline
Etpitate was recrystallised from alcohol. Notwithstanding, however, the excessive
care with which sodium formate was prepared, it was found practically impossible to
obtain it in a state of sufficient purity to make it available for trustworthy obser-
vation. Crystals of snow-like whiteness yielded yellowish solutions s0on becoming
yellow ; various crops of such erystals gave spectra of different lengths ; sometimes
the portion giving the longest spectrum, after the mosb careful recrystallisations would
transmit only half the rays, and by no artifice could a fraction be made to transmit
the original spectrum of the salt. A very careful examination showed us that formate
of 8oda is changed with extreme ease into oxalate, and there is no doubt that from
this fact arises the unsuccessful issne of our experiments on this salt. The Solution
of the four godium salts contained the following weights of the substances ;â€”Formate,

of liquid, or the solubions of acetate, propionate, and butyrate contained 50*8, 61'6,
and 725 per cent. of the respective salts. The acetate and propionate formed super-
saturated solutions.

Single and double thicknesses of liquid were examined. In Diagram No. 2 is shown
