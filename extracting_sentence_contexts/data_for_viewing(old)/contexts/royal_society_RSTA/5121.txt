at more or less the same time. Of course, these individuals may be committed to developing
their discoveries to different extents, which is generally why we give more credit to one or other
individual. But this is a matter of who to assign priority to and quite separate from the question of
how discovery actually occurs. The question of priority is a rather local one that should not dictate
the manner in which the history of science is written and presented. But of course everybody is
human and we all still like a hero since it makes for a good story. But it may not make for a
good history.

In closing, I would go further in proposing that the history of the discovery of the periodic
table provides perhaps the best-known example of simultaneous discovery if for no other reason
than the fact that it involved at least six individuals by contrast to the more frequently cited cases
involving two or three individuals such as Newton and Leibniz, Darwin and Wallace, Weinberg
and Salam, Venter and Collins to cite just a few.
