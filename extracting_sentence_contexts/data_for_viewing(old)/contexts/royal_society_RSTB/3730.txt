Béranex terms the parietal centre, and lying between the posterior ends of the two
ganglia habenul, above the fibres of the superior commissure (fig. 26). It seems
probable that the nerve is actually connected with one or other of the ganglia
habenulze, as in Ammoccetes, but I have been unable to detect any such difference in

size between the two ganglia as occurs in the lamprey.* © The fact that the parietal
eye itself in Sphenodon originates on the left side of the middle line seems to make it
probable that the nerve is connected with the left ganglion habenulz. The observa-
tions of pz Kxinckowstr6éMm, however, point to the right ganglion. Possibly the
nerve crosses over from right to left, but this is a question which cannot be decided
in the present state of our knowledge, and one which is well worthy of further
investigation,”

In 1903, ScHAUINSLAND published a figure (Taf. VII, fig. 73) taken from a
somewhat advanced embryo of Sphenodon, in which the nerve in question
(* Parietalaugennerv ”) is shown passing from the pineal eye beneath the
“epiphysis” and joining the superior commissure immediately in front of the origin
of the “epiphysis.” He states that it lies a little to one side of the middle line, but
