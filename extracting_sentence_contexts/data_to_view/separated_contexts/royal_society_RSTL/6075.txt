7 a), the spire being at the same time less _ 5 Y - _ re n
plane is wider in proportion to its length. Now it is not a lit e remarkable _- oy
almost uniformly the case with specimens furnished by particular localities, whilst those
obtained from others not very remote exhibit almost as uniformly the extremest elonga-
tion and narrowing of the septal plane with only a Single row of apertures; and hence
it might not unreasonably be maintained that this difference $hould be accounted of
specific value. In reply to this, however, there is not only the analogy of Orbitolites
and Orbiculina, in which an indefinite multiplication in the rows of marginal pores may
take place during the growth of the individual, but also the fact that in Peneroplis the
two forms cannot be distinguished at an early age, either by the shape of the shell or
by the disposition of the pores, which are often arranged neither in a 8ingle nor in a
double row, but on a sort of mixture of both plans, as shown in Plate II. figs. 9 and 10;
whilst among the more advanced examples of each type, it is not at all uncommon to
meet with individuals which present a combination of the characters of both, the septal
plane having a single row of pores in one part of its length with a double row in another. Sometimes, moreover, in one of the less compressed forms of the shell, although there
is but a single row of pores, it is obvious from the elongated shape of these that they
indicate a tendency to duplication (fig.
