contracted only about half-way, with little or no promise of ever contracting com-
pletely at this humidity; yet when afterwards placed in water it contracted the
remaining half in a few minutes.

The interpretation of this effect of incomplete contraction through lack of water
appears to rest on the existence of a continuous range of molecular aggregates (“ micelles ”“)
of varying degrees of stability under hydration. In the absence of water the extended
chains of 8-keratin cohere so strongly by virtue of their own numerous points of attraction
that the contractile tendency is practically eliminated ; but on hydration of the various
polar groups located chiefly in the side-chains* the lateral cohesion is diminished and the
grid system contracts spontaneously to the «-configuration. (A similar effect can be
brought about in stretched rubber simply as a consequence of thermal vibrationst¢ ;
in fact, most of the effects of hydration on the elastic properties of hair are paralleled
by the effects of heat on the elastic properties of rubber.) We may thus suppose that
at the water concentration associated with any given relative humidity, for only a certain
fraction of the chain aggregates—a fraction determined by their size distribution and
variations of organization—is there a reasonable probability of simultaneous hydration
of those groups all of which must be “ freed” before complete contraction can take
place. (In this connection it is interesting to note that the amount of water taken up
by wool at complete saturation corresponds almost exactly to an average of two molecules
per amino-acid residue ; for, as we have seen above, the average weight of a residue is
about 115, while SpeaKman§ has shown that Cotswold wool at saturation takes up an
amount of water equivalent to 31-9% of its dry weight, whence, if m be the number of
water molecules per residue, we have
