CHARACTER OF THE CURRENT—UNIPOLARITY—EFFECT OF HEAT, 161

after showing that similar phenomena can take place with good conductors, proves
that with s0ap, &c. many of the effects are the mere consequences of the bodies
evolved by electrolytic action. 1636. I conclude, therefore, that the facts upon which the doctrine of unipolarity
was founded are not adyerse to that unity and indivisibility of character which I
have stated the current to possess, any more than the phenomena of the pile itself,
which might well bear comparison with those of unipolar bodies, are opposed to it. Probably the effects which bave been called effects of unipolarity, and the peculiar
differences of the positive and negative surface when discharging into air, gases, or
other dielectrics (1480. 1525.) which have been already referred to, may have con-
siderable relation to each other *.

1637. M. vs 14 Rives has recently described a peculiar and remarkable effect of
heat on a current when passing between electrodes and a fluid.
