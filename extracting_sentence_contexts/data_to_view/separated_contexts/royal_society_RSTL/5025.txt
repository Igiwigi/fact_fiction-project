and... Cz=C'ay.
"Thus we may, by the same process of generalization, as8ume C'zy to be the $ymbolical
form for denoting every function of x and y which is distributive with regard to both
randy. C' here is manifestly the value of the function when x=1 and y=1. Now
if we adopt C' to be the unit of the function, as, in fact, we do in many cases of
ordinary produets, the symbolic form for denoting the function becomes simply ay.
(7.) This appears to'me to. be the simplest and best method of defining the nota-
tion zy in Symbolical Algebra; though I need not avail myself of it here as it is not
necessary for my purpose.
