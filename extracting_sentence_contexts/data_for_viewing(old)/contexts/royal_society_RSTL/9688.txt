very 8mall, and similar to those formed from F. G. powder at low as well as high
pressures (except where none was found in the residues), and that in several instances
very considerable quantities were formed from Pebble at densities ranging from 20 to
60 per cent., s0me of them being indeed very much higher than that produced in the
special experiment with sporting powder, in which extra precautions were adopted to
guard against oxidation of sulphide. Then, in the case of R. L. G. powder, the pro-
portions of sulphide found may be said to be intermediate between those produced
from pebble and F. G., the amounts ranging from 2 to 10 per cent.; and the higher
and lower proportions are indiscriminately distributed through the different residues
obtained at low, high, and intermediate pressures. In no instance, either with pebble
or R, L, G., was there a complete absence of sulphide, as in three instances, at the
higher pressures, with F, G. powders. We feel bound again to lay stress upon the
fact that there were no accidents of manipulation to account for these remarkable
differences in residues furnished by powders of practically the same composition.

5, One or two other points of interest present themselves in connexion with the
potassium 8ulphate found in the residues from the three powders. Both in the pebble
and F. G. residues, those obtained at the lowest and the highest densities differed very
decidedly from the remainder in regard to the sulphate present, while the proportions
in the residues obtained at the densities intermediate between those two extremes
present comparatively slight differences in the case of both these powders. But the
residues furnished by R. L. G. powder exhibit a very decided difference to the above ;
the proportions of sulphate in those produced at the four lowest pressures (up to a
density of 40) are high, and very similar in amount to those found in the majority of
the F. G. powder-residues, while those in the residues produced at the six higher
