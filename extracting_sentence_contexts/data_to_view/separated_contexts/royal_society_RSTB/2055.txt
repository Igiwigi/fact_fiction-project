[ owe this useful material to the kindness of Mr, Tutsgnron-Dyer. MR. FRANCIS DARWIN ON STOMATA, 541

Two ivy leaves were gathered and allowed to wither for 19 hours, Yucca
hygroseopes were then luted with wax on to the upper and lower surface, when
movement of the index occurred only on the lower side and was doubtless a stomatal
effect. This fact would probably have been demonstrated by the cobalt test or by
weighing, but not by means of the horn hygroscope. It is worth pointing out that the
cobalt test is practically applied by Srant in two ways, zc, when the leaf is merely
placed between glass plates, and an effect is looked for in one or two minutes, and
secondly when the sensitive paper is covered by a small vessel luted on to the leaf. These two methods roughly correspond in effectiveness to the horn and Yucca hygro-
geopes ; but the horn hygroscope is, I think, more sensitive than the cobalt method.
