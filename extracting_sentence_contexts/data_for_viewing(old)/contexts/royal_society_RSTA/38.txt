problems of the modern world. But also—and equally important—it has already enriched
mathematics as such by presenting new and challenging PDE models to the analytical and
numerical mathematics communities. We are convinced that the new research area of PDE models
in the socio-economic sciences is one of the best recent success stories of cross-fertilization of
totally diverse scientific fields. Consequently, we will also structure this introductory article by
mathematical questions rather than specific applications. The latter will obviously appear on the
way since they are driving the mathematical questions.

2. Kinetic models with non-physical interactions

Recently, ideas from statistical physics have started to permeate the socio-economic sciences,
leading to mean-field and kinetic PDEs as the main tools for qualitative and quantitative research.
Their applicability relies on the fact that socio-economic processes are often governed—similar
to statistical physics—by the interaction of large ‘particle’ systems, where the particles are
human beings (inter)acting in socio-economic scenarios. The natural step is to go from those
particle models to kinetic and further macroscopic PDE models. In those, several novel issues
appear due to the obvious differences compared to classical models in physics. In particular, the
interactions in socio-economics can have missing conservation properties or be of unusual long-
range nature, which leads to novel mathematical challenges, e.g. non-standard collision invariants
to be determined.

A problem that has attracted much attention is the evolution of wealth distributions and the
aim to explain experimentally observed Pareto tails in large-time limit. The models are usually
based on exchange of goods and money in binary interactions, with several different approaches
to the details of the modelling, all leading to different macroscopic models and stationary
