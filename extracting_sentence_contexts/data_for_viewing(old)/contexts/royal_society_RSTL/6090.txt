MR. LUBBOCK ON THE OVA AND PSEUDOVA OF INSECTS. 355

\ like a cucumber. It consists of a large number of egg-tubes, each formed of two
; chambers, one more or less spherical, and the other a miniature representation of the
\ ovary itself, as far as shape is concerned.
Â© The external membrane is in this species very distinct, and the internal structure of
the egg-tube cannot distinctly be seen until it has been removed. It is, however, easily
+ torn off, and the egg-tube will then be generally found attached by the upper part, and
with the end next to the spherical chamber floating loose. The part of the egg-tube
- also below the spherical chamber is very thin, and tapers rapidly to a very delicate
filament, while the upper part retains to the end a much more considerable diameter.
= These facts puzzled me a little at first, and made me doubt for awhile which was the
S ovarian end of the egg-duct. I s0on found, however, that the germinal vesicle was
Ve always at the side of the egg-germ which was turned away from the cylindrical cham-

Z ber; and a specimen occurred in which the lower part of the cylindrical chamber was

O beginning to separate itself from the remainder, and to form a new egg-germ (Plate
VIL. fig. 8). Towards the middle of October, all, or nearly all the egg-tubes were in

D this stage. The vitelligenous cells contained no distinct nucleus, and varied much in

cb gize, some being larger, and others 8xmaller than the egg-cell.
