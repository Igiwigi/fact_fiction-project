have shreds of semi-glassy groundmass, or occasionally of brown glass, adhering to
them. In one sample, the glass of the semi-glassy bandaite groundmass fragments is
practically colourless. Fragments and crystals as large as 0-3-0-4 mm. are sparse,
those of 0-1 mm. fairly abundant, and those of 0-06—0-04 mm. very abundant; there are
also many as small as 0-01—0-005 mm. or even smaller.

With these samples was compared fine dust collected from the 1929-32 nuée ardente
deposits of “Avalanche” Valley, Mt Pelé (F 4503). It proved to be almost identical
with the Montserrat dust in grain size, mineral constituents and general character.
The glass of the numerous semi-glassy groundmass fragments is usually almost
colourless. As in Montserrat, fragments of fine-grained holocrystalline groundmass
(like that of the dome rock) are in the minority. Hornblende, brown in colour, is less
abundant, in accordance with the fact that the mineral is much less common in the
Mt Pelé rocks. Some cristobalite was seen.* The general colour of the Martinique
dust sample is pale grey, while the Montserrat dusts have a brownish tinge; the
difference is probably due to oxidation of iron in the older deposits of Montserrat.

Mounted samples of the volcanic dusts from St Vincent that fell in Barbados in
May 1902 and March 1903, and of local St Vincent dusts of 1902, are available in
the foreign collection of the Geological Survey and Museum. Descriptions and analyses
of these dusts have been published (Flett 1908). On examination they proved to be
