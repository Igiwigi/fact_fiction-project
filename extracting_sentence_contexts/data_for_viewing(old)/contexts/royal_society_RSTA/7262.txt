the Cornbrash from +600 ft. at the Great Oolite outcrop in the west, to — 150 ft. on the
east. The depths given by the contours are probably correct within 50 ft., the principal
error coming from uncertainties in interpolating between the widely spaced bore-
holes. To the south and east of the —150 ft. contour we have only Southery (—471 ft.)
and Little Missenden (—570 ft.) and a few bores north-east of Peterborough. To extend
the map the seismic results may be used. The upper of the two discontinuities found at
each station is shown in figure 8. The results at Leighton, Great Staughton, Pertenhall,
Houghton Conquest and Tempsford fit in with the contours very well and leave little
doubt that this discontinuity is the transition from the Oxford Clay to the limestones
below it. The seismic results are not sufficiently detailed to separate the Kelloways Beds,
the Cornbrash, and the Great Oolite limestone. This identification is further strength-
ened by the fact that the refracted wave from the upper discontinuity at these stations
could only be observed at distances less than about 2000 ft., thus indicating a layer of no
great thickness. The result at Bow Brickhill is not consistent with the Cornbrash con-
tours (which give +90 ft. compared with the seismic result of 4-160 ft.). This disagree-
ment is not very serious as there is an exceptional development of limestones at Fenny
Stratford 14 miles to the west.*

It is thus natural to assume that the upper discontinuity at stations farther to the east
is due to the same limestones. If this be assumed, the contours of the Cornbrash may be
extended to —400ft. O.D. by the use of these points and the Southery and Little
Missenden bores. These contours join smoothly on to those above — 150 ft. The bore-
holes show a decreasing thickness of limestone towards the east, and it is a little unex-
pected that the seismic results should indicate that there is still some present as far east as
