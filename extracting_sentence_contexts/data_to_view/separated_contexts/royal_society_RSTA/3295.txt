Assume that a and D are as given at the beginning of this section. Let also
aij, bj, cj, 4,f, bj, € C* (D). If the problem (A 1) has a solution u € C!(D), then u belongs in fact to cl+e(D)

where C is a constant that depends only on the bounds of the involved norms of the coefficients, on the
domain and on the ellipticity and obliqueness constants. References
