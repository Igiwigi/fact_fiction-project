that the one from E130 had the external form shown at stage c of figure 8 and the one from
E138 had reached stage d (figure 16, plate 6). In the absence of a sequence of known
stages for comparison it is difficult to interpret the histology of a single corpus luteum, but
those of E138, the histology of which is seen in figures 23a and 24a, and the external form
of which is shown in figure 16, would not seem likely to represent a stage of development
leading up to the condition of the corpus luteum C of E130, figures 23), 246 and 175. The
extent of the connective tissue, which so markedly partitions the luteal tissue into a series
of bands, in figure 234, suggests in fact that this corpus luteum had already entered upon
changes which would lead to regression. The likelihood is that, like those of the preceding
. ‘generations’ in the same ovary, it was destined to regress without ever reaching the final
: , form of the fully developed corpus luteum of pregnancy. It would seem, therefore, that in
the normal course of events this animal would have undergone a further oestrous cycle
before becoming pregnant.
