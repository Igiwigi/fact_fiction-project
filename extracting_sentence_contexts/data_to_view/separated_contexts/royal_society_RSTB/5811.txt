For when the angle I,—I, exceeded the angle I,a—I, by more than a certain
amount, I, occupied the former angle and the spiral was reversed. The angle I,a—I, was
decreased by the displacement of I,a away from the wound and towards I,, while the
angle I,—I, was increased by the displacement of I; towards the wound and away from
I,. It was not found possible to correlate the varying degrees of displacement of these
primordia with the varying positions of the wound on account of complications, such
as the fact that the kathodic stipule of I,a extended over the wound in some experiments
and not in others.

(9) Subsequent Phyllotaxis when la was a Bract. In three experiments I,a was a bract, as already stated. Measurements of two of these
experiments are given in Table I.
