Kemeny et al. [64] suggested


that this was driven by mixing of nitrifiers into the well-lit surface ocean through autumn
mixed layer deepening, and photo-inhibition of nitrite oxidation, allowing the reversible nitrite
oxidoreductase enzyme to catalyse nitrate—nitrite interconversion. While we are unable to assess
directly the importance of this process here, because we did not measure 5!°N and 4180 of both
nitrate + nitrite and nitrate only, the observed increase in the difference between 8Nno; and
5'8ONo; (A15-18; figure 8d) towards the surface is consistent with this mechanism, which would
lower 5'8ONo, compared to 5!°NNo;- Further, the importance of subsurface nitrification that we
have described and the shallow Tin depths that we observe are consistent with the presence
of nitrifiers in the well-lit upper ocean, which could facilitate nitrate—nitrite interconversion. The
fact that the 5'8ONo, :8°NNo, enrichment ratio is close to or only slightly less than 1:1 at the
majority of stations (figure 8c) suggests that the effect of such interconversion is small compared
to that of nitrification below the well-lit surface layer, but this mechanism is worthy of further :
study during austral summer. [=

Regardless of the degree of nitrate—nitrite interconversion, the subsurface nitrification that we 5
have demonstrated can explain the progressive increase in nitrate concentration below the mixed :
layer as mCDW crosses the WAP shelf. This enrichment is driven by ongoing remineralization of DB
sinking organic matter, as well as downward mixing of subsurface water masses rich in nitrified :
nitrate as the deepest, densest waters are progressively blocked [61]. 4

(d) Other factors potentially influencing 5°Nyo, and 50yo, 3

Nitrogen cycling processes in sea ice have been shown to influence 5!5NNo, and 5!8Ono, in the
underlying seawater, through nitrification or sea ice algal nitrate uptake within the ice matrix
[98]. However, we argue that neither of these processes can explain the lowering of 5'°NNo, and
5'8ONo; that we observe, primarily because sea ice was only present at station TO7 and nitrate
isotope dynamics were similar at this station to stations T05, T06 and T08 where the ice pack
had retreated.
