(/) in the whistler should be related to the time (¢) after the original lightning flash by the
expression t=Dxf-t.

Here we have called D the ‘dispersion’ of the whistler. It is measured in (seconds)’.

In all the whistlers examined in the present work it was confirmed that the quantity /~
increased linearly with time, and in analyses of those whistlers which followed atmospheric
clicks it was found, furthermore, that the intercept of the /~! against / graph on the time axis
always coincided with the time of the click within the limits of experimental error, which

were about | 0-18. The chief sources of error were the high level of interfering atmospheric

noise, and also the fact that the whistlers were by no means pure tones. The spread of their
spectrograms in the frequency direction was much greater than that of a pure gliding tone
with the same rate of variation of frequency.* This spread varied widely from one whistler
to another, tending to increase with increasing dispersion.

These points are illustrated by figure 3, which is a typical analysis ofa whistler following
an atmospheric. The atmospheric has been set at the origin of the time scale. Each horizontal
bar represents the approximate time limits of the response of a tuned filter to the whistler,
and the circle indicates the position of its maximum. These responses were often of irregular
shape, and the widths shown were measured between the points at which they disappeared
into the noise. The filters used in these analyses had Q-factors of approximately 100. This

particular whistler is followed by a doubly dispersed ‘echo’ (see below).
