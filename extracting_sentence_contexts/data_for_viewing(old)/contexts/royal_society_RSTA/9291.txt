Admitting the possibility involved in IL, we must abandon weight experiments,
and proceed to the use of a full gravitation apparatus, having both masses (M and m)
under control as regards temperature.

It is supposed by some that Krpier’s 3rd law establishes the constancy of G, but
I have tried to show? that this is false, and that the common practice of obtaining
the masses and densities of heavenly bodies (sun, earth, planets, &c.) by assuming the
invariability of G is at fault.

5. The above appears to me one case in which Kupier’s laws have been strained
beyond their legitimate use; another case was pointed out long ago by M. Vicarre.}
He showed that when one of two attracting gravitative masses, M, is very large
compared with the other, m, the fact that the acceleration of the latter is independent
of its mass follows in all cases where the law of attraction is of the form
