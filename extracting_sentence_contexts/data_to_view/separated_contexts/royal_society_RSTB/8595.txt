This topic of research remains an active area of debate
and investigation, and new analyses may provide approaches to
illustrate that environmental forcing is indeed a stronger influ-
ence on recruitment than spawning stock biomass [33,34]. When synchronous shifts in recruitment are observed across
large marine ecosystems and coincide with regime shifts,
there is obvious and strong evidence for regime-shift forcing
on recruitment [34]. In fact, since recruitment has a strong influ-
ence on subsequent spawning stock biomass, a spurious
relationship of spawning stock biomass on recruitment is the
result, particularly if recruitment shifts abruptly [34]. Incorrectly identifying environmental forcing impacts on
fish productivity can have serious consequences for fisheries
management. The value of environmental information in stock
assessments may not offer improved outcomes unless there is
a reduction in the uncertainty of the new advice and the gains
(ie. yield, sustainable stocks) based on that advice outweigh

the risks of being wrong [35].
