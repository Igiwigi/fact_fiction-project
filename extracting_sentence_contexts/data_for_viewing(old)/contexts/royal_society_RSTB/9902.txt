the essential mechanism required for generalized reciprocity:
a behavioural response that is contingent on past social experi-
ence. Bacteria, for instance, have been shown to respond to the
secretion of exoproducts such as iron-sequestering sidero-
phores by secreting these substances themselves (([226];
reviewed in [227,228]), even though ‘cheaters’ could potentially
exploit their siderophore production [229-232], showing the
essential contingency inherent in the decision process involved
in generalized reciprocity. Therefore, if there is no mechanism
selecting against this simple contingency, generalized recipro-
city can be expected to be a ubiquitous phenomenon. As

outlined above, several studies have in fact suggested that
the conditions for generalized reciprocity to evolve are very
widespread [41,42,48,49,52-54].

(b) Time lag between cooperative acts

The time structure of reciprocity may take two forms: simul-
taneous and successive exchange of service and commodities.
This difference is significant, since reciprocal exchanges separ-
ated by a time delay are far more vulnerable to exploitation
by cheaters.
