The particular challenge of FOWT experimental testing is due to the fact that the system : =
dynamics are governed by both aero- and hydrodynamic loads, which are dominated by different :s
physical properties. To ensure similitude of platform hydrodynamics, the platform properties are !
typically scaled by the dimensionless Froude number (4.1) (see table 1). It describes the ratio : <
of inertial forces to gravitational forces in a fluid, assuming that the influence of viscous effects : 3
present in the thin boundary layer is small compared with the dominant factors, i.e. gravity and 13
inertia. The similitude of the incompressible aerodynamic flow over the wind turbine rotor is :8
conserved by scaling according to the Reynolds number (4.2), defined as the ratio of inertial : S
forces to viscous forces in a flow. The assumption of incompressible flow is valid, as the Mach 1S

number (4.7) for WT is typically well below 0.3. Froude scaling the structural stiffness may be
omitted for parts of the tested system and the platform can be built rigid if the relation between
the frequency fext of external forcing and the natural frequency fn of structural vibration is small
