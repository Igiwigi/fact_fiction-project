It has also been pointed out (art. 36)
that the real differential or relative motion of two contiguous particles of the mass must
necessarily be in the common direction in which the particles are constrained to moye,
by virtue of the external conditions to which the whole glacier is subjected. This, in
fact, belongs to the definition of © differential motion ” as I understand the term ; nor
can I conceive how any mechanical effects, such as dislocation or bruising, can be attri-
buted to a © differential motion ” in any arbitrary or conventional sense, rather than to
the real relative motion which I understand to be meant by the expression. If s0, it
appears to me impossible to accept this theory of the veined structure without a far more
explicit explanation than any which has yet been given of it. As8uming, then, what I
conceive to be the only intelligible and determinate meaning of the aboye expression, I
Shall proceed to investigate certain geometrical results which flow from it.
