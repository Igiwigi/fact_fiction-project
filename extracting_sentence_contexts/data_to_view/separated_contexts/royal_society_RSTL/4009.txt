Received May 20,â€”Read June 10, 1847. THE present memoir is not a mere description of a certain number of facts lately
discovered on the electricity of electric fishes; besides this, and more than this, it
contains the laws and theory of these phenomena. Consequently the order of expo-
sition of the facts in this memoir will be the same as that which a scientific arrange-
ment of the snbject would dictate. It is needless to remind the reader that the discharge of the electric fishes is 8ub-
ject to the will of the animal. On irritating any point of the body of an electric fizh, it it is easy to demonstrate by
experiment that this irritation is transmitted by the nerves to the fourth lobe of the
brain, and that then only the discharge takes place.
