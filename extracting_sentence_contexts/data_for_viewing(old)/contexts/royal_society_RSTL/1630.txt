other muscles vary with the change of apparatus which is
around the eye.

The oblique muscles of the eye stand contrasted with the
recti in every respect, in number, size, and direction. Yet it
is a received opinion, that they antagonize the recti, and keep
the eye suspended. To this opinion there are many objec-
tions. 1. In creatures where the eye is socketed on a cup of
cartilage and cannot retract, the oblique muscles are never-
theless present. 2. Where a powerful retractor muscle is
bestowed in addition to the recti muscles, the oblique muscles
have no additional magnitude given to them. g. In matter
of fact, the human eye cannot be retracted by the united action
of the recti as we see quadrupeds draw in their eyes, which
is an argument against these muscles being retractors, and
therefore against the obliqui being their opponents, to draw
it forward.

To these, other objections, no less strong, may be added.
We have just found that certain very rapid motions are to be
performed by the eyeball; now it can be demonstrated, that
a body will be moved in less time by a muscle which is
