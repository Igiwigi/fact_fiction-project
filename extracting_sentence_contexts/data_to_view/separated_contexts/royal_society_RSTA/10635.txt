Ayrron,* and on which her equation is based, fit the Curve VII.
with considerable accuracy. The whole of this large difference between Mrs. AYRTON’S
equation and the experimental results is due to the fact that the equation is based on
the range of are lengths of from 1 millim. to 7 millims., and that the equation no
longer represents the facts if we extrapolate any considerable amount. Even over
the range of from 1 millim. to 7 millims. the connection between the P.D. and length
for constant current is not accurately a straight line, as can be seen either in
Curve VII. or by a careful examination of Mrs. Ayrron’s experimental results.
