Leonards constants were based on a longer
period and so somewhat more satisfactory,* we might fairly accurately predict the
constants of the Cambridge and London frequencies from those of Hillington,
Southampton, and St. Leonards. We find, as a matter of fact, by interpolation :

| Mean height. Standard deviation. Skewness.

; i = ‘ a] a oe

| Dondonays! erie 29-969 0°330 0165
Cambridge. . . .| 29°956 0:336 0-176

\

Actual calculation for thirteen years at these stations corresponding to the years
used for Southampton and Hillington gives :—

Mean height. | Standard deviation.
