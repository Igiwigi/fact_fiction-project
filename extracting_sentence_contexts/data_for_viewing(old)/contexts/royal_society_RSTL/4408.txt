traversing an elongated vesicle from one end to the other, and thus holding nearly
as intimate a relation to the contents as if they had actually terminated in them.

several secondary ones with granular and biliary matter.


AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIVER, 115

As reasons for considering the tissue now described as part of the hepatic appa-
ratus, I may mention,â€”Ist, the close resemblance which often exists between the con-
tents of the vesicles and those of the undonbted hiliary tubes ; in several instances, in
fact, they have appeared to me identical. 2nd. The presence of distinctly yellow
fluid, either infiltrating the granular contents of the vesicles, or united to oil-drops :
this fluid may be reasonably supposed to be of the nature of bile. 3rd. The existence
of much granular matter, shown by chemical tests to be of albuminous nature, of
granular cells and nuclei in the vesicles, shows that they cannot be regarded as
adipose tissue merely; nor should we expect to find this in such constancy and abun-
dance in a class no higher than that of Insects. 4th. The oily matter which is found
in them is usually not at all more abundant than in the liver of many higher animals ;
it exists also in a state of diffusion and combination with the granular matter, and
its presence (since the tissue is surely not mere adipose) argues in 80me measure in
favour of its hepatic character, it being well known how prone oily matter is to
accumulate in hepatic structure. Were it proved by chemical tests that the yellow
fluid, not unfrequently seen in the vesicles, is truly bile, no further argument would
