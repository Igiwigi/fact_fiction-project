3°6 per cent. of the total nitrogen was nitrified.

Indeed, the greatest difficulty in the way of the supposition that much nitrogen is
available to plants by the nitrification of the nitrogen of the subsoil, is, in fact, the
want of sufficient aération. Independently of the greater or less porosity of the sub-

soil itself, and of the channels formed by worms, it is obvious that wherever the
roots go, water and its contents can follow; and that, with deep-rooted plants and
free growth, there will be active movement of water, and there must be of air also,
in the lower layers of the soil. In our former paper we called attention to the fact
that in the experiments in 1882, with the greater growth of the Melilotus, there
remained in the soil less water than in that of the Trifolium repens soil, corresponding
down to a depth of 54 inches, to a loss of 540 tons per acre, or nearly 54 inches of
rain; and again, in 1883, the Vicia sativa soil showed down to 108 inches, less water
than the Trifolium repens soil, in amount corresponding to between 600 and 700 tons
per acre, or to between 6 and 7 inches of rain. Obviously too, the still deeper rooting,
and still freer growing Medicago sativa would remove still more water.

Although much experiment and much calculation have been devoted by several
investigators to the estimation of the degree of aération of soils and subsoils of
different character, the data at command do not justify any very definite conclusions
on the subject. The results seem to indicate a probable range of aération from about
