THE MINUTE ANATOMY OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE AT THE POINT OF TRANSITION
BETWEEN THE STOMACH AND INTESTINE. In the following Chapter the anatomical continuity of BruxNER's glands with the
coiled tubes of the stomach will be described. But before proceeding to the relation
of the facts a short account of the history of the subject will be given. Bzven (104), 1849, spoke of racemose or acinous glands of the pylorus, which pass
into the acinous glands of the duodenum (BruNNER's glands). EckgR (105), 1852, said that the racemose glands of the portio pylorica form an
obvious transition to BRUNNER's glands.
