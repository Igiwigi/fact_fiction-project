which gives 2~"J, (z) = , an integral function of t.

And now we have for the asymptotic value of 2~"J, (z) the unique expression

which is valid for all values of arg ¢ between — 7 and z.

This shows at once that 2~"J, (z), qua function of t, has no imaginary roots which
are not at a finite distance from the negative part of the real axis. In point of
fact, these roots are known to be real and negative when n > — 1||. Hence the
asymptotic expansion for

a finite distance from the zeros of the function.

§ 6. The question now forces itself upon us:—‘‘ Do all integral functions of a
single variable z admit asymptotic approximations in the domain of z=~ , which are
valid for all points but those which are in the immediate vicinity of the zeros of the
functions 4
