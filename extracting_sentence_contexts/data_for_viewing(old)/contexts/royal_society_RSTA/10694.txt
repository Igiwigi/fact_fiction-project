4 the regulator, A rapid change in the quality of the gas produced similar effects. It
S was therefore absolutely necessary at the higher temperatures to keep the gas-
> pressure very constant. The best forms of gas-governor were tried, but did not
= prove sufficiently delicate. I therefore fitted up a large copper gas-holder, delicately
g suspended and counterpoised by means of a steel tape passing over a wheel with ball
& bearings so as to move with very little friction. This arrangement proved to be
® capable of regulating the pressure to within a tenth of a millimetre of water.
§ The large capacity of the gas-holder tended also to minimize the effect of sudden
a small variations of quality of the gas, such as might be produced by air in the
Q pipes, &e.

The action of this constant-pressure gas-supply was so perfect that for many
purposes no other temperature-regulator was required, and as a matter of fact none
was used in many of the preliminary experiments. Since variations of gas-pressure
were practically eliminated, it was found to be unnecessary to have the regulator bulb
inside the heater, and the fine adjustment-regulator was placed in the tank C,
(Barnes, figs, 14 and 15, pp. 211, 213), This regulator was employed to operate an
electric heating arrangement, as described by Dr. Barns in Section 4, in which slow
period oscillations were prevented by the device of the reciprocating contact suggested
by Govuy (‘Journ. de Phys.,’ 1897, p. 479). I found it necessary to introduce a few
