ON THE PRODUCTS OF DECOMPOSITION OF THE DIAZONITROBENZOL COMPOUNDS. These 8nbstances, as far as my observations go, are decomposed under the influence
of reagents like the other diazobenzol compounds; and their transformations may be
expressed by corresponding equations. The nature of their products of decomposition
may in fact be safely predicted beforehand, as the same isomerism which characterizes the
compounds already described is observable. It appeared of sufficient interest to trace them
somewhat more fully. I could not have given the comparative history of the products
of decomposition, however, without deviating too far from the main direction of this
investigation, and I must therefore reserve for a future opportunity a more intimate
acquaintance with these interesting bodies.
