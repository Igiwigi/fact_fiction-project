Thymus.—A single elongated gland is present on each side (fig. 45, ¢m.), the right
measuring in length, 0°53 mm. and the left, 0-43 mm. It runs back to terminate a
short distance in front of the pericardium, on a level with the first rib. We regard
the single gland as being formed by the union of thymus III and 1V and the fact that
the right gland is somewhat constricted and stains less deeply in its mid-region, on a
level with the laterally placed epithelial body IV (fig. 45, ep.b. TV), supports that
conclusion. The left gland is shorter and thicker than the right and shows no trace

of division into two parts.
