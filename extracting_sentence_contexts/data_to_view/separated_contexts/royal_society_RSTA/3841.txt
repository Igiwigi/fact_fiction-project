Several previous DN
studies also show that the selection of virtual fields is an important point regarding the accuracy :a
a7
and robustness of the identification method [65]. Therefore, it is necessary to first examine the : S

robustness and sensitivity of the identification method according to the chosen special virtual
fields. The data obtained from using one of the full-field techniques (i.e. grid method or digital
image correlation) in an actual experiment are in fact displacement fields that are discretized
over a region of interest. Therefore, effects produced by noise on the identification procedure are
closer to the actual effects that occur during actual experiments. These effects can be investigated
by directly corrupting the numerically simulated displacement fields.
