If we assume these con-
ditions, then on average (450/500) x (480/500) x 500 = 432
mimics will have neither trait, while only (50/500) x (470/
500) =47 models will have neither trait. Therefore, any
predator that avoided prey with either C+ or P+ would
have a net pay-off of 432-47 = 385 after exploiting all the
prey, which is lower than the pay-off were it to reject prey
based on C+ alone! Why is it that a predator that attended to one trait (C+)
rather than two traits (either C+ or P+) would have a higher
pay-off despite the fact that both traits are disproportionately
more frequent in models than their mimics? We can answer
this question by calculating the marginal pay-offs. Consider
a predator that began by avoiding C+ prey on encounter, so
that prey with both C+ and P+, and prey with C+ alone are
avoided.
