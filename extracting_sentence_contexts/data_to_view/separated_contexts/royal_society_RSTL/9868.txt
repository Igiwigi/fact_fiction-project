But the amount of potassic carbonate could not become greater if the
duction of the sulphate took place according to the equation :
=

= K,S80,+2C=K,S+2CO0,

=

tpnee, we must assume the formation of potassic disulphide. If we calculate from
tve analytical data of KARoLYT the proportions of his products on the supposition
{Eat the carbon which had remained free had acted on potassic sulphate according to
He equation :

S 4K,80,+7C=2K,C00,+2K,8,+50CO,
B50 obtain :
Z 4:65K,C0,+1:12K,80,+2:22K,8,+14:08CO,+2:65CO

cFHantities which are as near those found for the English powders as the composition
&þ the Austrian rifle powder approaches those of Waltham Abbey.
&If the potassic hyposulphite found by Buxsex and ScurscaKkory originated during
e analysis of their powder residue, then the latter contained, for 16 mols. of decom-
saltpetre, 0:45 mol. of KygS, and 0'33 mol. of K,S.
= Laxcx* found, amongst the products of the Wiirtemberg service powder, only potassic
eulphide.
= From NopBre and, Aprr/s analysis of the products of English mining powder it
Sould follow that for every 16 mols. of decomposed saltpebre; 4 mols. of KyS are formed
fd 5 atoms of sulphar left free ; this would give us for the composition of the
potassic sulphide 2 atoms of potassium and 2'25 atoms of sulphaur. From these facts we conclude that the second stage of the combustion of gunpowder
takes place according to the equations :

1K,00,4+78=K,80,+8K,8,+400, .'.. . . . (v)
4K,80,+70=2K,00,+2K,8,+5CO,. . . - - - (VI)
