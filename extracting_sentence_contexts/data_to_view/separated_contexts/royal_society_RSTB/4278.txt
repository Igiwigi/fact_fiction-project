Fig. 2, showing the effect of the superposition of the tracing of
the Talgai palate on those of the most primitive type of Australian, a reconstruction
of the Piltdown (Kxrru, 8), and a modern Englishman illustrates these facts
graphically. The characteristic shape of the palate is obviously to be connected
with the great size of the canine teeth and the broad premaxillary region which has
previously been described. This figure and fig. 8 further establish the important
fact that the peculiarity of the Talgai palate resides mainly in the anterior portion of
the jaw bearing the incisor, canine, and premolar teeth. The “ reduction” of this
portion of the jaw, which constitutes such an important character in the human, as
contrasted with the anthropoid palate, has not been carried so far in the Talgai
specimen as it has been in the present-day Australian. The modern Australian
palate figured is the largest and most primitive one obtainable in the skull collections
in Sydney.
