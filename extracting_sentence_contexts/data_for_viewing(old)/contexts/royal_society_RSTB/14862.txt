potential or imminent actions. Importantly, most children
used maybe prior to 36 months and prior to their first uses of
epistemic modal verbs.

Among the cognitive verbs that young children produce,
the verbs know and think predominate. Analysis has shown
these two verbs account for 96% of children’s early production
of cognitive verbs. By contrast, forget, remember, wonder etc. are
used much less frequently [27]. Given the overall frequency
with which know and think are produced, they might be
produced equally often and interchangeably. Alternatively,
children might be sensitive to a fundamental difference
between them, notably that know, unlike think, is a factive
verb, in which the truth of the complement is assumed.

With respect to relative frequency, recent evidence based
ona large sample of English-speaking children (n = 130) indi-
cates that in the 4-year period between 12- and 60-months,
know is produced more frequently than think and has a some-
what earlier onset [28], consistent with the proposal that
children’s conceptualization of knowledge, as opposed to
belief, is likely to be foundational for their theory of mind
[29]. Moreover, this differential frequency cannot be attribu-
ted to adult input. Children’s interlocutors produce know
and think with greater frequency as children get older, but
