DR. ARTHUR FARRE: ON THE ORGAN OF HEARING IN CRUSTACEA. 235

somewhat like an auricle, is more convex in its outer than its inner margin, and ter-
minates below in a slight appendix. It is of a delicate horny structure, of the con-
8istence of thin quill, and is nearly transparent, 80 as to admit of its contents being
seen through the parietes.

On removing a portion of the upper surface s0 as freely to expose the cavity, a
number of minute particles of siliceous sand are found lying at the bottom, PI. IX.
figs. 5 and 6. In the first specimens which I examined, the presence of these appeared
to be accidental; but as on pushing the inquiry further I invariably found them,
not only in this species, but in every other in which the organ existed, I began to
regard them as constituting essential parts of the structure ; as in fact, 8ubsidiary
otolithes derived from without, and supplying the place of these calcareous bodies
which are found in various classes as a permanent portion of the auditory apparatus.
These particles, no doubt, gain admission by the aperture just noticed, and as they
are of nearly uniform size, or at least not exceeding a certain size, the largest being
about x3zth of inch in diameter, the slight valve at the aperture may be regarded as
serving the purpose of a regulator, while the water would be allowed to flow freely
at all times by the circular opening. The margin of this aperture is surrounded in-
ternally by a chevauz de frise of hairs, PI. IX. fig. 7. a. These are pointed forwards,
and may be there placed either for the purpose of preventing the ingress of soft or
flocculent particles with which the cavity might become clogged, or for regulating the
admission of the particles of sand into the cavity.
