other species, but in some of the thinner and softer leaves they are much less
numerous, and in A, vitiensis they appear to be particularly scarce. BrrrranpÂ§
states that A, loranthifolia is distinguished by the absence of these sclerites ; but in
leaves referred to this species, which we have examined, several sclerites were
observed. There can be little doubt that these cells serve to bind together the
loose tissue below the palisade layer, and as HaBERLANDT suggests, such thick-
walled elements may be compared with the grains of sand in mortar or the glass
powder which is used to reduce the compressibility of guttapercha.||

The long arms of the sclerites extend through the open tissue of the lamina and
are often seen to be bent in such manner as to lie against the wall of a mesophyll
cell. Their irregular shape probably renders them more efficient as clamping cells
in the spongy leaf-tissue than if they had the form of ordinary fibres ; the fact that
these elements are less branched and more like normal parenchymatous cells in the
firmer and less open tissue of the leaf base would seem to favour this view.

The vascular bundles are accompanied above and below by a few fibres and by
secretory cells ; in Agathis obtusa these cells are larger and thicker than in other
species ; additional strength is occasionally afforded in the case of the stiff leaves
of this species by a palisade cell becoming lignified and functioning as a mechanical
element as in the familiar Hakea leaf. There appears to be no well-defined
sheath of large clear cells such as usually surrounds the vascular bundles of
leaves. In several instances we have noticed centripetal xylem elements above the
