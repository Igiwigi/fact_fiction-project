Why this phaznomenon did not shew itself again after
the conjunction with the same degree of splendour it did be-
fore ; the northern declination of the planet being then daily
decreasing, and the length and brightness of our twilight as
gradually increasing. This will also point out the reason why
it may not be seen again for some time. The fact, however,
being now known to exist, there is no doubt but that some
traces of it may, and I flatter myself will, be perceived, even
under other perhaps less favourable circumstances,

This discovery, lastly, throws also some light on the con-
stitution of the atmosphere of Venus, and the physical con-
struction of that planet. It appears, from the abovementioned observations, that how-
