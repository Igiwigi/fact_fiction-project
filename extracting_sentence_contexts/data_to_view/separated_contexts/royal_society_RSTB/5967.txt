The peculiar origin of the first pair of somites and their transverse commissure from
the prechordal mesoderm in a manner differing from that of all succeeding somites
has often played an important part in the criticisms of those who are unable to accept
the somitic interpretation. It must again be emphasized that all such arguments suffer from the inherent
weakness of laying too much stress upon the conditions in higher forms; a reversal
of this procedure, on the other hand, allowing due weight to be attached to the forms

with a less modified development, leaves little doubt of the fundamental integrity of
the segmental theory. As to the special peculiarities of the first prootic somite, these
may receive a formal explanation from the fact of their position in front of the anterior
limit of the notochord, which allows of the formation of a median commissure.

(iii) Conelusion—We may therefore safely conclude that the prootic somites are
true somites, and that they are three in number. B.—The Metotic Region.

(i) Descriptive-—In the earliest stages the auditory placode provides a convenient
landmark for the identification of the metotic somites ; subsequently recourse can
be had to the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves which, as will be seen, preserve a
constant relationship with the somites. The first metotic somite is a reduced and transient structure, but is clearly visible
between the 7-somite and 10-somite stages, appearing to attain its maximum develop-
ment at about the latter stage.
