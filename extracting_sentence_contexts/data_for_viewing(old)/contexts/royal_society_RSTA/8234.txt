6. Section III describes the “ Method of Normal Co-ordinates,” which entails a study
of disturbances varying according to a simple exponential factor of the time. It is
shown that, on assumptions which are usually regarded as permissible from the physical
standpoint, the method may be used to obtain a complete solution (for infinitesimal
disturbances) in the special case of the problem where the plane boundaries are at
rest. The method is then applied to the general case (with moving boundaries). It is
found that certain properties (the so-called “ conjugate relations ”) which are ordinarily
possessed by “normal” solutions are here no longer satisfied, with the result that
we can no longer show that the time factors are always negative, or even that they are
necessarily real. Again, it is found that the method of expansion employed in the
special case, to express an arbitrary disturbance as a series of disturbances of “ normal”
type, also ceases to apply. This last result suggests the question, whether stability
would in fact be demonstrated if we could prove that all “normal” disturbances (te,

solutions characterised by simple exponential time factors) inevitably decay. We
state our reasons for believing that the proof would be sufficient as regards stability
for infinitesimal disturbances. This appears to be the view of most workers on the
subject.

7. The only paper we have found which investigates in detail the dependence of the
time factor upon “ Reynoups’ number ” is that of L. Horr (Ann. der. Phys.,’ 1914).
Hopr’s investigation indicates stability for infinitesimal disturbances ; but it is subject
to some quantitative uncertainty, estimated by him as never greater than 10 per cent.,
arising from the fact that he replaces Bessel functions by their semi-convergent series
and retains only the first terms of these. We believe that it reveals with sufficient
