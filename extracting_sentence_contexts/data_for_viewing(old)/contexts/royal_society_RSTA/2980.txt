this acts as a quasi-independent set of tests.

This combination of reduced temperature together with a cross-check of two different
measurements to extract the parameters from the spectra suggests a possible route forward if
the SMM is to be used in order to determine the spin polarization from point contact Andreev
reflection measurements.

4. Experimental evidence for ABS in SF Andreev spectra

To date, there have been no definite experimental signatures of ABS caused by spin mixing
in highly spin polarized Andreev point contact experiments. Partly this could be attributed to
experimental constraints: to observe the ABS, high values of 6 [33] are needed, with fairly low
transparency [27] and at low temperatures [31,33]. When coupled with the fact that point contact
spectra are assumed to be made up of many nanocontacts rather than one single SF contact [11],
resulting in the likely distribution of features, it is less surprising that ABS features have not yet
been reported from point contact Andreev spectroscopy.

There is however one direct observation of ABS reported in tunnel spectra of Al-AlyO3-Fe
junctions [50], figure 4. In total 30 contacts were measured in this study, a small number of which
showed contacts with symmetric ABS, as predicted by Grein et al. [33]. For these contacts, the
observed magnitude of the conductance peaks was around three orders of magnitude lower than
