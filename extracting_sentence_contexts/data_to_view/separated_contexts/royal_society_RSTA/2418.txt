It is also evident that for HNsrx-pettog < 1 many aspect ratios have lower By ~ 2
and much lower fusion gain Qpr ~ 1 than the By constraint would allow. This is due to the strong
dependence of the gain on H as described in more detail in appendix A. These results also indicate
that if ST scaling does in fact extend to lower collisionality and higher field and current in NSTX-
U and MAST-U, important questions may still remain on how rapidly the transition from ST to
conventional-A confinement occurs for intermediate A = 1.8 to 2.5. Finally, figure 19 shows that for Bmax = 19T and Jwp = 70 MAm~?, the assumed aspect ratio
dependence of fy and Â« has a significant impact on the achievable fusion gain and net electrical
power. In particular, the fusion gain decreases by nearly a factor of 2 and net electrical power
becomes negative if the By and x are held constant at the values applicable to A= 4 (By = 3.45
and x = 2.06).
