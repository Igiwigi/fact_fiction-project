Pteridophytes with those of their fossil correlatives, the present types, with few
exceptions, hold their own in point of complexity, and do not show evidence of any
general reduction, These considerations seem to me to justify the position that,
unless good evidence of reduction be brought forward in any given case, the spore-
producing members of the homosporous Archegoniate: should be regarded as in the
up-grade of evolution.*

Notwithstanding the great difference in general form between the sporophytes of
the Bryophyta and Pteridophyta, the two offer certain lines of analogy which are
important in the study of the methods of advance of the sporophyte ; these will now

* The physiological problems relating to the heterosporous condition, and especially those in seed plants,

be considered. The sporogonia of Bryophytes may be naturally arranged as
illustrating progressive sterilisation of tissues; this has led on the one hand to the
distinction of a basal vegetative region (Seta) from a fertile apical region (Capsule) ;
but however complex the structure, the radial symmetry is maintained as the
fundamental type of construction. The growth of the simpler sporogonia shows no
definite lozalisation, but distinct apical and interealary growth is seen in the more
complex sporogonia. The former is most marked in the true Mosses, where it may be
