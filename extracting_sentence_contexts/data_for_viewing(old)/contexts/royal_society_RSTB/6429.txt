*EsPINASSE (1934) has recently pointed out some difficulties preventing complete
acceptance of the growth-rate theory of Littm and Jun. He considers that

growth-rates on the two sides of the collar can only differ if one of two sets of circum-
stances holds for that feather germ. “ Either (a) the barbs on the two sides must
be of different lengths, and the rhachis curved, since one side of it has grown faster
than the other ; or (4) the feather germ must have an asymmetry of just such a kind
and degree as to compensate for the difference in growth-rate and give a straight
feather, This asymmetry might be in fact a displacement of the ventral growing
point from its theoretical position diametrically opposite the forming rhachis ;
then the more rapidly growing side would get carried out of the region of growth
so much sooner than the more slowly growing side, having the less distance to
travel, as to be the same size or even smaller.”

Now in certain feathers of the fowl, e.g., remiges, all these conditions are present.
The barbs of one side are shorter than on the other ; the rhachis tends to be curved
away from the shorter side, fig. 54, Plate 28, and also the ventral point is deflected
towards the side of the rhachis bearing the shorter barbs, fig. 53, Plate 28.

The curvature of the feather, and also of the rhachis is possibly due to the habit
of the bird in holding the wings pressed against the sides of the body. As the follicles
