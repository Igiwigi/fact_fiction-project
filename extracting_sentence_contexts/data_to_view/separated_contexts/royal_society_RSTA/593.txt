Thus, in experiments in which shearing is rapid and intense a yield value is
obtained. However, when the liquids are left to stand they will always reveal a flat mirror
surface denoting absence of yield values. It is this fact that modified the conclusion drawn
in the section on shear elasticity to the effect that besides the temperature the rate of shearing
influences the partition of the energy input into shear elastic, recoverable portion and an
irrecoverable portion. Whilst a model of elastic and viscous elements in series would represent
this behaviour mathematically (a model of spring with variable elasticity and a non-New-
tonian liquid dash-pot in parallel is really necessary to represent it) it is felt that the use of
such models should be purely for calculation purposes ; the systems are not made up of several
elements in series or parallel, but they undergo several processes in parallel.
