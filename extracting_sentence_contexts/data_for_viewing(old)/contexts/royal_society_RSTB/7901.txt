It has also been argued that because tropical tree
carbohydrate concentrations, [CH,O], are ‘generally
high’, [CH,O] must already be in excess with
increasing [CO,] unable to further stimulate plant
growth (Korner 2003; Wright 2005). That plants
growing under elevated [CO,] often have higher
[CH2O] has also been taken as additional evidence
for this idea (Korner 2003). Nevertheless, recent
advances in our understanding of the signalling of
growth responses in plants, in particular interactions
between sugar and plant hormone signalling with
nutrients and other growth limitations (Rolland er al.
2006), show that higher [CH,O] is, in fact, usually
associated with a stimulation of sink activity (i.e. faster

Although an increased [CO] accompanying climate (CH2O] with higher [CO2] do not mean that plant
