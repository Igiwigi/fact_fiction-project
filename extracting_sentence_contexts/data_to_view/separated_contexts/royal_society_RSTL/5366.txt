Henee it appears, that jf the isothermal curves for an aggregate be drawn accord-
ing to the above definition, all the propositions proved in this paper respecting homo-
geneous substances become true of the aggregate.

(36.) ProposrTron NV.—Tnzorem. Every Isothermal line for an aggregate of a
liquid and its vapour, is a straight line of equal pressure, from the volume corresponding
to complete liquefaction to the volume corresponding to complete evaporation. This is a fact known by experiment. The Theorem is equivalent to a Statement,
that the pressnre of a liquid and its vapour in contact with each other, is a function
of the temperature only. Corollary. —TnrortEm.
