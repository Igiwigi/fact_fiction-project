‘The post-larval development of the test must be similar in many respects to that of
Echinocardium cordatum especially as regards the surrounding of the periproct by
inter-ambulacrum 5, the backward migration of the periproct and the compacting
of the apical system. of plates. In Clypeastroids Lovien (1874, e.g., Plate L) figures a
single pentagonal plate pierced by water pores and by four genital pores. The main
question demanding solution, therefore, was as follows :—Is this plate the enlarged
madreporic plate (genital 2) only, and if so what has been the fate of the other four
genital plates? Fortunately, the material available was sufficiently advanced to
furnish the answer to this question.

The imago at metamorphosis is almost circular in outline, 0-4—0-43 mm. in diameter,
and, owing to the fact that it possesses a lantern of Aristotle, is even more like a regular
urchin than is the imago of a Spatangoid (Gorpon, 1926, b, p. 272). Very soon the
test becomes ellipsoidal (fig. 18, / = 0-56 mm., b= 0-44 mm.). The pentagon having
at each of its apices an ocular plate occupies a large proportion of the dorsal surface.
In tig. 15 it will be observed that a long, slender branch arises from the right arm of
the dorsal arch. This branch is frequently present and in the large madreporic plate
(g*, fig. 18) part of the dorsal arch with just such a branch can easily be distinguished.

* In some forms the plating in one inter-ambulacrum is reversed, ¢.g., area 1 in Eehinarachnius.
