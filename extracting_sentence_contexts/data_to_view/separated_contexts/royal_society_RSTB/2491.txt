In these examples
there is internal phloem as well as internal secondary wood. Dr. Scorr considers
these features to be mere anomalies, but in view of the condition found in the Osmun-
dace they are probably to be regarded somewhat more seriously. This probability
is strengthened by the fact that in another species, Lyginodendron robustum, described
by Mr. Sewarp (‘ Ann. Bot.,’ vol. 11, p. 65), the presence of internal secondary wood
is quite constant. Cycadoxylon fremyt, another species close to Lyginodendron, has
also internal secondary xylem and phloem. In both the last-mentioned examples the
primary centripetal wood is largely abortive.
