slightly on expiration; all the superior fibres acting on the first, second, third and
fourth ribs acted very decidedly to draw down those ribs on expiration. The articu-
lations of these ribs with the vertebre are considerably above the attachment of
the serratus to the scapula; the centre of action of the serratus being considerably

below the centre of motion of the ribs; the fibres fixed into those ribs act in relation
to the ribs from below upwards and forwards to draw them downwards, and slightly
backwards. We have here this curious fact, that the superior fibres of the same
musele, the serratus magnus, are expiratory, while the inferior fibres are inspiratory.
The action of this muscle can only be demonstrated on the living body, but we might
have inferred, & priori, on knowing the relative direction of the various fasciculi of
the serratus and of the ribs into which they are respectively inserted, which fibres are
expiratory and which inspiratory.

The serratus is in full stretch when the animal stands, and then it acts from the
ribs on the base of the scapula: if all its fibres were expiratory, it is clear that when
the scapular action is called into play, as the expiratory action would be constant,
inspiration would be interfered with, If all were inspiratory, the expiratory action
would be clogged. As it is, the central fibres which support the scapula are neutral,
the superior expiratory, the inferior inspiratory, and by this beautiful adjustment every
