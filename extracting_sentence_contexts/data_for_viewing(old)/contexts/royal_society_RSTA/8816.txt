symmetry of the hole, and (3) that it must pass through O, which is located as the
centre of a paper circle fitted into the inner hole.

By proceeding in this manner it was found that the values of 3 could be nearly
always determined with confidence by at least one method and often by both. When
both methods were available the agreement in the resulting values of 3 was in
general good; the average difference between them in a// cases for shells of type I.
(99 in number), in which both measurements were available and both appeared to be
a priori reliable, was 0-20 degrees. These cases were simply taken as a sample.
The general features of the agreement were the same for all types. We may
therefore fairly assert that the probable error of any determination of 3 is some-
thing less than 0-2 degrees. The use of the measurement OA’ is of special
importance for small values of 3, and in fact alone makes their accurate determination
possible.

The probable error in the determination of ¢ is not quite so easy to estimate, as there
is no alternative method of determining ¢. The method is clearly theoretically sound,
and the errors can only arise from faulty’ estimations of the symmetry of the hole.
By making a number of independent determinations for the same hole, with proper
precautions against a biassed judgment, and comparing their consistency, it appeared
that the probable error of any determination of ¢ was less than 24 degrees, unless
the yaw was small (less than 0-8 degrees, say). As. the yaw approaches zero, the ©
errors in the determination of ¢ increase rapidly until, when the yaw is less than 0-2
degrees, ¢ cannot be determined at all.
