constants for a and n, are thrown upon the coefficient b. The accuracy of the
experimental work, and the validity of the formula for the influence of temperature
on conductivity, can then be tested (1) by comparing the two values of b deduced
from Ky, Kyo) respectively (Table XIX.), (2) by the smoothness or otherwise of
the curve representing the variation of b with the concentration of the solution
(Diagram XIV.).

In Table XIX. are given the values of the coefficients for all the solutions referred to
in Table XV. The values of a and n are the values derived from the expressions
formulated above. The values for b are those derived from K,,, and K,,. It will be
observed that in the column of differences for the b values, there is a progressive
series of positive differences followed by a series of negative differences. This is
mainly due to the fact that the slope of the line representing the variation with
concentration of the constant a was chosen so as to give the values for a at 40 per
cent. and at 4 per cent as close as possible to these individual values. A closer
agreement would have resulted if the linear relationship had been adjusted for
40 per cent. and 10 per cent., but the differences were so small that it was not
deemed necessary to repeat the somewhat tedious calculations involved. The values
of the constants are plotted out in Diagram XIV., and the smoothness of the
individual values for 6 is a satisfactory indication of the validity of the formula
employed.
