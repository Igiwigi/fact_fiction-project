The proportions diffused are sensibly equal, of the different salts, at the higher
temperature, with the exception of the largest proportion of salt, 10 per cent., when
a certain divergence occurs. This last fact is consistent with our expectations, that
the diffusion of salts would prove most highly normal in dilute solutions. Some of
the irregularities at the lower temperature are evidently of an accidental kind. (2.)
