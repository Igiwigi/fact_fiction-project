THERMAL EMISSIVITY OF THIN WIRES IN AIR. 393

On comparing the loss of heat from the wire of 1:2 mil diameter when at 300° C.

with that from the wire of 6 mils diameter when at 15° C., both being in an enclosure
at 10° C., we see that the former loses per square centimetre per second, not
1510 58 times
as much heat as the latter (which it would do if the emissivity were the same) but
instead,

60 X 58 or 3480 times

as much heat ; arising from the fact that the emissivity, that is, the number of calories
Seramme C.°) lost per second. per square centim. of surface per 1° C. excess tempera-
Bure of the 1:2 mil wire at 300° C., is 60 times as great as that of the 6 mils wire at
45°, the latter varying very rapidly with the temperature near 15° C.
& From the curves on figs. 11 and 12 the following table has been drawn up giving
\dhe emissivities of the various wires at eight useful even temperatures.
