The following is an
experiment tried with the electric light. The spectrum was formed with a complete
quartz train, no glass whatever being in the path of the rays. The purity of the
spectrum was evidenced by the fact of the lines being sharp when thallium, sodium, or
lithium was put between the carbon poles. The spectrum was s0 arranged that any
desired ray could be thrown on to a lampblacked pith surface, screens being interposed
to cut, off the action when desired. The torsion-balance was similar to the one used in
the last-named series of experiments (104), but was not quite s0 sensitive.
