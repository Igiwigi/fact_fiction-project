The Table also brings out more distinctly than before the yery large proportion of
arch to base in the Irish, which will probably be found to be a marked and general
national character. It further shows that the proportion of arch to base in a nation
may vary from either arch or base-line deviating from the average, or from deviation
of both ; and therefore probably the actual length of these measurements is of more
value than the proportion of one to the other. The most striking and altogether remark-
able fact is that in uncivilized nations, while the length of the arch is very yariable, the
length of the base-line is always great. Thus in length of arch the three Kafir skulls
exceed all other skulls in the foregoing Table, with the exception of the Irish, but the
Kafir base-line exceeds the Irish by not much less than half an inch. In the Esquimaux
8kull 77, and the Carib skull 88, both of them skulls of most savage type, the base-line
reaches the extraordinary length of 5:9, In only one European skull, the French 24,
has a base-line of 5'7 occurred, while in only two others, the French skull 22, and the
Scotch skull 38, it has amounted to 5'6, The low proportion of arch to base in the
French skulls depends on a concurrence of a long base-line with a short arch, three out
of the six males having the base-line 5:5 or more, and four of them having the arch 13-8
or less.
