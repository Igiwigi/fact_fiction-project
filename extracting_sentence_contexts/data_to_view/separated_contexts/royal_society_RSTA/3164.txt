Note that the restriction to a=0 in [9] was not necessary. With the slight generalization of
theorem 3.1 in [16] just mentioned, one could have allowed @ to be a continuously differentiable
function whose derivative goes to 0 exponentially as § > +oo. In order to use theorem 3.14 of [9] in §5 of this paper, it must be generalized to allow systems
(A 1) in which bis an arbitrary diagonal matrix. (Note that for the system (2.1)-(2.3), b= diag(0, b).)
In fact, we can generalize theorem 3.14 in [9] to allow a to be a continuously differentiable function
whose derivative goes to 0 exponentially as € > -too, and b to be an arbitrary diagonal matrix,
with the other hypotheses unchanged. The key step in the proof of the generalization is to show


that, if the travelling wave T*(é) is spectrally stable in 4, then it is linearly stable in Xq. To do
this one can appeal to Yurov’s recent result, theorem 1.1 in [10], which implies that for a linear
operator in the form (A 4) on L?, in which d = diag(d1,...,dn,) with all d, positive constants, a(&)
and the Sj(&) are continuous and approach end states exponentially, and b is a constant diagonal
matrix, spectral stability implies linear stability.
