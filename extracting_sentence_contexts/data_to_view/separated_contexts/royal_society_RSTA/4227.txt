Even although
slight imperfection of elasticity be shown before the yield-point, experiments showed
that no creeping need necessarily occur for a pause in the loading of at least a night’s
duration. * The fact that yielding takes some time to start has already been recorded by Professor EWING in his
paper cited above, “On Measurements of Small Strains, &e.” (see pp. 135 and 136), He has noticed that
yielding may begin in a part of the bar lying outside the 8-inch length to which the extensometer is
applied, and may gradually spread along the bar. MR.
