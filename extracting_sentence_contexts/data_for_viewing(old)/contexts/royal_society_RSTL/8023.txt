VThe preceding considerations respecting the still-water strains resulting from the action
: yertical and horizontal forces on a ship have been given at considerable length, be-
use they furnish many extensions and corrections of existing knowledge, and also be-
Ause methods similar to those here employed will hereafter be applied to the severer
strains experienced by ships when at sea or when ashore. Besides this they have a
special interest and importance themselves. They do not, it is true, exercise very much
immediate influence on the distribution of material and the provision of strength in a
ship, owing to the greater magnitude of the sea-strains; but they constitute what may
be termed the permanent strains on the structure, and we have seen how very widely
these permanent strains differ under different methods of distributing the weights
and the buoyancy. In view of the illustrations chosen, there cannot fail to result a
fuller appreciation of this fact than could result from any general statement ; and the

importance of careful stowage must be fully realized, as well as the connexion whi;
should subsist between the ship's form and the distribution of her weights. Some
existing views have been shown to be erroneous,â€”notably those respecting the effect of
an excess of weight amidships, and the poxition of the section of maximum strain. The
classification T have adopted for ships is confessedly imperfect; but no general laws
can possibly be laid down to include the very varied characters of the distribution of
weight and buoyancy in all ships, and the types I have chosen have at least the merit of
including a very large proportion of the cases met with, besides permitting a generality
