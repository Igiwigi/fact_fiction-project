Average rise  -006

These results indicate (1) that the rise in the difference is occasioned not merely by
the direct application of the stimulating agent to the cord, but as a consequence of
the presence of a series of excitatory processes, whether these are produced by nerve
impulses entering below by afferent channels, or from above by cortical efferent ones. This conclusion is supported by the fact that a similar rise follows a large reflex
discharge of energy from the cord, when this is produced in the strychnised animal
by sensory stimulation.

(2.) They also show that the rise is least in the case of the excitatory cord changes
evoked by cortical stimulation, in which case the limit of rise is not only small, but
soon attained, the average rise in the instances given under A being -003, the
maximum = ‘005, the minimum = ‘001. When the sciatic nerve or posterior root of
the cord (severed from the brain) is excited, the rise is seen to be much more
pronounced, being on the average °005, maximum ‘011, minimum ‘003. Finally,
when the columns of the cord itself are excited, the rise is greater, the average being
006, maximum °018, minimum ‘002. (The average rise in this case would be still
greater if the three very low and exceptional readings of ‘002 were omitted from the
table ; it would then be 0075.) In the same experiment performed on the Monkey
(282) the rise in half an hour following twelve excitations was -006.
