imagined to vary, the whole varying states of the fluxes B, D, C due to impressed
force being determined by the curls of e, and hy, which are the sources of the dis-
turbances (though not of the energy).
The rotational peculiarity in eolotropic substances does not seem to be a very
@prmidable objection. Are they not solid ?
a As regards the assumed constancy of p, a more complete theory must, to be correct,
feduce to one assuming constancy of p, because, as Lord Rayiercn* has shown, the
umed law has a limited range of validity, and is therefore justifiable as a preparation
dpr more complete views. Theoretical requirements are not identical with those of
he practical engineer.
i But, for quite other reasons, the dynamically determined stress might be entirely
srong. Electric and magnetic “force” and their energies are facts. But it is the
otal of the energies in concrete cases that should be regarded as the facts, rather
hen their distribution ; for example, that, as Sir W. THomson proved, the “mechanical
‘Balue” of a simple closed current C is }LC*, where L is the inductance of the circuit
oefficient of electromagnetic capacity), rather than that its distribution in space is
given by SHB per unit volume. Other distributions may give the same total amount
‘ef energy. For example, the energy of distortion of an elastic solid may be expressed
&n terms of the square of the rotation and the square of the expansion, if its boundary
De held at rest; but this does not correctly localise the energy. If, then, we choose
“Some other distribution of the energy for the same displacement and induction, we
Should find quite a different flux of energy. But I have not succeeded in making any
‘pther arrangement than Maxwett’s work practically, or without an immediate intro-
Bluction of great obscurities. Perhaps the Jeast certain part of MAxweELt’s scheme,
modified by myself, is the estimation of magnetic energy as $HB in intrinsic
