apart from gallinaceous birds he has very seldom known egg-laying to occur in any
species excepting in the presence of the male. Spontaneous ovulation, in his
experience, is non-existent or most rare in species which normally mate for life.
It may occur, however, in unmated swans and with various kinds of cranes when
two females live in abnormally close association. Otherwise, Lord Tavistock informs
me, these birds never lay unless mated. The conditions are clearly comparable to
those seen in the pigeon. The mere presence of another individual provides an
exteroceptive stimulus which acts on the pituitary and starts the nest-building and
ovulating stage of the cycle.

Tue MEANING oF SExuUAL DisPLAy

In view of such facts as these it is easy to see that sexual display and courtship
phenomena generally probably serve an important function in producing the
necessary synchronization of the male and female reproductive processes without which
procreation cannot be accomplished. Such a view has been put forward by Ex1or
Howarp, and adopted by Pycrarr (1913), and also by Huxtey (1914), who has
studied sexual posturing in the great crested grebe. Howarop says that the purpose
of posturing is the provocation of sexual reaction by mutual stimulation, HuxLey
refers to it as having an aphrodisiac action, and BrEBrE (1931), supposes that it has
“a slow indirect effect upon the nerves’. Here I suggest for it a more precise
physiological signification.

It has been shown that the gonad-stimulating hormone of the pituitary will cause
ovarian development and ovulation in birds, and that sexual posturing or even the
