a very luminous progenitor detection consistent with a 50-80 Mo star [59,60]. (Note that here the
lower value of 50 Mo is derived assuming that the progenitor was in an eruptive state, whereas
the higher mass estimate of 80 Mo derives from the necessary bolometric correction if the star was
quiescent and hot.) At this meeting we have heard reports from Elias-Rosa et al. of yet another
example, SN 2015bh, which appears to be very similar to SN 2009ip. Having multi-filter (colour)
information in pre-explosion data is usually hard to come by, but the very high luminosities of
these progenitors are more luminous than the most luminous known RSGs, and are far too bright
to be WR stars. LBVs seem like the most straightforward interpretation of these progenitors.

Placing the detected source on an HR diagram to deduce its initial mass, however, is not so
straightforward because of one caveatâ€”pre-SN eruptions are inferred to account for their dense
CSM, so they might have been in an outburst state at the moment when the pre-SN archival data
were obtained (which would, of course, still point to an LBV-like progenitor). In fact, some cases
of pre-SN eruptions have been detected, as described next.


(d) Directly detected precursor eruptions

Observations have already confirmed the idea that SNe with strong CSM interaction may have
suffered violent LBV-like eruptive instability in the few years before core collapse, because there
are several cases where the precursor eruptions were directly detected as dramatic photometric
variability. The first documented case was the outburst 2 years before SN 2006jc [61,62], which
was unusual in that it was an H-poor event (Type Ibn). SN 1961V, mentioned above, also showed
slow S Dor-like variability in the years before its SN (see [3]), although for many years it was
not considered as a SN. The Type IIn-P event SN 2011ht also showed pre-explosion outburst
