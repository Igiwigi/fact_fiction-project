The flame was perfectly transparent at the highest temperatures, and it was
possible to look right into the converter and see the fluid slag thrown up against the
mouth and drop back into the vessel. This fact is to he noted, the fourth spectrum had an exposure of exactly a minute,
while the sixth had two minutes; as regards the manganese bands the spectra are
much alike, but in carbonic oxide and in iron lines the sixth is much the stronger
spectrum. This shows that the quantity of manganese vapour was decreasing, but
the quantity of iron vapour was increasing. Though the fifth spectrum received an exposure half as long again as the sixth, the
spectrum is much more than twice as strong.
