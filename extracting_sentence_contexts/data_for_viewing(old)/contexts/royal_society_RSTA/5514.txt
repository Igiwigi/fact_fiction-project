neither presents a human face, only human voices and, during a variety of exchanges with their
human user, exhibiting typically human tonal responses factual, humorous or critical depending
on the context.

Although digital assistantship has become a home appliance for a growing number of
households, it is not yet a ‘twin’. Even if the assistant’s machine learning ability gathers ever
more information about the user, that information is still too specialized and fragmentary to
genuinely duplicate the user, in spite of having access to vast amounts of data and powerful
data analytics. And that access and the means to analyse the data constitute the second drive to
DT. Personal data have been accumulating for over a decade even as businesses and government,
as well as social and medical services, found lucrative and/or otherwise beneficial uses for their
operations and the value to the user. During the early part of the last decade, I introduced the
