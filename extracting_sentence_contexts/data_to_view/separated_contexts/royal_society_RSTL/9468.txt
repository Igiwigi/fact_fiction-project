BABER ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE THYROID GLAND. 585

Tn this connection it may be well to mention the following appearance which T have
observed in the thyroid gland of several Conger Kels :—In the walls of the vesicles,
which in this animal are often of considerable size in proportion to the whole organ,
small vexicles are seen, as shown in Plate 68, fig. 4. These secondary vesicles (Plate 68,
fig. 4, 3, 3) are provided with an epithelial wall, and with contents similar to the
primary vesicles. From the fact that by their growth they have evidently flattened
out to a greater or less degree the epithelium separating them from the cavity of the
primary vesicle, it is probable that the two layers of epithelium separating the cavity
of the s8mall, from that of the large vesicle sometimes give way, allowing the contents
of the two vesicles to mix. At the same time others of these small vesicles probably
grow outwards becoming independent struetures (Plate 68, fig. 4, 5, 5). It is possible
that some of these s8mall vesicles may be curved branches of a large one which are cut
across in the section.
