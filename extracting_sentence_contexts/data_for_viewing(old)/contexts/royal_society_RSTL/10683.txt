[3 volcanic origin, Thus VogGeLsAnct describes and figures, from a quartz-trachyte from

Snear Schemnitz, and also from Borsva, spherulitic bodies, the 80-called Globuliten, of

Eivotropic Silica, and of approximately similar dimensions to the greensand globules.

A Miner Livyt has also discovered silica in a globular form and isotropic condition in
eurites from Les Settons. Tt is worthy of notice, also, that there is a remarkable
similarity, both of form and size, between the colloid siliceous globules of the greensand
and the calcareous bodies artificially produced by the reaction of ammonia carbonate

* Professor Z1TreL mentions the fact that after treating with acid the now calcified, or partially
calcified, siliceous sponges from jurassic strata the residue contains numerous rounded, rough, deeply
indented siliceous discs. © Studien itber fozsile Spongien,” I. Hexactinellide. *Abhandl. der kinig]. bay.

the description of them that they are much larger, and that they further differ from those under con-
8ideration in being either crystalline or erypto-crystalline.
