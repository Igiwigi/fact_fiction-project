For lack of space on the plate a graph has not been given of the disturbances as
calculated from (16). The scatter is greatly reduced (s.d. of disturbances 11-43 against
17-05), but the general course of affairs is very similar to that shown by the graph for the
ungraduated numbers. The graphic test was applied to see whether the regression of wu, + u,_, ON U,_, Was,
in fact, appreciably linear or no. Figs. 3 and 4 show dot-diagrams for the ungraduated
and the graduated numbers respectively.
