It is only recently that higher-order versions of the LB method (LBM) have
been developed, which prove capable of capturing (some) non-equilibrium effects beyond the
hydrodynamic picture [24-26], but such higher-order versions are not relevant to this work. The main feature that distinguishes the LB from the DSMC is the coarse graining operated at
the level of the microscopic velocity space, as the degrees of freedom of the velocity space itself
are largely reduced. In fact, while, in LB, probability distributions at each lattice site x are allowed
to propagate only along a finite set of directions with an assigned speed &,, in DSMC particles are
grid-free.

The most important steps of any hybrid model are the definition of accurate protocols to exchange
information between the different solvers at the overlapping region and the decomposition :8
of the computational domain into the particle, continuum and overlap domains. For what :s
concerns the first issue, as LB involves the solution of kinetic equations for the single-particle :
distribution function evaluated at a set of discrete microscopic velocities, fa(x, t), and not directly
the hydrodynamic moments or their fluxes as in classical Navier-Stokes equations solvers, we
developed specific mapping schemes that allow information to be passed from the DSMC to
the LB domains and vice versa, correctly transferring also non-equilibrium information.
