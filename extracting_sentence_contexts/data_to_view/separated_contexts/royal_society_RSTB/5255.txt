Frortep (1883, p. 220) corroborates the observation of GEGENBAUR recording the
remarkable fact that during the 7th and 8th day of incubation the dilatations of the
notochord are arranged intervertebrally and the constrictions intravertebrally.
ScHAUINSLAND (1906, p. 546) also gives a text-figure showing that the dorsal (thoracic)
vertebree in 8-day chick bear amphiccelous character. It is evident that all above-mentioned authors agree in this, that the first deformation
of the notochord observed in the chick embryo is represented by intervertebral con-
strictions and intravertebral dilatations, and that these deformations do not appear
earlier than on the 5th day of development. This, in connection with the fact that
none of the later investigators known to the writer, who deal with the early development
of the chick or of other birds, have described a stage in the evolution of the form of the
notochord earlier and different from these just mentioned, renders the observation of
intrasclerotomie dilatations and intersclerotomic constrictions on the notochord of the
3- and 4-day Larus very interesting. The fact that the shape of the notochord remains unaltered before the beginning of
the formation of the system of the perichordal rings renders it highly probable that. the
deformation of the notochord is not caused by internal but external forces.
