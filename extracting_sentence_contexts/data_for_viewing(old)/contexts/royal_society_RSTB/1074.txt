964 PROFESSOR H. M. WARD ON THE ACTION OF LIGHT ON BACTER

escaped the action of the light. How? There are several possible explan
(1) The light was not sufficiently intense, or did not act long enough, to kj
spores more resistant than the majority; (2) The spores from which these
originate were so deeply submerged that the oxidising action set up by |
could not take place freely ; (3) These submerged spores lay so exactly |
number of other spores that the latter partially screen them from the light.

If it were not for the fact that these spores do eventually germinate out: fre
thus show that the agar is still a fit medium for their growth, it might
suggested (4) that these spores have escaped suffusion by some poisonous
developed in the medium; but I have given such excellent evidence of o
against this position that I cannot accept it as probable.

On the whole, the most rational explanation seems to be the thirdâ€”the
developing colonies are from spores partly screened by others, living or dea
intervened between them and the incident rays.

The following series of photographs illustrates at the same time the com
action of certain glass screens, and some phenomena already met with when ine}
the plates.
