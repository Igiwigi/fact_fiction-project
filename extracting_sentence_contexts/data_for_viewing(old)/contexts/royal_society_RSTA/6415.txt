questions [25] of Thermodynamics 2.0 using his pet theory known as Constructal Law. Adrian’s
article underpins Constructal Law as the universal principle of all biological, geophysical, social,
and technological evolution.

A relationship exists between physics and thermodynamics, as exemplified by statistical
approaches [6,26]. The relationship is not reciprocal, as the practitioners of science value this
relationship asymmetrically. Engineers value thermodynamics more favourably than physicists
might, and this value judgment from engineers has a legacy and logic. Thermodynamics came
into being after we had discovered steam engines because people felt the need to explain just
how their new engines worked.

We hope this two-part theme issue of Thermodynamics 2.0 will be able to contribute toward
the unity of science, energy, economics and evolution. The fact that engineers in the twenty-first


century study above and beyond engines has become increasingly evident. We should also spend
more time understanding and explaining how humans and human society work. Thermodynamics
2.0 strives toward a better understanding of life, humans and human society, as well as their
interconnection to the material world. Energy makes a human society, and power relationships
make or break a society.
