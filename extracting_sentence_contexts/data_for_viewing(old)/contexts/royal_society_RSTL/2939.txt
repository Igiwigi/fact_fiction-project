EVERY naturalist is aware that many s8pecies of insects, particularly of hymeno-
pterous insects, which live in society, maintain a degree of heat in their dwellings con-
siderably above that of the external atmosphere, but no one, I believe, has hitherto
demonstrated the interesting facts that every individual insect when in a state of
activity maintains a separate temperature of body considerably above that of the sur-
rounding atmosphere, or medium in which it is living, and that the amount of tempe-
rature varies in different species of insects, and in the different states of those Species.
Previously, therefore, to considering the connection which subsists between the evo-
lation of animal heat and the functions of respiration and circulation in insects, I
Shall endeayour to prove that every species maintains a distinct temperature of body,
the amount of which differs in the different states of the insect.

I was first led to the particular consideration of the subject of temperature in in-
sects by some observations on the temperature of wild bees in their natural haunts,
which were made by myself at Richborough, near Sandwich in Kent, in the autumn
of 1832, at the suggestion of Dr. Marsnas Har, for the purpose,—similar to that
