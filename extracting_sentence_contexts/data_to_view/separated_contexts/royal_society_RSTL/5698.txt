These changes in
e calibre of the vessels continue, even in an amputated limb, for days after severance
m the body*: I have repeatedly watched them taking place, and seen them give rise
the movement of the blood. 'B The other fact to which I will allude, appears to me to decide of itself the question at
JZ88ue. Having occasion to examine, under chloroform, some very small frogs, measuring
Mbout an inch from the tip of the nose to the end of the coccyx, I found that the blood
Jn the capillaries invariably flowed in a stream pulsating synchronously with the beats
Ef the heart, which were visible through the parietes of the thorax ; and however mildly
She anzesthetic was administered, the motion was commonly exceedingly slight between
She pulses. Not unfrequently, although the arteries remained of full size, the blood
moved in jerks, with considerable intervals of absolute stillness between the successive
Zimpulses which the contractions of the heart occasioned ; yet no accumulation of cor-
Epuscles was produced in the capillaries, however long the animal was kept under obser-
Avation.
