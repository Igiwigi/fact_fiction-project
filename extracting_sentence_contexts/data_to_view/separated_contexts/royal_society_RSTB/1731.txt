When seen in sectional view,
the spore of S. insigiis bears a considerable resemblance to the pollen grain of Pinus
(see fig. 14), though, as the superficial aspect shows (see fig. 11 ; also, WILLIAMSoN,
19th Mem., Plate 7, figs. 43 and 44), its real form is quite different, for in the fossil
the air-sac forms a continuous rim all round the spore, a fact not recognised by
Count Sotms-Lausacu. There is little doubt, however, that the wing agrees with
the air-sacs of Pinus pollen in being formed by a dilation of the cuticle, and probably
its function was the same. The four spores of a tetrad are arranged tetrahedrally, as is shown with great
clearness in some of the sporangia (see Plate 14, fig.
