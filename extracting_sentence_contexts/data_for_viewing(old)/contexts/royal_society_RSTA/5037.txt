Right from the beginning, the unknown young Newton casts himself in a superior position
as the lynx-eyed detective, the expert on lenses who decided to amuse himself by playing
with colours but who rapidly realized that major scientific issues were at stake. In his first
sentence, in a deceptively casual remark inside parentheses, he points to a long-standing problem
that Descartes had failed to resolve: why does a spherical lens not bring sunlight to a perfect
focus? In a key strategic move, Newton switches to a different and little-studied instrument—the
prism—for exploring the nature of light. Rewriting his repeated trials, mistakes and cul-de-sacs
as a logical and systematic investigation, he makes his conclusions sound inevitable and hence =
unchallengeable—and by concealing vital details, such as the type of glass or shape of the prisms, :
Newton renders replication extremely difficult.

The paper has no sub-titles, but Newton presents his case in four stages, inviting his readers nee)
to follow him on his journey from plain experimental fact towards a quantitative theory of light :
supported by empirical verification. For more details, see Zemplén’s ‘The history of vision, colour & ne]
light theories’ [9]. DNS

In this artfully naive account, Newton reports that he started out by observing how a circular
beam produces a rectangular spectrum on being passed through a prism (even though it is more
pear-shaped). He then appears to examine and dismiss reasonable explanations, substantiating
his arguments with quantitative calculations. What he is actually doing is rejecting Descartes’
arguments that colours are modified by the medium: Newton leaves unstated the alternative
possibility that the sine laws of refraction are at fault. By comparing rays with tennis balls
(then small cork balls covered with woollen cloth), he implies that light consists of particles;
