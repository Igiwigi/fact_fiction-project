It may
be that the main stem of the external ophthalmic artery has been replaced by the rete, and
that consequently the peripheral orbital and ethmoidal branches frequently have their
roots in this structure. In the rat the so-called supra-orbital division of the stapedial artery
arises from the stapedial artery at the apex of the orbit and has a distribution similar to
that of the external ophthalmic artery of other animals (figure 9). In fact, as will be shown
later, it is probably a true external ophthalmic artery. The site of origin of the peripheral vessels supplying the orbito-ethmoidal region was
found to vary frequently in the cat, and also, though much less commonly, in the other
species. In the latter the variations seen consisted merely of a shift of the origin of the
branches along the main trunk of the external ophthalmic artery.
