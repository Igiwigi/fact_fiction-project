It appears to be formed of radiating thin
plates in close contact; but the state of preservation does not admit of detailed
description or absolute identification, for the mass may possibly be dermal armour. The bones of the palate.—The bones of the palate are scattered. Their identifica-
tion rests upon, first, the forms of the bones; secondly, their consecutive positions ;
and thirdly, the fact that the vomer, palatine, and pterygoid all carry minute teeth;
while there can be no suspicion that these elements belong to the lower jaw, since
the lower jaw is preserved. Vomer.—Both vomerine bones are indicated, and both are partly imbedded in the
matrix. They were very slender, 3 centims. long, and about 2 millims. wide where
widest proximally.
