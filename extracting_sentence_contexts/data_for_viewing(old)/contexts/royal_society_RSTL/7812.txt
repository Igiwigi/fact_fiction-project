of the moveable light slides. A block for supporting glasses is also fitted to these
guides, and its upper surface is ruled with lines parallel to them, 80 that any object can
be surely placed on it in a given position. The lights were petroleum lamps with the
edge of the flame turned towards the photometer: when the wick is not too high, and
they have been burning for about twenty minutes, they give an intense and tolerably
constant light. 'The yerniers are adjusted to read 0 when the polarized semicircle dis-
appears entirely, and are set to 90* when the lights are adjusted to equality. This
equality is verified for each obseryation ; then for any azimuth (9) the intensity of the
light transmitted by the glass = in? 0. If the lights be of the same colour, the bounding
diameter disappears completely and the process is comparatively easy ; but if there be
any notable difference of tint, it is much less satisfactory. In such cases I found, as
FRAUNHOFER had done long since, that one must make this diameter as faint as possible
â€”a fact which implies that the two beams, whether equal in intensity or not, make
nearly the same impression on the eye.

I must add that within the last few months my eyes have ceased to be fit for 8uch
delicate work, and that most of these comparisons have been made under my inspection
by my As8istant, Mr. CuarLEs Fas, and occasionally by Mr. Howarp GRUBB, both
practised and good obseryers.

In examining object-glasses, they were placed in contact with the emeried disk of the
photometer, 80 that no correction is required for any convergence of the light due to
them. The results for them are given in the following Table I.
