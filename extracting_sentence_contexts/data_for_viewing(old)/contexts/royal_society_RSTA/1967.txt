(a) Linear analysis and relevance to turbulent flows

The buckling instability occurs when the fibre, initially in a straight configuration 0;X =p,
experiences a strong compression by the flow. This is likely to happen when the flow locally
displays a violent shear, so that the rodlike fibre is like a Jeffery orbit [35]: in that case, the rod
rotates and is not aligned with the flow. During such event, the fibre alternatively experience
stretching and compression along its main axis, giving it the opportunity to buckle. Performing a
linear stability analysis for such orbits is however complex. Indeed, upon buckling, the initially
straight fibre picks a specific trajectory among an infinite family. The selected trajectory depends
on the initial perturbation and is very sensitive to fine sub-leading details, such as thermal
noise [36], fibre or fluid inertia [37,38], or, as in our turbulent settings, the fact that the flow is
not a pure shear.

As we will see in the sequel, a simplified linear stability analysis already fairly describes
buckling events, meaning that we can avoid delving into the complicated context of Jeffery orbits.
Let us consider that the fibre experiences a time-constant compression 7 = p'A p <0 along its
direction. The base solution p(t) describes a rod-like solution to the slender body equation (2.1).
We introduce a perturbed solution as X(s, t) = X(t) +sp(t) + x(s,t), where X(t) is the average
position of the fibre centre of mass and the perturbation x is of small amplitude (i.e. |x| « £).
For buckling, we are interested in perturbations that grow perpendicularly to the fibre direction.
The two transverse components of x are decoupled and evolve as (e.g. [18])
