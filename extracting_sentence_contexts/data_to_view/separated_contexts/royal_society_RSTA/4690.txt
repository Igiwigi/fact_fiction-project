Their two-dimensional counterparts, i.e. bimode metamaterials, have also been
discussed theoretically [56]. To obtain complete dynamic control on the remaining longitudinal elastic waves, however,
one must not only tailor the bulk modulus B but also the mass density p [41] to thereby tailor
the phase velocity c= /B/p and the impedance Z = /Bp independently—ust like in acoustics. Our approach [57] starts from the fact that the effective pentamode metamaterial bulk modulus
is mainly determined by the diameter at the thin ends of the double cones, whereas the diameter
at the thick middle part barely enters (for reasonable parameter choices). This is related to the
observation that the stress is concentrated to the thin ends (not depicted; see [57]). One can
