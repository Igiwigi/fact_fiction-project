258 DR. HERMANN KOPP ON THE RELATION BETWEEN BOILING-POINT

and that the isomeric compound ethers differed from one another in their boiling-points. An extensive series of boiling-point determinations* which I made of these isomeric
ethers, proved that the latter assumption is not founded on facts. The exertions made by
ScnroDeR, GERHARDT, Low and others, in the hope of recognizing the influence of the
constituent elements on the boiling-point of a compound, have also essentially remained
without result f. In France the existence of the relations between composition and boiling-point which
I had observed, has been contested by I.
