The shadows on the distant Bietschhorn were black, and
She snow-capped summits stood out with almost undimmed whiteness. At Thebes, in
Egypt, where I was for three months in 1874-75, I often remarked upon the depth of
Shadows of the rocks of the Lybian range, distant some three miles from my station ;
“ut the shadows in the Oberland Alps, lying some twenty miles ur more away, were
n this occasion even darker, showing that the haze caused by dust, which is always
nore or less prevalent in Egypt, was almost absent. The presumable absence of
Svater particles as well as of dust on my days of observation at the Riffel made the
‘Eutmosphere clearer than it was in Egypt even under the most favourable conditions,
Al am not stating this only from recollection, but I have records of the fact in photo-
graphs which I took at the time at both places. This state of the atmosphere lasted,
as I have said, till the afternoon, when a battle for supremacy was waged between the
north wind and the wind coming over from the Italian side of the range. The sky
then became more or less hazy, and the observations of sunlight were discontinued.
