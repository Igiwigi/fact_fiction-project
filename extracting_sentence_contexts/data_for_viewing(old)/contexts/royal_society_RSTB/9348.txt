cell membrane and were dependent upon the entry of extra-
cellular Ca?*: thus, they were caused by exocytosis. This
spontaneous release was triggered by the action potentials
that DA cells generate in a rhythmic fashion upon removal of
all synaptic influences. Thus, extrasynaptic dopamine release
by DA cells was controlled by their pacemaker activity.


GABA release. Further experiments supported the conclusion
that upon GABA exocytosis, the transmitter diffused from the
site of release into the surrounding solution and activated
nearby native GABA, receptor channels randomly distributed
over the plasma membrane of the DA cell. In fact: (i) DA cell
perikarya contain organelles stained by antibodies to GABA
[22], GAD [45-47], synaptobrevin 2 (VAMP2 [26]) and VGAT
[48]. (ii) Examination of the surface of isolated DA cells by
confocal microscopy, after staining with antibodies to both
synapsin and gephyrin, ruled out the possibility that GABA-
ergic endings presynaptic to DA cell bodies had survived
the procedure of retinal dissociation. (iii) The frequency of the
GABAergic currents depended on the concentration of intra-
cellular free Ca* in the patch pipette and increased upon
membrane depolarization.

The release was extrasynaptic because presynaptic active
