This group is combined with the Anomo-
dontia into an order named Theromorpha. Few of the American fossils have been
figured, so that their exact relation to the Anomodontia is not easily determined ;
but, in so far as I can judge from the description, few of the characters relied upon to
differentiate them sustain the author’s estimate of their importance in classification,
while their affinity to the Anomodontia is so close that I can realize no obstacle to
grouping the Pelycosauria as a sub-order of Anomodonts. I base this conclusion on
the following facts :—

(1) Professor Cops defines the Pelycosaurian scapular arch as consisting of scapula,
coracoid, and epi-coracoid, blended like an os innominatum. But Sir R. Owen, in
1876, in his ‘South African Catalogue,’ Plate 69, figs. 5, 6, figured a South African
specimen which shows this condition, and he regarded the fossil as Dicynodont.
