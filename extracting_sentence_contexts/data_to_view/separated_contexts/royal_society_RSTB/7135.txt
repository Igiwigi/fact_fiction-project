The position of the posterior opening,
however, and its relations to the 10th nerve and posterior semicircular canal are so similar
in the two genera that there can be little doubt that the structure exists in Dapedius. The
anterior opening presumably lies in the large unexcavated hollow above the external
semicircular canal; it appears to be much larger than the corresponding opening in Caturus,
while the vertical pillar separating the lateral cranial canal from the utriculus is decidedly
narrower. The result is that the canal is much more part of the cranial cavity in this genus—
a fact which rather increases the difficulty of assigning to it any of those functions, suggested

from comparison with living fishes or Palaeoniscoids, which were discussed when dealing
with Caturus. The position of the anterior semicircular canal can only be deduced from its entrances
to the cranial cavity; it seems to have been rather longer than the posterior canal. The
ampullary chamber is very large, and less clearly separated from the cranial cavity than
that of Caturus, nor is there any impression to show whether the ampulla of the external
canal was particularly enlarged.
