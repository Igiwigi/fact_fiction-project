Key features of this community are that it is species found significant impacts on colony- [46,50-52] and popu-
rich, taxonomically rich (meaning that it encompasses para- lation-level health [50], but how these translate into real
sites from viruses to trypanosomes to nematode worms to impacts in the field remains unknown, apart from the case
parasitoids and cuckoo bees) and largely made up of general- of cuckoo bees described above. However, given the preva-
ist parasites that can infect multiple host species [9,36]. In fact, lence of parasites such as C. bombi [47,53-59] and S. bombi
recent work has shown that at least some of these parasites [48] that are known to have dramatic impacts on host species
have an even broader host range, being capable of infecting [47,48,50], it seems likely that they are having at least some

solitary bees (e.g. [37,38]). As such, this parasite community impact on their host populations in the wild. Along with their potential role in structuring pollinator has to be balanced against the need to provide this complex | 4 |
