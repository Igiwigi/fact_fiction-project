These sets have dimensions D(h), which define the so-called ‘spectrum of
singularities’ related to the exponents ¢p by the Legendre transform [2,4-6]. In fully developed
turbulence, D(/1) is a bell-shaped function centred slightly above 1/3, which implies the presence
of entangled scaling symmetries; see figure 1. The fact that the local structure of turbulent fluctuations entails the local rather than global
form of scaling is an idea at the core of many heuristic models of intermittency. The lognormal
