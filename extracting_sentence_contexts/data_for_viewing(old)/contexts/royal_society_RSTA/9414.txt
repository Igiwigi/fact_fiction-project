at whatever epoch this middle point may be. Hence the value of (@»—0,)/(@»—9,)
should, on this hypothesis, be 2/7 also; in the present case, if the mean results from

Tables III. and IV. be taken, its value is Jess than 2/x—Broun’s value of 0p»—0,
would satisfy the relation more exactly. Without much more accurate data,
however, it would be very unwise to conclude definitely that the phase angle does
not vary harmonically throughout the lunation.

According to the theory of the lunar magnetic variations which was outlined in the
Introduction to this paper, they are primarily due to a lunar atmospheric tide, which
produces the electric currents responsible for the magnetic variations. It is a
question of ascertainable fact whether or not the changes in phase angle (with
change of lunar distance) which are found in the lunar magnetic variations are
already present in the lunar atmospheric tide, as revealed by the barometric records.
The computations necessary to determine this point have not, however, yet been
made, and therefore in the present discussion it is advisable to consider what
information in the matter may be derived from general theory.

In the case of the atmospheric tides, the tidal theory appropriate to a uniform
ocean is presumably applicable. A change of phase in the tide appears possible only
if frictional forces are acting, and these would produce a retardation of phase, the
magnitude of which depends only on the period and not on the amplitude of the
tidal oscillation. In the case of the lunar atmospheric tide it is chiefly the amplitude
which alters (over a total range of 40 per cent.), while the period changes only by
