In both the liquid air and liquid hydrogen researches
the materials which showed a reduction in tenacity had all very small elongations, and
one or two also had this even at ordinary temperature. On the other hand, in four
materials (Nos. 1240/1, 12911, 1379B, and 1166A/4) out of six, where the tenacity has,
on the contrary, continued to increase progressively between — 182° and — 252-8°, the
ductility at the lower of these temperatures is also less than 1%. One of the specimens
1166A/4, in fact, shows the greatest relative increase in tenacity in the present series,
from 21-4 tons per square inch to 69-2 tons; that is, more than trebled. Although, therefore, increasing brittleness, no doubt, has an important effect in
tending to prevent any further increase in tenacity after the temperature of liquid air
is reached, this is not an entirely satisfactory explanation, which remains to be sought. Owing to this failure of liquid hydrogen temperature to further increase in general
the tenacity, especially high tenacity figures are not a feature of the results.
