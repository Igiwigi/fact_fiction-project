BY REFLEXION FROM METALLIC SURFACES. 271

4. In these cases the metallic reflexion performs the part of the first rhomb in
FresxEL's experiment with two. If I rightly interpret Sir D. BrewsreR's process
for a similar restoration, before referred to, and if the two metal plates are analogous
to the two rhombs, in the change of plane, which he 80 accurately determined, after
the second reflexion, at the maximum incidence, we may infer a correspondence with
that produced in the rhomb; and that it is equal to twice the azimuth of the rhomb.
And in fact I find the results from two such different methods agree very closely for
all the pure metals; though for certain ores, very low in the scale, there are some
discrepancies.

There is also a close agreement between these results and the azimuths of the
plane of the ray restored to plane polarization by the action of a crystallized plate,
as given by the same author for some of the principal metals*, which confirms the
same inference.

5. The changes of plane for successive incidences are in general of a nature analo-
gous to those in the reflexion from transparent bodies, but not the same.

At the incidence for the maximum, if the plane of the polarizer be first adjusted
