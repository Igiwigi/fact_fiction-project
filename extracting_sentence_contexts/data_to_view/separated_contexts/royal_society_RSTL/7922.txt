FALCONER, * the function
is to be deduced with such facile certainty from the mere form, the premolar of
Hypsiprymnus ought also to be carnivorous. But we know that the genus is 80 strictly
herbivorous that the family to which it belongs has been- regarded as representing in
the Marsupialia the Ruminants of the placental Mammals. With this fact before us,
is it likely that the premolars of Plagiaulaz and Thylacoleo © were applied to cut and
divide flesh'?”

To this I reply ; consider the difference of the molar teeth following the trenchant
one in Plagiaulas and Hypsiprymmus respectively, and the true solution will be given}.

$ 14. Interrupted and continuous applications of Teeth.—The deduction of the
carnivorous nature of the extinct Marsupials in question was drawn not from shape
merely, but from correlation of teeth. The © arbitrariness,” if sach quality be predi-
cable of the conclusion, is applicable to the guiding principle, not to the palzontologist
confiding therein.
