eases, being impregnated by the various fluids circulating in the system#.

From the preceding observations by myself, and from those made by the physiolo-
gists whose writings I have quoted, I think it is established, as a general law in
Animal Physiology, that certain tissues are capable of being nourished without the
presence of blood-vessels within them : it has been shown that all these tissnes are
surrounded by large blood-vessels, which appear to have no other function than of
supplying to them a nutrient fluid ; and the way in which this nutrient fluid is con-
veyed into the substance of these tissues bas been also pointed out.

* Recent investigators have thrown 80 much light upon the structure and the mode of growth of the Zpi-

dermoid Class of non-vascular tissues, that (as is apparent) I have added but few new facts in this department
of my researches,
