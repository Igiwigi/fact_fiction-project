ving the eclipses at the telescope. If the semi-transparent plate is inserted in
holder, these eclipses occur in pairs, with shadows moving oppositely ; if not, they
rsingly. (A very narrow strip passed not quite close to the mirror may show
h single shadow double. Too broad a strip will, of course, merge a pair of shadows
one. )

ee times round naturally gives two pair of eclipses on the front mirror, and
€ pair on each of the others.

Vithout the cover-glasses the light can be got many times round, but, when they
on, the faintness of the light which gets through all the surfaces makes it unwise
im at more excursions, because the definition and visibility of the bands suffers in
le proportion. In fact, the superior sharpness of the twice-round bands perhaps
® than compensates for the advantage of the half-as-long-again path belonging to
three-times-round set.

€ cover-glasses are, of course, not set absolutely vertical, else the enormous
iber of reflexions from their surfaces would confuse everything.

hother way of testing the order of the image in use is to tilt the front mirror so
© broaden the bands by a measured amount, and then to imitate or compensate
y tilting one of the other mirrors. The angle of tilt necessary with one of these
be n/(n + 1) of the tilt of the front one.
