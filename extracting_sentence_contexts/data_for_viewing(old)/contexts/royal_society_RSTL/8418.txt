MR. ROBERT MALLET ON VOLCANIC ENERGY. 153

'This other cause, which occupies pages 52 and 53, is simply another hypothesis, that
if the presxure of the superincumbent dome oyer the liquid lake be removed, partially
or wholly, by its becoming a self-supporting dome or arch, then the relief from-pressure
thus arising must lower the fusing-point, of the liquid material of the lake, and 80 keep
it longer liquid.

18. There is nothing absolutely in any of the known facts as to the materials of our
earth's crust to warrant our supposing isolated masses therein of far greater fusibility than
the remainder, to say nothing of that material being ex necessitate penetrated by water
from the surface, to which it is admittedly near ; for without the water we can have no
volcano. Other serious difficulties occur as we attempt to follow out this notion by a

Q comparison with observed facts of yolcanic action at the vents, for which space cannot
© here be afforded. We pass on to some remarks on the theories of eleyation.
S 19. The words *elevation,” © upheaval,” © Aushebung,” © soultvement” have been
E- continually employed by the geologists of all countries, but especially of our own, in
= the loosest way, 80 far as the forming of any definite conception of the play of forces
> or mechanism of the movements is concerned.
S A wide survey of the writings of geologists proves, however, that the notion generally
