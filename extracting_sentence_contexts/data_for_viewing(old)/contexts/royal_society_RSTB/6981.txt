It will be appreciated, then, from the foregoing account, that the innervation of the
rostrum and its associated structures is considerably more complex than is indicated by
Murray & Tiegs. It is not claimed, however, that the present account is in any way
complete; my preparations show great numbers of fine nerve strands which have not been
followed out in detail.

The dorsal pair of tracheal branches (figures 7, 9, 12 and 13, ¢r.) of the rostrum has
already been adequately mentioned in describing the course of the frontal ganglion con-
nectives. In addition, however, a second pair of tracheae lies with the ventral nerve to the
mouth-parts in the median space between the supporting apodemes of the rostral tendons
(figure 8G, H, I). Both these pairs of tracheae give off numerous branches, some of
which, on account of their size and the fact that they continue parallel with their parent
trunk, suggest when seen only in transverse section that more than two pairs of tracheae
pass down the rostrum. The tracheae, not only of the rostrum but of the body generally,
are characterized by the possession of fine hair-like processes projecting from the taenidia
into the lumen (see Wigglesworth 1939, p. 182).

The dorsal and ventral tracheae of the rostrum are figured by Murray & Tiegs (1935,
text-fig. 10).

The coiled ‘salivary’ glands of Calandra are closely applied to the lateral surfaces of the
crop (p. 280), and their ducts pass forward lateral to the brain to enter the rostrum. As
already mentioned in describing the stomatogastric nervous system they lie lateral to the
pharynx in company with the labral nerves, and diverge anteriorly from these nerves as
