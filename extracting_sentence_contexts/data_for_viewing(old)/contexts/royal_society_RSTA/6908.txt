INVARIANTS OF THE MATRIX PENCIL

22. There is an invariant theory associated with the collineations (ijkl) of §8. I here
state the main results without proof (‘Turnbull 1942). The 24 collineations belong to
three pairs of matrices §8 (1) and three characteristic equations each of order k. If a is
a root of one such equation, then 1 —a and a/(a—1) are respectively the roots of the
other two.

If Xk —X,GF-1 4... +(—)*¥X, = 0,

is one of these equations, its coefficients Y, are rational integral invariants of the four

medials A, B, C, D. In fact X, = ¥(—)/4,, where A, denotes the 4k-rowed determinant
| A, BC: ;

CDA;

and the sum extends to all the determinantal permutations of A — AA; (i+j =k),

that is to (‘) terms. Each of A, B, C, D has k columns. Exactly k—2 of the X, are irre-

ducible, and X, = (BC) (DA), X,, = (AB) (CD).

On permuting A, B, C, D in all possible ways in 4, two further sets Y, and Z, alone are
found, accounting for the two further characteristic equations. On writing
