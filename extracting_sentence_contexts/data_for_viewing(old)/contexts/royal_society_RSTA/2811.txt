seen in the 3.8Ga Isua greenstone belt in Greenland [162,163], the variably dated 4.4-3.8Ga
Nuvvuagittuq supracrustal belt in Canada (e.g. [164]), the ~ 3.6Ga Acasta Gneiss Complex in
Canada [165], in Australia at ~ 3.2 Ga (e.g. [137]) and in South Africa at * 3.5 Ga (e.g. [166]); see
also Moyen & Martin [167]. Thus, early Earth tectonics likely featured at least spatially limited,
transient episodes of subduction.

A stagnant lid with short-lived episodic bursts of subduction has often been invoked to
explain the above observations from the Hadean and Archean geologic record (e.g. [168-172]).
However, a sluggish lid, where subduction occurs more frequently and on a locally confined scale
as compared to the short-lived, global subduction and resurfacing events seen during episodic
overturns, may also be able to explain early Earth geology. A sluggish lid, featuring subduction
and lithospheric mobility, can explain long-term preservation of early-formed mantle chemical
heterogeneity, as a sluggish lid also results in slow mixing [118]. In fact, even plate-tectonic
style convection throughout the Hadean and Archean can allow early formed heterogeneity to
survive when variations in lower mantle mineralogy are taken into account, as high viscosity,
silica-rich regions that are resistant to mixing tend to form in the cores of convection cells [173].
Paleomagnetic reconstructions of super-continent cycles show a trend of gradually increasing


plate speeds over time, rather than the decreasing trend one would expect from models based on
the classic mantle convection scaling laws discussed in ยง3c [174]. Such a trend is also consistent
with predictions from grain damage models that explicitly include the effect of higher mantle
temperatures on lithospheric grain growth rates [104], an effect which is not included in the
convection models shown in this study (see ยง3c).
