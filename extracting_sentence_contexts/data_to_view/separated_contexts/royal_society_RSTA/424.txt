As a rule the stress-distribution will be found to alter both within the enclaves and—to
a less but perceptible extent—in the still elastic material which adjoins them. On that
account the planes of maximum shear-stress will change direction as the enclaves extend, and
for this reason the load must be increased by steps; but in fact the directions are found to

_ alter slowly, so the steps may be fairly large. Continuity at a plastic-elastic interface

12. At this point it is necessary to consider whether any component displacement, strain
or stress can be discontinuous at an interface; for the argument used in the theory of elasticity,
that discontinuous displacement would entail an infinite strain and therefore stress, plainly

is no longer applicable when (§2) an infinite strain can consist with finite stress.
