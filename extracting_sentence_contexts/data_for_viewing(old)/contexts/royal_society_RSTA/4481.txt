disentangling but non-unitary. The measurement channels are non-unitary because they involve
the trace operation that cannot be represented by a unitary operator. The realistic measurement


procedure is more complicated than the von Neumann-Liiders scheme and, generally, cannot be
reduced to the latter even if the involved intervals of time are rather short.

3. Joint quantum probability
(a) Channel-state duality

As is explained in ยง2f, the von Neumann-Liiders scheme does not provide a general definition
of conditional quantum probabilities and therefore does not lead to correct joint quantum
probabilities. This is due to the fact that a realistic measurement procedure requires the five-
step convolution channels described in the previous section. This multichannel measurement
procedure looks quite complicated. Fortunately, there exists the Choi-Jamiolkowski [31,32]
isomorphism establishing the channel-state duality

C <> {6aB, Has}, (3.1)
with a state 6,48 defined on the Hilbert space
Hap =Ha &) He. (3.2)

Thus, instead of dealing with the channel convolution, we can equivalently consider the
composite state characterized by the space of microstates (3.2).
