17. When the experimenter was standing on the ground, and consequently, as has
been already explained, in actual, although imperfect connection, with the battery, he
could draw sparks from either terminal. We shall, in the sequel, be enabled to trace,
with more precision, the rise of this tension ; for the present, we are only concerned
in establishing its existence, and thereby proving the first fact, that fension or electro-
static effects precede, and are independent of, the completion of the voltaic circuit. 18. Hitherto we have not obtained any insight into the condition of the dynamic
effects under such circumstances of antecedent tension.
