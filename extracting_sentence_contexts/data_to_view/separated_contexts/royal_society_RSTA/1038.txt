In the presence of ECM proteins anchored to the inner walls of the capsule, cells
proliferate, readily spread onto it and self-assemble into a closed spherical epithelium. This set
up gives a new opportunity to investigate epithelial growth with a prescribed curvature and
with variable parameters. The fact that one can vary the parameters, such as the stiffness of the
artificial ECM by tuning the composition of the hydrogel, is a unique opportunity for testing
specific aspects of the theory. Indeed, morphogenesis is a complex highly regulated sequences
of processes with a few degrees of freedom including the use of mutants. Using in vitro cysts


allows one to dissect the different potential morphogenetic events and to investigate the impact
of geometrical and morphological control parameters.
