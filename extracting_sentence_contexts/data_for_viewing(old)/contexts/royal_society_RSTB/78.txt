observed that the Chelonia possessing these pouches are more characterised by a
peculiar odour than the pouchless forms.‚Äù They frequently yield a yellowish
grumous substance, most especially abundant in those forms which have these
bladders provided with villi (Platysternum). This comparison is erroneous, as
already Duvernoy has pointed out; the pouches are certainly not glands, and are
developed from the middle portion of the cloaca, whilst the organs of the Crocodiles
are skin glands, like those on the throat.

It has been known, since Townson, that some Chelonia draw water into the cloaca
per anum. He put an Emys into coloured water, and observed that, when put after-
wards into clear water, it vented coloured water. He concluded from this that water was
pumped into the anal pouches, and that the latter served for hydrostatic purposes.
This view has been generally accepted, and is strengthened by the fact that neither
the true terrestrial Tortoises nor the marine Turtles with their specialised flippers
possess such additional hydrostatic organs.

It was, however, apparently never ascertained if the pouches, and not only the
cloaca, were filled with water. Anprrson, with his great experience of Tortoises,
remarks expressly that, although he had examined, immediately after death, nearly a
hundred individuals of South Asiatic Emydes, yet in no instance had the cloacal
