(see p. 196),’where the liquid was
pure glycerine. The effect of the viscous drag is, in fact, most marked in the most

viscous liquid. Influence of the Constants of the Liquid. Finally, in confirmation of the general argument, we have the fact that with a
liquid of small density and surface tension, such as Alexandra oil, a much smaller
velocity of impact with a highly polished sphere is required to give “rough” splash
than with water, a liquid of greater density and surface tension, the reason being
without doubt that the tangential velocity due to the impact is greater with the less
dense liquid, as, indeed, is proved to be the case by the greater height to which the
surrounding sheath is thrown up, and the smaller the surface tension the less will he
the abatement of velocity on account of work done in extending the surface.
