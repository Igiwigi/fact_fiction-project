When speaking about left B, e.g., it means left hemisphere of baby B.

In the next paragraphs, 6 and 6!, the description of the left hemispheres is given
on the pages to the left, viz., 46, 48, 50, 52; the description of the right hemispheres
on the pages to the right, viz., 47, 49, 51, 53; thus enabling at once a comparison of
the left conditions with those of the right.

Attention therefore is particularly drawn to the fact that the text of page 46
continues on page 48, and so on.
