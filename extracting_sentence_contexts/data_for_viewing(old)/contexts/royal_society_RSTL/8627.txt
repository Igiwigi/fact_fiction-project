direction from north by west, through north, north-east, and east to east-south-east ; and
the change from the summer to the winter monsoon is retrograde, and consists in a
gradual strengthening of the northerly current till the latter attains its extreme direc-
tion from north by west in January.

At Mooltan the wind-system is again different. Here south-west is the predominant,
quarter, to the extent of 29 per cent. on the average of the year; north-west stands
next in importance, and due east and west winds amount to only 2 and 3 per cent.

x respectively, It is possible that the low proportion of west winds may be due to some
© local obstacle, influencing the currents that act on the wind-yane and diverting them
2 either to north or south of their primitive direction. But eyen if we admit that a por-
= tion of the north-west and south-west winds are possibly diverted west winds, the fact
remains, that at, this station winds from the southerly quarters are equally numerous
© with those from northern directions, which is not the case at any other of the Punjab
2 stations here noticed, The predominance of westerly over easterly winds, on the other
2 hand, is a condition which also obtains at Rawul Pindee and Lahore, though not at
£ Dera Ishmail Khan. With respect to the annual change of mean direction, the Table
ie shows considerable irregularities, which may be due in part to the cause above suggested,
and in part to the inequality of the periods from which the data for the several months
-2 have been obtained. In January the resultant appears to be decidedly north-north-
3 west; in February and Mareh less decidedly north by east and north by west; and the
> wind then appears to back through north-west and west to south-west by south, which
= is its prevailing mean direction during the summer monsoon, and is most decided in
5 September. In the latter months of the year the direction of the change seems to be
