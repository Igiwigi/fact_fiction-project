In 1883 Maccuratr made observations on Lonicera chinensis, which Wiesner (5)
describes in the following words: “Here a remarkable case occurs, namely, that,
independent of external circumstances, the first internodes increase in length, then
decrease, and once more increase, until near the end of the shoot is another decrease
in the internodes.” The probable explanation of this case will be given in the
sequel.

Finally, what may be regarded as the view commonly held may be gleaned from a
quotation from the new edition of Prrrrer’s ‘Physiology of Plants’ (6): “The
leaves and internodes on every shoot increase in size from below upwards. . . . . "i

Stress must be laid on the fact that, when the statements given above are true,
they concern solely the shoot produced during one vegetative season. On such a
shoot it is very common to find that the successive internodes wax and wane in
length from below upwards, but, as I shall prove hereafter, this is far from being
universal, indeed, many branched herbs provide exceptions.

Only few explanations of this increase and decrease of internode-length have so far
been put forward, Hates correlated the increase with increased vigour of nutrition,
associated with enlarged leaves and rise in temperature, and he attributed the final
decrease to rapid hardening of the tissues in the dry, hot summer and to cool
autumn nights. Other botanists, too, have ascribed the preliminary increase to
rise in temperature in spring, and the final decrease to fall of temperature in autumn,
or to deficient supply of water to the growing-points.
