The funda-
mental forces that shaped human brain network topology at
evolutionary time scales remain poorly understood, and only
few computational studies explored the role of factors including
energetic costs, communication efficiency and dynamic com-
plexity [4]. A similar dearth plagues our current knowledge
of functional activity at faster time scales [42,43,153,154]. Characterizing stylized facts, i.e. structural characteristics
that would hold for a diverse collection of instruments, exper- 5. Conclusion
imental conditions and time scales, may ultimately enable
modelling observed time series for a range of scales, and
for instance predicting the next steps for a given sequence
of data. This in turn may supplement existing comparative
statics approaches to the appraisal of the functional potential
of brain systems for future learning [22], prior to or following
brain damage.

inate in a well-identified and circumscribed brain region, its =
consequences affect the functioning of various circuits, and

its surgical control via implanted stimulators could target a
global network dynamics rather than a unique well-localized
brain region.
