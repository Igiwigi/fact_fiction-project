Classification can be performed using a variety of sources, mostly the spectral information (the
observed value in each pixel), spatial or contextual information and ancillary data (ground truth,
for instance). The latter is usually available only in very restricted areas, from which training
samples can be obtained.

The simplest available classification techniques rely only on pixel-wise information, i.e. on
the observation in each coordinate: isodata, parallelepiped and pointwise maximum-likelihood
(ML) are examples of these methods. Arguably, the most successful techniques exploit both the
spectral information and the context. This is mostly due to the fact that images exhibit a great deal
of spatial redundancy, i.e. spatially neighbouring pixels tend to be alike.

As an example of contextual classification one should mention techniques based on Markovian
models. Geman & Geman [1] posed the classification process as an estimation problem and, as
such, proposed a number of estimators and algorithms. These techniques rely on variations of
the following idea: the class m in each coordinate should satisfy a criterion that, simultaneously, : =
optimizes the pointwise spectral evidence and a contextual measure of smoothness, for example 3
