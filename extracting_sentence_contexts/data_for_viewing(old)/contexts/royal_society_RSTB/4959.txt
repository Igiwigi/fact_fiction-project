The same is true of the Anglo-Saxon residents. Those whose faces normally have
little colour do not show much that is distinctive, but anyone whose complexion
borders upon the rubicund has a distinctly cyanosed appearance. In one case we had
the opportunity of comparing the complexion of such a subject at Cerro and at
Lima, where the blue tinge at once disappeared, and his face presented a fresh and
healthy appearance. In our own cases—a fact observed by most previous workers
was apparent, namely, that the cyanosis, which at first was very marked in our
faces, and especially in our nails, became reduced in degree. On arrival at Oroya,
for instance, our nails were much more cyanosed than those of the residents with
whom we compared them, In a day or two this difference had practically dis-
appeared, and we acquired the same colour as the Anglo-Saxon of longer residence in
the mountains. In our case the cyanosis which takes place on first reaching a high
altitude could not be attributed to cold, as has been done elsewhere, for the houses
were heated, as was the car in which we travelled. It must be clearly stated that
neither we nor anyone else were the same colour as at the sea-level. We became
accustomed to the altered aspect of mankind and ceased to notice it, but half-a-
minute’s respiration of oxygen at any time altered the colour either of ourselves, our
fellow Anglo-Saxons, or the members of the indigenous population to whom the gas
