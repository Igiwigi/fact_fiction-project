But if we do not insist on the vanescence of gamic pairs, and on an autopolar result,
we can reduce the 8-edron readily to the 7-edral pyramid, by the evanescence of 3, 4,364,
which makes the face 4;,, and then the convanescence of 3g4,6,4; ; but the first of
these two steps gives a heteropolar result. Generally apy a-edron that has at most a
Ãž-ace or a p-gon can be reduced by single vanescences to the (p+1)-edral pyramid. R

In the second of the aboye three 8-edra, the first pair, though at first sight it appears
a vanescible pair, is not 0. For putting s, and F, for the summit and face signed 2, we
5ee in the eighth and second pairs, or the nodal pairs, $ in f;, and s, in f;, 8, in fa, and
% inf,, Ifnow 314,44; evanesces, we have f,=f,, whence, s, is in f, through 8, and s,
in f, through s,, 80 that 3,4,444; is no longer convanescible, f; and , through s, and s,
being covertical, and in fact collateral faces.

Hence the only vanescible pairs are the second and third. As they stand, the summits
read thus with their signatures,

31424z4445363738-
The vanescence of the third pair gives us the reading
31591353,465635
and now the fourth pair has become the only vanescible one, giving the reading
