Other applications of 4
cellulose nanofibres, such as thermoelectric materials, are covered in the paper by Tammelin (VTT : =
Technical Research Centre of Finland) [17]. The subject of composite materials is further explored : 3
by Gindl (BOKU University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences) [18], where it is shown (8

that retaining some of the lignin component of the plant fibre structure assists in the interfacial
interactions with other polymers. This, and the fact that hierarchical and architectural diversity
are important (Bismarck, University of Vienna/Imperial College) [19] for composite materials, is
not surprising because we know they are critical in the function of the original plant material. We
would do well to remember that these are originally biological materials, and our exploitation of
them may be more successful if we learn from Natureâ€™s approach to their use. So, returning to the natural world, and the place and context of cellulose nanofibres and their
industrial exploitation, we should consider these in a mounting concern over global warming.
