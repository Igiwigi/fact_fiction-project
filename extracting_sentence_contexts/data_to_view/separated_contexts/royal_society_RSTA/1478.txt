These limitations of ISM could perhaps be addressed by the use of Bessel beam illumination
(but at the expense of some 3D imaging performance) [70], combined with radially polarized
illumination to decrease the cross-polarization in the focal region, and by multifocal illumination


[57]. The main advantage of ISM over SIM is the optical sectioning property, which allows ISM to
penetrate better through thick specimens. As Gustafsson says about SIM [48]:

‘It is, however, possible to achieve lateral resolution well beyond the classical limit without
discarding any emission light, namely by using laterally structured illumination in a wide-field,
non-confocal microscope.’

The fact that no emission light is discarded results in a stronger signal, but it should be
appreciated that, the pinhole in a confocal microscope or the finite size of the detector array in
ISM, are the reason for the optical sectioning property, i.e. optical sectioning is achieved because
light is discarded. Data accessibility. This article has no additional data.
