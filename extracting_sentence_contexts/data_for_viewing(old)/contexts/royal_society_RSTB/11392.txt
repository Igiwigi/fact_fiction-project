(e.g. ‘make a slice’, ‘make a hole’).

2. Abstract concepts representation and
grounding

Different views have been proposed on the representation of
abstract concepts and words. According to traditional views
(e.g. [5]) both concrete and abstract concepts are represented
as abstract and a-modal symbols that are unrelated to the per-
ceptual states and actions that produce them. For example,
according to the Context Availability Theory [6], the different
processing involved for concrete and abstract concepts is due
to the fact that concrete words have stronger semantic
relations with a reduced number of contexts, while abstract
words have weak relations with a larger number of contexts.
Following the Dual Coding Theory [7], concrete concepts are
represented by activating a verbal and non-verbal system,
while abstract concepts are represented in a verbal system
only.

The embodied view (e.g. [8]), by contrast, argues that
concrete and abstract concepts are represented as modal sym-
bols grounded in perception and action (i.e. sensorimotor
knowledge). Within the embodied view, theories based on
‘simulations’ [8], ‘metaphors’ [9] and ‘actions’ [10,11]
