Ni the relative amount of the magnetically
hard material, at —186° C., has so far increased that the initial fall of permeability
during heating has’ practically disappeared. The decrease of permeability of the soft material during rise of temperature is
almost exactly counterbalanced by the corresponding increase of that of the hard
material, 3

Thus over a considerable range of temperature we have a material of practically
constant magnetic properties. We have, in fact, a magnetic analogue of the alloy of
practically negligible thermal coefficient discovered by GUILLAUME. The 26°7 per cent. Ni alloy isa magnetic invar.
