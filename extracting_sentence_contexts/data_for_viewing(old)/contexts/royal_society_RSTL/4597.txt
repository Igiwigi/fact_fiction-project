traction always takes place, which contraction is excited not only in the muscle di-
rectly traversed by the current, but also in the inferior muscles of the leg and in the
foot.

When the electric current traverses the muscular mass in the contrary direction
to that of the ramification of the nerves, the animal utters loud cries, and gives other
indications of suffering severe pain, accompanied by contractions much less violent
than in the preceding case, and which never extend beyond the muscles traversed by
the current.

If we were to satisfy ourselves with seeing these experiments once only, or were to
confine ourselves to a few trials only, we might easily be led to form an erroneous
conclusion ; in fact, at the beginning of the experiment, particularly if a somewhat
powerful current be employed, there are both cries of pain and contractions, at the
same time; but this soon ceases, particularly if we know how to regulate duly
the strength of the current. "The constant effects which distinguish the action of the
electric current, according to its direction, in the muscles of living animals, are those
which I have indicated, namely, pain, when the electric current is what is commonly
called inverse,â€”contraction, when the current is direct.

Now, setting aside all hypothesis, there can be but one way of explaining these phe-
nomena : when there is a contraction, there must necessarily be a current of nervous
force propagated from the brain towards the extremities of the nerves: when there

is a sensation of pain, this current must be impelled in a contrary direction, that is,
