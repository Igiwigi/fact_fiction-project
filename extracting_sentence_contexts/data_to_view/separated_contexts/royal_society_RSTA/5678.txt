(b) Modelling reliability :g

In general, the hemodynamic results of modelling in the coronary stream bed are in qualitative S
agreement with modern concepts of the blood supply to the heart. The most convincing facts

in this regard reflect the data on the volume blood flow rate in the arteries after myocardial
revascularization (figure 9). The panels illustrated in this figure demonstrate that the maximum
velocities in all the considered areas of the left coronary artery (In, Out1, Out2) are associated with

the diastolic part of the cardiac cycle, that is, after the closure of the aortic valve. On the contrary,

the minimum velocities occur at the beginning of the left ventricular systole, ie. immediately after
excitation of the myocardium.
