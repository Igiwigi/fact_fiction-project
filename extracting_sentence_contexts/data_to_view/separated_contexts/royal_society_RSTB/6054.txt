Firstly, the fact that the unisoliutricular frog exhibits different degrees of the
asymmetry is to be correlated with the difficulty of obtaining regular or consistent
figures, when a merely blinded animal or one with two utricular macule
remaining is subjected to slow lateral tilt. Evidently the otolith of the unisoli-
* utricular frog may attain stability at different degrees of inclination of its underlying
macula. Secondly, the fact that the usual degree of spinal torque of the present is
less than that of an Ewatp frog is to be correlated with the presence of vertical
canals in the intact labyrinth of the latter animal. This inference may be experi-
mentally verified. After severance of the nerves to the cristae of its two untouched
vertical canals, an Ewan frog forthwith becomes, as far as posture goes, like the
unisoliutricular animal, its average degree of torque being no greater and no less.
