as flexibility and cross-lingual support.

In addition, just as in many other fields of natural language
processing (and indeed Al), the NLG field is currently moving
more and more towards data-driven techniques and sophisti-
cated machine learning methods. The challenge for social
robotics is to determine how to incorporate such methods
into the sort of interactions needed for a particular deployment
context.

For example, the current E2E (‘End-to-End’) NLG chal-
lenge [52] uses data drawn from a restaurant domain,
where the input consists of a series of facts about a restaurant.
Any system trained on this sort of data would perform well
in a context where the robot must convey similar facts to its
partner; however, in contexts such as a home companion
robot, the robot utterances might be very different. In general,
as with all data-intensive techniques, the issue is obtaining
sufficient training data. It is not likely that current data-
driven NLG techniques can solve all social robotics generation
tasks—although given the success of such techniques, it would
still be instructive to learn how far they could be pushed.

A recent workshop at the INLG 2018 conference [53]
brought together researchers from HRI and NLG to discuss
