model section. (d) Frequency down-conversion ratio (i) and input and output frequencies (ii) as a function of the mass ratio
between the defect and extended modes. These plots have been obtained by keeping the extended mode's mass constant and
modifying the defect’s mass. (e) Frequency down-conversion ratio (i) and input and output frequencies (ii) as a function of
the extended mode mass, while keeping the modal mass ratio mg/m, constant. (f) Conversion efficiency as a function of the
excitation frequency and amplitude, calculated with the experimentally determined extended mode damping (i) and with twice
the damping (ii). Points that are not coloured correspond to combinations of excitation frequency and amplitude for which the
system does not have a steady-state solution. In this figure, all parameters are identical to those in figure 3f unless otherwise
indicated. (Online version in colour.)


persists for a period of time that is much longer than any of the system’s time constants. This
can be observed from the fact that the phase difference between perturbed and unperturbed
systems does not change significantly if we wait an additional 1000s until t= 1790 s (figure 6c). In
the experimental system, this phase stability would be limited by the presence of external noise
sources and Brownian motion.

8. Frequency tunability

A remarkable feature of our frequency-converting system is the possibility of tuning the input and
output frequencies over a broad range, both during the design phase and dynamically once the
system has been built. Figure 6d,e theoretically explores the relationship between the input and
output frequencies and the modal masses. We first explore the effect of the mass ratio by altering

the mass of the defect mode without altering that of the extended mode (figure 6d). This results in : =
