black is generally firs formed in small specks, and if, owing to a gudden disturbance,
the film were thinned to below the maximum of surface tension, equilibrium would be
poxsible if the thickness were that corresponding to Q‚Äù. The parts of the film of
thickness intermediate to P' and Q' would shrink, and an apparent discontinuity

would be established.


ON THE THICKNESS AND SURFACE TENSTON OF LIQUID FILMS, 683

This 8upposition is als0 less satisfactory than the last, inasmuch as the equilibrium
would be nnstable. An accidental thinning below Q' would produce rupture. The
fact that this does not occur at once might be explained by supposing that the snrface
viscosity would play a more important part as the film became thinner,

We need hardly point out that the best way of attempting to test such theories
would be to measure the surface tension of a grey film. Unfortunately, however,
81ch a film can only be obtained when the electric current is passing, and the very
fact that the grey displays itself is a proof that changes in the snrface are going on
which may complicate the conclusions to be drawn from the experiment.

We have frequently tried to secure satisfactory observations of this kind, but have
not succeeded in obtaining any in which we could with certainty discriminate between
the possible effects of the renewal of the surface and a real change in surface tension
due to a change in the thickness. Experiments XX. to XXIIL are the only observa-
