of Gibraltar, and unloads its waters of their excess of alt.
But however plausible this theory may be, it must be con-
fessed, that scarcely any other argument has hitherto been
alledged in support of the probability of this under-current,
than the easy explanation it would afford of the phenomena,
and analogies derived from the familiar fact of opposite atmo-
spheric currents formed in confined places, from the mere
admission of air of a different temperature.* The following
fact, however, for which I am indebted to Dr. Macmicnarr,
who had it from very respectable authority (the British Consul
at Valentia), seems to give considerable support to the above
theory. Some years ago a vessel was lost at Ceuta, on the
Coast of Africa, and its wreck afterwards thrown up at
Tarifta, on the European shore, full two miles west of Ceuta.
How can this be explained, except by the action of what may
be called a counter-submarine current, which would carry a
body, sunk to a considerable depth, out of the Straits ?

It was a favourite scheme of the late Mr. TexnNaAxT, to
examine specimens of sea water from the Straits of Gibraltar,
taken both from the surface and from some great depth, in
