In the complete development of the disturbing function x—x* would occur wherever
the F's and G's occur, but never with the H's.

If we put y=1 in (284), we have
aW ,4W 27?

de Tde' a(l—1)?

SEAS). - 1! 51-1; Lan

Where & means summation for i, 1, ii, iv.

This result follows from the fact that in all the E-terms of W, e& and &' enter in
the form le+ ma", where [+m=2.

In the F*-terms xy enters in the form 2y,, and is of the opposite sign from I+m ; in
the F,-terms it enters in the form 2x, and is of the same sign as [+1 ; in the G*-terms
it enters in the form x", and is of the opposite sign from 1m ; in the Geterms it
enters in the form x, and is of the same sign as {+m.

Hence as far as regards the E-terms of W, we have

in the F*-terms = a2 Ee =)
in the F,-terms = mm ad
Gon = KT)
