cellular automata, which cannot be reached from within the system. However, if a
structure physically exists in our world, its constructibility is given, and moreover
we immediately have in our hands a solution to this problem of computing the
complexity, if one may consider the construction; the crystal growth; the assembly
process that formed it. In other words, the same algorithm that builds a structure
provides us with its complexity.

K4=|d(a)|

where a is the assembly algorithm and d(a) its description.

We propose to call this measure the assembly complexity, and we should note
that it is not necessarily coincident with the Kolmogorov complexity; in fact the
two will only be the same if the assembly algorithm is the shortest possible,
and since Kolmogorov complexity is not computable, this coincidence cannot,
in general, be checked. In the case of a crystal, the shortest algorithm would
simply be to repeat the unit cell, but assembly complexity would instead consider
the crystal growth mechanism, such as the Burton-Cabrera-Frank mechanism
we discussed above. We may add the corollary that if the possible structure
corresponds to a point in an energy landscape, then the complexity of a particular
structure comprises the route through the energy landscape.

On what level of system description should we consider the assembly
complexity? The level for a biological structure should clearly be that on which
biological information is stored: the genomic one; let us term it the genomic
