8erye but to render the explanation offered in the text more complicated than it is. Moreover the fact already
alluded to in the text—viz. that tentative moyements differ in no respect from the accurately localizing move-
ments, except in their want of precision—this fact, I think, strongly tends to show that the same kind of
þ tissue-clements is concerned in the production of all these moyements.

of unsevered tissue on either side of that tube. The fact of its doing 80, however,
certainly seems to be connected with the fact of the radial tubes being tracts of high
excitability. Now the latter fact, it seems to me, can only be accounted for in one of two
ways, Either (4) we must swppose the course of a radial tube to coincide with that of -
a chain of ganglionic elements, or else (5) we must snppose it to coincide with something
resembling a nerve-trunk—the latter being composed of aggregations of the afferent
lines which we have already supposed to constitute the rudimentary nerve-plexus.
According to the first of these snppositions, the comparatively high excitability of the
radial tubes, as well as the pointing of the polypite to the unsevered tube in a specimen
prepared as represented in fig. 8, would both be explained by the further supposition
that when such a ganglion chain is stimulated—either directly or by conduction of the
stimulus from a distance—the ganglionic elements discharge their influence, and 80 add
to the strength of the original stimulus. According to the second of the above suppo-
sitions (viz. 6), the fact of the high excitability of the nutrient tubes would be explained
by the consideration that a stimulus applied to the snupposed nerye-trunk would directly
