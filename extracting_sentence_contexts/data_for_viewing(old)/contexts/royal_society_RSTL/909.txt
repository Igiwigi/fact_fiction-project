the card a little of a solution of nitre in water ; when I obser-

turbid serum, a whitish cloud was. immediately formed. The
two fluids were then stirred together; upon which the mixture

the opacity of blood, since it can, by no other means, increase
the reflection of light from the interior parts of that body.

This theory explains another fact respecting the colour of
blood, which might otherwise seem. unaccountable. If a small

dark crassamentum, the parts touched by it will for an instant

matter in water, do. nothing more than destroy its colour:
Upon examining the crassamentum, a reason for this difference
