3154. Such a conelusion as that just arrived at, brings on the question of what is
magnetic polarity, and how is it to be defined ? For my own part, I should understand
the term to mean, the opposite and antithetical actions which are manifested at the
opposite ends, or the opposite sides, of a limited (or unlimited) portion of a line of
force (2835.). The line of dip of the earth, or a part of it, may again be referred to
as the natural case; and a free needle above or below the part, or a wire moving
across it (3076. 3079.), will give the direction of the polarity. If we refer to an
entirely different and artificial standard as the electro-magnetic helix. the same
meaning and description will apply.

3155, If the term polarity have any meaning, which has reference to experimental
facts and not to hypotheses only, beyond that included in the above description, I
am not aware that it has ever been distinctly and clearly expressed. It may be $0,
for I dare not venture to say that I recollect all I have read, or even all the conclu-
sions I myself have at different times come to. But if it neither have, nor should
have, any other meaning, then the question arises, is it correctly exhibited or indi-
cated in every case by attractions and repulsions, 4. e. by such like mutual action of
particular bodies on each other under the magnetic influence? A weak solution of pro-
tosulphate of iron, if surrounded by water, will, in the magnetic field, point axially ;
if in a stronger s0lution than itself, it will point equatorially (2357. 2366. 2422.). The
same is true with stronger cases. We cannot doubt it will be true even up to iron,
nickel, and cobalt, if we could render these bodies fluid in turn without altering their
paramagnetic power, or if we had the command of magnets and of paramagnetic and
diamagnetic media, stronger or weaker at pleasure. But in the case of the solutions,
