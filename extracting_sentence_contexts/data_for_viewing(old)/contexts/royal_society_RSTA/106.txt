with the so-called two-dimensional scour. Scour induced by waves and combined waves/current
has been widely studied and is relatively well understood. This includes the onset of scour
[15,16], equilibrium scour depth [17-19], time scale of local scour [20] and three-dimensional
scour [21-23]. A comprehensive review on the mechanics of scour is available in [24], which
summarizes both research results and practical findings to provide engineers and researchers
with the fundamentals of scour.

In the 1970s, pipelines laid at a water depth where surface wave action was still significant
were used in order to be buried; exposure to wave loads or potential hydroplastic phenomena
were definitely avoided [25]. In the case of deep-water pipelines, the analysis procedure was
limited to the identification of the maximum free-span length referred to a 100 years return period
design current in order to make negligible the risk of tuning of vortex shedding. The so-called ‘no
oscillation’ approach was due to the fact that in most cases a resulting cross-flow oscillation of the
order of one diameter of amplitude was unacceptable [26].


The early 1980s saw the issue of more comprehensive guidelines, including the concept of 4 |
synchronization of vortex shedding with oscillation in the direction of the current [27]. The

first time this criterion was applied to a submarine pipeline, it proved to be the one steering
the determination of the limit length, at the same time showing that pre-existing situations of
pipelines laid on an irregular seabed would have to be redesigned in some way as they did not
comply with the acceptability criteria [26].

In the following decades, in situ stability and long-term integrity of offshore pipelines across
