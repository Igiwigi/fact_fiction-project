The preparation was placed in the incubator
and kept at a constant temperature of 32* C. for twenty-seven hours, after which time
when examined it showed the following structures :â€”

(a) Besides intact granular pus-corpuscles there were numerous pus-corpuscles the
substance of which had become swollen and transparent ; these contained two to six
spherical homogeneous, not yery highly refractive, bodies, about half the size of a coloured
blood-corpuscle, or eyen less. Some pus-corpuscles containing these bodies were seen
to be in the state of becoming disintegrated, and thus those spherical bodies becoming
freed. That they are not nuclei of the pus-corpuscles is 8hown by the fact that they
become the more distinct the more the matrix of the pus-corpuscle becomes swollen
and disintegrated. They are most distinct when they have become freed from a cor-
puscle. Besides they have a s/ightly greenish colour and are homogeneous; whereas it, is
well known that when pus-corpuscles'swell, also their nuclei become swollen, and have
then the appearance of vesicles bordered by a thin membrane.
