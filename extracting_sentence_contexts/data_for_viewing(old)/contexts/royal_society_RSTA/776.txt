Engineered frequency conversion makes the spectral degree of freedom accessible for quantum
information science. Since it can selectively convert specific temporal modes, it can generate
superposition states with respect to some basis or probe spectral correlations in a bipartite system.
Weakly pumped PDC in the photon-pair regime already generates spectral entanglement. For
example, the configuration depicted in the central plot of figure 1 is essentially a Bell state
(1//2)(|Ag, Bo) + |A1,B1)) and can be probed by two pulse gates operating on superposition
modes of Ag, Aj and Bg, By, respectively [8].

However, the QPG is not limited to single photons only. In principle, more information can
be encoded per temporal mode if we use multiple photons per mode. What happens if we send
in higher photon numbers or squeezed states in different spectral modes into the QPG? In this
section, we answer this question by providing a simple analogy between the QPG and a spatial
network of beam splitters. In fact, even though we operate on the frequency degree of freedom,

Figure 3. (a) Spatial analogy of the QPG. The actual frequency conversion operates on single mode with a conversion efficiency
sin(9). Any input state thus undergoes a unitary U>*** of which the first output corresponds to the pulse gate mode. Effectively, :
this can be used to perform beam-splitter operations on the input modes. (b) Two examples for the beam-splitter operation: a [=

any FC is just a beam splitter transformation. Particularly for the QPG, only one term is non- 3
zero in the Schmidt decomposition, i.e. the conversion can be modelled with only a single beam :S
splitter. If we send in photons in different temporal modes, we have to transform these modes Dy
