such a pair has the same final position. Their action difference is given by first-order classical
perturbation theory to be

where the path of integration is over the unperturbed orbit. Naively, unaware of manifold
stability, one might have expected this quantity to diverge exponentially fast with increasing time
owing to the exponential separation of orbits in chaotic systems, and for quantum dynamics
of chaotic systems to be hypersensitive to perturbations. This would have been due to the
action difference showing up as an exponentiated phase. It would also seem to be limited to
logarithmically short time scales. Instead, the manifold stability is strong enough to eliminate
the exponential sensitivity completely, and, in fact, the first-order classical perturbation term

is valid on algebraically long time scales. It is responsible, after further argumentation, for : 2

A nice illustration of the accuracy of perturbation theory is given in [16]; a modified version : <
