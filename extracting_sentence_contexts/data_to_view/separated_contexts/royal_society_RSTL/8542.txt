Observe that this value is independent of R, and that the expression is thus the same

viz. we have thus, in the case where the mass ſz as is finite, a superior limit to the
prepotential of the remaining portion of the surface. This will be indefinitely small in
comparison with the prepotential of the disk, provided only #* is indefinitely small

compared with R***, that is # indefinitely small in comparison with R'**s.
