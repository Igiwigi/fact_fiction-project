have produced the rocks of our globe.

The difficulties alluded to arise from the minute size and imperfectly developed crys-
tallisation of the mineral constituents alike of the rock and the a&rolite; and they have
in general baffled the efforts of the chemist on the one hand to effect their separate
analyses, and of the crystallographer on the other hand to determine the forms of these
constituents. The chemist indeed has endeayoured to overcome the difficulty by attempt-
ing a chemical separation of the constituent minerals of these fine-grained mixtures into
one group of such as are soluble and another group of those which are insoluble in acids,
and then treating the numbers obtained from the analyses of these groups by the light
of theoretical considerations founded on the formulze and properties of known minerals.
This method is necessarily only an approximative one. Even granting that by its means
we could divide a rock into two classes of ingredients, which we cannot in fact accurately
do, there remains the question of how to separate from each other the mingled minerals
in, for instance, its insoluble portion.

But the great interest that attaches to whatever may throw light on the history of
atrolitic rocks seemed to render it yery desirable that some more reliable method should
be s0ught for their investigation. With this end in view, and also with the purpose of
basing on such an investigation a scientific classification of the now very extensive col-
lection of acrolites in the Britigh Museum, I ome ix years ago commenced a systematic
examination of these bodies by the microscope. While the meteorites were being cut.
in order to show their polished surfaces, a 8mall fragment of the portion detached was

fastened by its flat ide to a trip of glass and carefully worked down to the utmost
