and therefore its vanishing expresses the condition that some one of the quadrics of the

dition that it shall be possible, through the intersection of two conics of the system, to
draw a conic having double contact with the third. In this case the Jacobian of the
system breaks up into a right line and conic.

But we cannot, in like manner, conclude that the result of elimination between four
