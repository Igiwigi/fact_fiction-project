response theory (see, e.g. Hummer et al. [87], Shirts and Pande [88], or K6nig et al. [89]). Most free
energy calculations are strongly influenced by anharmonic terms (e.g. van der Waals interactions),
are not performed in a homogeneous environment (e.g. in a protein), or exhibit more than one
dominant conformational substrate [44]. The underlying nonlinearities in the dynamics are what
account for both the presence of chaos and non-Gaussian statistics. The phenomenon is well
known in turbulence: there it is caused by very long-range hydrodynamic interactions mediated
by energy dissipation. It is not anticipated from our experience of studying linear systems with
short-range interactions at equilibrium.

That the equilibrium distributions arising in molecular dynamics should be non-Gaussian may
appear surprising, given the accounts in most textbooks and lectures, which transfer themselves
into research articles very readily. The reason for the presence of non-normal statistics in such
systems at equilibrium comes from the fact that here too we are dealing with the infinite range
interactions mediated by Coulomb forces. In a computer simulation of a closed system, such as the
canonical or (N,V,T) ensemble, the molecular dynamics is driven by the existence of thermostats
