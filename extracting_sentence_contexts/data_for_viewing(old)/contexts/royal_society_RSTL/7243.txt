the world of chemistry on which the attention may adyantageously be concentrated.
Ordinary language is too vague and too diffuse for the purposes of science, and in
chemistry especially the facts are 80 numerous and s0 complicated that it is only when
embodied in a concrete form that they can be stored in the memory, and become the
object of reflection. Hence even an imperfect and material picture may, in a certain
epoch of the development of the science, be found of indispensable utility.

The actual theory of chemistry may be regarded as an expansion of the hypothesis of
DaLron. In science, as in other s8pheres of thought, hypotheses often pass without
question which come to us recommended by early use, and by even a $hort tradition ;

S and when embodied in symbolic language, and thus intimately blended with our con-
AQ ceptions, they are readily mistaken for facts. No statement, perhaps, would receive
S more universal or unqualified assent from chemists than that the molecule of ammonia
T contains three atoms of hydrogen, that ethylamine is derived from ammonia by the
= 8ubstitution of an atom of ethyl for an atom of hydrogen, and that the reason why
> there are three, and only three, such derivatives of ammonia is, that each derivative is
S formed by a repetition of the same process, and that, the molecule of ammonia contain-
.S ing only three atoms of hydrogen, this process can only be repeated three times. These
£ conclusions are regarded as 80 certain as to be almost removed from discussion. But never-
= theless they cannot but partake of the hypothetical nature of the theory in which they
= originated. Tt is only because our primary hypothesis has led us to take this peculiar
2 view of the atomic constitution of ammonia, and to express it by the symbol NH,, that
% chemists have adopted these further hypotheses as to the nature of the process by which
© ethylamine is formed, and as to the cause of the limitation which exists in regard to the
