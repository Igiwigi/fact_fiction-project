decompoxition and transfer which Sir Humenry Davy deseribed in his cele-
brated paper#*, were those in which acids were passed through alkalies, and alka-
lies or earths through acids; and the way in which substances having the
most powerful attractions for each other were thus prevented from combining,
or, as it is said, had their natural affinity destroyed or suspended throughout the
whole of the circuit, excited the utmost astonishment. But if I be right in the
view I have taken of the effects, it will appear, that that which made the wonder,
is in fact the essential condition of transfer and decompoxsition, and that the
more alkali there is in the course of an acid, the more will the transfer of that
acid be facilitated from pole to pole; and perhaps a better illustration of the
difference between the theory I have ventured, and those previously existing,
cannot be offered than the views they respectively give of such facts as these.

551. The instances in which sulphuric acid could not be passed through
baryta, or baryta through sulphuric acid$, because of the precipitation of sul-
phate of baryta, enter within the pale of the law already described (380. 412.),
by which liquidity is s0 generally required. In assuming the solid state of 8ul-
phate of baryta, they became virtually non-conductors to electricity of 80 low
a tension as that of the voltaic battery, and the power of the latter over them
was almost infinitely diminished.

552. The theory I have adyanced accords in a most satisfactory manner
with the fact of an element or substance finding its place of rest, or rather of
evolution, sometimes at one pole and sometimes at the other. Sulphur illus-
