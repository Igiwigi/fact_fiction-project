is the most rigid one for compliance minimization and is also minimizing the maximal stress
norm in the cell [33]. In particular, the boundary of the hole is equi-stressed and [33] proposed an
implicit expression of the boundary of the Vigdergauz microstructure in terms of the macroscopic
strains (or macroscopic stress) and the volume fraction (apart from the material properties). More
recently, Liu et al. [34] proposed an alternative expression in terms of the volume fraction and
another (non-intuitive) geometrical variable. The goal of this section is to numerically compare
our microstructure featuring a super-ellipsoidal hole with the Vigdergauz microstructure. The
conclusion is that they are very similar and the differences between their shapes are negligible in
practice.

Therefore, we favour super-ellipsoidal holes because the Vigdergauz microstructures have a
very complex parametrization which is not easy to handle numerically. In fact, it is not explicit
and depends on elliptic integrals and requires finding zeros of nonlinear equations. This makes
the super-ellipsoidal hole more convenient in terms of simplicity and computational cost.

(i) Level-set description of Vigdergauz microstructure

Let us first provide a description of the Vigdergauz microstructure through the zero value

of a level-set function. Early work [33] described the Vigdergauz microstructure in terms of i>
the macroscopic strain and volume fraction (and material) parameters. In [34], the Vigdergauz : <
microstructure is described by a symmetry (non-intuitive) parameter r and the volume fraction : >
p. Here, we slightly modify the parametrization of the last work by using the semi-axis ratio :3
