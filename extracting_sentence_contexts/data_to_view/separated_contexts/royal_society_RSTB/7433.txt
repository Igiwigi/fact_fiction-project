It does not bear any relation to the probable evolution
of the organisms included in the order Amoebida. It is very well known that Entamoeba
histolytica and other intestinal amoebae can be grown in culture indefinitely on suitable
bacterial food like most of the free-living non-parasitic forms. The mere fact that some
amoebae become parasitic does not justify the creation of the family Endamoebidae. The
production of temporary flagella under conditions imperfectly understood is equally
unsuitable as a character for the creation of a family. In some amoebae it is neither easy
to produce temporary flagella nor is this character as consistent as was assumed by those
who created the families Dimastigamoebidae or Bistadiidae.
