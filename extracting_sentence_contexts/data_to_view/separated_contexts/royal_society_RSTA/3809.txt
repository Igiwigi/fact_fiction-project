in the first trials the difference was rather embarrassing. However, after a little
practice the eye becomes educated to set the mercury to each point in a constant
manner, and this is all that is really required. The same consideration shows
that minute outstanding capillary differences should not lead to error, — It may
be remarked that the mercury is always on the rise at the time of adjustment,
and in fact it was found best to make it a rule not to allow the pots to be
drowned at any time when it could be avoided. After such a drowning it was
usually (perhaps always) found that the mercury surface was disirartiedl by the
proximity of the points without actual contact, an effect attributed to electrification. The presentation of the point to the mercury, or rather of the point to its image
as seen by reflection in the mereury, was examined with the aid of two similar eye-
lenses (not shown) of 22 millims, focus.
