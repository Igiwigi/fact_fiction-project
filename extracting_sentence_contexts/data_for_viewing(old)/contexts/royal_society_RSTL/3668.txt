upon any other part of the sac.

As the sac elongates, we frequently find it accompanied by minute vessels, which
usvally but not universally, assume a spiral direction, as seen at b, Plate XVII. fig. 3,

and in fig. 4. These vessels appear to be part of a system of minute vascular tissue
peculiar to these organs, as they differ in character from the minute vascular tisswe
that we have before described as prevailing almost universally in the animal matter of
the Corallidze, being furnished with valves or diaphragms at regular intervals. But
the most singular circumstance is that they appear to demonstrate the fact, that cy-
toblasts are not only concerned in the production of the cellular structure, but that
they are also the direct originators of the vascular tissue, for in this case we observe
short branches given off at nearly right angles from the minute vessels, and at the
apex of each of these there is seated a small cytoblast, not exceeding 3/3 of an
inch in diameter, but very considerably larger than the branch that supports it, which
measured but +7457 of an inch in diameter. Other small cytoblasts are seated
upon the vessels, as shown in fig. 4, which represents one of the sacs with the ac-
companying vessels and cytoblasts, as seen with a microscopic power of 800 linear.
The vessels are not attached to the sacs throughout the whole of their course ; con-
s8iderable portions of them are floating freely between the organs ; and branches from
these free vessels are often to be seen passing in a very singular manner half round
the outer circle of the cytoblast at the apex of the sac, and, upon quitting it, proceed-
