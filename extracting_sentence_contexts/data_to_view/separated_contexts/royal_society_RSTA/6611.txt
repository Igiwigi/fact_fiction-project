Maximum and minimum estimates are as follows:

Q1 1 00768 > 0-0326, Qzo9 0-0231->0-0163, Qa, 0-0153 > 0-0108,
and these, if substituted in the formula x’ = u+gQ, give
£111) 31> 74,  So99,74>104, 2551, 98 >139. The values of g obtained by taking /Cu*™> 254 are:
£111, 159+ 374,  Zo09, 307 > 436, 255), 373 > 528. Probably (owing to the divergency of the beam, as explained above) even these values are
too low, but the special point to be noticed is that g increases with decreasing Q, and that the
fact of this increase in independent of the particular values taken for [£"%/J, or for Qyg. This confirms the hypothesis that in many type II diamonds the individual crystallites are
closely parallel to each other, so that multiple reflexion is possible, although discontinuities
at the boundaries interrupt the sequence of spacings and spoil the perfection of the crystal
as a whole. A few type II diamonds, however (plate 17, figure 22c) give photographs in which the 111
absorption lines although still sharp are outstandingly strong, while those corresponding to
less intense reflexions are absent or very weak.
