This procedure has been widely adopted and great advances have been made in recent
years in solving special problems, particularly with the help of complex variable analysis. Some discussion has taken place over the validity of the theory of generalized plane stress. Southwell (1936) pointed out that it was in fact only necessary to assume that the average
value Zz of 2z taken through the thickness of the plate is zero. Alternative assumptions about
2z have been suggested by Green (1945) and Ghosh (1946), but the validity of these assump-
tions is still unknown. Ghosh (19464), in a slightly more general discussion than that given
by Southwell (1936), has shown that a state of stress is possible in a plate with 22 identically
zero, but the conditions at the edge of the plate cannot then be arbitrarily prescribed; so
that in a problem with given boundary conditions it is still not known how near the average
stresses found by the generalized plane stress theory are to the actual average values found
from a complete three-dimensional solution of the elastic equations.
