e-mail: maxime.derex@iast.fr Natural phenomena are not created by individuals; they are simply features

of our environment. Yet they generate reliable effects, resulting from the laws of
physics, chemistry or biology, that can be exploited and used for a purpose. As
argued by the economist Brian Arthur, ‘[natural] phenomena are the indispen-
sable source from which all technologies arise. All technologies, no matter how
simple or sophisticated, are dressed-up versions of the use of some effect—or
more usually, of several effects’ [1, p. 47]. Simple technologies such as cutting
stone tools, for instance, exploit the effect of hard and sharp edges to slice
through softer materials. Other technologies such as wheels harness the effect
of rolling to facilitate movement by reducing friction.

There is nothing particularly remarkable about the fact that human cultural
evolution exploits natural phenomena. Products of biological evolution also
exploit natural phenomena. The teeth of carnivores are hard and sharp to cut
through flesh, the structure of down feathers traps air to limit heat loss from
birds’ body, and so on. Moreover, non-human animals also exploit natural
phenomena through culturally acquired behaviours. Chimpanzees, for instance,
socially learn to exploit the crushing power of heavy stones to crack nuts
open [2].
