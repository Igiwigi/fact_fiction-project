Thus the spermatozoa, like the ova, are more efficient at a given tempera-
ture, within the first two or three minutes after they are passed from the body, than
at a later period. At that time there is not only a greater number of spermatozoa in
a given quantity of fluid in a state of activity; but the whole of them exhibit a
greater intensity of motion than after they have been for some time mixed with water. In the Toad, which, in this country, as already stated, pairs at a few weeks later in
the season than the Frog, and which seems not only to require a higher temperature
of the surrounding medium, but also a relatively higher temperature for the develop-
ment of the ova, the spermatozoa are most active, and most fitted to impregnate at
the instant of expulsion ; as is shown in the mode of intercourse of the sexes in that
animal, and in the fact that, if the fecundatory fluid be not immediately applied to
the strings of ova as these are passed, the unsprinkled ova are infertile. The oviposi-
tion of the Toad is an exceedingly slow process, and usually lasts, as SPALLANzanz
obseryed, from ten to fifteen hours: in one instance I found it continued during
seventeen hours, but it was completed in others in eight or ten. The act of impreg-
nation, therefore, is necessarily also prolonged.
