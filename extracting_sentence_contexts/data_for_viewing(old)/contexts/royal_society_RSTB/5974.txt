(= encircling cells of Harris (1932, p. 81) ). The surface walls of the guard cells were
very thin, the pore is usually clearly visible, though it lacks any special cuticularization.
The guard cells seem to have been sunk slightly below the surface in a shallow more or
less rectangular cavity whose sides show a definite outline owing to the extra thickness of
cuticle, which varies somewhat in the different species. The stomata on the leaves
resemble those on the cupules in all these characters, and the slight variations seen in
the different species of the Corystospermacee seem to have their counterparts in the
different species of the leaves which have been examined. It seems probable that when
all the forms of leaves have been examined we shall be able to match at least a number
of them with species of Umkomasia, etc., by comparison of the details of their stomata
and epidermal cells.

In view of all these facts it appears highly probable that the plants which bore the
fertile structures of the corystospermous types also produced leaves of the type of
Diecroidium, “ Stenopteris,” Johnstonia or perhaps of the forked Pachypteris, the cuticles
of which have not yet been so carefully examined ; it is very much more probable
that these leaves belonged to pteridospermous types than to plants of filicinean affinities.

Famity PELTASPERMACE.

This name is proposed for the plants whose characteristic fronds were designated
Lepidopteris by Scutmerr. Their pollen bearing structures have been identified and
studied by Anrevs and Harris, while the seed-bearing organs have now been discovered
both in Greenland and Natal. These plants appear to be related to the pteridosperms
and it is desirable to give them a family name which indicates that they were seed
