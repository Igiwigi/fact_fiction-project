Tt ap-
pears, therefore, that the disease of the: fifth nerve, which has destroyed the
sensibility on one side of the face, has caused a loss of motion in the musecles
of the jaw on the same ide. A more frequent occurrence establishing the distinetion of motions influenced
by the fifth and seventh nerves, is presented in the case'of paralysis of the portio
dura ; for then all the muscles waste but those supplied by the fifth. In the
case referred to, of the man wounded by the horn of an ox, in whom the portio
dura was torn, and who had the skin of his forehead, side of the nose, cheek
and lips, deprived of all fleshiness'and substance; and in fact wasted to mere
skin, the muscles of the jaw were entire and prominent; and on introducing
the finger into the mouth and making him imitate the motions of mastication,
a weak contraction could be felt in the 'cheek*. ? These facts close the evidence of the fifth nerve being a double nerve; not
only the nerve of sensibility to the head and face, but a muscular nerve to the
muscles of the jaws, active in mastication, and otherwise useful in all animals

* How often a question has occurred as to this motion in the cheeks, may be seen on referring to
cases, p. 1238, Exposition, &c. and p, 57, Appendix, 1st edition. MR.
