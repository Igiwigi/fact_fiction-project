It is hardly necessary to add, that any thing which any in-
sulated body, or system of bodies, can continue to furnish with-
out limitation, cannot possibly be a material substance : and it
appears to me to be extremely difficult, if not quite impossible,
to form any distinct idea of any thing, capable of being excited,
and communicated, in the manner the heat was excited and
communicated in these experiments, except it be MOTION. I am very far from pretending to know how, or by what
means, or mechanical contrivance, that particular kind of mo-
tion in bodies, which has been supposed to constitute heat, is
excited, continued, and propagated, and I shall not presume
to trouble the Society with mere conjectures ; particularly on

enlightened philosophers have endeavoured, but in vain, to
comprehend. But, although the mechanism of heat should, in fact, be one
of those mysteries of nature which are beyond the reach of
human intelligence, this ought by no means to discourage us,
or even lessen our ardour, in our attempts to investigate the
laws of its operations. How far can we'advance in any of the
paths which science has opened to us, before we find ourselves
enveloped in those thick mists which, on every side, bound the
horizon of the human intellect ? But how ample, and how in-
teresting, is the field that is given us to explore!
