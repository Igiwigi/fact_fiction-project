hydrogen is not constant, but varies with the density, diminishing with increase of density,
and vice versd.

As already remarked, this seems in harmony with the nature of the departure of
this gas from Boyxe’s law.

The theoretic value assigned by Ciaustus to the specific heat of hydrogen is 2°411.°
Experiment VIII. is just this number, IX. rises above it. he rest lie less or more
below it.

Conclusion.

The principal result of these first experiments on gases is the broad fact of the
departure of the specific heat at constant volume from constancy. Some such result
might have been, perhaps, anticipated from the known imperfectness of all gases. But
the invariability of the two specific heats is in text books most generally insisted on.
It is probable that a gas whose molecules were without action upon one another would
show invariability of specific heat. As it is, it appears that the mutual influence of
the molecules of some gases being of a positive nature, that of others (hydrogen mole-
cules at least) may be of a negative nature. But the subject is only touched upon in
this first paper. Many questions remain to be answered. Is the specific heat
dependent on temperature limits? If the perfectness of a gas depends upon its
temperature, how will this affect the nature of the relation between specific heat and
density? Will the rate of variation alter ? Presumably it will, It is not improbable
that at very high temperatures the slope of the line for air (or even for carbon dioxide),
