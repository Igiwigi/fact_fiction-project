for At tabulated by Bearden in 1967 were all based on interpolations from neighbouring elements
[114]. Although the later tabulation of Deslattes et al. [115] includes experimental values for Lay,
the only reference given goes back to the 1967 review, which includes no primary references. It
therefore remains unclear to the current authors if reliable X-ray spectra for Z = 85 have ever been
measured.

7. Mopping up X-ray spectra in the known periodic table

By the time of publication of the 1931 edition of Manne Siegbahn’s Spektroskie der Rontgenstrahlen
experimental X-ray energies had been compiled for most of the non-radioactive elements up to
Z=92 (figure 10), with the exception of neon and lithium [117]: even today the detection of the
very soft Ka emission from lithium at around 54eV remains difficult with conventional X-ray
spectrometers owing to the low energy of the X-rays and the fact that in both lithium metal and
most of its compounds the 2p shell is nominally empty, so that any dipole allowed transition
intensity into a 1s core hole depends on 2s-2p hybridization [118].

Direct measurement of X-ray spectra of radioactive elements that had been discovered by
radiological techniques even before Harry’s pioneering experiments posed ongoing technical
challenges, so that Siegbahn’s extensive lists of X-ray wavelengths contained no entries for Po
(Z=84), Rn (Z=86), Ra (Z=88) and Ac (Z = 89). Progress in filling in these remaining gaps may
be traced through tabulations of X-ray energies published by Cauchois in 1952 [119]; Bearden in
1967 [114]; Cauchois and Sénémard in 1978 [120]; Deslattes et al. in 2003 [115]; and finally in the
contemporary NIST database, last updated in 2005 [121].

The first of these classical radioactive elements to be characterized by X-ray spectroscopy
