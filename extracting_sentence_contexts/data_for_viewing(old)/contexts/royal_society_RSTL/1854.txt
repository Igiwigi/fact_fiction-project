of animals of the higher orders ; that there is also at some
distance from the brain, a second substance of similar struc-
ture, connected with the brain by two lateral chords ; and that
this second part gives off the nerves that go to the different
muscular structures of the body ; I consider myself borne
out in the opinion that this part answers the same purpose
as the medulla spinalis.

The ganglions which form a chain connected $0 beautifully
together by a double nerve, must be considered to have the
same uses, whatever they are, as the ganglions in the human
body, being equally composed of a congeries of nerves.
These are facts, which if they are allowed to be clearly made
out, form an addition to our knowledge, and give confirma-
tion to opinions not before satisfactorily established.

Here I hall conclude the present Lecture, neither Mr.
Bavex's time nor my own having admitted of our proceeding
farther in this curious and interesting anatomical investigation,
which I am not without hope, in the course of another year, of
our rendering as complete as microscopical observations admit
of, by examining the neryous system of a class of animals in
