To study the crosstalk between light
acclimation and gene regulation, we exposed the cells under
sudden light stress after acclimation to ML. A schematic of
the central carbon metabolism is presented in the electronic
supplementary material, Data SD6. Despite the fact that
mRNA abundance is not always correlated with protein
levels and enzyme activities [55], it is frequently used as a
good indicator of metabolic modifications [56]. Based on the
measurements, the expression pattern of genes/isogenes
encoding different enzymes in carbon metabolism pathways
was variable according to light intensity and acclimation
period after light shift (expression pattern of the genes is
shown in figure 2 and logÂ» values of the expression ratios are
displayed in electronic supplementary material, Data SD7).

(c) Towards acclimation to high light

After the shift to HL, diatoms have an increased photosyn-
thetic capacity (see electronic supplementary material, Data
SD4) that would have generated additional ATP and
NADPH. This would allow an increase of Calvin cycle
activity (also supported by the increase of mRNA expression
of FbaC1: 3.9-fold, FBPC3: 4.3-fold, TPI_2: 3.5-fold, RbcL: 2.2-
fold), providing enough CO, is imported into the chloroplast.
