Like the sixth problem, the latter two
are general tasks rather than specific mathematical problems with a clearly identifiable, possible
solution. All these three problems are also strongly connected to physics, though unlike the sixth,
they are also part of mainstream, traditional research concerns in mathematics. In fact, their
connections to Hilbert’s own interests are much more perspicuous and, in this respect, they do not
raise the same kind of historical questions that Hilbert’s interest in the axiomatization of physics
does. A balanced assessment of the influence of the problems on the development of mathematics | |
throughout the century must take into account not only the intrinsic importance of the problems

but also the privileged institutional role of Gottingen in the mathematical world with the direct 3
and indirect implications of its special status. However, if Hilbert wished to influence the course of :8
mathematics over the coming century with his list, then it is remarkable that his own career was ig
only very partially shaped by it.
