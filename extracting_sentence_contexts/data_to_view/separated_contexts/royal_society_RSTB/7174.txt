The follicular epithelium forms an epithelial plug
at the base of the ovary with extensive tapering anteriorly. It would appear that this
epithelium also does not merely play the part of secreting the egg chorion, but is important
as a nourishing factor. This conclusion is supported by the fact that histolysis takes place
among the follicular cells of the basal plug. Before passing into the histolytic stage these
cells show great activity having large nuclei and clearly displayed nucleoli. The bodies of
the histolytic cells later fuse together into one mass surrounded by a layer of follicular cells
which secrete a spherical membrane around it.
