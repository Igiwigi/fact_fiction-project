It is also more quickly arrested than psendo-
Heavage, and would scem therefore to need oxygen more. Slndirectly, bursting of the inner sac and consequent cessation of the yelk-contractions
ends upon access of oxygen, which acts by favouring decomposition when the water
Enot changed. ES Although some of the changes seen in the eggs in the suffocation experiments may
I& attributed to the poisonous action of some product, and not alone to the absence of
Sygen, yet the general inference, that oxygen is consumed, is not thereby weakened ;
Aid it, is a significant and interesting fact, that the cleavage masses in suffocated eggs
undergo a species of fusion, which much resembles one of the effects of the action of
carbonic acid on them. It remains, however, a weak point, that I failed to obtain chemical evidence as to
the product of oxidation, which might be expected to be in very small amount, as the
consumption of oxygen was 80 minute. Despite the difficulties of deciding what interchanges take place between the sub-
stance of the yelk and the surrounding medium during the functional activity of the
former, the fact came out with sufficient clearness, that some non-albuminous organic
matter, and some salts, passed into the water.
