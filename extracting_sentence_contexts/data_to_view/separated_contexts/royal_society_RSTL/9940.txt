The dimorphic genus, Sarcophyton, is probably closely related to
Aleyonium. The presence of dimorphism is not sufficient to warrant the gupposition
> that they sprang from different stocks, for this condition occurs in 80 many widely
5 different genera that it is reasonable to suppose that it was introduced more than
b=0 onee in the course of the evolution of the group.
'S As an example of this we find that the genus Xenia, which probably followed
5 another line of evolution from the hypothetical ancestor, is not dimorphic, whereas the
& genus Zeterozenia, very gsimilar to it in other respects, is dimorphic. E The lines which evolution took in producing the large number of genera of
z Primnoacee, Gorgonacee, &e., are much more difficult to make ont, but the following
represents perhaps as near an approximate to them as our present knowledge permits.
2 Taking Siphonogorgic as a form intermediate between the ancestral type and the
3 true Gorgonide, we find that the chief diversion lies in the fact that the colony has
ES, assumed an arborescent shape, and a support for ib is produced by a more copious
& development of spicules in the axial portions of the colony. The body-cavities of the
8. polyps, however, remain long, as they were in the ancestral form. Most probably
= there was another stage between Siphonogorgia and this ancestral form which was
S not dimorphic.
