Thus we see that © the branchial arches have the same morphological value as the
hyoid, and the latter as the mandibular arc ” (HvxLzy, © Croonian Lecture,” p. 53); and
not only 80, but the © trabecule cranii” are merely the foremost of these arches, as
both of us have for some time felt satisfied.

In the earliest condition of my * first stage ” (fig. 7), although these thick rods gra-
dually decrease in size from before backwards, yet the first are twice as thick as the

second, and their section is most perfectly ovoidal. In the rest the shape in section is
round within and flattigh on the outside; this arises from the fact that dehiscence
commences on the inner side several days before the clefts appear in the cutaneous
system ; yet thus early the cheeks are becoming forrowed (figs. 6 & 7) between the
arches,

The incurved lower end of the arches stops short some distance from the mid line,
leaving a space for the azygous pieces, which, however, do not appear for seyeral days to
come. The oblong tract of tissue between the arches below (fig. 7), which has a rounded
free margin anteriorly, and which has been partly cut away in the section behind, is the
basihyal and basibranchial region ; the free-ending anterior part becomes the tongue (7g.).
The tissue of which the rods are composed is cellular, very 8olid, and is rapidly passing
into hyaline cartilage ; a very evident concentric line indicates the differentiation of the
perichondrium ; they are imbedded between the skin and mucous membrane in a very
