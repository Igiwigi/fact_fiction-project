The auto-correlation function 8

for single commodities is modelled using the action functional and Feynman path integral. The auto-correlation also provides a stringent test of the accuracy of the model. The view taken in statistical microeconomics [1] is that supply and demand are inseparable
and in fact are two facets of a single entity, namely the microeconomics potential function V[p]. The
potential can be chosen to be the sum of supply and demand [1]

Vip] = Pip] + Sip], (1.1)

but can be more general, as discussed later. : =

The potential function V[p], similar to mechanics, drives the evolution of market prices. For the [=
special case when the prices are constant (time independent)—given by the constant prices : yy
Po = (P01, Po2,---,Pon)—the prices minimize the value of the potential; namely that V[pp] is a : 2
minimum of V[p]. aes

The break-up of the microeconomic potential into a sum of supply and demand need not hold if
in general for all values of the price as the break-up is essentially an asymptotic property of the : 8
microeconomic potential.
