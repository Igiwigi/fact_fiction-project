Of these H. esculentus ? x Echinocardium cordatum $ was,
contrary to MacBrivr's experience, most readily obtained, and proved the least
unhealthy. Fucus points out that the wide difference separating these species is
such as to render the resulting larve derived from crossing them invariably
pathological. This is borne out by the fact that very few survive more than seven
or eight days, and always die after becoming highly abnormal and stunted. It is
doubtful, therefore, if sound deductions can be drawn from the hybridization of these
forms. In the cross Hehinus 2 x Hehinocardium f all the larve inherit the absence
of the aboral process from the female parent.
