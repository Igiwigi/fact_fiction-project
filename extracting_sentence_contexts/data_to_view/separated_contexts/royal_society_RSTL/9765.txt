In the same way it is possible to conceive that the muscle should be able
Sto sum up the effects of a series of stimuli which follow one another 80 closely as to
Zdegerve the title of a continuous rather than a discontinuous stimulation. Tf, then, we
:Z2 have reason to snppose that in the firs+ case the discontinuons stimuli ultimately
23 produce a contraction by increasing the excitability of the mnscle, s0 in the second
ZCase We May SUPPOSE that a continuous stimulation causes a rhythmical series of con-
'S fractions by acting in the same way. The difference between the two cases would
Zeconsisb in the extent to which the excitability was increased ; in the one, the muscle
Sis not rendered sufficiently excitable to contract without the assistance of a distinct
Z separate stimulus ; in the other, the excitability is increased 80 much that no separate
Stimulus is required : the muscle, in fact, can be spoken of as capable of spontaneous
E contraction. B= PART IT. VS ON THe ACTION OF THE VAGUs NERVE.
