(a) Assumptions and simplifications of the theory

(i) Heat and mass transport

The statement of the problem given by equations (2.1)-(2.10) implies that the chemical segregation
coefficient ko, impurity diffusion coefficient Dc, liquidus slope m, liquid phase density », and
kinematic viscosity v are constants that do not depend on temperature and chemical composition.
Moreover, thermal diffusivities in the phases are assumed to be similar, which allows one to
directly employ the available methods for the description of dendrite growth [24,27,39]. Such
a simplified statement of the problem ensues from the fact that, in particular, the difference


between thermal diffusivities enters the ‘empirical constant’ 09 of the condition being sought for
the selection of the stable dendrite growth regime.

Extending the theory to the very wide range of solidification velocity (as stated in §§2 and 4),
these simplifications can be crucial for the analysis and interpretation of experimental data. For
instance, at high solidification rates, the liquidus line slope and chemical segregation coefficient
become velocity-dependent functions, leading to a drastic change of growth kinetics, and making
the transition from the diffusion-limited to thermally controlled growth very sharp [87]. However,
these simplifications enable us to carry out the analytical calculations for systems of nonlinear
equations with hydrodynamic contributions.
