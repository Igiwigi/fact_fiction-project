An influential explanation of demographic transition is that
the real or perceived costs of children increase as living stan-
dards go up, with the opportunity costs to reproduction
becoming disproportionately large for the wealthy and
highly educated members of a population [8,10,84]. Individ-
ual fertility reductions, under this essentially economic
approach, can be interpreted as best responses to investment
or information constraints [17], with social learning acting as
a proximate, but not an alternative, causal mechanism. Social
learning strategies evolved to generate adaptive fit between
environment and behaviour; they do not in and of themselves
affect the broader reproductive strategy. But it is new infor-
mation that can lead to behaviour change, not just the fact
that we have social learning mechanisms. Cultural norms
and values are themselves evolving, and not necessarily in
tandem with reproductive success. While humans have
been social learners at a large scale for a very long time,
some institutional changes like mass communication and
education systems have profound effects on the scale and
speed of information passing (often horizontally) through
populations. Socially, spatially, culturally and demographi-
cally structured interactions additionally affect what goes
into our decision-making mechanisms. Perceptions about
the marginal gains from embodied capital investment and
about greater opportunity costs are subject to these con-
