may be a positive or negative fraction, or may be > 1. If we know that the first
observed line of a series is actually the first member m= 1 for that line and p is
definite. If we assume, for instance, that the first doublet of a principal series has
the same separation as those of the associated series, the question is settled ; or if
such a line has not been observed, then the degree of convergence of the separation of
any P doublet will give its order at once, e.g., the fact that the D lines in Na have
the same separation 17°21 as the sharp series, would show that the D lines are
actually the first members of the series. If these had happened to have been outside
the region of observation, however, and the doublet (3302, 3303) had been the first
observed lines of the P series, their separation (5°50) would have at once shown that
for them m = 2, and again p would be definitely determined. In spectra with no
doublets or triplets, as in the singlet series of He or O, this criterion would not be
available.
