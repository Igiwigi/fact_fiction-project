very bright colours, as in the case of certain feathers and some small marine
animals. BrepERMANN describes a structure called the “ Stdébchenschicht,” which he
declares is present in the wing-cases of most iridescent beetles, and which, with the
assistance of the surface cuticle, produces all their colour. Except in the case of
certain Cetoniids, however, no such layer could be found. Moreover, the surface
cuticle is not responsible for much colour, or its disappearance would be noticed
when the wing-cases are placed in a highly refractive fluid.

The peculiar colour of the Cetoniids mentioned is probably caused by a layer of
rod-like structures at right angles to the wing surface. Any section tangential
to the surface of the wing-case which exposes the ends of these rods is intensely
coloured by reflected light, even when in Canada balsam. By transmitted light,
or in transverse section, this columnar layer is yellow. The fact that the chitin is
doubly refractive recalls the colours of similar crystals (¢.g., tourmaline).

Selective Metallic Reflection. .

In beetles, the available depth of chitin is especially limited. If the colours are
due to interference, part of the surface layer must be occupied by a protective skin,
and hence there is only available a thickness of one half wave-length. It is therefore
important to know the maximum saturation that can be produced by a single film.
