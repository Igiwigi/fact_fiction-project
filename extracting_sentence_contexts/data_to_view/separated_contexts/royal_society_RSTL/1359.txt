Davy's observations on the

the ordinary adhesions of the lungs ; and in a very few hours
attain their maximum of strength. This viscidity, which coagulable lymph acquires in passing
from a liquid to a solid form, has not, that I am aware, been
noticed by authors ; and the formation of adhesjons is usu-
ally explained without reference to this quality.*

Though I believe the common opinion to be untenable, that
the age of adhesions can be decided by their strength, it is
far from my intention to maintain that they do not become
firmer in progress of time, or that their duration may not
occasionally be conjectured from their appearance and re-
sistance.

g. It is believed by many, that the small portions of serous
fluid which are found after death in the cavities of serous
membranes, especially in the pericardium and the ventricles
of the brain, may have been poured out after the cessation of
life. | I'am not aware that this opinion is other than hypo-

thetical, or that it 'is supported by any precise facts. As a
theoretical conelusion its correctness seems doubtful, TI have
endeavoured to put it to the test of experiment, and the re-
sult has not been favourable to it. I have notes of three dif-
ferent experiments on dogs, which were made in Ceylon in
1818, all which seem to show that, under ordinary circum-
stances, no effusion of serum, or exudation $0 as to occasion
accumulation, takes place after death.
