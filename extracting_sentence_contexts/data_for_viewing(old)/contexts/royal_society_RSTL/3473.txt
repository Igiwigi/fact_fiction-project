found the active principle of the Lecanora Tartarea to be by no means identical with,
although strongly resembling erythrine. The conversion of his erythrine also into
psendo-erythrine by boiling with alcohol, indicates either the identity of erythry-
line with his erythrine, which can scarcely be supposed, or that his erythrine was
a mixture of true erythrine with some other snbstances more sparingly soluble in
alcohol and scarcely soluble in ether, which I consider to have been most probably

the fact. The difficulty might be got rid of, by supposing that the three lichens
Roccella Tinctoria, Parmelia Roccella, and Lecanora Tartarea, all contained primi-
tively different characteristic bodies, which possessed the common character of
generating his pseudo-erythrine, and the bodies which result from its decomposition ;
but, although in a certain degree supported by the analogy of the Yariolaria dealbata,
which contains orcine and no erythrine, I consider this idea as being much less likely
to be true, than that the erythrine of Hzzrex should be fonnd to have been a mixture.
It is on these grounds that I have transferred the name erythrine to his psendo-ery-
thrine, the substance which has been just now described.
