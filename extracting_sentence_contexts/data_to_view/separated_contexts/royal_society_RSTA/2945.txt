]. Introduction

It is well known that zero-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs) reside on the nodal
surface of d-wave superconductors, e.g. on the (110) surface of the cuprate high-temperature
superconductor (HTSC) YBayCu3O07_3 (YBCO). The corresponding zero-bias conductance peak
(ZBCP) observed in tunnelling spectra measured on such surfaces is, in fact, one of the hallmarks

of d-wave superconductivity (we note, in passing, that ‘d’ stands for d,2_ 2). Such spectral features, : =
first discussed by Hu [1], have been observed by many groups using various methods, such as Ds
point contact spectroscopy, planar junctions and edge junction geometries. The tunnelling spectra : Ss
could be well fitted to the theory of tunnelling into a d-wave superconductor developed by : =
Tanaka & Kashiwaya [2] and Kashiwaya et al. [3], who extended the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk :s
(BTK) model [4] developed for an s-wave superconductor.
