vesicle, may be frequently seen in an empty condition.

'The simple and, as it appears to me, the only reasonable interpretation of the above
facts is this: â€”The parenchymatous cells, either in groups or singly, lie originally in the
intervesicular tisse, outside the epithelial walls of the vesicles. They begin to make
their way into a neighbouring vesicle by pressing on the epithelial wall of one with which
they are in contact. This pressure exerted by a parenchymatous cell canses the epi-
thelial cells to lose their quadrilateral outline, and to present a more or less triangular
or crescentic appearance. The pressure continuing, the epithelial cells become flattened,
and finally either separate at once (figs. 13, 6 & 14,6) or first become reduced to a thin
membrane, which then gives way (fig. 12,5). In either case the result is the sxame, The
parenchymatous cell is placed in direct communication with the contents of the vesicle,
and can escape into the cavity of the 8ame. And that it does 80 is shown by the fact
that these cups or hollows formed by flattened epithelial cells are frequently seen in an
empty condition, having lost their parenchymatous cells.

To swm up this process : it appears that the cells forming the parenchyma of the
thyroid gland of the dog originate in the intervesicular tissue external to the walls of the
vesicles ; from ome eause (inherent movement, or growth of cells behind them) they exert
pressure on the wall of an adjoining vesicle ; the cells of this become flattened out or
absorbed, and finally give way, allowing the parenchymatous cells to escape into the cavity,
and to form a constituent of the contents, of the vesicte; but what part these cells take
in the formation of the contents of the vesicles T am unable to state.

The distribution of parenchyma through the gland appears tolerably uniform, though
