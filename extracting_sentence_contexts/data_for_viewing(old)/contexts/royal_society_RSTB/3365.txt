conditions. We mention them here, however, because at first sight it might appear
that if a mass of quartzite could drift into coal, then the ‘coal balls” themselves
might have been transported. Every point in the structure and occurrence of
the erratics, however, shows them to be fundamentally different in nature and
origin from the “ coal balls,” so that they will receive no further consideration in this
paper.

To return to the consideration of the facts illustrated by the huge mass containing
plant remains at Shore. Throughout its substance, as is generally the case with the
normal “ coal ball,” there are preserved numbers of plants of different kinds. The
plant scraps are also generally closely packed, so that practically all the substance of
the coal ball contains plant tissue, the small interspaces being filled with nearly  .
pure and almost transparent (when in section) mineral carbonates.

Nodule in Floor contains only Stigmarian Rootlets—A nodule, showing a
considerable contrast to this appearance, was found in the floor below the huge mass
in the seam at Shore. Externally, this floor nodule had all the characters of a typical
coal ball, being about 9 inches in diameter and of a very regular spheroidal shape.
This nodule was the first to be found in the floor, and was therefore very carefully
examined ; a few others have been found since, and have the same characters. When
