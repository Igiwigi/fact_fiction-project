5. Evidence for multiple stable states through
grazing â€”fire interactions

Most previous assessments of regime shifts and alternative
stable states in relation to fire and herbivory have focused
on the tree layer: Van Langevelde [92] modelled the role of
fire intensity mediated by grass biomass on the probability
of canopy closure and fire exclusion (grass biomass being
positively and negatively affected by browsers and grazers,
respectively). However, in this model grazing, browsing
and fire frequency were external parameters. From our
discussion mentioned above, there is sufficient evidence to
suppose that fire and herbivory do in fact interact, and that
each consumer can act to either promote or exclude the other.
The expected outcomes of these interactions support the
idea that fire and grazer ecosystems could be alternative
states [34]. Given that (i) grazing promotes the spread of
short-grass patches and bare ground [82,84,107,108], (ii) fire
impedes the spread of short grass [82,83] and (iii) there is a
threshold proportion of short grass at which fire is excluded
[109], one can expect hysteresis in the system (figure 3). Short-
grass areas increase with grazer density, but increase more
slowly in a system where fires occur. Once a threshold
proportion of short-grass is reached, fire drops out, and the
system switches quickly to a grazer-dominated system with
