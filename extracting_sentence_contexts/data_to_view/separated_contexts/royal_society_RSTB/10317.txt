First, adjacent COs may be avoided because they cancel
their effects on genetic associations [160]. Second, it has been
speculated that CO interference may reduce the chances of
breaking up co-adapted gene complexes (supergenes) [157]. Some support for the idea that CO interference is not a purely
mechanistic constraint comes from the fact that some species
lack interference [154] and, more importantly, that there is
some evidence suggesting that interference levels evolve in
long-term evolution experiments in Drosophila [161].

(c) Differences in recombination rates between the

Sexes
In many species, CO rates and localization differ between male
and female meioses, and these differences can vary in degree
and direction even between closely related species [162-164]. The most extreme case is achiasmy, an absence of recombin-
ation in one sex, nearly always the heterogametic sex [162]. This may have evolved either as a side effect of selection to sup-
press recombination between the sex chromosomes [165,166],
or as a way to promote tight linkage without suppressing
recombination on the X or Z chromosomes [163].
