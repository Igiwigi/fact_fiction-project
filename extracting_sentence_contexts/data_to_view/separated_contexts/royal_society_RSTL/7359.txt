S308. It was remarked that M. Hrerire's investigations are conducted by means of a
(nonical form, viz. if A (=), = No. 19 as above) be the quartinvariaut of the given
Sintic (a,6,c,d, e, f Xx, y), then he in fact finds (X, Y) linear functions of (&, y) 8uch
aat we have

Z (ﬆ, b, c, a, 6, f Xa, yY'=(A, 6, VE, VF, w, XX, YY

iz. in the transformed form the two mean coefficients are equal; this is a convenient
sumption made in order to render the transformation completely definite, rather than

© absolutely necessary one); and where moreover the quadricoyariant (Table No. 14) of

Ke transformed form is a

= =a/AXY,

&, what is the same thing, the coefficients (2, p, y/F, x/F, w/, x) of the transformed form

are connected by the relations

a —4p/F+3k=0,
Nu—4v//F+3k=0, My
M'—3up' +M=/A,
the advantage is a great simplicity in the forms of the several covariants, which sim-

Plicity arises in a great measure from the existence of the yery simple covariant operator

ix 5 (viz. operating therewith on any covariant we obtain again a covariant).
