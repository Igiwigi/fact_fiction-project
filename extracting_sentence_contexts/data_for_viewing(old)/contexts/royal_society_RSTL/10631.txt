Nature” (Nov, 24), in which the writer describes a proposed method of obtaining
the N., S., E., and W. components of the wind. The method was briefly this. A
sphere resting at one pole on a point in the periphery of a roller or disk, and in
frictional contact at four points of its equator with four other rollers or disks, would
(the planes of all the rollers being vertical) freely revolve upon the turning of the
bottom roller. If the plane of the latter were always kept parallel with the direction
of the wind, and ib were turned ab a rate proportional to the wind velocity, and at,
the same time the planes of the four others were placed in pairs respectively N. and S,,
E. and W., the latter would record the four corresponding components of the wind.
M. VexTosA was led to this idea in 1878, after reading an account of Vox OrrTixGeN's
Integrating Anemometer, by the endeavour to obviate the sliding friction of that
instrument, The arrangement he 8uggests is per 8 incapable of performing other
mathematical operations than simple addition, and, in fact, is only one of the two
necessary but distinct features of the author's mechanism mentioned in the abstract
of the above paper (Proc. Royal Society, 1884, p. 191). M. VeNTosA, however, in his
letter, truly says of his proposal, © Cette transmission se fait ici par roulement $ans
glissement ” (the italics are his own), and he must be regarded as having, prior to the
author, suggested the use of a sphere and rollers for effecting a change in the axis of
rotation of the sphere without necessitating other than rolling contact.—H. 8. H. 8.
