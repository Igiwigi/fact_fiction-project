the weight exceeds the buoyancy by 115 tons*; between R' and R?, a length of 65 feet,
the excess of buoyancy amounts to 220 tons; from R* to R?, 80 feet, the excess of weight
is 275 tons; and between R* and R*, on a length of 30 feet, the weight exceeds the
buoyancy by 210 tons. These figures furnish another illustration of the advantages
regulting from the adoption of moderate length and proportions in iron-clad ships.

In all the preceding examples the ships have been supposed to be fully laden ; but
there must, of course, occur alterations in the amount and stowage of the weights on
board, and consequently in the relative distribution of the weight and buoyancy. Earlier
writers on the s8ubject have fully recognized this fact, and nearly all of them concur in
stating that the greatest strains experienced by a ship floating in still water are those
incidental to the state when all the weights of equipment are removed, but that the
character of the strains remained the s8ame as when the ships were laden. Tn this
opinion they were probably correct in s0 far as the ships of their period were concerned,
as the older classes of ships always hogged considerably ; but in modern ships when
light, the characters as well as the intensities of the strains are often very different from
those when they are fully laden. For example, if a paddle-wheel steamer, like the
« Vietoria and Albert,” had her heavy weights of engines, boilers, coals, &c. removed,
the buoyancy amidships would become greater than the weight, and the ship would be
brought into a condition similar to that of the * Minotaur,” when fully laden, illustrated
by fig. 2 (Plate XVI.). A few illustrations will sRhow more clearly that the conclusions
drawn by the earlier writers by no means hold for all modern ships, some of which are
