118 MR. MACQUORN RANKINE ON THERMO-DYNAMICS.

For this purpose, let us take the ascertained fact of the production of heat by the
expenditure of mechanical power in friction, according to the numerical proportion
determined by Mr. Jours ; and let E denote the quantity of mechanical power which
must be expended in friction, in order to raise the temperature of unity of weight of
a given 8ubstance from that of absolute privation of heat to a given temperature 7,

During this operation, let the several elements of the external surface of the mass
undergo changes of relative position expressed by the variations of quantities denoted
generally by p, and let the increase of each such quantity as p be resisted by an ex-
ternally-applied force such as P.

Then during the elevation of temperature from absolute cold to 7, the energy con-
verted to the potential form in overcoming the external pressures P will be
