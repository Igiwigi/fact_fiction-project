Two intersecting sets of these spirals, the contact parastichies, are usually conspicuous to the

eye, owing to the fact that each primordium touches certain others; because of these con-
tacts the eye tends to select these particular sets and to ignore the other spirals which
traverse primordia not in contact with one another. Nevertheless, the inconspicuous curves
have just as much, or just as little, objective reality as the conspicuous contact parastichies,
which are simply a particular pair of sets from among the whole family of logarithmic
spirals. These curves then are all parastichies.
