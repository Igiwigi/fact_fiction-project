of erystals of phosphate to albumen containing already formed calcospherites of
carbonate, prevented their further formation and caused disintegration of those already
formed.

It is, therefore noticeable that the salts of lime in the condition of calcospherites
are not ina very stable state of equilibrium, they alternately coalesce and disintegrate
under the effect of various conditions in the medium in which they are produced.



CALCIFICATION IN ENAMEL AND DENTINE. 107

This fact has an important bearing upon their varying conditions of aggregation in
the calcifying structures of living organisms.

The Sheath of Neumann.

The existence or non-existence of this sheath has long been a matter of controversy.
Joun Tomes* was the first to describe the presence of a soft fibril in the dentinal
tubes. He showed that these fibrils ran in tubules in the dentinal matrix, and were
provided with a definite lining membrane; the sheath first fully investigated by
NeEuMANN (16) and named after him. This lining membrane shows a great resistance
to the action of acids and can be isolated in preparations of dentine by the
destruction of the intervening matrix substance by the prolonged operation of
strong acids,
