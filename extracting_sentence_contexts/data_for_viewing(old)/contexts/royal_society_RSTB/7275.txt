earlier than those of the spermathecae, a fact confirmed by the very young female larva
possessing the rudiments of the caecus on the ninth sternite and lacking any sign of
spermathecal rudiments on the eighth sternite.

The two separate buds of the caecus unite in the middle line forming one cavity with
a vertical division. In more advanced larvae all signs of double construction disappear,
except near the opening of the invagination, which still shows a division in its cavity.

Little change later takes place in the shape and construction of the caecus, except that
it becomes longer and its wall thicker. In some sections (figure 5 d) a mass of myoblastic
cells can be seen running between the outer surface of the caecus rudiment and the nearby
muscles. No traces of secretion are present in the caecal cavity during the larval stage.
The peripodial cavity of the caecus rudiment changes in the prepupal stage into the
