Finally, sites with high sedimentation rates will show less distortion due to bioturbation (e.g.
[78]). Hence, approaches that are capable of measuring the isotopic composition of a large
number of single specimens [76], coupled with detailed assemblage data, while targeting sites
with relatively high sedimentation rates, present the best opportunity to find and interpret the
significance of intermediate value individuals in the PETM onset. These records would also allow
further investigation of another interesting aspect of single foraminifera records—the fact that
intermediate temperature values are detected on samples with pre-excursion 5!°C [29]—which
may help unravel possible mechanisms of carbon release if preliminary warming was not caused
by a carbon source relatively depleted in °C.

(b) Method 2: relative size of the carbon isotope excursion between reservoirs

On the basis of different CIE magnitudes between reservoirs, Kirtland Turner & Ridgwell [30]
suggested the PETM onset could be less than 3kyr. Kirtland Turner & Ridgwell [30] used the
cGENIE model forced with a uniform input of carbon to the atmosphere over durations ranging
from 1 year to 10kyr and compared the relative size of the CIE generated within the ocean
and atmosphere as a function of the duration of carbon input (figure 2b). Shorter carbon input
durations corresponded to larger atmospheric CIEs but not larger mean ocean CIEs.
