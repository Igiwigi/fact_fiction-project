According to Darwiy, * species
are multiplied and genera are formed ” by the application of the principle of “ Divergence
of Character,” while his reference to the opposite principle is only a passing one. Brra
(1926), on the other hand, says, “ Darwin represents evolution as a process of
divergence of characters. As a matter of fact, predominative importance belongs to
convergence of characters.” There is hardly any doubt that since Darwiy’s time
extensive study of characters has shown that quite a number of apparently homogeneous
genera and families are in reality polyphyletic in origin. Thus, in evaluating the
relative importance of characters the problem of the morphologist has become very
complicated indeed.
