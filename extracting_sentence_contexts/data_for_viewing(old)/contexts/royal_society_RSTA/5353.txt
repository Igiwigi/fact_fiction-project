represents the most accurate imaging of mouse cartilage in three dimensions reported so far [35].

In this study, Ruan and co-workers used one of the most advanced commercial micro-CT scanners
(which combines absorption and phase-contrast imaging modalities) and imaged mouse AC,
pre-stained with osmium tetroxide mixed with ruthenium hexamine trichloride and cacodylic
acid, at increasingly higher resolutions (10, 4, 2, 1.5 and 0.5,1m). Although highly accurate and
informative, their approach required extremely long acquisition times (e.g. 17h for the acquisition
of approx. 21m resolution scans), which, combined with the use of toxic contrast agents, makes
their method unsuitable for high-throughput assessments or in vivo imaging.

Our current proof-of-concept result is important because: (i) it gives promising indications on
the potential for a higher resolution laboratory-based CAXPCi system to resolve mouse AC ex
vivo in three dimensions without any contrast agents. The fact that the resolution in the synXPC


system was approximately twice that of the CAXPCi system would suggest that this could be
within reach, although more detailed analysis (e.g. quantitative comparison between the signal-
to-noise ratios obtained with the two systems) and tests are still required before firm conclusions
can be drawn. (ii) In the longer term, further improvement in the CAXPCi system may lead to
a new generation of CAXPCi micro-CT scanners, which could be used for in vivo longitudinal
pre-clinical imaging of AC at resolutions impossible to achieve by current MRI technology.
Notably, given the proven difficulties with contrast-enhanced micro-CT imaging of the mouse
AC in vivo, X-ray phase-contrast micro-CT seems to provide the most valuable potential solution
to bring the mouse model of OA to the next level in terms of throughput and translational
applications. Some degree of promise in this sense is given by the fact that our preliminary studies
