It
appears also from the observations of SPALLANZAN1, that in
many animals a portion of the aorta, next the heart, is capable
of exhibiting a continued pulsation, even when perfectly empty
and separated from the heart ; but this property is limited to
a small part of the artery only, which is obviously capable of
being essentially useful in propelling the blood when the
valves of the aorta are closed. The muscular power of the
termination of the vena cava is also capable of assisting the
passage of the blood into the auricle. It is not at all impro-
bable that a muscle of involuntary motion, which had been
affected throughout the whole period of life by, alternate con-
tractions and relaxations, might retain from habit the tendency
to such contractions, even without the necessity of supposing,
that the habit was originally formed for a purpose to be ob-
tained by the immediate exertion of the muscular power :
but in fact the partial pulsation of the vena cava is perfectly
well calculated to promote the temporary repletion of the

auricle, while it must retard, for a moment, the column which
is approaching, at a time that it could not be received. There is no difficulty in imagining what services the mus-
cular coats of the arteries may be capable of performing,
without attributing to them any immediate concern in support=
ing the circulation.
