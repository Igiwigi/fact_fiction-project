From the
bright red solution a substance separates on cooling in red flocks, which, as well as
the orange-coloured flocks produced by adding sulphuric acid to the liquid, consist,
according to them, entirely of purpurine without any trace of alizarine. They purify
it by crystallization from alcohol. Now I have shown above that the fermentation
of madder, which is in fact synonymous with the fermentation of rubian, is due to
the action of a peculiar substance, which I have called erythrozym, on rubian ; that
the action of this substance is very rapid; that it is not accompanied by any disen-
gagement of gas; that it is terminated long before any effervescence or any acid
reaction of the liquid begins to appear ; that the products of the action do not differ
essentially from those due to the action of acids and alkalies ; that the formation of
alizarine in about the same proportion as when acids or alkalies are employed is one
of the results of the process, and that yeast exerts no decomposing power on rubian
whatever. Hence it necessarily follows, that if the purpurine of WoLey and STRECKER
be not found as such among the products of the fermentation of rubian, it must consist
of a mixture of two or more of those products. Now I have mentioned in the first part of this paper, that though alizarine and
verantine are both perfectly insoluble in boiling alum liquor when acted on sepa-
rately, yet that when a mixture of both is employed, the mixture is found to be
soluble in alum liquor with the colour characteristic of purpurine.
