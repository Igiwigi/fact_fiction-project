The first term AW is the work done by the system under some change in its
global constraints and —AW is the work we need to perform to (reversibly) add a new internal
constraint into the system (see reference [23]). Note that — AW, is also the work done by the system
along the inverse path [23] but only if the new internal constraint is released reversibly. In fact, in an
irreversible process related to the removal of the internal constraint, the system’s work —Awit
can even be zero and, in this case, the work we have done to impose the internal constraint —-AW,
is completely converted into heat upon the constraint removal (like a free expansion without a
piston). The heat exchanged with the surroundings is AQ, and the second law states that it will
be smaller than the increase in entropy produced when some internal constraint is removed
(spontaneous or induced process),

TAS > AQ. (2.2)

In terms of work, this relation implies that the system does maximum work when the internal
constraint is released under control or, more precisely, reversibly,

—AW, > —AWi™ > 0. (2.3)

Adaptive molecular resolution permits one to play with a new type of work source called
alchemic free energy. Like in the Middle Ages, this work is that needed for transmutation of
simple metal (CG model) into gold (atomistic model).
