SCFs, then use SCF solutions for electrosynthetic purposes [19]. Initial work with NH3
showed through chronocoulometric techniques that the diffusivity and thus mass transport
of m-chloronitrobenzene was enhanced in supercritical conditions [26]. Crooks & Bard [22,23]
also reported on the first electrochemistry of organic compounds in scNH3; they noted that
reactions in liquid NH3 could also be accomplished in scNH3. Their work demonstrated that
the dielectric constant and density could be manipulated in scNH3 by changing the pressure
or temperature [22]. Bard and co-workers [24,25,27] studied the use of HzO as an SCF for
electrochemistry. The unique properties of water near its critical point render it a good solvent : =

for both organics and salts [19]. The experimental difficulties associated with scH,O, including Sy
high critical temperatures, pressures (Tc = 647 K, pc = 22.1 MPa) and corrosion, make it difficult : 2
to use [19,24]. McDonald et al. [24] described additional difficulties associated with working with : &
scH2O including long equilibration times and the fact that electrodes could not be removed and 22
replaced for cleaning or inspection; the latter is a common problem when working with any SCF. [4

Toghill et al. [28] have recently published a mini-review on SCFs that gives a brief overview of : ie
the literature relating to the electrochemistry in SCFs. Grinberg & Mazin [29] have reviewed the : z
literature on electrochemistry in seCOz and scCO2 with various co-solvents, up to 1998. : Ss

(b) Electrochemistry in supercritical carbon dioxide

Although being dismissed as an SCF for preparative electrolyses by Silvestri ef al. [18],
carbon dioxide has been used as an SCF for electrochemistry [7,8,10,12-14,30-57]. Supercritical
COp, although having a low dielectric constant (Â¢ <2) [31], is of interest as a solvent for
electrochemistry as it is non-toxic, inexpensive, non-flammable and relatively inert. The easily
