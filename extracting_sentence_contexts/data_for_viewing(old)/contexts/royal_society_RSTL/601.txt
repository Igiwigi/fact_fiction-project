tact with it; but that a large proportion of it escapes in rays,
which do not heat the transparent air through which they pass,
but, like light, generate heat only when, and where, they are
stopped and absorbed; I suspected that, in every case. when,
in the foregoing experiments, the cooling of my instruments
was expedited by coverings applied to their metallic surfaces,
those coverings must, by s0me means or other, have facilitated
and accelerated the emission of calorific rays from the hot surface,

Those suspicions implied, it is true, the s1pposition that dif-
ferent substances, heated to the same temperature, emit unequal
quantities of calorific rays; but I saw no reason why this might
not be the case in fact; and I hastened to make the following
experiments, which put the matter beyond all doubt.

Exper. No. 12. Two equal cylindrical vessels, made of sheet
brass, and polished very bright, each g inches in diameter, and
4 inches long, suspended by their oblique necks, in a horizontal
position, (being placed on their wooden stands,) were filled
with water at the temperature of 180*; and their circular flat
bottoms were presented, in a vertical position, to the two balls
of the thermoscope, at the distance of 2 inches.

When the two hot bodies were presented, at the same moment,
to the two balls of the instrument, or, what was till better,
