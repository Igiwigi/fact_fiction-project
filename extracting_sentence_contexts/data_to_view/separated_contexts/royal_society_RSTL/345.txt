I have purposely avoided any reasoning on the causes
of the loss of vital heat .on the change of media in the ex-
periments recited. It may be supposed that during immer-
sjon, the water immediately in contact with the skin having
become heated to a certain degree, the naked body, on rising
from it into the air, was in fact exposed to a colder medium,
and thus the loss of heat, in this instance, produced. My ex=-

having been made in contact with the body, I will not deny
that there is some foundation for the remark ; and the cases,
it must be allowed, are by no means exactly parallel between
immersion in an open vessel, however large, and immersion in
the sea, where the constant undulation may be presumed to
occasion* a continual change in the surrounding' fluid.
