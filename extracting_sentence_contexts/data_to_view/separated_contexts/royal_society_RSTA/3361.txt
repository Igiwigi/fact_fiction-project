From the researches of M. Lepuc and Professor Morury it is probable that the
above numbers for hydrogen are a little, perhaps nearly one thousandth part, too
high. The correction to very small pressures has to be made in a different manner
for hydrogen and for the other gases, in consequence of the fact that the observed
ratio of densities corresponded not to 0° C., but to 16° C.t Now the observed values
of B for hydrogen and oxygen relate to about 11° C., so that if we correct « to 0° C.,
we are, in fact, altering it in the wrong direction. I have employed as the correcting
factor to 16° C. the value 1°00118. It may be noticed that the discrepancy between my ratio of hydrogen to oxygen
and that of M. Lepuc is partially explained by the fact that my comparisons were at
16° C., and his at 0° C,

The uncorrected number for nitrogen (14°003 corresponding to O = 16) has already
been given,§ and contrasted with the 14:05 obtained by Sras.
