example, the first exact describer of Human Osteology, when treating of the lumbar
vertebr&, observes,—* 5. Betwixt the roots of the superior oblique and transyerse
processes a small rising may be observed, where some of the © musculi erectores
trunci corporis' are fixed*.” And SormMERRING bears testimony to the accuracy of
Moxxo's observation of this © small rising” as a constant part, by calling it © processus
accessorius processui transverso et articulari superiori interpositus,” There are, in
fact, two such accessory Processes, as SOEMMERRING, indeed, seems to indicate. One
of these ©small risings* or © accessory processes,” although it seems 80 insignificant,
and is s0 8mall, as to be commonly passed over without notice in our modern an-
thropotomical compilations%, is not only 80 constant as to merit unfailing notice in
the human subject; but, in extending our comparisons from Man to the lower mam-
malia, we find it speedily, in the Quadrumanous Order, for example, gaining a de-
velopment which makes it, in the dorsal and lumbar regions, more conspicuous than
the articular processes themselves : whence Cuvigs, observing its relation to the
anterior of these processes, calls it * une seconde apophyse articulaireh;” and M. pz
BLainvilre, struck rather with the shape of the process, calls it © apophyse styloide||;”
whilst M. STraus-DuRcknei, regarding it as a sort of accessory transverse process,
prefers to call it © apophyse plagienne@| :” I have termed it the * anapophysis**,” The
8econd tubercle is usually a somewhat larger process, situated between the diapo-
physis and the upper or anterior zygapophysis; it is equally constant in certain ver-
tebr& in Man, and attains in some mammals, the Armadillos for instance, as great a
length as the spinous process itself.
