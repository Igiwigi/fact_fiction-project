4s an interesting question, whether the freedom of the corpuscles from adhesivencss
th is due to ome active operation of the tissnes upon the vital fluid, or whether
eir adhesiveness in an inflamed part or outside the body is the result of a prejudicial
ence exerted upon the blood by the irritated tissnes, or by the objects of the
al world with which it comes in contact when shed. The fact that the non-
iveness of the corpuscles within the vessels continues in an amputated limb,
-  ghows that it is independent of the central organs of the nervous system, and probably
too of any nutritive actions going on in the tisswes. Als, if the latter were concerned
in its production, we should expect to find the corpuscles adhesive in the large arteries
and veins of the webs, since it is doubtless chiefly in the capillaries that the mutual
=w interchanges take place between the blood and the solid elements of the body. It may

S upon it by the consideration of the canses of the coagulation of the blood, which seems

S tobe a closely allied subject.
