It will,
however, be more convenient to employ formule in which m takes successive
integral values only, N being then replaced by 4N or by a number of that order of
magnitude. As the positions of the lines have been determined with considerable precision, and
the lines are fairly numerous, it seemed desirable to compare the accuracy of a variety
of formule, some with N assumed the same as for hydrogen, and others with this term
calculated from the lines themselves. The fact that not all the lines have been
resolved, and the slight uncertainty as to the absolute positions of the last two or
three lines of the series, renders the comparison to some extent wanting in finality, but
the results may nevertheless be of interest. For comparison of observed and calculated wave-numbers, the unresolved lines have
been regarded as consisting of two components separated by 0°99, one having a wave-
number greater by 0°33 than that of the unresolved line, and the other 0°66 less, since
the more refrangible component is about double the intensity of the less refrangible. The wave-numbers adopted in the calculations for the less refrangible components,
adjusted in this manner, are given in the first column of Table II.
