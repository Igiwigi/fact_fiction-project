that a fluid would be stable at all speeds if Q,/2, > R,*/R.*, and unstable if
Q,/Q, < R2/R,*. The former of these is equally true for viscous fluids, but the
latter is modified in the sense that if Q,/, < R,*/R,*? the motion is unstable only
if Q, is greater than the value given by (5.6). It should be noticed that if the analogy
on which Lord RAYLEIGH based his theory is strictly adhered to, the case when
Q,/2, < R,?/R.2 would be unstable at all speeds, even in a viscous fluid; for a
heterogeneous fluid in unstable equilibrium under gravity is not more stable when it is
viscous than when it is inviscid.

The second prediction which can be made is that in the unstable case the type of
instability which will form is periodic along the length of the cylinder; with a wave-
length almost exactly equal to twice the thickness of the layer of fluid between the
cylinders. This is a consequence of the fact that 6 = 1, for the wave-length of the
unstable disturbance is 27/2 = 27/0 = 2d/0 and this is

2d when @=1. ia 0 oe io

It will be shown in the second part of this paper that the symmetrical type of
instability does actually occur under experimental conditions, and that both these
predictions are verified with considerable accuracy.

Numerical Approximations when 1— is not small.

When 1~—, is not small the first few diagonal terms may be of the same order of
magnitude as the neighbouring terms which are of the form (m*—n*)~*, but on passing
