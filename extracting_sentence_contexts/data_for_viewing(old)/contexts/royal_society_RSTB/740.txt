It will be noticed that the total volume of carbon dioxide obtained amounted to
more than sixty-nine divisions, and that more would have been obtained had I carried
the experiment further.

I stopped the experiment at the point referred to, because I wanted to answer two
questions with regard to which doubts might possibly arise. First, however, it
should be stated, that although the organism had been in the apparatus, and deprived
of atmospheric oxygen, for more than six weeks (September 11 to November 18), and
had enormously increased in volume, and presumably in weight, it was noteworthy
that no characteristic gelatinous cushion had made its appearance.

I argued that this might possibly be owing to the fact that I had been drawing
off the carbon dioxide, almost as fast as it was formed, and that probably—judging
from what occurred in similar cultures in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide—the
cushion would form if I let that gas accumulate.

* The temperature of the tube f was allowed to fall to 10°-12° C. between the 8th and the 20th.


AND THE ORGANISMS COMPOSING IT. 173

Since it would not do to leave the apparatus as it was until the pressure of gas
dislocated the mercury junction with the pump, I sealed off the tube f with a blow-
pipe flame* just below the cotton-wool w’, and put it aside at 25° C.
