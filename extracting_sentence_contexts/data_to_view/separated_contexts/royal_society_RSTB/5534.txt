COONa + 3Nal + 3H,0. Summary. A method is described (p. 140) for the quantitative estimation of kojic acid (5-hydroxy-
2-hydroxymethyl-y-pyrone) which depends on the fact that kojic acid is quantitatively
decomposed by alkaline iodine solution under experimental conditions which have been
determined and of which details are given. The equation of this reaction has been established (p. 141) and the mechanism by
which the reaction takes place has been determined (p. 148).
