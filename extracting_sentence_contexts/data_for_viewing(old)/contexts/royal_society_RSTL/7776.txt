No reason is assigned in the records for the adoption for the first two periods of a
different true-meridian reading to that which was observed ; but it may be presumed
that in the latter case the intention was to produce that accordance, which doubtless
existed in fact, between the values of declination in that and the preceding and following
periods. Any periodical variations which the observations may, however, exhibit will
be unaffected by the meridian reading, 80 long as none of the observations of any single
period involved belong to more than one series, or 80 long as each series of observations
is treated independently of the others; and it is only when combining the different series
together for the elimination of secular variation and for the evaluation of absolute deeli-
nation at a given epoch, that regard must be paid to the actual disconnexion of the
several series. In the investigations of solar and lunar diurnal variations which follow
or are in progress, no incomplete days, nor any comprising observations from different series
have been made use of.
