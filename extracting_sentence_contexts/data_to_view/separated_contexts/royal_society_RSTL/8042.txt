that from any point can be drawn concyclic planes which will intersect the planes of
the nodal conics of Z in four tetragrams circumscribed to the nodal conics. Now if the
points from which the four concyclic tangent planes are drawn be the pole of the plane
of one of the nodal conics (that is, in fact, if it be one of the four centres of inversion of
the sphero-quartic), the proposition is evident. and the proposi-
