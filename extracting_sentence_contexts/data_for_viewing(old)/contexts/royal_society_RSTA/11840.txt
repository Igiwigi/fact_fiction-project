alteration of titanoferrite. It seems probable that in this rock we have examples of
both kinds of paramorphism between ilmenite and sphene. The original coloured
sphene is seen passing through a white opaque compound into titanoferrite ; and on
the other hand a colourless sphene occurs which is probably of secondary origin and
results from an alteration of the titanoferrite which originally formed a constituent
of the rock.

The other accessory constituents of these interesting pyroxene gneisses are apatite,
which is found enclosed in all the other minerals of the rock, zircon, which is abundant,
and occasionally corundum. The existence of this mineral in these peculiar basic

a S gneisses is a very interesting and, as we shall hereafter show, a very significant fact.
<i Some of the chief types of these pyroxene gneisses are illustrated in figs. 15, 16,
Zand 17, and in Plate 6, fig. 1.
2 Rocks of similar mineralogical constitution to these coarse pyroxene-gneisses, but
Hof finer texture and assuming a more or less perfect granulitic habit, appear to be
= by no means rare in Burma. They exhibit a great diversity in the characters of their
6 constituent minerals, but nearly all consist of a lime- or lime-soda-felspar (more or
5 Pless altered to scapolite and sometimes to calcite and quartz) and a pyroxene which
sbmay be some form either of enstatite or augite, or may be partially or wholly con-
= verted into a hornblende or a biotite. These rocks may be designated pyroxene-
*8 granulites and pyroxene-scapolite-granulites, and I will proceed to describe some of
EB their most interesting varieties.*
