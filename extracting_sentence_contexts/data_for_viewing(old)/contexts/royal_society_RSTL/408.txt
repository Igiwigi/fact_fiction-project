the whole tending to a confirmation of the general system set
forth, in 179g; and, in one instance, affording, perhaps, a
clearer proof of the strength of the stream, in respect of its
northerly direction, than any of those, adduced on the former
occasion.

In pursuing the detail of these facts and observations, I
shall begin, in the neighbourhood of Cape Finisterre, and pro-
ceed with the course of the current, along the Bay of Biscay ;
and thence, across the mouth of the British Channel, to Scilly,
and the entrance of St. George's Channel.
