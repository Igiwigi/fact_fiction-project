Bris is the equation to a parabola.

€The curves of the first singular system are hyperbolas, having their asymptotes

Parallel to the axes of coordinates and having contact of the second order with this
abola.

— The complete primitive represents a series of parabolas with axes parallel to

he axis of y, and each having contact of the second order with some one of the

perbolas, and, in fact, with two of them, since « is given in terms of and ¢ by a
= equation.
iB § 57. In order to make up further examples we only need to take :—

Q (1.) A curve A.

(2.) A series of curves A,, depending on one parameter, each having contact
of order x with the curve A.

(3.) A series of curves As, involving two parameters, each having contact of
order x with some one of the curves A,, and so on, till we have a series of curves A,,
involving nm parameters, each having contact of order n with some one of the
curves Sis
