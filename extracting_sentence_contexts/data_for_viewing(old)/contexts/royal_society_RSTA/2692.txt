event. This may be estimated to be ~1 [s]. The model possesses two distinct and independent
length scales: one associated with the fault slip and the other with the distance along the fault. The
former length scale is the critical slip distance £, which was taken to be ~1 [cm], while the other
is the distance the rupture propagates per unit time, vs/@, which was taken to be ~2 — 3 [km],
where vu; is the s-wave velocity along the fault. The typical plate velocity is several [cm/year] and
corresponds to a very small number of v ~ 10-7 — 10~®. The spring constant kp was related to the
normal stress as N/kpL ~ 10% — 10°. Then, as C is known to take a value around 3, c would be of
order 107-103, with a and b being one or two orders of magnitude smaller than c. The crossover
velocity v* is hard to estimate, though it should be much smaller than unity, and we take it as
a parameter.

In our simulations, for the sake of computational feasibility, we concentrate on the strong
frictional instability regime where the b parameter is greater than a critical value b,. In fact, b,
is determined solely by the elastic parameter ¢ [40-42]. In 1D, it is given by b, = 2¢? + 1, while in
2D it is given by bp = 4¢? + 1. In the following, we put ¢ =3 corresponding to b, = 37, and vary b
in the range of b > bc, ie. 40 < b < 80. Other parameters are fixed to be a=1, c= 1000, v* = 10-2
and v = 10-8.

Concerning the system size L, we put mainly L = 500, but additionally put L = 1000 and 1500 to
check the system-size dependence. Periodic boundary conditions are assumed in both directions.
Concerning the initial conditions, all blocks are assumed to be at rest, i.e. vj; =0 (1 <i,j <L)att=
0, and the state variable is set to 4; =10!2. This large number comes from the fact that the interval
time of large events of the model tends to be extremely long reflecting the very slow loading
velocity of v =10-®. The displacement of each block is taken to be random uniformly distributed
between [—500, 500] from block to block. Events at earlier times are transient and are affected in
