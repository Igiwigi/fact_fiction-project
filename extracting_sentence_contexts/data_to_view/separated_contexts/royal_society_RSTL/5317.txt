The air getting looſe
into the ſubſtance of the lungs cannot be parted
with in exfpiration ; it conſequently is retained there,
and the ſpace it occupies prevents as much of the
external air being received into the lungs as its own
quantity. As, from their inceſſant motion, injuries
to the lungs are not eafily removed, when once a
rupture is made, every fit of coughing or other vio-
lent exertion extravaſates more ajr, Hence the rup-

ture ſtill continuing, and probably increaſing, more
and more air becomes extravaſate, until, as in the
preſent caſe, the quantity becomes ſo great, as not only
to impede the courſe of the blood through the lungs,
but the internal prefſure of the extravaſate air pre-
vents the ingreſs of a quantity of freſh air, ſufficient
tocool and attenuatethe blood. In fact, a ſmall part
only of the lungs is employed ; as the extravaſate air,
though ſtill in an elaſtic ſtate, anſwers by no means
the purpoſes of freſh air in reſpiration ; as the former,
by its confinement in the lungs, is very foon deveſted
of its vivifying ſpirit, that principle which is ſoon
deſtroyed in animal bodies, and which ſome chemi-
cal phyfiologiſts have ſuppoſed to be an acid nitrous
Gas, and is moſt eſſential to human life. Hence, in
a very ſhort time, the effefts are too_obvious to be
mentioned; and death muſt ſoon follow, as hap-
pened to the perſon, who is the ſubje& of this com-
munication,

I am, with all poſlible regard,

Humble ſervant,
