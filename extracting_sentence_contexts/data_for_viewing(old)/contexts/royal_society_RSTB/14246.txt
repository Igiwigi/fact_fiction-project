response to the stresses created by having to live in very
large social groups [56], a problem they solve by substructur-
ing the group so as to create a multilevel social system that
exploits the capacity to form temporary herds and at the

same time allows the animals to defuse the stresses of
group-living by dispersing when it is safe to do so [26,57].

Equation (2.1) predicts that humans living in the mean
observed group size for contemporary humans of 154 [45]
would need to devote 41.2% of their waking day to grooming
time if they were to bond their groups by social grooming alone
(the horizontal dotted line in figure 1). In fact, a sample of time
budgets from seven societies drawn from a wide range of cul-
tures gives an average of 20% of the day devoted to social
interaction [58]. In other words, it seems that modern
humans use the same amount of time as the most social nonhu-
man primates, but somehow manage to use it more efficiently
in order to ‘groom’ with more individuals.

Grooming is extremely costly in terms of the time that has
to be invested in a relationship to maintain it at a specific
degree of emotional closeness, and this is as true for
humans as it is for other primates [59-61]. Given that
a minimum time investment is needed in each relationship
