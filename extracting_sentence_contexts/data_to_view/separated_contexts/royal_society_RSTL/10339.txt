The
mineral manure and nitrate of soda, on the other hand, which had yielded the heaviest.
firsb crop gave less excessive aftergrowth, and but few flowering s8tems. Under all
conditions as to manure the second cuttings were, however, much heavier than the
average ; indeed, excepting with the nitrate, generally very heavy. Owing to the amount of the crops, to the difficulty which had been found in dealing
with the second crops without, removing them, and to the fact that a period of
20 years had now been completed, during which only the first crops had been removed,
it was decided henceforward to cut and remove the second crops whenever practicable ;
and, accordingly, the heavy second crops of 1875 were 80 treated. It is obvious that the removal of the second crops materially affects the condition of
the land, and in the case of the deficiently-manured plots tends to much more rapid
exhaustion. Tt is also obvious that, with this change, a new element in the struggle
among the components of the mixed herbage is brought into play, or at any rate the
effects of an old one are considerably intensified.
