hormones, and the germinal epithelium remained quiescent.

When the first-year Continental starlings arrived in the British Isles in autumn, they
could not be distinguished from the first-year British birds, as the ovaries of both races were
in the same stage of development. About the middle of February there was a burst of
ovarian activity in both races, but in the Continental birds it was less intense. This activity
showed itself especially as an increase in size of the largest primary oocytes. The germinal
epithelium remained inactive. The growth of the primary oocytes became more rapid in
all birds in March, but the speed of growth in the British females was always faster than
that in the Continental females (figures 47, 48; figures 67, 68, plate 15). The statistical
comparisons of the ovaries of the birds of the two races in February and March are given
in table 9. The same method of comparison is followed as in the case of the males. From
this it is seen that in February P, the probability that the two races are in fact identical,
is less than two in a hundred, and therefore the observed differences are probably significant.
In March, as P is less than 0-01, the differences observed must be considered significant.
