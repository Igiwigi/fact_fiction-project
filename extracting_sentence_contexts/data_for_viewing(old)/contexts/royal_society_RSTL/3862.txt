IN the June Number of Mures's Archiv (for 1842) there appeared a paper from
the pen of Dr. Stuon of Berlin, announcing the discovery of certain animalcules,
which he regarded as Acari, in the sebaceous substance of the follicles of the human
skin. After perusing his account of these singular creatures I was induced to
engage in the inquiry, and was $0 much interested in what I saw, that I devoted six
months of exclusive labour to the study of their structure and mode of development.
The result of my research is at variance with the description of their structure given
by Dr. S110N; it corroborates Dr. S1Mox only in the general fact of the existence of
these animals and their diversity of form, while it offers several new and original ob-
servations for consideration. Among the latter I may refer especially to the anatomy
of the head, which Dr. Simon regards as composed of certain moveable organs, but
which in reality is distinct from those organs ; the discovery of eyes; of a power of
retracting the head within the thorax; of ova; of a remarkable embryonic form :
and of the progressive development of the young animal.

The situation of the animalcule in the zoological system is a question $till to be
determined, and it is one on which I have felt unwilling to speculate until a com-
plete description of the creature shall have been placed before scientific entomologists.
"The name given to the animal by Dr. Errcnsox of Berlin and adopted by Dr. Simox,
namely Acarus folliculorum, is founded on the erroneous view of the anatomy of the
