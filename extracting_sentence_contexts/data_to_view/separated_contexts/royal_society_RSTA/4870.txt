With the arrangement described the conductivity of the condensed layer was
‘osmall compared with that of the sulphur itself. This result was true whether the
quartz rods were in or out. The facts as to the conductivity of the surface of annealed
sulphur were confirmed and completed at a later time. = With respect to the tests of specific inductive capacity and residual charge, we
éwill only state that by a comparison of this film with a bit of specially-prepared
“mica, we observed, for the first time, that striking absence of residual effect which
gwill be described when we deal with a film free from the objections we have raised
gto this one.
3 It now became clear that we must reduce the electric stress on the sulphur if we
desired tu be free from the risks of breaking the film.
