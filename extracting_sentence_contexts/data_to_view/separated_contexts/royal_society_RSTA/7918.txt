Figs. 24, 25, Plate 8, are X-ray photographs of small
bundles of unstretched silk and stretched human hair, respectively, taken under similar
conditions with Cu Kz rays in a cylindrical camera of radius 3-98 em. (The hair was
stretched in steam to an extension of about 100%.) It will be seen that there is a
strong resemblance between the two photographs, in particular with regard to the
repetition of pattern parallel to the fibre axis. For silk the period in this direction is
about 7 A.,* while for B-keratin it is rather less, something between 6-7 and 6-8 A.t
(for the detailed description of the two keratin photographs, see I). It is not at all
probable—for keratin at least (see above)—that lengths such as these represent the true
period along a polypeptide chain-system, but are rather an expression of the fact that
in the simplest formulation of the fully-extended general chain :—

the side-chains project alternately on opposite sides of the main-chain. (This poimt
will be clearer from the models discussed below.) From an examination of all the
available evidence, we have to conclude that the submicroscopic crystallites of biological
structures are simply bundles, of varying degrees of neatness, of long molecular chains
which for fibres such as silk and hair all lie approximately parallel to the direction of the
fibre axist. Unlike ordinary “laboratory ” crystals, therefore, the molecule or mole-
cular complex in a fibre crystallite is in general considerably longer than the length of
the crystallographic cell in the direction of the chain axis; the chains run straight
through the geometrical cells, so to speak, in such a manner that the primitive
