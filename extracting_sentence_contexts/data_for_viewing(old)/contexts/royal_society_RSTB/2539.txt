Farmer has more recently described a similar phenomenon in the adult plant of
Helminthostachys zeylanica. The central cylinder of the Ophioglossaceze closely
resembles that of the Osmundacew. Evidences of its derivation from an originally
concentric stelar tube are, however, not so abundant. The presence of concentric
petiolar bundles in Botrychium virginianum and of mesarch wood in the stem of
Helminthostachys, however, point in this direction (FARMER, ‘ Ann. of Bot.,’ vol. 13,
p. 432).

Schizwacee.—There is considerable variety of stelar structure in this group. — Its
anatomy has been studied by Prati, and more recently by Boopte (“On the
Anatomy of the Schizeeacew,” ‘Ann. Bot., vol. 15). A number of illustrations have
been prepared for this order, but the admirable recent work of BoopLE cited above
makes their publication unnecessary, since, in regard to the facts of structure and
development, my results are in agreement with his.

In Lygodium the cauline central cylinder is protostelic, i.e, a non-medullated
concentric strand. In Anemia phyllitidis the adult stem is characterised by the
presence of so-called polystelic structure. By studying the development of this
species, however, it is possible to trace the stelar systems back to a condition where
there is present a concentric tube interrupted by foliar lacunz, a condition which is
