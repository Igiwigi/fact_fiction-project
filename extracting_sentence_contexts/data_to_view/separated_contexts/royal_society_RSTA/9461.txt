The ratio found in daylight was 0-924, so that here again
we have excellent evidence of the stability of these cells. The effect of varying anode potential on B. 299 is well shown. There can be no
doubt but that a potential as high as 120 volts would be advantageous with Burt
cells, especially in very bright light, if it were not for the fact that the relative
importance of leakage currents would be increased by this high voltage. We have
always adopted 60 volts as a convenient standard for emission cells. At this
voltage the change in sensitivity is no more than 0-4 per volt for the Burt cells
and is much less with most of the others, save the large cell X 41.
