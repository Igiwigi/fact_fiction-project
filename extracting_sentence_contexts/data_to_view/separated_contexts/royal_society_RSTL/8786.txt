For ſeveral years he has done
me the honour of being my correſpondent, and I
have communicated ſeveral valuable papers from him
to the Royal Socicty. The diſcoveries made in the ſummer of the year
1752 will make it memorable in the hiſtory of elec-
tricity, Theſe have opened a new field to philoſo-

phers, and have given them room to hope, that what
they have learned. before in their muſeums, they may
apply, with more propriety than they hitherto could
hays done, in illuſtrating the nature and effets of
thunder ; a phenomenon hitherto almoſt inacceſſible
to their inquiries,

But to make the moſt certain advantage of theſe
new diſcoveries, we ſhould confine ourſelves to facts ;
and if we do draw conſequences from them, they
ſhould be immediate and neceſſary ones ; for, when-
ever our diſcoveries ſeem to promiſe to be uſeful and
important, we are apt to hope and expect great ſuc-
ceſs from them : we mult therefore be careful to re-
firain our imagination, or we ſhall fall into error. Theſe conſiderations have induced our author to
examine with care; what may truly be concluded
from the experiments propoſed by Mr. Franklin of
Philadelphia, and fince carried into execution in

France, and elſewhere, in relation to the electricity '

of the clouds during a ſtorm ; by weighing every cir-
cumſtance, and comparing the greatneſs of the ef-
fects, which have been had in view, with the more
than apparent inſufficiency of the means, which have
been employed to produce them. He thinks, he ſees
clearly, that the conſidering the electriſation of pointed
bodies as a proof of leſſening the matter of thunder,
is abuſing a real diſcovery to flatter ourſelves with a
vain hope ; and it is chiefly to diſipate this error, if
it yet ſubſiſts, that determined our author to print,
in the work before us, ſome reflexions, which he had
made at firſt only for himſelf, and a few perſons, to
whom he was defirous of communicating his opinion.
