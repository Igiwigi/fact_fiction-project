regularly succeeded by a whorl of sporangiophores. In the strobili the leaves of
successive whorls show a radial alternation, as in the vegetative shoot, and it seems
natural to suppose that they accordingly correspond to the ordinary succession of
them in the vegetative region, But in addition to the sterile leaves, and not
disturbing their succession, are the sporangiophores ; if these were rightly regarded as
leaves, it might be anticipated that the alternate succession of the sterile leaves would
be disturbed where the sporangiophores intervene between their whorls, but it is not.
Again, the number of the sporangiophores is usually half that of the sterile leaves,
but the number is not strictly maintained, while their disposition in vertical, non-
alternating series is on a plan quite apart from that of the alternating whorls of
sterile leaves. ‘Their position on the internode also, sometimes at the base, sometimes
at the upper limit, often in the middle, again shows their independence of the sterile
leaves. These facts together point to their being independent structures.

THE MORPHOLOGY OF SPORE-PRODUCING MEMBERS. 241

Tn considering the probability of this view, the condition of the spore-hearing parts in
other homosporous Pteridophytes should be brought into comparison. Spore-bearing
parts of a similar form to the sporangiophores of the Equisetines, bearing like them
sporangia radially disposed, with a central vascular supply, occur in various positions
in other homosporous Pteridophytes; for instance, irregularly disposed in a broad
