The part adjoining the western shore of the glacier is in-
deed highly crevassed, and therefore unfit for this experiment ; but at the distance of
fifty or sixty yards from the moraine it becomes remarkably flat and compact for a
space of about seventy yards in width, and several hundred yards in length, throughont
which space there is not a single open crevasse. Now this compact area of ice pre-
sents the veined structure in a nearly longitudinal direction, with a degree of delicacy
and distinctness not to be found in any other part of this glacier (as I had already re-
marked in my Travels, p. 159), and it contains no other trace of a system of longitn-
dinal fissures or lines of separation of any kind, which could render mechanically
possible the distortion of this flat compact surface of 80 great an extent. Now I have
always observed that the veined structure near the side of a glacier is best developed
where the ice is least crevassed, or the continuity of the mass most perfect ; a fact
stated and referred to its true canse from the first date of my speculations on the origin
of the blue veins, in the following words :—© The veined structure invariably tends to
disappear when a glacier becomes 80 crevassed as to lose horizontal cohesion, as when
it is divided into pyramidal masses. Now this imwediately follows from our theory ;

each mass moves singly, and the structure disappears very gradually *.”
