It is observed that in
both cases the folding angle decays away from the origin.

(b) The role of microinertia

The role of microinertia is investigated in this section, as connected to the formation of folding
patterns. An inspection of equation (4.15) shows that the microinertia lengths (11, h22) are related
to the (lower) second-order spatial derivatives of the out-of-plane displacement. In fact, for fixed
