5. Conclusion

There is no empirical evidence for the bare vacuum energy of fields. Neither does the bare
vacuum energy do mechanical work [12], nor does it gravitate. Therefore it seems wise to take
for the vacuum energy in the universe a renormalized energy density. Assuming the same
renormalization procedure as for the Lifshitz theory in planar media [47], while taking into


account cosmological horizons and causality, gives a vacuum energy density of the right order
of magnitude [57]. The resulting theory makes concrete predictions about the cosmic evolution,
equation (4.2), apart from one parameter in equation (4.5) that cannot be determined yet. The
result seems encouraging, but of course it remains to be seen whether the theory reproduces the
astronomical facts in detail, and not only their order of magnitude. The theory was developed [57]
for the electromagnetic field as carrier of vacuum fluctuations; it therefore remains to be checked
whether it can be extended to other fields.

Analogues of gravity [23-26] have played a decisive role in developing the theory [57] and
analogues may be important for testing crucial components of the theory in experiments. The
theory extends the renormalization procedure of the Casimir stress in inhomogeneous planar
media [47] to spatially uniform, time-dependent materials. Direct measurements of the Casimir
force inside planar media are difficult, the easiest is perhaps a test of the extreme behaviour
predicted in [56]. But one could emulate Casimir forces with other fluctuations, as long as they
have a similar spectrum than the vacuum fluctuations, replacing the f in the Casimir force by

an effective noise parameter of significantly larger magnitude, which would enhance the effect. : =
