Their calculation was given almost in full, and was performed by essentially the same methods
as those explained above. The work was made rather more lengthy than necessary by the use of an
unsymmetrical transformation of the integrals in place of that given in equations (13)-(17), to which I was
led while endeavouring to simplify the calculation of Ajgu(u?+12+w*)o. The calculation of Au(u? + v* +1?)
was also complicated by the fact that the gas was not assumed to be at rest; but on revision, despite these
simplifications, I decided to omit the routine calculations altogether. Equation (26) was not given in the paper as originally written because it is connected with the
conductivity of mixed gases, and I was then unaware of any experiments on the subject which would
make so tedious a calculation worth the while. I have since found such experimental data, and have
therefore worked out the formula (26), the results of which (as will be seen in Part III.) show very
satisfactory agreement with the observations.—Note added October, 1911.
