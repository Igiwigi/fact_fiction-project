It is therefore necessary to inquire whether there is actually any finite

3 range of values of A for which the equation (17) has a continuous real solution for y as a

3 function of x, for all real values of x and Â¢. Ifthe equation has such a solution, it is necessarily

eI expressible in the form (18).

@ The maximum permissible value of A for a continuous free surface to exist is given by

the maximum value of A defined by the implicit relation

P(A, x,y) =; (69)

where # is the pressure expressed in non-dimensional units. The function f(A, x,y) is in
fact the left-hand side of equation (17). Since A, regarded asa function of real variables x and y, is to be a maximum, we must have
