see that NP-to-LP transitions occur at higher carbon dioxide gas mole fractions, corresponding to
higher partial pressures. At 20% carbon dioxide no LP to NP transition takes place.

8. Binary mixture adsorption as function of gas-phase composition

In order to reproduce the Baron and co-workers [37] experimental mixture results, we have
calculated adsorbed amounts against carbon dioxide gas mole fraction curves at 1 and 7.5 bar
(figure 5, note the different Y axis/adsorption scales) using the parameters for the pure single
components and using both models A (lower part) and B (upper part).

The agreement of model B (gradual transition approach) results with the experimental data is
reasonably good. The apparent inconsistency of model A predictions could be simply explained
by the fact that the LP/NP transition occurs at all mole fractions at pressures above 7.5 bar,
figure 4(a-e). At 1 bar (figure 5(f)) the LP-to-NP transition occurs at a gas-phase carbon dioxide
mole fraction of around 0.25. At 0-0.25 mole fractions, the structure exists at LP of low occupation
and at higher mole fractions 0.25-1 the structure exists at NP. The model B 1 bar adsorption
(figure 5(a)) is the rounded adsorption curve version of model A. At 7.5 bar (figure 5(/)), the
LP-to-NP transition occurs at a gas-phase carbon dioxide mole fraction of around 0.55. At 0-0.55
mole fractions, the structure exists at LP of low occupation and at higher mole fractions 0.55-1
the structure exists at NP. At pressures above 7.5 bar, a reverse transition from NP to LP occurs
(figure 4, upper part) leading to higher adsorption. Considering the higher adsorbed amounts at
higher pressures, model B 7.5 bar adsorption (figure 5(e)) is the rounded adsorption curve version
of model A.
