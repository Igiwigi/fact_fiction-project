Example of a reservoir scale simulation showing the total amount of MVP loss for the different regimes with different Ds
viscosities (and therefore response timescales) for the wall rocks. At high melt fraction, MVP mass loss is negligible, while it is Dw
significant in the lower melt fraction regime (total volatile mass fraction goes from about 5.5 to less than 3 wt% in this particular :
case). 3

reservoir, potentially leading to a less explosive eruptive style if the system does erupt [40]. Moreover, the fact that melt-rich pockets tend to outgas more slowly than crystal-rich areas leads
to MVP accumulation in such melt-rich pockets, fostering larger eruptions due to the increase in
compressibility [12,37,40]. Apart from those mechanical effects on magma reservoir dynamics and volcanic behaviour,
the presence of an MVP, and the dynamics of outgassing, controls the rates and compositions
of gases that escape magmatic systems. As the composition of gases emitted during and in
between eruptive events are key to monitor active volcanic areas [41-45], and feed into global
volatile cycles on Earth [10,4648], it is of paramount importance to determine how such rates
and compositions might evolve as outgassing proceeds in crystallizing magma bodies
