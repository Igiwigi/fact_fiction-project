Low aspect ratio STs (bottom) exhibit natural
elongation because the close proximity of the centre column and the opposite side of the plasma forces the plasma away and
flattens its inboard edge, elongating the plasma with no contribution from the external magnetic field. Image: A. Sykes.

used to design ITER suggested the use of powerful devices operating at high/moderate field and
current, which would have to be large in order to handle the high power. (Experiments since have
suggested that the scaling could in fact be 6 independent, which could have significant impact on
the optimization of tokamak fusion performance [15].)

ITER was designed to be two to three times larger than JET in linear dimensions, with a 10-fold
increase in plasma volume. The main ITER design parameters are R=6.2m, V ~ 850m, Br(at
R)=5.3T. The unique international nature of ITER along with its size and engineering complexity
have resulted in cost over-runs and delays, and led some researchers to consider alternative
approaches, particularly as new technologies have become available over the intervening
timeframe.

(c) High-temperature superconductors

One of these technologies is the ‘high-temperature superconductor’ and at Tokamak Energy
we believe that this could be the key enabling technology that produces the large magnetic
fields needed for economical fusion power.
