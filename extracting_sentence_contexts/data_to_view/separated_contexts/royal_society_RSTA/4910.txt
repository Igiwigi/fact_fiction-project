by the second condition in the definition of a generous tuple, and the fact that any g € G is of the S
form :

& = (igi)

for some & € Gm 1G; C Z(G;) and gj € GC, so that g=zh with z=(&) € Z(G) and h=(g;) € G6. It follows that for any g = zh € G, we have

t(g) =t(zh) = t(z)t(h). =

As 1(z) is a scalar (because t if G-irreducible and z is central), we see that any G°-invariant : S
subspace is also G-invariant. a 1

Remark 2.5. This result would not extend if we allow G; not contained in Gy, G?: for instance, aS
if G=Oz,;, so that G? =SOo,, there exist irreducible representations of G which split in two : a
irreducible sub-representations when restricted to G°. 2B

We then state a preliminary result, which for convenience we express in the language of :3
Tannakian categories.
