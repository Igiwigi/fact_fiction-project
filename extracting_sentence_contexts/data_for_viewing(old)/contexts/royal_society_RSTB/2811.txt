The attempt will now be made to form a general view of the methods of advance of
the sporophyte to more elaborate types. Some of the main points which are material
features in those methods may be formulated, on the basis of the observations and
comparisons stated above, as follows :—

(1). Spore-producing cells form a part of the tissue of all sporophytes which complete
their part in the normal ontogenetic cycle; from this it is concluded that spore-
production was normally a constant event in their evolution.

(2). There is a general biological probability of increase of spore-production in
homosporous, land-living plants, since those with the largest spore-output are most
likely to maintain and spread their race, while the numerical question is not
complicated by the sexuality of the spores. As a matter of fact the number of cell-
divisions in the sporogenous tissue preceding the tetrad division is usually indefinite
in homosporous forms ; the capacity of increase is thus structurally evident in them.

(3). The Archegoniate sporophytes illustrate by numerous examples the sterilisation
of spore-producing cells, so as to form temporary nutritive cells, or permanent
