triple arc. Finally, Versrucce (1934) investigated the catenation in a trisomic
mutant from O. rubricalyx x blandina in which the maximum was a chain of 9
chromosomes and three pairs. These results are compiled in Table I, from which
it will be seen that in all the primary trisomics from O. Lamarckiana examined the
extra chromosome belonged to. the ring of 12, whereas in the half-mutant and in
the trisomic from deserens x nutans it belonged to a free pair.

All these results are summarized in Table II (p. 244).

The method of synapsis

In the earlier literature of the subject Oenothera was regarded as the outstanding
example of telosynapsis in plants. This was based upon the fact that in the forms
which we now speak of as showing catenation, more or fewer of the chromosomes
are arranged end-to-end in a ring in diakinesis and on the heterotypic spindle until
the connections between them are broken in anaphase. It is now known that in

most of the wild North American species the 14 chromosomes are thus normally
arranged in a closed ring. It has also been recognized from the first that the
chromosomes in the chains and rings are essentially whole somatic chromosomes,
