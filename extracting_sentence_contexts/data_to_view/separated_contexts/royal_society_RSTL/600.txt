The celerity with which the ball of the thermoscope acquired
heat, or cold, might be estimated by the velocity with which the
bubble of spirit of wine advanced, or retired, in its tube; but;
on the most careful and attentive observation, I could not per-
ceive that it moved faster when the ball was acquiring heat,
than when it was acquiring cold; provided that the hot and the
cold bodies, from which the calorific and frigoritic rays pro-
ceeded, were at the same relative distances. From these experiments, which I lately repeated at Geneva,
in the presence of Professor PicTer, Mons. de SaussuRE, M.
SENEBIER, and several other persons, we may venture to con-
clude, that, at equal intervals of temperature, the rays which
generate cold, are just as real, and justas intense, as those which
generate heat; or, that their actions are equally powerful, in
changing the temperatures of neighbouring bodies,

On a $uperficial view of this subject, it might appear extraor-
dinary, that 80 important a fact as that of the frigorific radiations

calorific radiations of hot bodies have been so well known ; but,
if we consider the matter with attention, our surprise will cease. Those radiations by means of which the temperatures of neigh-
bouring bodies are gradually changed and equalized, are not
sensible to our feeling, unless the intervals of temperature be
very considerable; and the constitution of things is such, that
while we are often exposed to the influence of bodies heated
several thousand degrees (as measured by the thermometer)
