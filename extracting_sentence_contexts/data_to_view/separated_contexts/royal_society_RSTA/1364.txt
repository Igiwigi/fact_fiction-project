Compare also the accounts in Sturm, * Geometrische Verwandschaften,’ p. 347 (1909), and Hupson,
‘Cremona Transformations,’ p. 167 (1927). + In fact the tangent cone to a ‘Y-primal at a point P of an n-ple base surface F will in general break up
into n primes through the tangent plane x at P; so that all points near P, which lie in a prime through
zt, impose the same condition on ‘Y-primals to contain them, and will be represented by the same point
P’ of S. This point P’, then, describes the E-curve of S which corresponds to the neighbourhood of P. Cf. Berttt, ‘ Introduzione alla Geom. Projettiva degli Tperspazi » (1923), Cap. 10, section 5. ,
