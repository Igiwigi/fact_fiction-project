a Faunal remains on the whole are somewhat rare, and of the different genera, Car-

oh honicola, Anthracomya and Naiadites are sometimes very rare. At other times they

ES appear in well-defined bands, but how far such bands extend laterally is not known. 5 A significant fact is that on horizons where plants of the class Lycopodiales are
5 dominant, shell bands generally occur. Further, the shales in such bands are of a
2 carbonaceous nature.
