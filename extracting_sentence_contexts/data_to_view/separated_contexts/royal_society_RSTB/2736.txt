There can be no doubt that species whose larvee are closely similar, are more easily
cross-fertilised than are widely different species, for example, Echinus eggs are almost
as readily fertilised by the spermatozoa of Strongylocentrotus as by their own ; the
converse cross is, however, much harder to effect, and indeed Strongylocentrotus eggs
seem difficult to fertilise with foreign sperm of any species. Some experiments were made to determine whether the gelatinous envelope has any
influence in preventing cross-fertilisation. That this may be the case is indicated by
the fact that eggs which have been shaken, so as at least partially to remove the

envelope, were sometimes more easily fertilised. But this was not always the case, and
it can easily be shown that the gelatinous envelope is not the sole cause, for if eggs
of Strongylocentrotus are mixed with large quantities of Spherechinus or Arbacia
sperm, often enough spermatozoa traverse the envelope to cause the egg inside it to
rotate, and yet the egg is not fertilised. This was also shown by another method.
