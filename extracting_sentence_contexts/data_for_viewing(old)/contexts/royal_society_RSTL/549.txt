(+1) =0
whence c=0 and c=+4/â€”1, using this latter value we have

a= =1 x VFIP=VD

which is the equation of the circle, and it is obvious, that this
curve satisfies the conditions,

It is very necessary to attend to this mode of determining
the constants, as we should otherwise meet in the solution
with many curves which do not satisfy the conditions ; thus
in the last example, the curve is apparently an hyperbola,
but owing to the constant becoming imaginary, it is in fact a
circle,


256 Mr. BaBBAGE'S essay, &c.

To complete the outline of this new method of calculation,
it would be necessary to treat of equations involving two or
more functional characteristics, and to explain methods of eli-
minating all but one of them: these lead to a variety of inte-
resting and difficult enquiries, and will probably be of consider-
able use in completing the solutions of partial differential equa-
tions: it would also be proper to consider the maxima and
