THE MORPHOLOGY OF SPORE-PRODUCING MEMBERS. 227

illustrating a progression from a simple, slightly differentiated state, with small
sporangia, to a more complete distinction of a sterile from a fertile region, frequently
with larger sporangia, and from the homosporous, non-septate condition to the
heterosporous state, with indications of a partial, or in the megasporangia of Jsoetes
even a temporarily complete septation. If this view be correct, it would be only a
slight step further back to refer the whole series, as regards its origin, to the condition
of a simple strobilus, in which all the leaves would be fertile ; this condition is at
least approached in LZ. Selago, in which the sporangia appear at an exceptionally early
stage on the seedling plant. This fact, together with the undifferentiated shoot and
simple sporangium, mark off the sporophyte of L. Selago as a relatively primitive type
of Lycopod.

Pihylloglossum has been commonly regarded as the most primitive type of Lycopod,
and its strobilus certainly seems to be the simplest. The question has been discussed
elsewhere as to the nature of the protocorm and protophylls, which are such prominent
features in its vegetative system, and the view entertained that they show specially
adaptive, rather than general Lycopodinous characters.*

The original Lycopodinous type may then be pictured as an unbranched upright
strobilus, in which all the leaves were sporophylls, and the sporangia of moderate
size ; from this, along the lines above indicated, all known Lycopodinous forms can be
