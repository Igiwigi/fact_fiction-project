The protoplasm, as it has contracted away
from the cell-wall, has adhered to the membranes of the pits, at those points in the
cell-wall where pits are present ; and in consequence, the whole section presents the
appearance of a. number of stained and interconnected irregularly-shaped stellate
masses, for the narrow processes of any one mass unite at their apices with those
proceeding from the neighbouring masses, thus exhibiting a well-defined reticulate
arrangement. The reason that the processes proceeding from the masses of two
contiguous cells are opposite one another obyiously depends upon the symmetrical deve-
lopment of pits on either side of the cell-wall (Plate 68, fig. 3). But that, the relation
between two such processes is of the most intimate character is quite evident from the
fact that in many instances it appears that an optical continuity exists between them,
thus establishing a means of communication between cell and cell (Plate 68, fig. 5). Successful sections are 80mewhat difficult to prepare, for if the sulphuric acid does
not act sufficiently long, the cell-wall is either little or not at all swollen, and when in
this condition cannot be permeated by the dye, and if the action has been allowed to

proceed too far, the protoplasm is attacked and the delicate connexions 800n become
obliterated. Moreover, at the same time the middle lamella becomes swollen and will
deeply stain, which of all things is to be avoided.
