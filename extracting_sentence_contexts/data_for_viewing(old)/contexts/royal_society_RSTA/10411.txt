ON A CHARGED ELECTRIC CONDENSER MOVING THROUGH SPACE. 181

All the above observations were taken during the middle of the day and the
afternoon.

There seems to be no change of deflection with change of sign, and by comparison
with previous results there seems to be no bias one way or the other.

From experience gained with the apparatus, the deflections observed would appear
to be attributable to small sparks or discharges taking place inside or over the
condenser, causing slight heating and consequent perturbation of the surrounding
air, This is further suggested by the fact that when the condenser employed had
Jecome damaged by falls and other vicissitudes, so that audible sparkings occurred,
She perturbations became so great as to prevent all possibility of observation,

3 There is no doubt that the result is a purely negative one. As the energy of the
fagnetic field, if it exists (and from our present point of view we must suppose it
oes), must come from somewhere, we are driven to the conclusion that the electro-
Btatie energy of a charged condenser must diminish by the amount N (z/v)?, when
â€œnoving with a velocity u at right angles to its electrostatic lines of force, where N is
the electrostatic energy.
