catalogues’ concerning quantum experiments [26, p.158]. Any such catalogue is reset with
each new measurement, which renders previous history of measurement on the same object
irrelevant as concerns our predictions from this point on [36, pp. 73-76]. The meaning of these
catalogues is subject to a further interpretation, even if one follows the spirit of Copenhagen.
Such interpretations may, for example, be either probabilistic, Bayesian or statistical, in the sense
that I shall now explain. According to Pauli:

As this indeterminacy [that reflected in the uncertainty relations] is an unavoidable element
of every initial state of a system [a quantum object] that is at all possible according to
the new [quantum-mechanical] law, the development of the system even can never be
determined as was the case in classical mechanics. The theory predicts only the statistics of
the results of an experiment, when it is repeated under a given condition. Like the ultimate
fact without any cause, the individual outcome of a measurement is, however, in general not
comprehended by laws. This must in general be the case, if quantum or wave mechanics is
interpreted as a rational generalization of classical physics [mechanics], which take into
account the finiteness of the quantum of action [Planck’s constant, h]. The probabilities
occurring in the new laws have then to be considered to be primary, which means not
deducible from deterministic [causal] laws. As an example of these primary probabilities
I mention here the fact that the time at which an individual atom will undergo a certain
reaction stays undetermined even under conditions where the rate of occurrence of this
reaction for a large collection of atoms is practically certain. [46, p. 32]

Pauli speaks of determinism rather than causality, but this does not affect my argument because,
as explained earlier, in the case of classical mechanics both notions coincide. Most important is
