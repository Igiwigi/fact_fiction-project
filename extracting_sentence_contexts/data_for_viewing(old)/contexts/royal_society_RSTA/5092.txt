phase loading as shown in figure 38 [80]. The morphological changes were driven by the sign of
the stress and the high temperature and are fully consistent with a negative mismatch parameter.
Connecting with the work of Ott & Mughrabi [60], the alignment of the plates in the direction of
loading is expected to be beneficial for the TMF life.

As a further test of the model, it was applied to the case of notches with a notch severity
of K, = 1.72 and computing crack tip stresses and strains using Neuber’s rule. Agreement with
experiment was reasonable (within about 20%) but it was pointed out how a more fully developed
crystal visco-plasticity (CVP) model along with detailed FEA would have the potential to
significantly improve the notch predictions [80]. An idealized go/no-go path for moving forward
in making life predictions was also presented and is reproduced in figure 39 for completeness.

Of critical importance in TMF are the facts that: (i) oxidation is generally a critical damage
mechanism for most Mi-base alloys, (ii) damage mode interactions that may not occur in
isothermal fatigue are frequently of critical importance in TMF, (iii) no explanation for TMF
which is applicable to all Ni-base alloys is possible since the damage depends on the details
of deformation and environmental attack, which depend on compositional and microstructural
