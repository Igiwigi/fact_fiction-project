charged projectiles) or exchange processes (unlike electrons). Thus antiprotons provide a very
clean ionization signal. Charge effects can be studied by comparing to proton scattering.

(b) Antiproton—hydrogen

At energies above 200keV, the experimental results [11] are well described by the first Born
approximation. As this approximation is based on first-order perturbation theory, the cross
section is independent of the charge of the projectile. Indeed, the measured ionization cross
section is identical to that of protons, within the uncertainty of the measurement.

For energies below 200keV, the charge of the projectile does play a role. As the proton
attracts the electron, while the antiproton repels it, the proton cross section becomes larger
than the antiproton cross section. In fact, while the proton cross section monotonically increases
with decreasing collision energy, the antiproton cross section levels out, and even declines
slightly, below collision energies of approximately 150 keV. Down to approximately 50 keV the
experimental results are well described by the distorted wave Born approximation.

Below 30 keV there are no experimental data, so instead I compare the results from different
theoretical approaches. Theoretical calculations in this regime are usually based on classical
motion of the antiproton, creating a time-dependent perturbation of the hydrogen atom. I will
refer to this as the semi-classical method. This method comes in two varieties: either the antiproton
is assumed to follow a completely straight trajectory, unperturbed by the interaction with the
atom, or the bending of the antiproton trajectory is allowed for. The latter method treats only
the antiproton—-atom separation R classically, while the angular variables are treated quantum
mechanically, leading to rigorous conservation of quantum mechanical angular momentum [12].
