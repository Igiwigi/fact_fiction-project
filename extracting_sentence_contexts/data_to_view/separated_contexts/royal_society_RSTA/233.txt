The advantages of continuum models are that the results can be directly
compared with macroscopic data, such as the FD in figure la and the space
time diagram in figure 2b (Kerner 2004), and that it is also relatively easy
to provide the boundary conditions for velocity and flux. Their disadvantage
is, however, that it is difficult to relate the model parameters to microscopic
driver parameters. Moreover, it is not clear what limitations are imposed by
the fact that fundamentally discrete systems are being modelled as continua. Phil. Trans.
