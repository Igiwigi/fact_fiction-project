region. The origin of this, whether from anterior mesenteron rudiment or no, is not clear.
The most complete account is that given by WirsMANN (1926) on the embryology of
Carausius, where complete somites are formed in all segments. Since no anterior
mesenteron rudiment is present in this insect the mode of origin of the anterior cephalic
mesoderm must be quite different from that of the same structure in Pieris. This author
states that all head and body mesoderm arises in a uniform manner. WHEELER (1889)
in Doryphora finds that the mass of lower layer cells in the head arises in a similar manner
to that of the mesoderm behind. It only differs from such mesoderm in that it is a
cell mass destined to give rise to mesoderm and ectoderm. This is a condition similar
to that of Pieri

subject, neuromeres and appendage and segment formation being commonly described,
but mesoderm both in the matter of its development and its relation to appendages
being incompletely investigated.

It is not surprising to find that the mesoderm of the oral region arises differently
from that behind. It must quite obviously be referred to the association, which is a
secondary one, which exists between the mouth and segments behind it. The original
anterior position of the mouth cannot be doubted. In this original position there
