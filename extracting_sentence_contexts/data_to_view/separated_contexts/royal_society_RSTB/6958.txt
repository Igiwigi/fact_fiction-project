The branching of the muscle fibres has the
effect of converting the morphological circular arrangement of the fibres at these junctions
into a physiological spiral. The glycogen content of the various parts. of the frog’s heart, as revealed by staining
with carmine, is found to increase in the order sinus, atria, ventricle and bulbus cordis. ‘This
is correlated with a similar increasing order of density of musculature and work done, the
glycogen being a reserve potency for the energy of muscular contraction. The fact that the
intrinsic rhythmic rates of the several chambers decrease in the same order as the glycogen
content increases may or may not be coincidental. Cutting and ligature experiments, with cinephotographic and kymographic records,
reveal the intrinsic rhythmic rates of the various cardiac chambers of the salamander heart. No satisfactory reason has yet been adduced to account for the different intrinsic
rhythmic rates of the several parts of the heart when these are isolated from each other.
