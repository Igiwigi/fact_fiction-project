secondary circuit contained seven large Leyden jars in parallel with the spark gap im
vacuo. A spark gap in air was placed in series with the one in vacuo.

In order that the gases evolved by the electrodes might be removed, the Kurth pump
was kept in continual operation during an exposure, and the sparks were made to pass
intermittently by means of a make-and-break device operated by a motor in the primary
circuit. ‘The frequency and duration of the spark was regulated by the degree of vacuum
which the pumps could maintain, and worked out to be about one-tenth of the total
time. The length of exposure required was found to be equivalent to about 35 minutes
of continuous sparking, or on the average from 4 to 5 hours, intermittent exposure.

In these initial experiments the results obtained were far from satisfactory. This was
due to the fact that the grating employed was an old one and badly tarnished, and also
to the fact that it was not ruled according to the special method required for very short
wave-lengths. The shortest wave-length recorded was about 900 A.U.

Due to the kindness of Prof. McLennan, however, a new grating and new Schumann
plates were obtained from the Adam Hilger Co., and with these rapid progress was
made. ‘This grating was much smaller in area than the old one, being only 3-5 cm.
wide and 5 cm. high, had a focal length of 100 cm. and was ruled with about 14,000 lines
per inch.
