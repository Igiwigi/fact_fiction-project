Because 9 particular grass, or other plant, is

5 Tabit and Conformation of Plants : Organisation by means of which they maintain
{a} or improve their position, or suecumb in competition with others. Before passing to the consideration of individual species, a few general remarks.on
the structure and mode of life of the plants with which we have to deal are requisite.
