Most
definitions of human economics stress the production and distribution of
goods and services, and the allocation of resources. Some go further and men-
tion the maximization of profit or the minimization of cost, but this is merely a
hypothesis about one of the objectives of economic activity. Many of the latest
insights suggest, in fact, that human choices often violate the rules attributed to
Homo economicus. Behavioural economics routinely questions assumptions
behind rational choice theory [6]. Why do we have a sense of fairness that some-
times makes us forego advantageous resource distributions?
