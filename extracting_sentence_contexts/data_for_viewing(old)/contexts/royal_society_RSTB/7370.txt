pathways to the motor arcs provision must be made for the synaptic continuity of the motor
neurons of the internal face of the body wall and the association fibres of its outer surface.
Such contiguity is impossible over the greater part of the wall where the heavily calcified
stroma is many hundreds of microns thick and apparently devoid of penetrating fibres. In
two zones only, both on the ventral (oral) side of the arm, is the body wall sufficiently thin
to allow of the apposition of the two parts of the nervous system. The one is in the roof of
the nerve cord (n.c.), the other below the lateral motor complex (/at.mot.); in both places
the boundary is uncalcified and a mere | to 34 thick. In the former instance fibres have
been seen to penetrate the boundary and to run in conjunction with fibres on the farther
side (see below). An anatomical connexion of the two systems in the region of the
lateral motor complex is not so well established, but the responses of the tube feet and arm
under experimentally defined conditions of innervation (Smith 1945), show that excitation
can, in fact, be short-circuited through the lateral motor centres, and that in consequence
the motor arcs can be excited either centrally (through the radial cord) or peripherally.

(6) The detailed anatomy of the motor supply to the arm musculature

The detailed constitution and fine anatomy of the motor tracts supplying the arm muscu-
lature may be exemplified by a description of the fibre systems which extend (figure 2) from
the radial nerve cord (n.c.) to the lateral transverse (a), longitudinal ambulacral (c), and
supra-ambulacral muscles (d).

The cell bodies of the central distributory neurons (figures 2 and 3, c.dist.) lie in the floor
of the radial perihaemal canal. Each group is confined within an area roughly bounded
by the proximo-distal width of a foot and the middle third of one side of the V-shaped nerve
