is light red in colour, the colouring element, as in all other Annelids, being dissolved
in the fluid mass. It is remarkable that the fluid contents of the visceral cavity in
Glycera $hould be colourless, while the corpuscles which it holds in Suspension
sbould be filled with a blood-red liquid, contrasting these bodies in a striking
manner with the fluid in which they float. The cavity of the peritoneum is dispro-
portionately capacious. It is little interrupted by segmental septa. The worm is
extremely quick and active in its movements. The true branchic are hollow cylin-
drical appendages, lined within and without by vibratile epithelium, and penetrated
only by the fluid of the peritoneal cavity. They are supplied by no true- blood-vessels.
The chylaqueous fluid therefore is the subject of the respiratory change, for which
these appendages present an appropriate mechanism.

To this fact the highest interest attaches. It constitutes an undeniable proof that
the fluid of the peritoneal cavity is capable of discharging the highest function of the
animal organism. The presence of red corpuscles in the fluid of this species does

not prove that in no other species is this fluid capable of enacting a true respiratory
function, since the branchial organs of nearly all Annelids (many by it exclusively)
are more or less injected by the fluid of the visceral cavity. On the other hand, a fluid
which is destitute of corpuscles may also perform the office of respiration. Floating
