The Holocene began more than 11000 years ago after the last glacial period and saw
the dawn of human civilization. Before that the Pleistocene lasted for 2.5 million years [1]. It saw
both major climate change and a massive extinction of life forms: those two facts are connected. The Anthropocene—the epoch which started when humans first began to have a significant
impact on Earth’s climate, geology and ecosystems—is itself a much-contested concept. There
is a live debate about when it started.
