However,
Bechtle et al. [16] calculated the fracture strength of a single enamel crystallite to be approximately
2GPa indirectly, by combining the experimental results and analytical solutions for hierarchical
materials. This value is approximately one order of magnitude higher than the strength obtained
from bulk HAP (approx. 100 MPa [44]; see the electronic supplementary material, table S1) and
is of the order of theoretical strength estimation of approximately 4GPa (oy, = E/30). The slightly
lower experimental value compared with the theoretical value may be explained by the fact that
the elastic modulus of a single enamel crystallite is not reported in the literature owing to the lack
of sample preparation and testing technique. Thus, the elastic modulus of an artificial micro-sized
HAP single crystal (125 GPa) assessed by nanoindentation [43] is used in the calculation of the
theoretical strength. Note that indentation approaches quantify material properties under multi-
axial stress state (largely compressive stresses) that can differ from the properties assessed under
uniaxial tension.
