The effects of intermittency and coherent structures are apparent: unless €;(x) is uniform, the a

then there are ‘heavy tails’ on the increment distributions. Accepting the similarity hypothesis —
equation (2.5), it is clear that spatial enhancements of increments are associated with enhancement : 3
of the local average dissipation function ¢,(x).! Thus, in regions where dissipation is very 18
concentrated over a scale r, there will be concomitant concentration of large values of 5v;. For ao
a given value of average dissipation (e(x)) =e, this effect causes equation (2.4) to differ greatly : 8
