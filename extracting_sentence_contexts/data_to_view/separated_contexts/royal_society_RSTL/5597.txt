To form the connexion in order to determine their conducting powers, one end stood
in a cup of quicksilyer, the other cup being formed by placing an india-rubber tubing
over the other end, the latter cup being of course also filled with quicksilver. As the
rods were made by hand, the difference in the results of the same specimens is thus
accounted for. An interesting fact was now observed, viz. that in all the cokes and graphites the conÂ»
ducting power increased by heat. Some experiments were made with gas-coke, and it
was found that if at 0* the conducting power equalled 100, it, from 0* to 140?, increased
000245 for each degree, and between the common temperature and a light red heat,
about 12 per cent.
