To make experi-
ments of the same kind with expansions only slightly exceeding the limit v/v, = 1Â°25
is difficult on account of the exceedingly small number of the drops. Apparatus on a
much larger scale would be better for experiments on this point,


GASES BY THE ACTION OF RONTGEN RAYS AND OTHER AGENTS. 451

One way of accounting for the fact that an electric field has no effect on the rain-
like condensation under consideration would be to suppose that the nuclei are
produced at the moment of expansion. They might, for example, be caused by the
motion of the piston or plunger through the water. The fact, however, that the
condensation is just as easily observed when the cloud-vessel is connected with the
rest of the apparatus by a bent tube of considerable length, as for example in the
apparatus shown in fig.
