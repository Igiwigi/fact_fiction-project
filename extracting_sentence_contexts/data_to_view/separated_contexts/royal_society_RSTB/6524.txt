(1896, pl. VII, fig. 1) of the jaw of Acanthodes, which
is derived from much less well-preserved material.

Taken together these descriptions leave no real doubt that true bone does occur in
the visceral ossifications of Acanthodians. But if no bone cells could be observed or
even if they had never existed, it is evident from the fact that some portions of them must
be resorbed during the growth of the animal that the jaw bones of A. bronnii agree with
true bone and differ from all other vertebrate hard parts. SUMMARY OF THE STRUCTURE OF ACANTHODIANS IN GENERAL

The Acanthodians are fish-like gnathostomes whose general build is fusiform, with
a body which may be rather deep (Cheiracanthus) but which is generally slender,
ultimately becoming eel-like (Acanthodes). General Shape

Finsâ€”There are one or two dorsal, an anal and a caudal fin.
