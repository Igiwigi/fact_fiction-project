With a charge buried at a finite depth
the effects will presumably be intermediate between those for the infinite and semi-
infinite media. Ina quarry blast the conditions are somewhat different, and approximate
to an impulsive tangential force on the ground. This might be expected to produce a
large distortional wave, and in fact transverse waves are usually observed from such

blasts (Leet 1938, chap. 7).

7. AMPLITUDES

A quantitative study of the amplitudes of the waves is a matter of some difficulty, for
the recorded amplitude depends on (a) the distance of the shot from the geophone, (4)
the amount of explosive, (c) the depth of the hole in which it is buried, (d) the amount of
tamping employed, (e) the sensitivity of the instrument and its variation with frequency,
(/) the way in which the geophones are buried, as well as on geological factors. No
attempt has been made to disentangle the effect of all these variables, but certain
qualitative considerations are useful in the interpretation of the records.
