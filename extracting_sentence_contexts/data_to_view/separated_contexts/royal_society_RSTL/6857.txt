The greater delicacy of the fibres of the right ventricle may be explained
either by an arrest of growth after birth, or to their becoming subsequently atrophied. The fibres of the right ventricle, as a rule, form only curves or segments of spirals
(Plate XIV. figs. 36 & 37), a certain number of them anteriorly (especially those of the
internal layers*) bending over and uniting with corresponding fibres from the right side
of the septum to form a fibrous archway (Plate XITI. figs. 18, 21, 24, & 27, m), which

* The fibres of the external layers which enter into the formation of the fleshy pons, arise in many instances
from the root of the pulmonary artery and aorta, and from the anterior portion of the right auriculo-yentricular

opening,

separates the right auriculo-yentricular opening (7) from that of the pulmonary artery (Ã¾),
This fibrous archway has been appropriately denominated the fleshy pons, and is more
less spindle-shaped, from the fact of its forming the boundary between the auriculo-
ventricular and pulmonic orifices, the former of which is oval, the latter circular. It
varies in size according to the dimensions of the heart. In the sheep, calf (Plate XIV,
fig. 43, m), hog, leopard, deer, and seal it is uually about half an inch in breadth at.
its narrowest portion, and rather less than a quarter of an inch in thickness; while in
the giraffe. camel, and horse it increases to twice these dimensions.
