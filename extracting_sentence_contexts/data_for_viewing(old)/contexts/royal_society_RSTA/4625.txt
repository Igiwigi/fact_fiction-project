are statistically significant at the 95% level, as determined by the resampling bootstrap method
[89], sampling with replacement 10 000 times. In the ConvOff experiments, the shortwave CRE in
the 40-100th percentile range is significantly anti-correlated with the net cloud feedback, both
within the equivalent ALPI bins and across the low-latitude oceans. Because the GFDL AM2
ConvOff experiment is an outlier, we checked to see whether these correlations were mainly
reflecting the unusual behaviour of this one model by repeating the calculation without it. With
GFDL AM2 removed, the ConvOff experiments show similar correlations, but confined to the
80-100th percentile range only for the shortwave CRE only (not shown), much like that seen
in the standard experiments in figure 3c. Hence, both ensembles hint at a tendency for the
models with the largest magnitudes of the shortwave CRE in the most stable cloud regimes to
have more positive cloud feedbacks in those regimes. This provides support for the argument of
Brient & Bony [13] discussed above, in which models with more low level cloud tend to have
more positive feedbacks. Additional support for this argument is provided by the fact that the
low cloud fractions in the 90-100th percentile range are positively correlated with the net cloud
feedbacks in the same range (figure 4e,f).

Figure 3e,f also shows that both the standard and ConvOff ensembles have positive
correlations between the values of the longwave CRE in the 90-100th percentile range and the
cloud feedback averaged over the low-latitude oceans, indicating that models with stronger
longwave CRE tend to have more positive cloud feedbacks. Figure 4b and 5c show similar
correlations between the low-latitude ocean cloud feedback and high cloud fraction in the
ConvOff ensemble and IWP in the standard models, respectively.

Additionally, both ensembles have mid-level cloud fractions which are anti-correlated with
the low-latitude ocean cloud feedback and also with the local net cloud feedback over much
