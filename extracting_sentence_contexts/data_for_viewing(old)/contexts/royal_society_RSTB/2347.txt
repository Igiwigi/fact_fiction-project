The structure of a typical herbaceous leaf is one eminently suited for producing all
the remarkable diffusive phenomena which we have found associated with multi-
perforate septa.

It we take a special case, such as that of the under-side of the leaf of Helianthus
annuus, we find the impervious cuticle and epidermis pierced at regular intervals with
minute elliptical openings whose apertures are capable of being regulated by the state
of turgescence of the guard-cells.

These openings, the stomates, are in immediate communication, through a large
intercellular space, the respiratory cavity, with the numerous and roomy interspaces
of the loosely packed cells of the spongy parenchyma. We have in fact an arrange-
ment which virtually amounts to a multi-perforate diaphragm extended over a
chamber whose interior presents a very large absorptive surface to the atmospheric
carbon dioxide which enters through the fine apertures.

Where the stomates open into the respiratory cavity there is ample space for the
formation of the negative “shells” of equal density which must necessarily be pro-
duced by the divergent molecular drift of the carbon dioxide entering the leaf. The
spacing of the stomates on the leaf, if we regard them as circular openings, is about

8 diameters apart, a distribution which, as we have seen, would allow each single
opening to exercise nearly its full efficiency without interference with its neighbour.
