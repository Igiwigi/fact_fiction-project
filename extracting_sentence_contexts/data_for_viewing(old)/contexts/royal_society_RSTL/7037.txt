The Somme flows through a chalk district with a few tertiary outliers, while the
tribatary valley of the Arve penetrates to the main body of the tertiaries. At St. Acheul
the quantity of sandstone blocks and pebbles, and of flint pebbles, derived from tertiary
strata, is very considerable, and the presence of specimens of Nummularia lavigata and
of the Venericardia planicost@ shows the upland direction of their origin, as no beds
containing these fossils exist below Amiens. In the several patches of high-level
grayels (chiefly of subangular chalk-flints) between Amiens and Abbeville, tertiary d6bris
continue to be found, and at Moulin Quignon sandstone-fragments of a large 8ize are
$till numerous, although they are fewer and smaller than at St. Acheulf.

The occurrence of rolled fragments and boulders of granite and other old rocks in the
valley of the Seine at Paris, is a fact which has long been well known. The presence
of similar materials of distant origin has also been proved to hold good in the higher-
leyel gravels of Gentilly and Charonne. M. Duvar described the section at the first-
named place (which applies to the other), as consisting of sands passing downwards into
a gravel composed of pebbles and fragments of cretaceous and tertiary rocks, together with
others of porphyry, and © a prodigious quantity of grains and pebbles of red granite ” |,
some of which weighed from eleven to thirty-four pounds. Land and freshwater shells
and small reptilian bones were common, with some bones of the large mammalia.

The valley-gravels at Frenoy, Nogent-sur-Seine, and Troyes consist, chiefly of oolitic
