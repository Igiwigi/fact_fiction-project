THE INTERNAL ENERGY OF FERROMAGNETICS 185

} (— @o,2/@T). The value of C’,, becomes simply the difference between C,, and Cy.
This procedure is again arbitrary ; it leads to the conclusion that C’y increases
slowly at the lower temperatures but very rapidly as the Curie point is approached—
from about 0-012 at 352° to 0-018 at 362°—although it remains practically constant
over a range of about 100° above the Curie point, and by hypothesis is not attri-
butable directly to the decrease in the intrinsic magnetization.

Unless the origin of C’y is known and estimates of its magnitude can be made,
the value of C,, below the Curie point also remains uncertain ; but fairly definite
limits can be fixed. Since G’y is not directly associated with the change in intrinsic
magnetization, the fact that it varies little over almost 100° above the Curie point
suggests that it will vary little for an equal range below. At lower temperatures it
must decrease, since the total C, eventually becomes less than C’,, above the Curie
point, Table VI. The assumption that C’,, remains constant down to 300° will at
least give lower limits for the values of Cy, and consequently also lower limits for
— (1/s) (2E/éc) as obtained from (6.2). An upper limit for which some theoretical
justification is given below is obtained by assuming that C’,, decreases linearly
with the temperature from 375° to — 273° C. In making the calculations the values
of } (@92/2T) have been taken at 1° and 2° lower than the values for the specific
heat for the results of Lape and Grew respectively—that is the maxima have been
made to coincide. The results are shown in Table VIII.
