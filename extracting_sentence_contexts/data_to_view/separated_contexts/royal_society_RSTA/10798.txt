Let us consider how these results are affected when the individual pulses are
of infinite breadth. Suppose that we examine the type which Lord Ray.ercn
suggested,

iter

The displacement becomes comparatively small when the distance from the centre
of the pulse is great compared with 1/c. In fact, we are tempted to regard these
pulses as practically equivalent to pulses of finite breadth 1/c or thereabouts. Suppose that the least observable interval T comprises a large number of central
points of pulses. Suppose also that T is great compared with 1/ce.
