The authors emphasized a necessary condition for
moving spots given by the inequality

nt<-—l. (3.4)

This condition, which will later reappear, comes from the linear stability analysis around a
stationary state that leads to the following characteristic equation for the growth rate A:

A+ n(1 — exp(—ar)) =0. (3.5)

Figure 5. Hyperbolic tangent solution to equation (3.8), with e« = 0. The fact that a simple explicit formula exists for the
leading-order problem facilitates the analysis. See also equation (3.12). (Online version in colour.)

A necessary condition for stability is obtained by first determining the real roots. Keeping t
fixed, we analyse A = 4(n) from equation (3.5) in the implicit form nt = At(exp(—At) — 1)1.
