To address this question,
we focus on landscapes that have more than one peak (46% of
L=3, K=1 landscapes), since with a single peak, hi is always
equal to the fitness of that peak. Interestingly, figure 1b
shows that ft does not always monotonically increase with N. In fact, this expected case occurs only for about 40% of the
landscapes with more than one peak (e.g. figure 1c), and h

(iii) Impact of the starting set of genotypes have a high peak more accessible than the low peak, and
So far, we have considered the average /i of h over all possible vice-versa for landscapes displaying overall decreasing beha-
initial genotypes, assumed to be equally likely. What is the viours. Quantitatively, 99% of the landscapes where both
impact of restricting the set of possible starting points to measures are positive or 0, but not both 0 (representing
those with high fitness?
