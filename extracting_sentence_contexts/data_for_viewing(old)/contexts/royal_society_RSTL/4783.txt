with alizarine, then its solutions in alkalies have a reddish-purple colour. The ammo-
niacal soJution loses its ammonia on evaporation, and leaves the substance behind as
a brown transparent pellicle. The ammoniacal solution gives precipitates with the
chlorides of barium and calcium. The alcoholic solution gives dark brown precipi-
tates with the acetates of lead and copper, as I mentioned before. When it is free
from alizarine, it does not communicate any colour to mordanted cloth, and is there-
fore no colouring matter in the usual sense.

In the opinion of most chemists who have examined madder, this root contains
two distinct colouring matters, viz. alizarine and another, to which the names of pur-
purine, ovylizaric acid and madder-purple have been applied by different chemists.
This opinion has been advocated with considerable ability by MM. Worey and
STRECKER. I have however reason to suppose that purpurine is in fact no distinct
snbstance, but a mixture of alizarine and verantine. The latter snbstance accompanies
almost all the products which are obtained from madder, and it is this body which
renders them 80 difficult to purify. It adheres s0 pertinaciously to alizarine, as to in-
duce the belief that the two actually form a chemical compound. The mixtures of
the two vary in appearance from that of dark red crystals to that of a red crystalline
powder. In these mixtures the verantine may easily be detected by dissolving in
alcohol and adding acetate of copper, which precipitates the verantine, as before de-
scribed. It also accompanies rubianine and renders it difficult to crystallize, as I
mentioned above, and I have never been able to obtain rubiretine without some trace
of it. As a characteristic of purpurine is mentioned its property of giving a cherry-
red s0lution with alkalies, having none of the violet appearance belonging to alkaline
solutions of alizarine; and also its forming, when treated with boiling alum-liquor, a
