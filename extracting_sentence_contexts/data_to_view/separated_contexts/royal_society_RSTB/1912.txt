Unfertilised eggs similarly treated do not burst, but merely swell and alter
their appearance. Tn most cases only one antherozoid succeeds in penetrating the egg, but we have
seen, amongst several thousand preparations, three cases of polyspermy (fig. 23) in
which two antherozoids had effected an entrance. This rare occurrence of polyspermy
under the conditions such as are normal for the plants concerned, makes one feel
rather doubtful as regards those cases of polyspermy reported for animals ; not that
the facts are disputed, but as to whether the occurrence in those recorded cases may
not be largely the result of the prevalence of abnormal conditions at the time of
fertilisation. We have never succeeded in obtaining satisfactory evidence to show that unferti-

lised eggs are ever able to germinate. Turret, however, mentions that unfertilised
eggs which he kept for several days produced moniliform projections, which he
regarded as attempts at germination, and he further states that cellulose walls are
sometimes present.* As far as our experience goes we have never been able to observe
any cellulose walls produced around unfertilised oospheres, but one often observes, on
testing the oospheres as soon as they are liberated, that amongst them there often
occur egg-like bodies provided with walls.
