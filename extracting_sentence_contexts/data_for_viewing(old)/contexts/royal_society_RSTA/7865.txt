Therefore
O< (Ny. 6, X (M)x,)15

and by the lemma, the circle Ny: ©, is the circle with least radius containing (%),,-
The next theorem shows that for every set Yt, the asymptotic behaviour of Ny, (9)
for large | 9| is, in a very strong sense, the same as that of the simple function Ng, (4).

Theorem 19—Let 2 be closed and bounded ; &, the same as in Theorem 18. Then

ele (9) — Ng, (9)) = 0.

If the centre of S, is not a boundary point of the convex closure of the common part of W and
the circumference of ©,, we have, in fact,

Ny (») = Ne, (9)

for all sufficiently large | 9\.
As corollary of Theorem 19 we have

~ Nw (9) = il 5

where r, is the radius of ©,.
The existence of the limit in (75) was proved by Rarrt for the case when WM is a
