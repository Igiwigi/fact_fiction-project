Isolated at Ardeer from
wine cellar debris. The carbon balance sheet for this species is given in Table XIII. The only point of biochemical interest about this carbon balance sheet is the fact
that Rhacodium cellare appears to form small amounts, 0-158 gm. (6-3 per cent.), of
a non-volatile acid which may possibly be optically dextro-rotatory, since there is a
considerable difference between the glucose as estimated by the polarimeter (1-512
per cent.) and by the Saarrer-HaRTMaNN method (1-257 per cent.). With the exception
of this there is a complete absence of any other features of biochemical interest.
