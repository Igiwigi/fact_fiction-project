(The numbers +1, +2, +4 are the residues, modulo 9, of the various powers of 2, and
the notation can be further elaborated.) ‘These rules, it is easy to see, give the 135
intersections, which are therefore unaffected by . So w belongs to the group, as
required.

13.7. The operation may be regarded as a product PQ, in which each of P, Q is of
period 2; Q being in fact

(16) (25) (34).
This is seen at once by applying to each of X, Y, Z (of which no two have a line in
common) the obvious decomposition of a cyclic permutation of period 9,
(123456789) = (17) (26) (35) (89) . (18) (27) (45) (36).

13.8. It is manifest that instead of » we may take any power of o, say o”, where
is not a multiple of 3. Or we may take, instead of , an operation obtained from it by
any permutation of the suffix-numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

13.9. By 9.35,
