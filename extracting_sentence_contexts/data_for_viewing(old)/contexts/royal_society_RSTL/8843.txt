In this explanation T have referred to india-rubber because it is much more easy to
conceive the effects on it than on a hard s8ubstance like iron, the expansion and contraction
of which is quite inappreciable to our senses ; the reasoning, however, applies equally
well to all elastic substances, and is quite independent of their hardness or softness.
That friction is sufficient to preyent the expansion of iron at a surface against which it

is squeezed out is amply proved by the fact that when a block of iron, hot or cold, is
8queezed on an anvil the iron bulges out in the middle, as shown in fig. 4.

Lxperimental Verification of the Figures.

The figures which illustrate the foregoing remarks are not altogether ideal, for they
have been verified to a certain extent by experiments on india-rubber; for instance, by
drawing vertical lines on the edge of a plate of india-rubber, and then observing these
lines as the roller passed along as near as possible to this edge; also by observing lines
drawn in the same way on the edge of an india-rubber roller. The effect of friction to
prevent expansion, shown in figures 4 and 5, was verified by marking the surface of the
india-rubber under the plate A B with parallel lines in chalk, which left a mark on the
iron and showed how far there had been slipping. The figures are nevertheless intended
