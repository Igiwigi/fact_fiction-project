Coorzs (read May 16, 1839), but which I have pointed out to the especial notice of photo-
logists on several occasions, viz. 1st, in my paper on the action of crystallized media on homogeneous light,
read December 23, 1819, and printed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1820 (See vol. ex. p. 88); 2ndly, in
a paper read November 18, 1822, before the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and printed in the Transactions of
that Society for 1822; 3rdly, in my Treatise on Light (Encyclop. Metropol. $5 487, 497, 503.). This ray
has, in fact, been constantly used and recommended by me as a standard ray, for which purpose it is admirably
adapted on account of the facility of insulating it in a 8tate of purity. D2
