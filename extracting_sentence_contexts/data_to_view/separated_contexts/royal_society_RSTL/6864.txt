The values in the last column were obtained as follows: take for instance that of
gold. The mean deduced value (column 1) for its conducting-power at 0* was 88-17,
under the suppoxition that the percentage decrement in its conducting-power between 0
and 100 was 29-307 ; the percentage decrement, however, found for pure gold was 28:30 ;
we must therefore recalculate the deduced value to obtain a more concordant one, and

this may be done with the help of the proportion

Reducing the others in the same manner, we are struck with the coincidence of these
values with those really found for the annealed wires by experiment; in fact we must
asxume that the values deduced for the conducting-power of metals are those of the
-annealed wires, even when hard-drawn ones are experimented with. What the deduced
yalues for the conducting-power would be when using annealed wires of impure metals
we are unable at present to say, for no determinations have been made in this direction. It, must be remembered that the effect of annealing on the conducting-power of alloys
is very small, 80 that the deduced values from those found for the annealed wires would
not be very different from those deduced from the hard drawn, as8uming, as we have
done in the former part of this investigation, that the percentage decrement in the con-
ducting-power between 0® and 100® of hard drawn and annealed is the same.
