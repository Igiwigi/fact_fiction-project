Furthermore, no fauna of any kind was discovered in any of the deposits
which yielded Chellean implements, while, on the other hand, those which contained
Acheulian artifacts were usually highly fossiliferous. The appearance of this fauna,
which is of nilotic type, in beds with Acheulian implements dates the connexion of the
lake basin with the Nile fairly accurately. The importance of those deposits which are
unfossiliferous except for a few Chellean implements, lies in the fact that it is just such
an absence of fossils that would be expected in deposits laid down between the time
of the extinction of the Kaiso fauna and the arrival of the Nile fauna at the height of
the following lake maximum. Towards the end of the Chellean the lake level again began to fall, though to what
extent is uncertain. The discovery of very late Chellean or very early Acheulian imple-
ments in beds about 100 ft. above the present shoreline shows that the lake must have
dropped to approximately that level.
