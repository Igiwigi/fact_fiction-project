The tests made on 1414A steel (6-05% Mn, 17-91% Ni) after treatment by a slow
cooling from 800° C. like the majority of the steels, demonstrates very clearly the
inferiority in properties obtained both at ordinary and at low temperatures, as compared
with those resulting from the water-quenching treatment appropriate to the austenitic

class of steels to which it belongs. A similar result was obtained with alloy No. 1424B
in Group IV, Class 2.

Class 7. Iron, Manganese, and Silicon.—The alloy tested in this class behaves in
much the same way as 1252B steel (iron, nickel, copper). This steel is, in fact, the
most adversely affected by liquid hydrogen of any tested in the research.

Class 8. Iron, Manganese, and Copper.—The feature of the behaviour in liquid air
of steel No. 1240/1 containing 2-01° manganese and 1-45% copper, was the main-
tenance of its full normal ductility of 17%. Its tenacity was increased in the fairly
normal ratio of 60%.

In liquid hydrogen a consistently favourable behaviour is seen, since this steel is
among the few whose tenacity progressively increases in passing from liquid air to liquid
hydrogen temperature.

As has been seen (specimen 4147/104), such a result is not obtained with the plain
