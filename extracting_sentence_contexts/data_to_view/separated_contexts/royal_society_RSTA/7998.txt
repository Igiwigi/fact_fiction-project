* The nitrocellulose is composed of a mixture of guncotton (C,,HsgNi,0,2) and collodion (CosHg:N 50s),
the N-content depending on the proportions used.

+ Diphenylamine (C,,H,,N).

t Mineral jelly (C.oH4:).

§ Centralite (C,,H )N,0).

|| The heats of formation for calculating the calorimetric values are given in E.S., Table IH, p. 59, with
the exception of centralite (for which the heats of formation at 15° C. have been taken as 250 calories
per gram and 67,000 calories per gm. mol.), and of mineral jelly (for which the corresponding values are
465 calories per gram and 131.130 calories per gm. mol.). In this connection we are indebted to
Dr, G. Rorrer for drawing our attention to the fact that the figures quoted in E.S., Table I, for dipheny-
lamine should read + 32-5 calories per gram and +5490 calories per gm. mol. in place of — 325
and — 54,900 respectively as there entered. The gas compositions and calculated temperatures of explosion for the various
s f }
propellants are shown in Table I. Taste I1.—Gas Composition and Temperature of Explosion (T)).
