Further, we often find, in the central portions of a glacier, the structure feeble, or
where the glacier moves through a valley of tolerably uniform inclination, and where
no medial moraines occur to complicate the phenomenon. But if the veins mark the
the centre as at the sides; the fact, however, certainly is that we do not 80 find them.

Let me here show the true significance of this fact. If a plastic substance, such as

with its major axis transverse to the axis of the stream ; and if the latter, it would be
