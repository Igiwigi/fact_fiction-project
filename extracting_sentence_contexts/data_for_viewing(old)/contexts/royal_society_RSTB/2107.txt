It is not easy to find evidence bearing on my theory which I desire to put forward
in a tentative spirit.

The fact that aquatic plants do not, as a rule, close their stomata at night, is in
favour of the hypothesis, for they live in a more or less saturated atmosphere, where
transpiration, with its accompanying loss of heat, is always small, and where, therefore,
the stomata may safely remain open. ‘This applies especially to floating leaves, but
must to some extent be applicable to aquatics with aerial leaves. Another considera-
tion is only applicable to floating leaves, namely, that since their temperature must
be decided by that of the water, the closure of the stomata would be insignificant in
effect. In order to test the point practically, I placed leaves of Ivy (Hedera), Laurel
(P. Lawrocerasus), Turnip (B. Rapa), &e., floating on a small pond, while corres-
ponding leaves were placed close to the edge of the pond on a wicker table 60 centims.
