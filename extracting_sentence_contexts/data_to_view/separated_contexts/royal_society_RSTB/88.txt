In this section the marginal bracts of two nodal disks are inter-
sected at /, k’, and the two verticils of sporangiophores ascending from these disks are
seen at 7,7’, The walls of the sporangia constituting the upper and inner verticil of
the internode /’ are present at m’, and the sporangiophores at J, 1. Several points are demonstrated by the facts just described : the sporangia are very
numerous; they are all arranged radially in two verticils ; as is shown by fig. 13, m’, their
vertical length much exceeds their transverse diameters; their perpendicular lateral
surfaces are flat and virtually parallel to each other, allowance being made for the fact
that, seen in transverse sections, the inner border of each sporangium is somewhat

thinner than its outer one. In the inner verticil this inner border has a mean diameter
of from 735 (0066) to 35 (02) of an inch, whilst their peripheral margins in the same
verticil range between 4 (‘012) and 3\5 (02) of an inch.
