Figure 6. The 50-column periodic table.

However, this claim would seem to contradict the current IUPAC naming convention for groups
and may be another example of attaching undue importance to pragmatism. As the IUPAC
convention stands at present, the groups of elements in the f-block are not assigned any numbers.
It is not clear why Pyykké considers that all groups in the f-block should be considered as being
in group 3 while lamenting the fact that the 32-column format produces too many such groups.
However, we can remain within the IUPAC convention and say that group 3 consists of either Sc,
Y, La and Ac or perhaps Sc, Y, Lu and Lr on moving from an 18- to a 32-column format [14-20].°
Pyykk6 also worries that moving to a 32-column table, and possibly re-numbering as 1
to 32, would lead to a loss of correspondence between group numbers and the maximum
oxidation states of the elements in question. In fact this is something that already happened, to
a lesser extent, with the move from an 8-column to an 18-column format. In 8-column tables,
the maximum oxidation state of an element corresponds directly to the group number label.
However, in the 18-column format, this is only true of the s-block elements. In the p-block, one
needs to subtract 10 from the group label, while the d-block brings still further complications. But
even this criticism is merely pragmatic. Why should an improvement in the periodic table be held
hostage to the demand that one should immediately be able to deduce the maximum oxidation
state from the group label of any particular element? The periodic table has now become as much
