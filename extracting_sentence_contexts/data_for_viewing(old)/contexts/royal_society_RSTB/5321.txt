column 6 only pore-pair 2 is in contact with the buccal membrane (of. figs. 7 and 8).
In column a the upper tubercle represented in fig. 10 is opposite pore-pairs 16, 17 and
18, and therefore belongs to the sixth triad F. The fourth tubercle—that nearest the
median pit—has almost disappeared. The same is true of the third tubercle in column b.
From this it is certain that tubercles 1, 2 and 3 of column a and 1 and 2 of column 6}
(shown in fig. 7) have entirely disappeared during development.



ARBACTA, ECHINARACHNIUS AND LEPTASTERIAS. 301

In Arbacia the amount of resorption of calcite at the actual peristomial margin is
small in spite of the fact that the auricule are incomplete arches. This is in keeping
with the fact that each area bears but a single spheridium which remains in a pit near
the peristome throughout the life of the urchin (¢f. Echinus miliaris where each ambula-
crum bears numerous spheridia three of which pass, during development, from the
ambulacrum on to the buccal membrane.—Gorpon, 1926, a). The adoral triads, at
first narrow and high, become relatively broader and lower ; much of the calcite together
with the primary tubercle gradually disappears until, in the adult, only a small part of
each plate—that around the pore-pair—remains.

y. The Inter-ambulacrwm.—At metamorphosis the inter-ambulacrum differs con-
siderably from that found in the imago of Zchinus (cf. fig. 3 with Gorpon 1926, a,
fig. 16, p. 282). Plates 2 and 3 are on a level with plate 1 instead of being aboral to it,
