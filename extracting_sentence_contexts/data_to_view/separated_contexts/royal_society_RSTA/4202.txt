While, however, it follows automatically that non-causal behaviour, considered at the level of
a given model, cannot be handled deterministically, the reverse is not true. The qualification is
necessary because we can have causal models of processes in Nature that may not ultimately
be causal. The fact that the causal models of classical physics apply and are effective within the
proper limits of classical physics does not mean that the ultimate character of the actual processes
that are responsible for classical phenomena are causal. They may not be, for example, by virtue
of their ultimately quantum nature. Nor, conversely, does the non-causal character of a model, for
example that of QM, guarantee that quantum behaviour is non-causal.
