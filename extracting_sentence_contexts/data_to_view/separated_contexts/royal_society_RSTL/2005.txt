If the time of high water at Plymouth be 5" and at
the Eddystone 8", the water must be falling for three hours on the shore,
while it is rising at the same time at ten or twelve miles distance ; and this
through a height of seyeral feet. We can hardly imagine that any elevation
in one of the situations should not be transferred to the other in a much
$horter time than this. There is, in fact, no doubt that most, or all the statements of such discre-
pancies, are founded in a mistake arising from the comparison of two different
phenomena ; namely, the time of high water, and the time of the change from
the flow to the ebb current, In some cases the one, and in some the other of
these times has been observyed as the time of the tide, and in this manner have
arisen such anomalies as have been mentioned. The time of the change of current, or the time of slack water, as it may be
termed, never coincides with the time of high water, except close in upon the
Shore, and within its influence; the interval of the two times is generally con-
siderable.
