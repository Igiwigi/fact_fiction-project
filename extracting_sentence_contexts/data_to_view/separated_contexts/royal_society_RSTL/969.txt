W. Herscner. on the action of

reckoning from these points approximate in a general way
to the Newtonian scale. In fact, the 'periods of the more
refrangible rays being performed more rapidly than those of
the less, if 'we suppose the. coincidence. above spoken of to
take place: at- any; point-(the minimum for' instance),. of the
1% ring; the intervals between the x and (n+1)% minimum
will -be- greatest-for- the: red! and least for the violet, &c,
Consequently, when: the -violet next disappears totally from
the extraordinary pencil; there will remain yet a little of the
red, less of Â© the. orange, and 80 0n, and this: difference in-
creasing at every [succeeding minimum on- either side, will
produce a succession. of colours approximating in a general
way to NEwToN's scale. This approximation will however
be much less-close on the side of the virtual pole towards the
nearest axis, because the disturbing influence of the separa-
tion of the axes: on the figure of the rings and the law of
their successive intervals, is much more sensible than at a
distance from the pole. This will be evident if we consider
that in the interval between the extreme coloured axes, the
tints will be regulated entirely by-the law of their distribu-
tion.
