of the cord, and the commissural fibres of the nerves from the ganglia. But in the
course of the development of the segments of the body by elongation, a correspond-
ing elongation of the neryons cord itself takes place in the substance of the ganglia,
and these nerves become further and further removed from each other in that part
which lies on the cord above the middle of the ganglion, while they still remain at-
tached to the other nerves at its sides, and thus form a kind of triangle (fig. 13. 80. c)
above the aganglionic tract, as it passes over the gangliin. This elongation of the
cords in the ganglion goes on, as in Polydesmus, until in the middle portion of the
body these nerves have become released from those at the sides of the ganglion, and
pass off from its anterior part. In the anterior third of the body they are directed
forwards, but are till kept in contact with the ganglion by means of the lateral fibres
of reinforcement, and also by a delicate set of fibres derived from the ganglion itself
(fig. 14. c). These facts seem further to show that the ganglia are the centres in which
the growth and elongation of the cord always take place, and also that the nerves of
the cord are usually first formed in connexion with ganglia, although they may be
afterwards removed from them by further growth and changes.

The compound structure of the cord is distinetly seen in Geophilus, The superior
aganglionic tract is more clearly seen along the whole length of the cord, even while
passing over a ganglion, than in any other genus, It is scarcely more than one-half
of the width of the whole cord. The lateral fibres are also distinct, and may be
readily seen bounding the roots of the nerves.

The disposition of the terminal nerves of the cord is curions. Each ganglion gives
its pedal nerves backwards to the legs in the next segment, $0 that the penultimate
