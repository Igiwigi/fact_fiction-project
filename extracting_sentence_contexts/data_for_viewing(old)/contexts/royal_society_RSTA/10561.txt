and similarly for all negative and even values of 7, 7!! is infinite. The ratio of two

of these factorials of negative numbers is, however, finite, for it is easily shewn that
if m and n be two negative numbers, whether even or odd,

mii awe (—n —2)!!

nll = De (—m— 2)u

n!!

One of the advantages of a separate notation for what may be called the “ alternate”
or “double” factorial, is due to the fact that it often saves the inconvenience of
different expressions for odd and even numbers.

$2. Formule of Transformation,

It is convenient to collect together some equations which will often be required.
Most of these equations will be found already in previous writings, such as HErve's
‘Treatise or ADAms’ “‘ Researches in Terrestrial Magnetism.”

As regards zonal harmonics, it is only necessary to quote the well-known relations :
