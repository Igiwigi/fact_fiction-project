Comparison then of different habitats or of different parts of the same habitat tends
to confirm, the conclusions based on comparison of different regions of the same plant
or of different individuals in humid and dry air, that the more arid the environment
the higher the stomatal frequency tends to become.

Relative frequency on the two leaf surfaces.

In those leaves in which stomata are present on both surfaces, the question naturally
arises as to whether the stomatal frequency varies independently on the two surfaces
or whether there is a negative or positive correlation.

The facts that plants of moist habitats tend to have stomata in the upper epidermis
more frequently than those of dry situations, that stomata in the upper epidermis are

in the upper epidermis, possess such on the lower leaves (e.g., Mercurialis perennis), all
