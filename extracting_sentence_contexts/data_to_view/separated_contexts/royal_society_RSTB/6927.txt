But in such specimens, the ‘cortical’
parenchyma is derived from peripheral elements of the incipient vascular tissue exposed to
the air by the downward incisions. A fundamental question therefore relates to the
differentiation of this parenchyma. In attempting to interpret the varied configuration of fern steles in terms of causal factors
the first essential is to acquire an adequate knowledge of the facts of development in the
growing region. Very little, indeed, is known of the factors which are causally related to
the initial differentiation of vascular tissue, the absence of such knowledge being a serious
obstacle to further progress. Lang (1915) suggested that among these factors may be
included (i) functional stimuli, (ii) the inductive influence of the older differentiated parts
on the developing region, or (iii) formative stimuli of unknown nature proceeding from the
developing region.
