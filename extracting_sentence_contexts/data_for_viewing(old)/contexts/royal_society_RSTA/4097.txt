thus, only a ‘gas’ phase of particles is present. Our study is focused on the steep parts of the
surface-pressure isotherms, corresponding to the compression of particle monolayers without
voids. Note that equation (2.1) is obeyed by monolayers from monodisperse particles, as well as
by monolayers from slightly polydisperse particles such as those used in this study [23].

Figure 2c (experiment 2) compares JI(A) isotherms measured with the same amount of
particles, from the same batch, but spread on the surface of a water and 1mM KCI solution. The
data indicate that at the smaller values of A (at the higher degrees of compression) /7 is higher for
the monolayer spread on the surface of the 1mM KCI solution. This result seems paradoxical,
because the electrolyte is expected to suppress the electrostatic interparticle repulsion and to
lower the surface pressure /7. A possible explanation for this result is proposed in §3d.

Figure 2d illustrates three experimental facts, namely (i) the experimental curves possess large
linear portions when plotted as [7 versus A~/?; (ii) the magnitude of the surface pressure /7


increases with increasing KCI concentration; and (iii) for the same KCI concentration (0.1 mM),
IT is systematically lower on expansion than on compression, i.e. a pronounced hysteresis effect
is present. Moreover, the curves in figure 2c,d indicate good reproducibility of the experimental
curves obtained in three consecutive compression/expansion cycles. The theory of the surface
pressure of monolayers from charged particles is presented in the next section and possible
explanations for the observed effects are proposed.
