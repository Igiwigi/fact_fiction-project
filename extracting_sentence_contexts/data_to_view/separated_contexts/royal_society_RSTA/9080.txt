The line 60270 is from Hanpxe. As the di = 36 dd, it is just possible
that the link from it to the previous line might be a normal e or e(—d,) link. The
link 11332°4 from 54617 is about 10 in deficit and may be spurious, and in fact it
leads on into the X linkage. It is, however, w (d,)+°62, but this and those beyond
have been excluded from the list. In support of this further evidence is available
from the consideration of the D, linkage below.
