This important observation indicates a temporal evolution in the modes of melt
production within the crust and that TTG are not a simple, single type of melt but rather a pool of
rock types with a spectrum of compositions. Any model that includes the chemical composition of
TTG through time thus needs to account for changing conditions of melting of crustal successions,


whether they are buried or subducted. Hence, while this highlights a temporal evolution of melt
chemistry in general, complications may further arise through spatial variations between cratons,
and even within cratons; a fact that is often not accounted for, simply because of the difficulties
in reconstructing spatial relations of TTG in remnants of highly modified Archaean crust. The geodynamic framework for all of these changes remains equally confusing and
unresolved. One possible scenario for achieving burial of near-surface igneous rock is through
a continuous volcanic overload [63].
