Puggioni & Rondinelli showed using DFT calculations that inversion symmetry is broken
when the A-site cations are ordered in layers along the c-direction [11], while the magnetic and
metallic behaviour persist. Constraining the a and b lattice constants to be equal to mimic coherent
epitaxial growth, they obtained a Pmc2, space group, with the same tilt pattern as the Pnma of the
disordered alloy and an additional distortion corresponding to the polar > mode (shown in
figure 3a) of the parent P4/mmm space group. Interestingly, suppression of the polar [5 mode
caused a collapse of the ferromagnetic order [11]; we will use this fact to investigate the interplay
between polarization, magnetization and magnetoelectric multipoles. Using the ground-state structure of the layered A-site ordered compound from [11], we
calculate the electronic and magnetic structure with spin-orbit coupling included. Within the
LDA, we obtain a magnetic moment on the Ru atoms of 0.1 up; this increases to 0.7 wg with
even a small U=0.5eV.
