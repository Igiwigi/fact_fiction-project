on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat. 525

Let us now examine what information we may draw from
the facts which are recorded in this table. The first that must
occur is, that a candle which emits light, is also a copious source
of invisible heat. If this should seem to require a proof, I give
it as follows.

That the candle emits heat along with light, the thermometer
has ascertained ; and, that a considerable share of this at least
must be invisible, follows from comparing together the quantity
of light and heat which are stopped by different glasses. The
bluish-white one, for instance, stops 86 rays of light, and 625 of
heat. Hence, if only visible rays of heat came from the candle,
a glass stopping more light, as for instance the dark-red glass,
which stops 999,8, ought to stop all heat whatsoever; but the
