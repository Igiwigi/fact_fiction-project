centre as well, as held by Werk Mircwety and Retcuert and by FLEXNER in the case
of the Rattlesnake, is open to doubt. In favour of such an action is the fact that in
the cases in which small doses of Daboia venom were given, to induce the negative
phase of reduced coagulability, the number of respirations were nearly always reduced
very considerably before any marked fall of blood pressure had taken place. Further,
in some instances when a second dose of venom was injected, after complete vaso-motor
paralysis had taken place, the already much reduced respirations speedily failed
altogether and death took place, as, for example, in the fourth Puff Adder experiment.
In one experiment (not mentioned hitherto) two small subcutaneous doses of Daboia
venom, which had been mixed for } hour with CaLmerrte’s antivenin, were uot followed
by the usual slowing of the respiration, which would seem to point to a small amount
of Colubrine poison present having been neutralised by the serum. On the other hand
is the fact that in no case of Viperine poisoning was there any evidence of paralysis
of the end-plates of the phrenic nerves. The evidence does not seem to be sufficient
to decide the point either way, and it must be left to further experiments, on the
lines of C. J. Marrin’s method of separating the Colubrine from the Viperine element
by filtering through gelatine under pressure, to determine it.


190 DR. L. ROGERS ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION AND

Antidotes to Viperine Venoms,

If my conclusion is correct that the most essential lethal action of the Viperine
poisons as a class is a paralysis of the central vaso-motor centre, much as that of the
