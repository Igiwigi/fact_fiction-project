FF and ISL »y data for all alloys are illustrated as a function of hardness in figure 7, juxtaposed
onto the previous ISL,;, data. The data show a jaw-like trend whereby ISL) py threshold loads
decrease with increasing hardness. This behaviour is consistent with HE phenomena. More
precisely, in the current experimental configuration whereby a notched square bar is loaded in
bending, loss of ductility and strength due to the presence of added hydrogen are also expected to
cause a reduction of crack threshold in the notched sample. A notable observation is that the trend
for ISLi2y threshold is not linear. Rather, it appears to near a lower limit, whereby increasing
hardness above 53 HRC does not appear to cause significantly lower threshold values. Stated
otherwise, above 53 HRC the materials have reached a near-maximum degree of embrittlement.

These data validate the capability and sensitivity of the experimental set-up to provoke,
detect and quantify HE even at low hardness levels, i.e. in the range of 35 HRC. The fact that
quenched and tempered steel with hardness as low 35 HRC begins to exhibits a small but
measurable degree of loss of fracture strength must be carefully considered in the context of the
experimental conditions. These results were obtained under extreme experimental conditions of
hydrogen concentration and stress applied in pure bending. The combination of these conditions
is outside the normal spectrum for bolted joint applications, and therefore not directly applicable
to mechanical fasteners without additional conversion and correlation, as will be discussed in the
following section.

(c) Quantifying hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility: NFSo,

The ratio ISL}.2v/FF expressed as NFS»1.2v is a normalized measure of the HE susceptibility
of the material, at a given concentration of hydrogen absorbed during the experiment, precisely
