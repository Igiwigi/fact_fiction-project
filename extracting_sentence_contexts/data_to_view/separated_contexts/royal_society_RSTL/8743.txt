Is the contractile tissue of the swimming-organ peryaded by a definite system of sensory
and motor tracts, 80 to speak, radiating respectively to and from the marginal centres ?
or is the contractile tissue of the swimming-organ of a more primitive nature, the
functions of nerve and muscle being more or less blended throughout its substance ? Now, for my own part, I deem this question the most interesting one with which the
present paper is concerned; for the eyolutionist, no less than the physiologist, will
recognize its importance as of the highest. We have already obtained ample evidence
of the fact that it is to the Medus we must look for the first decided integrations of
tissue having, to say the least, 8omething closely resembling a nervous function to
8ubserve; and we have seen that these integrations appear in the form of intensely
localized centres of spontaneity. It therefore becomes a matter of pressing moment to
ascertain the manner in which the spontaneous impulses are transmitted from these

centres and distributed throughout the contractile tisxue of the swimming-organâ€”
whether a definite system of lines of discharge becomes eyolyed pari passu with a defi-
