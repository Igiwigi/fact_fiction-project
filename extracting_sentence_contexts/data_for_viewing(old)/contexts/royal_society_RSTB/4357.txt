most other Mammals, lies in the fact that in the latter no stage is characterised by
any marked difference in the cytoplasm or nuclei of the ameloblasts.

Tn the case of Marsupials, however, we find that there is a stage where the greater
part of the cytoplasm has become transformed into metaplasmic material, the cyto-
mitoplasm alone remaining.

The marked changes in the nuclei of the ameloblasts form another distinguishing
feature, for the size of the nucleus is undoubtedly related to the functional activity of
the cell, and therefore to the amount of undifferentiated cytoplasm, so that without
going so far as to accept in their entirety Herrwic’s views as to ‘“ Kernplasma-
relation,” we may safely infer that the great decrease in size of the nucleus is due to
the fact that almost all the cytoplasm has been changed into metaplasm.

This great decrease in the size of the ameloblastic nuclei during the earlier stages
of functional activity shows that substances from the karyoplasm must diffuse into
the cytoplasm, whilst their subsequent increase during the stages of rejuvenation can
only be explained by assuming that the nuclear chromatin has the power of taking
