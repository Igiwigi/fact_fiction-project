In
Hibiscus, on the other hand, there is considerable actual growth, in the sense of
the formation of new tissue elements by cell division. In stem outgrowths there
is still more division, so that large masses of tissue are formed, which in some cases
are almost indistinguishable from wound-callus. It, therefore, seems probable that the fact that the outgrowths usually begin
in the green cells is to be explained by the relation between assimilation, turgescence,
and growth. In this connection it would be interesting to know if the intumescences
described by Soraver* in the flowers of the orchid Cymbidium Lowi occurred in
tissues containing either chloroplasts or leucoplasts. Neither the description nor
the figure elucidates this point.
