sexuality would only occur at those intervals when fluid water is present; thus in
plants of aquatic ancestry passing to a terrestrial habit, in order to secure an adequate
plant-population, a premium would be put upon the increase of individuals by
vegetative means; increased spore-production would thus become a matter of
importance in land-growing plants, while as the number of spores increased, their
nutrition would demand an increasing vegetative system. ‘Thus it is reasonable to
think that from simple beginnings, such as those seen in the post-sexual stage of

* SrRASBURGER (/.c., p. 820) uses the term “isogenic” in the sense in which we use “ homologous”
alternation, and “ heterogenic ” in the sense in which we use “ antithetic ” alternation. I see no advantage
in thus superseding the earlier terms of CELAKOVSKY, and I shall retain those which have the priority.

certain Thallophytes, the sporophyte as it is seen in the Archegoniatz may have
originated, as a matter of adaptation to life on dry land.*

But against this hypothesis, and apparently supporting the position of those who
uphold PrinesHern’s view of homologous alternation, is another line of evidence, which
has since 1893 been strengthened by striking new facts, viz., the discovery of fresh
cases of direct vegetative transition from the one generation to the other in
