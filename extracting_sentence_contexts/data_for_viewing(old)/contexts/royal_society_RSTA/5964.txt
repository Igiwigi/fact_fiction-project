where (—A)*, a € [0,1], is the fractional Laplacian defined for sufficiently smooth functions v:
2 — Rin terms of the relation (ay U]k = |kP"[O]k, k € Z, in which [7], is the Fourier coefficient
of v with wavenumber k. As shown in [69], system (2.8) admits globally defined smooth classical
solutions in the subcritical (a € (1/2, 1]) and in the critical (w = 1/2) regime. On the other hand,
finite-time blow-up occurs in the supercritical regime (a € [0,1/2)). The fractional Burgers system
is thus a useful simple model to study singular behaviour, especially given the fact that the three-
dimensional Navier-Stokes system is also known to be globally well posed in the classical sense in
the presence of fractional dissipation with exponents a > 5/4 [70]. The fractional Burgers system
(2.8) has also been studied in connection with turbulence [71].

Generalizations of the instantaneous estimate (2.3) for the case of the fractional Burgers system
(2.8) have been obtained in [12]. It was shown that the dependence of the bounds on the enstrophy
rate of growth d€/dt on &) has the same global form of} in the subcritical, critical and parts of the
supercritical regime with the exponent y increasing without bound as the fractional dissipation
exponent a is reduced from 1 (where y = 5/3, cf. (2.3)) to 1/4. Moreover, by solving numerically a
variant of Problem 2.1, these new estimates were shown to be sharp (up to numerical prefactors).
Finally, singularity formation in the supercritical regime and transient behaviour in the subcritical
case were studied numerically using Monte Carlo methods in fractional Burgers flows subject to
