It is important to
note that in the Monkey, much of what we are, from observations upon the lower
animal types, inclined to regard as temporary and relegate to block or ‘“ shock,” in
Gorrz’s language “ Hemmungserscheinungen ”—not « Ausfallserscheinungen”—proves,
under prolonged observation, to be, I must think, permanent ; in fuct, to be true
deficiency phenomenon. Every histologist acquainted with the comparative structure
of the spinal cord in the Ape and in the Dog, must have been impressed with the far
greater complexity obvious in the former. The above evidence is in accord with that,
for it shows that the same trauma inflicted upon the cord leads, in the monkey, to
much heavier permanent defect than in the dog ; just as, in fact, ablations of the
cortex cerebri are pregnant with far greater “Ausfallserscheinungen” in the Monkey
(Ferrier, H. Munk, ScnArer, Morr) than in the Dog (Gourz). It is reasonable to
argue still severer results in the case of the human spinal cord ; of which again we
know the minute structure to be yet more complex still.
