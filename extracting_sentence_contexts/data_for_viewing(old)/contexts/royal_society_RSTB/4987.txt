low oxygen pressure in the inspired air, the discrepancy between the oxygen
pressure in the bag and that in the mixed venous blood is reduced. At high
altitudes no assumption can be made as to the composition of the arterial blood, It
is necessary to obtain the blood by arterial puncture, and determine the oxygen
and CO, contents by direct analysis.

We have treated our results in the following way :—(a) The minute-volume has
been worked out on Frox’s principle both on the oxygen basis and the CO, basis, on
the basis of points C and E; the two have then been averaged. We also give the
results as calculated by Muaxins and Davis, 7.¢. on the basis of the A and B
points (fig. 24). These naturally give a greater minute-volume throughout and show
a trifling rise in the minute-volume at Cerro, but they agree in the main with other
methods in the following respects. Rough as the methods are, one or two facts
emerge. A very trifling amount of exercise on the bicycle ergometer raises the blood
flow between 100 to 800 per cent. No change of this order takes place as the result of
residence at high altitudes, if one seeks for a change approaching one-tenth of this
order, namely 20-30 per cent., one just reaches the point at which the discrepancies
as between one method and another loom very large. It is not possible to be certain
of a change of 20 per cent. in either direction, and at present one must consider that
neither a rise nor a fall in the minute-volume of 20 per cent. was established at
Cerro, whilst a change of a larger order was disproved. Since the pulse quickens, the
systolic output may appear to be reduced, or approximately unchanged according to
the method of estimation employed (see figs. 25 and 26), The above statements
apply only to the two persons on which experiments were performed—Redfield and
Meakins.
