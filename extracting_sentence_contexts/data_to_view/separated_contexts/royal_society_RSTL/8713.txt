The more important of these are the following :—(1) 'The cells of the nerve-rudi-
» ment are distinctly smaller than those of the vertebral rudiment ; (2) the cells of the nerve-
rudiment are elongated, and have their long axis arranged parallel to the long axis of
S the nerye-rudiment, while the cells surrounding them are much more nearly circular. The cells of the nerve-rudiment measure about +55 X 5355 to T3575 X 335 inch,
those of the vertebral rudiment 5555 X 7955 inch. The greater difficulty experienced

in distinguishing the nerve-rudiment from the connective-tissue in Pristinrus than in
Torpedo arises from the fact that the connective-tissue is much looser and less condensed
: in the latter than in the former. 'The connective-tissue cells which have grown out from the muscle-plates form a con-
tinuous arch over the dorsal surface of the neural tube (vide Plate 17. fig. F); and in
ome 8pecimens it is difficult to see whether the arch is formed by the rudiment of the
posterior root or by connective-tissue.
