which Angiosperms are abundant, are represented as circles.

The arrows indicate the two streams of migration, the northward trend of the Jurassic-
Wealden floras, and the dispersal from Arctic lands of some of the oldest members of
the present dominant group of Angiosperms.

The present, approximate, northern boundaries of the distribution areas of some of
the Angiosperm families and genera which are represented in the Greenland Cretaceous
flora are also indicated, and for these I am indebted to my friend Mr. Ronatp
Goop.

The northern boundaries of the families and genera shown in Map II must be regarded
as only approximations to the facts of geographical distribution. Thus a member of the
Menispermaces, Cocculus pendulus Dieus, is recorded from localities in Egypt and
elsewhere farther north than the line drawn for the family.

Map II. Locality2. Spitsbergen.*—N aruorst assigns the plants from Kap Staratschin
and Advent Bay to the Upper Jurassic period (including Wealden), and those from Kap
Boheman to the Middle Jurassic. All three floras include Greenland types and,
botanically, there is no clear distinction between them. ‘The comparisons made in the
Table are based for the most part on resemblances which do not amount to specific
identity.

detail with the Greenland flora, or to be assigned within narrow limits to a geological
