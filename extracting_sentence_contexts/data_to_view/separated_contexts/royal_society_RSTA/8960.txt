that it agrees roughly with the value K = 2°50 cm, for an aperture of diameter 2°50 em. in an infinitely
extended thin plate. Reference to fig. 2 of §11 shows that the length of the resonator at position 0 is
not determinate owing to the fact that the face opposite the aperture is not plane. The distance from the
mica diaphragm to the aperture is 11-5 em., not very different from the value of ho required to satisfy
the theoretical formula (i.). For purposes of approximating to the pitch of such resonators for purposes
of design, the theoretical formula (v.) may be employed.
