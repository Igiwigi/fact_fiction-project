So much for the scheme of continuous killing-out. Let us now turn to a scheme of
cataclysmic killing; supposing that a series of practically instantaneous cataclysms
occurs, each sweeping off a certain proportion of the then existing species. However
crude, it seems to me that such a scheme is a slightly closer representation of the facts ;
at all events, a comparison between the consequences of such a scheme and the scheme
of continuous killing will show whether extreme differences in the time-incidence of
destruction on species have or have not any important effect on the estimated doubling-
period. M 2
