We can now formulate the question: Of the permutations of the first 2
numbers, how many have a descending specification denoted by a given composition
of the number x? Whatever the answer, it is clear that the same answer must, in
general, he given for three other compositions, viz., the three others associated with
the zig-zag graph. In fact, from

314592768 of specification 211221,

we derive 867295413 " 2241:

and from these two by changing the number m into n—m-+1,
796518342 of specification 1422,

22112
and so forth. 243815679 ” 122112

Tn two cases there are two associated compositions instead of four, viz. :—
(i) When the composition reads the same as its inverse (that is the same from
left to right as from right to left),
(ii) When the conjugate and the inverse are identical, as in 221, whose
conjugate is 122.
*The number of self-inverse compositions of an even number 27 and of an uneven

number 2m-+1 is om
Pi

The number of inverse-conjugate compositions of an uneven number 27+ 1 is
Hence, in the present theory, the number of different numbers that appear in the
case of an even number 2m is, since the whole number of compositions is 2?"~",
$.2"+4 (229),
= 2m (29241);
and, in the ease of an uneven number 2m+1,
