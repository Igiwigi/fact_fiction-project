clearly the limit is too low. Pascuen has pointed out that 27065°6 and 27215 are
respectively VP, (2) ~ VS (2) and VP, (2)~VS (2). How closely this is the case may
be illustrated by calculating these values with the limits of errors. VP, (2) and
VP. (2) are 10286°84 and 10305°59, with possible errors 1:73. Using the calculated
limits of the D series (Table [.) and Pascren’s value of § (2), the value of VS (2) is
13980°1643°82, giving respectively from the above relations 3693°32+5°5 and
3674°57+5°5. The wave - numbers of the actual lines are 3694:02+'14 and
3673°74+°27. Still it isa single agreement, and might possibly be fortuitous, The
measurements of wave differences are much more reliable than those of actual wave-'
lengths. Now the difference for the two lines in question gives v = 20°28+°41, with
PascueEn’s estimates of his errors. The difference for P, (2) and P, (2) is 18°75+°36,
which is decidedly against the conclusion. In favour of it, on the other hand, is the
fact that a similar relation shows itself under Na. There is another unallotted pair,
4642°35 R. (50 8.) and 4638°6 R., with a separation 17°4044°5 dd, where dd denotes
the wave-length difference error of observation. The first has a wave-number about
P(o)—VD(2), viz, 21534°92+4°5d) as against 215382+7. It is difficult to see
where a doublet with » about 17 to 20 could come in unless the D series was a
satellite one, in which ease the first series here considered should be a doublet one. If
so, however, it would have been seen by PascuEN, who separated much closer lines in
the ultra-red Na spectrum. The other lines left over are 4829 R., 4808 L. D., and 4767 R.

Na. The lines observed in Na not belonging to the regular series are much more
numerous than in the other elements. The following is the list :—

23391°3 P. A, (83) 55827 8. B, (5) 4660°2 8.
