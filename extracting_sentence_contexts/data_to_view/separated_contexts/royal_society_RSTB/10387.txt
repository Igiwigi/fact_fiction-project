That is, if the syllable X
occurs 100 times, and the conjunction of XY occurs 80 times, the transitional prob-
ability between X and Y is 80%. These experiments demonstrated that infants
preferentially segment syllable groupings with high transitional probabilities
compared with syllable groupings with low transitional probabilities. The fact
that infants could use the statistical structure of the input to learn the identity
of words provided support to theoretical accounts suggesting that learning
plays an important role in language acquisition, and sparked tremendous interest

adults, and other species. Subsequent research has demonstrated the breadth of stat-
