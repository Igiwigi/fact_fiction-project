nature of a wrong pairing, of certain individuals, we should eimply have o, = o:,

In any case, if the percentage of fictitious values be not large, the second and third

terms are of the second order of small quantities, since and are small. The
P

maximum value of the third term cannot be greater than + stn —m.)*, and this
will be relatively small in the cases to which we shall apply it. For example, no great changes are made in o, when we vary the amount of
fictitious cases introduced into our fertility tables. m, and m, do, however, change.
