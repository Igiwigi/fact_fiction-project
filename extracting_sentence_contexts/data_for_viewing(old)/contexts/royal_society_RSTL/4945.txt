water, into which a quantity of fluid had just been expressed from a male that had
been kept separate from the female. The fluid on examination was found to be com-
posed almost entirely of very active spermatozoa. The egg was examined three
minutes after immersion, and scarcely five minutes after it had been laid, and multi-
tudes of spermatozoa were then seen adhering to its surface. Most of them were still
vibrating rapidly, while others were motionless. But although I was able to distin-
guish every part of these bodies, I could not detect any in the act of penetrating, or
which had already penetrated into the substance of the envelope, and most certainly
not one was imbedded in the interior. Neither were there any in contact with the
yelk-membrane, or in the yelk-chamber of the envelope.

The egg of the Newt is peculiarly fitted for an examination of this kind, from the
fact of the existence of this yelk-chamber, or space in the interior of the envelope.
This is formed by the gelatinous covering which the egg gains in the oviduct imbi-
bing fluid by endosmose and becoming expanded immediately it comes into contact
with water, when the inner layer separates from the vitellary membrane, with which it
has been in contact within the duct; and as the outer layers more and more expand,
the yelk, covered only by the vitellary membrane, is left free in a large cavity in the
interior, surrounded by a thin fluid. The spermatozoa of the Newts, as is well known,
are of large 8ize, and are easily recognized ; 80 that in the eyent of their having pene-
trated the egg-covering before it, leaves the duct, or at the moment of its expansion,
or after the chamber has been formed in it, they can hardly escape observation.
