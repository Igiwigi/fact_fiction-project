(below 0.5 in synergy bias), they can actually be expanded into microscales that are themselves
more synergy biased (and the correlation between the change in synergy and the macroscale
synergy remained positive).

4. Causal emergence as information conversion

Given the evidence that information conversion can occur at macroscales, even in a well-
understood baseline measure like the mutual information, it is next necessary to establish what
it means and how it relates to other information-theoretic approaches to emergence. How does
it play out in measures like the effective information, which was specifically designed to capture
causal influence and can peak at a macroscale?

A hint comes from the already well-established fact that the effective information (EI) changes
across scales due to a change in determinism and/or degeneracy [8,10,18]. Indeed, it is already
proven that:

EU(X;Y) = > J P(x, y) logy (seeps) | P(X) =H™, (4.1)
xEeX yey


which differs from the normal mutual information calculation in that P(X) is set to H™**, and can 8 |
be rewritten as

Effective information = determinism — degeneracy. (4.2) Ss
