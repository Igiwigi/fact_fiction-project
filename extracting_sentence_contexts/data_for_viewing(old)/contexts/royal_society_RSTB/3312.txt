ON THE ARAUCARIEA, RECENT AND EXTINCT. 373

a. ARAUCARIA.

Paleozoic Records.—The most convenient method of summarising the facts
gleaned from a study of Palwozoic plants which have a bearing on the question
at issue is to consider briefly such genera as have been either definitely referred
to the Araucarieze, or regarded as probably referable to that division of the
Coniferales.

Walchia.—The generic name Walchia, instituted by SteRNBERG, is applied to
branches met with in the upper members of the Carboniferous system and in strata
of Permian age. The sterile shoots are usually in habit and in foliar characters
practically identical with those of recent species of the Eutacta section of Araucaria-
The close resemblance between Walchia piniformis and Araucaria excelsa was
recognised by BRONGNIART in 1849.* Pith-casts of Walchia also resemble those of
recent Araucarian branches. The evidence afforded by the reproductive shoots is
