'= 3°12807. Thus 6 + 38, — 28, is positive, and accordingly no rational point-binomial is likely
to fit as well as the normal curve. As a matter of fact the fundamental cubic is now

176032) + 1:0453272* + *033773z — ‘0003709 = 0,

‘The two negative roots of this equation give imaginary value for p and g. The
small positive root gives p greater than unity and q negative, n is also negative.
