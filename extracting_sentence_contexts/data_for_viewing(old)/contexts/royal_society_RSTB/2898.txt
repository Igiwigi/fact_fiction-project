attached to a “crest” which, no doubt, represents the lamina of the bi-sporangiate
species. As the specimens with structure preserved show, there are as a rule two
monosporangiate pedicels corresponding to each bract, springing from the ventral
surface a little above the base of the gamophyllous verticil. The pairing of the
sporangiophores in this type may reasonably be regarded as analogous to the
branching of the fertile appendages in Sphenophyllum fertile.t The bracts are
completely connate for a long distance from their base, and thus differ widely from
the appendages of the new cone. Though the two fructifications are extremely
divergent in their general morphology, there is a close agreement in certain details of
structure. The structure of the pedicel is practically the same in both.t As already
pointed out the sporangium is attached to the crest in S. Dawsoni in quite the same
way as it is to the lamina in S, fertile; the complex structure of the sporangial wall
appears to be essentially the same in both. In fact the agreement in all these
features is as close as it could well be, considering that the sporangiophore is mono-
sporangiate in the one case and bisporangiate in the other.

Several other species with monosporangiate pedicels have been described by
M. ZetnuEr ;§ so far as the available data show they present no special points of
comparison with our fossil.
