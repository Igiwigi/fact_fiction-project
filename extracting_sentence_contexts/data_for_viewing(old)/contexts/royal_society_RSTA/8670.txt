material, as it is possible that the spontaneous weakening is always accompanied by
the formation of minute cracks, of the same size as the molecular groups.

It is probable that, in many cases, the most stable orientation of the molecules at
a free surface is that in which their maxima of attraction lie along the surface. Such
an orientation would in turn lead to a similar tendency on the part of the next layer

of molecules, and so on, the tendency diminishing with increasing distance from the
surface. There would therefore be a surface layer having the special property that in it
the “ flaws” ran parallel to the surface.

Hence this layer would be of exceptional strength in the direction of the surface.
This suggests a reason for the experimental fact that the breaking load of wires and

fibres consists mainly of two parts, one proportional to the area, and the other to the
perimeter of the cross-section. The process of drawing, too, might predispose the
molecules to take up positions with their maxima of attraction parallel to the surface.

If a perfectly clean glass plate be covered with gelatine and set aside, the gelatine
gradually contracts, and as it does so it tears from the glass surface thin flakes up to
