hour of 2» 34®=, At St. Helena also September is found on the east side of the mean
line at all hours of the twenty-four, except for one hour before and one hour after
noon, when it is slightly on the west side; and March is found on the west side of
the mean line with the exception of the hours from noon to 6 y.M. April participates
with March in the peculiarity thus described both at the Cape and St. Helena. April
is on the west side of the mean line at the Cape at all hours without exception, and
at St. Helena at all hours with the exception of 11 a.m. and noon.

I abstain from dwelling on other particulars, fearing that, not possessing any
clue towards an explanation of these remarkable phenomena, I may do harm rather
than good by contributing to give an undue significance to what may not prove the
most important features. I will only permit myself therefore to point out one or two
practical considerations snggested by the facts now under notice.

1. Recent researches in meteorology have shown us, that when we confine our
attention to the mean annual and mean diurnal values (of the temperature for example)
in different parts of the globe, we derive but a small part of the instruction which the
observation of nature is eapable of affording. A similar remark applies with equal
justice to the consideration of the variations of the magnetic elements. Jn the Annual
Variation now before us, even a very cursory inspection is sufficient to show, that as
the same months occupy positions on opposite sides of the mean line at different
parts of the twenty-four hours, the mean Annual Variation, or that which is shown by
the mean values in each month taken from al/ the observation hours, must be merely
a residual quantity; and that consequently natural features must be more or less
masked in deductions in which only mean values are brought into view. In fact,
