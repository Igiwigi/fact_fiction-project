Experience has sufficiently proved, that a stronger will ever
obscure a fainter light ; and it follows hence, that the light of a
bright star approaching the moon, when full, or nearly s0,
will lose something of its lustre: but little can be inferred
in favour of an atmosphere either of the moon, or of Mars,
from the observation of Cassinz, in which, as Dr. HERSCHEL
has illustrated by some observations of his own,* a star in
Aquarius, of the sixth magnitude, and as yet six minutes dis-
tant from Mars, diminished in light when both were seen in
the same field of the telescope. A mere apparent diminution of
light, occasioned by the glare of a larger luminous object, when
Seen at the same time with a smaller one, in the field of the
telescope, is one thing ; and another thing is a real indistinct-
ness of the small luminous body, which increases in proportion
as they approach nearer to each other.

on the Atmosphere of the Moon. 359

It was very natural for Jupiter to diminish in brightness,
when it approached 80 near to the moon, then almost at its
full, as to be seen at the same time in the field of the telescope,
which was, in fact, the circumstance of this observation ; but
I could not observe any progressive variation of light in the
eastern and western, equally luminous, disks, proportional to
their distances from the limb of the moon, much less a real
indistinctness ; and this neither when the limbs of the two
planets were nearly in contact, nor when Jupiter was partly,
or about one half, covered by the moon

It was a sight truly gratifying to an eye accustomed to the
light of the moon, or in general to similar observations, to be-
hold how Jupiter, at its immersion, as well as emersion, being
half, or more than half, covered by the moon, exhibited its
belts and other parts,-as distinctly, close to the limb of the
moon, as it does at some distance from it: and had I not al-
ready succeeded in my numerous observations on the atmo-
sphere of the moon, and very recently in those which enabled
me to determine its twilight, I should perhaps have adopted
the doubts the ancient astronomers entertained concerning the
existence of a lunar atmosphere; and this the rather, as when
Jupiter, in its immersion, was $0 far covered, that the luminous
Spot 1, fig. 2, was close to the moon, I could plainly distin-
guish this spot, although it be in itself by no means very
perceptible. Such, however, must have been the appearances, according
to my new observations and measurements of the twilight of
the moon : for if it be proved that the extent of this twilight,
to where it loses itself in the light reflected from the almost
wholly illuminated disk of our earth, amounts to no more

than an arc of 2* 34/ of the circumference of the moon, and if
it be hence demonstrable that its greatest dilatation does barely
amount to z3* 8, and the perpendicular height of that part of
the lower more condensed ,stratum of its atmosphere, which -
is capable of reflecting the solar rays, and of producing some
other, perhaps more remarkable, obscurities in the stars seen
through it, does not exceed zooo Paris feet, and hence cannot
reach above one second of a degree above the limb of the
moon; we need not wonder that s0 small a magnitude, which
loses itself in the inequalities of the limb, many parts of which
are known to be considerably mountainous, should not be-
come sensible, especially at the approach of a body of $0
large a diameter as Jupiter, and when so small a magnifying
power‚Äù is applied.
