The formule of Ryppere or of Kayser and Runex are sufficient in general to
identify lines as belonging to a given series, except in the cases of lines in the infra
red, where the order is 1 or even 2, but they are not sufficiently accurate for our
purpose. It is necessary to obtain formule for the various series which can reproduce
the known series within limits of error or, if this is impossible, with as few outside as
possible. The fact that Ryppere’s formula contains two arbitrary constants, whereas
K.R.’s have three, and the well-known relationships brought to light by Ryppera’s
formula naturally suggest it as the basis for a second approximation. In the absence
of any definite theory as to the nature of the vibrations giving rise to spectral lines,
it is necessary to make some assumption and to test it by its results. The most
natural one clearly is to suppose that in RypBere’s form A—N/(D)?
