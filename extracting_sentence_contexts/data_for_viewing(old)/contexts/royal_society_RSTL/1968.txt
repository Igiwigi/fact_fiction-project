the mercury obtained was pure and dry, its quantity could not represent less
than was present in the compound subjected to analysis. It may have con-
tained more, but not less mercury than was collected ; and any quantity to
be added to that above given would proportionally diminish the quantity of
chlorine. Thus, if these analyses are at all trustworthy, they prove that the
equivalent of chlorine may be less than 35'7, but that it cannot be greater.
There seems, therefore, to be no reason to call in question the methods
which have been used to find the equivalent of chlorine. The real number,
as above stated, is to be sought within a range extending from 35'28 to 35:45.
This range may be much narrowed by facts supplied by other experiments.
Were 35:35 assumed as the equivalent of chlorine, 107:78 would be the equi-
valent of silver, deducible from the composition of chloride of silver; but this
number for silyer is inconsistent with the analysis of nitrate of silyer to be
afterwards mentioned, and consequently the hypothesis which led to it is in-
admissible. By a similar line of reasoning the equivalent of chlorine may
be brought within the limits 35'4 and 35:45, I am disposed to select 35:42 as
agreeing closely with my own results, coinciding with the number given in the
most recent tables of Bzrze1lvs, and as giving a convenient number for silyer.

Equivalent of Silver.

It appears, at first sight, such a simple operation to prepare oxide of silyer,
