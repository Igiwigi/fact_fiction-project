edges, as if they had been just taken from a quarry. They were exposed to a hot
sun, and the black pitchy matter was oozing out abundantly from numerous pores.
The planes of stratification presented those undulations called ripple-marks. On my
inquiring from whence they came, I was assured by the fishermen that a fresh supply
