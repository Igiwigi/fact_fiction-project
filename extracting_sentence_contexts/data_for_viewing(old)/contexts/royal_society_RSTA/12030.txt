3 C, = a + 2b (100 — t) + 3c (100 — ¢)*.
& where

8 a= 0719020000,

a b = — 0:00006750,

g c=  0'00000182.

= This, of course, is plotted, virtually, by the inclination of the curve upon the plate,
& the ordinates all being supposed as lengthened in the ratio 1 to 48°56.
3 The line above this, p = 071800, shows a rapid upward curvature below 35°; liquid
3 in fact was present up to 18°5. Nothing being accurately known as to the specific
F heat of the saturated vapour, we cannot safely assume anything as to the course of
2 events between the 13° and 35° points. A theoretical point obtained from the curve
A of Part IL, at the initial temperature 15°, lies on the prolongation of the experiments
at the upper temperature. It is not, however, marked upon the dotted line, as it
cannot be relied upon, except it be shown that the variation with temperature of the
specific heat of the saturated vapour is at the same rate as that of the superheated
vapour.

The following equation, of similar form to the last,
with fair accuracy :—

C, = 0°2056 — 2 x 0:0000819 (100 — t) + 3 X 000000133 (100 — ¢).
