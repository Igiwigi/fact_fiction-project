AND CHROMOSOME PAIRING IN OSMUNDA REGALIS 199

potencies on a thread. That normally these potencies are satisfied internally to the
chromosome in the production of the submicroscopic convolution. When this normal
equilibrium is interrupted, presumably by chemical means, at leptotene, external
reaction results in chromosome pairing (at zygotene). When elastic recovery has
restored the original equilibrium (at pachytene) pairing ceases.

‘THE PHENOMENON OF SUPERCONTRACTION

Two further pieces of indirect evidence may be quoted in support of the inter-
pretation of meiosis outlined in the previous section. The first is the well-known fact
that the most striking other case of a chromosome in a state of exceptional elongation,
that of the salivary glands of the Diptera, also shows chromosome pairing in an extreme
degree. No explanation, either biological or physical, can generally be advanced for
this behaviour in such a tissue. If, however, chromosome elongation and chromosome
pairing are causally connected the matter becomes intelligible if not explained.

The second, perhaps more cogent, piece of indirect evidence is in the phenomenon
of “‘supercontraction”’. This is exemplified by wool and other fibres as a normal after-
effect of extreme stretching. If wool, for instance, is held under tension in steam for
not more than two minutes certain intramolecular linkages are disrupted and 100%
elongation of the visible thread may result. If, however, the thread is retained either
in steam or cold alkalies (under conditions in which permanent recombinations are
