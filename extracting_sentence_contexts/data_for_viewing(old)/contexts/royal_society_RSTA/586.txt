If some powerful mechanisms can arise in a natural way, then very clever people will use and optimize them. We repeat that
the analysis and interpretation of these events in the social and political literature are very controversial [1-5]. There are
claims that the absence of political programmes and strong political leaders is an illusion; these programmes and leaders are
just hidden.


realization of their energy in real social actions. ASE (as well as stimulated emission of energy in
physics) describes only the emission of the quanta of energy. The real social actions can be treated
as analogues of the measurements performed on photons, i.e. the interaction of the field-quanta
with atoms. In our social laser model, the majority of the population emits coherent s-photons, but
only a fraction of them is ‘detected’, e.g. in clashes with police and army. However, the presence
of a strong coherent wave of opposition plays a crucial role, at least in the aforementioned recent
social protests and revolutions. In fact, the presence of such an information wave restricts the
force of reactions from governmental organs.

systems’ of Linnaeus University and the visiting professor fellowship at the Center for Quantum
BioInformatics (QBIC), Tokyo University of Science (October 2014). The author would like to thank I. Basieva
for numerous discussions on principles of laser-functioning.
