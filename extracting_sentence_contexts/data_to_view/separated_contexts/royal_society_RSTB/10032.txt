One key way in which fire and herbivory differ is their
selectivity. Fire has often been characterized as the ultimate
non-selective herbivore [48,49]. In fact, the ideal fuel/forage
for fires and herbivores are different [50], as anyone who
has seen a fire delicately picking its way through a moist
fuel-bed would agree. For herbivores, high-quality forage
represents green leaf material with a low C:N ratio and a
high bulk density (biomass concentration [51-53]). Given
these constraints, herbivores will be more/less selective
depending on their body size and gut type (figure 1a).
