showed that these beds were identical with those which elsewhere contained the
fossil now generally known as Spirorbis. In the meanwhile Puriures,t in 1836,
had described the Spcrorbis-limestones of Ardwick, Manchester. The fossil
Spirorbis itself was first described in 1809.ยง

Murcuison|| laid great stress on the occurrence of these Spirorbis-limestones as a
means of correlating the coalfields of the Welsh Borderland system. More recently
Dantet Jones has applied the same principle to the correlation of the Sulphur
Coals in different parts of the Wyre Forest.

It appears to me to be more than doubtful whether any such evidence can be
relied upon, in view of the wide vertical range which Sprrorbis is now known to
possess. There are four important facts to be borne in mind in this connection.
Firstly, in my experience, Spirorbis occurs in shale more frequently than in lime-
stones. Such Spzrorbis-shales were recorded from the north-eastern margin of the
Mamble district by Roserrs in 1860.**

Secondly, Spirorbis sometimes occurs in a hard, cream-coloured limestone. It seems
to be held in some quarters that these limestones are largely built up of Spzrorbis.
On the contrary, I believe this fossil is, in a sense, an accidental occurrence in the
limestone, and just as much so as any impression of a fossil plant found in a
calcareous bed.

Thirdly, cream-coloured limestones of similar texture to those containing Spirorbis,
but without any trace of that fossil, are of frequent occurrence, and are often fairly
