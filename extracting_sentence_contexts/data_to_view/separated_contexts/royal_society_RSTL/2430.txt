The
irregular torsion of the silk thread however still embarrassed
us a good deal, But though this undoubtedly caused indi-
vidual results to differ more from the mean than we had
expected, it is not sufficient to account for a singular ano-
maly observed not only in the mean results of a great
number of trials, but in all individual cases ; viz. that by this
mode of observation, zinc was invariably found to stand
above copper in the scale of magnetic action, whereas in the
determination by the statical method, where the deviation of

the compass was observed, the former metal was as invaria-
bly found to be placed below the latter, the other metals
retaining their order. A possible explanation of this anomaly
(should future experiments show that the fact depends on no
fallacy) may be found in the principles hereafter to be
explained, but we wish to be understood as speaking with
reserve on this point, |
