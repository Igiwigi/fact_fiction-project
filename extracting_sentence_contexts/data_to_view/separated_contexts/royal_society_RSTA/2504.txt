Taking this into account, and the smallness of the value of b/a
deduced in the case of R from Table XLIV., the natural inference would seem to be
that the value of R from ordinary days in a particular month depends less on the
value of § in that month than on the values of $ in the other months of the year. This may mean nothing more than that the value of S on a particular day is a very
rough measure of the solar activity to which enhanced diurnal inequalities are due,
while the mean value of § from all days of the year affords a very exact measure. The fact that the value of b/a derived from Table XLIV. in the case of R’ is so
much larger than that derived in the case of R, suggests that the solar influence is
more direct or immediate in the case of irregular than in the case of regular magnetic
changes. Table XLV.
