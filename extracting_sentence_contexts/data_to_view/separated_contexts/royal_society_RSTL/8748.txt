The
stomach is globular, with a long conical mouth or proboscis projecting up in the centre
of the last described cavity. A similar proboscis is deseribed by Sans as existing in
Allopora oculing. The stomach seems to have no outlet below; but it is of course diffi-
cult to be certain of the fact in 80 small and yielding a structure. A series of bundles
of fibres, each bundle continuous with one of the plications of the cavity above, is
attached to the periphery of the stomach. There are no mesenteries, at least none
80 distinct]y differentiated histologically that they can be recognized by methods which
show them plainly in /eliopora and Pocillopora.
