But in no other reptile are
those articular surfaces 80 narrow vertically in proportion to their breadth as they are
in the cervical vertebre of the Pterosauria (76. figs. 1, 2, 12-14, 6b, c): in the dorsal
8eries the cup and ball present more ordinary saurian proportions. This fact, being established, will give new and increased interest to the working out
and examination of any detached vertebre from secondary rocks which resemble in
texture and 8ize those of Birds and Pterodactyles. It has been alleged, for example,
on microscopic characters of the osseous tissue, that certain pneumatic wing-bones found

8il in Stonesfield slate, are those of birds. But every such vertebra from that lower
Solitic bed which I have yet seen, has the simple terminal articular concavity or convexity
Aaracteristic of the Pterodactyle.
