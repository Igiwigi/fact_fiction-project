The origin of these terraces is not difficult to explain. Immediately after the
eruption the valley was more or less completely filled with fine hot ash, mixed with a
certain proportion of coarse blocks and bombs. The river when it resumed its flow
found it a matter of no great difficulty to wash out or re-arrange this material. But
the rains in St. Vincent are intermittent, and take the form of heavy showers, during
which the streams come down in flood and frequently are raging torrents. At other
times the quantity of water in their channels is very small, though this stream was
never quite dry in the month of June when we saw it. A small body of water, black
as ink and thick with mud, was always flowing to the sea, steaming strongly and very
hot. It came in gushes which rushed down with a wave in front of them (see
Plate 23, fig. 2), several inches or a foot inâ€™ height, and between these the current
was very slight and, in fact, almost ceased. It was not hot water but black boiling
mud, and the stronger rushes carried with them pebbles several inches in diameter.
On one occasion, when we were returning from an ascent of the mountain, we found
one of the smaller streams, which we had crossed dryshod in the morning, so swollen
by heavy showers that it was flowing in a thick black current 2 or 3 feet deep and
several yards across. It was very hot, and we had to cut down some of the bare tree
trunks to form a temporary bridge. Not long after we had crossed, this was carried
away by the current.

This thick muddy flow constantly bears much material to the sea. The banks
of ash on each side frequently slip down, especially when the hot sand dries after rain,
and when it is undermined by the stream, and little landslides take place which
temporarily dam back the current till the pressure of water increases and sweeps
