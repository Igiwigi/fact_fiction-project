stability of the Ag(II) precursor. Indeed, all compounds of Ag(II) with O, N, C or S ligands
share the same fate (see [12] and references therein). The majority of F connections of Ag(II) are
thermodynamically stable; elimination of F2 becomes facile only for Ag(III) derivatives, such as
AgF; (at temperatures above 20°C) or AgF salts (at temperatures above +300°C and in dynamic
vacuum [30]).

Lack of thermodynamic stability of certain Ag(II) salts may be rather proponouced as
exemplified by AgSO,. This black compound decomposes thermally at temperatures above 110°C
according to the following equation:

2Ag(II)*(SO4) > Ag(1)9(S207) + 502 t- (6.3)

Nevertheless, Ag(II)SO4 is metastable at ambient (p,T) conditions and despite the fact that
the equilibrium pressure of oxygen exceeds 1TPa (sic!). However, AgSO, undergoes slow
decomposition yielding the low-pressure form of Ag(I)2(S2O7) at ultra-high vacuum conditions
[23] and yielding the high-pressure form of Ag(I)2(S2O7) at pressures exceeding 23GPa in a
diamond anvil cell [29].

7. Distortions: small but stubborn

As for all ‘localized’ d? systems, the compounds in the solid state containing Ag(II) are susceptible
to a Jahn-Teller (JT) effect. The JT effect for related Cu(II) compounds induces rather small
distortions of the first coordination sphere, and the cases are known where the difference between
the equatorial and apical Cu-ligand bond lengths does not exceed 2%. However, the JT effect
for Ag(II) compounds is quite strong as it usually leads to appreciable elongation (or, rarely,
