obtained by the rougher method is not great considering the nature of the latter, and
the order is the same.

An attempt to determine the expansion of crystals of potassium and rubidium
sulphates, by means of the weight-thermometer method, has been described by Sprine
(‘ Bull. de ’Acad. de Belgique,’ 1882, 197, and ‘ Ber. Deut. Chem. Ges.,’ 15, 1940).
Olive oil was employed as the liquid, and the density determinations were carried up
to 100°. The value obtained for the cubical expansion of potassium sulphate for 100°
was 0°0126, and for rubidium sulphate 0°0111. The latter value is extraordinarily
near the truth according to the results now presented, the value for 0° to 100° being
actually 0°01108. But the impossibility of trusting this method, equally with all the
relatively coarser density methods, to afford correct differences between the values
for different salts, is clearly demonstrated by the fact that the difference shown
between the values for the potassium and rubidium salts, namely 0°00150, is seventeen
times as great as the real difference (‘01117—0°01108 = 0°00009), which is now shown
to exist.

SuMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.

The principal results of the investigation are presented in the following summary.

1. The coefficients of cubical expansion of the orthorhombic crystals of the normal
sulphates of potassium, rubidium and cesium exhibit a progression, corresponding to
the progression of the atomic weights of the three respective metals. This is true of
both the constants @ and b in the general expression for the coefficient of cubical
