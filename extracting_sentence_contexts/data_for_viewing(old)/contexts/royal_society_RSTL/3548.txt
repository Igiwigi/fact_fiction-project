relative inclination after undergoing the operations of grinding and polishing upon
a lapidary's wheel.

To many persons such a result may appear inadmissible ; but there are several phy-
sical facts, which, when well considered, cannot fail to diminish its improbability.
If we grind and polish a surface of mother-of-pearl obliquely to the strata of which
it is compoxed, we shall find it impossible to produce a perfectly flat surface: even
if we grind it on the finest and softest hone, and polish it with the smoothest powder,
the termination of each stratum will remain ; and while the general surface reflects a
white image, the grooves or striz will give rise to the beautiful prismatic images
produced by interference*,

Another analogous fact presented itself to me many years ago in examining calca-
reous spar. Having had occasion to form an artificial face upon one of the edges of
the rhomb containing the obtuse angle, I used a coarse file without water, and found
that it exposed faces of cleavage which had never been previously seen, and which
were inclined to the general surface produced by the file.

In examining the optical figures produced by the disintegration of crystallized sur-
faces, I have found that by coarse sandstone, or the action of a rasp, or large-toothed
file, we can expose surfaces of crystallization with their natural polish differently in-
clined to the general surfaceZ.

In all these cases the faces, exposed by the mechanical action of grinding or filing,
preserve their natural surfaces and polish, and will preserve them more perfectly and
