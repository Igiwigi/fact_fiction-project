round stratum of stone entirely argillaceous, and not one-
twentieth of an inch in thickness. The lime surrounding this
stratum has been removed by three, Saxicayz, which have
bored down upon it from difterent directions. The $hell of
one of them remains in its hole, and shows that the pro-
gress of the animal was arrested by the stratum long before
its death. There is a deep groove across one valve, in which
the stratum is nearly buried ; and which has evidently been
caused, not by friction against the stratum, but by the growth
of the shell on each side of it ; this is shown in fig. 6.

If additional proof is required, it is supplied by the fact that
many naked animals of the softest texture form their habi-
tations in limestone. The boring Annelides are innumerable
in calcareous rocks, and are found to attack every marine

afford them a nidus. They may, indeed, be considered to
perform the very important office of destroying shells when
they become useless ; thus preventing accumulations which,
in a few ages, would fill every harbour. The thick oyster
