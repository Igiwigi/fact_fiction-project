The diverse
plethora of data that can be gathered from a single device mean that biologging
studies are extremely information-rich, perhaps containing thousands of data
points for each measured variable (e.g. [15-17]). However, this high per-
device information content comes at a cost. Data analysis is complicated by
the fact that resulting datasets are often time series, where successive values
of our metrics of interests are dependent on values from prior sampling
events [18] (table 1). For example, the blood pO of a diving elephant seal at
time f during a dive is entirely dependent on pO; at time f â€” 1 because of a lim-
ited store of oxygen [34]; or, trends in body temperature over time may be non-
random because of circadian rhythms [35,36]. This distinction is important
because it changes some decisions we might make about how we conduct
our analyses.
