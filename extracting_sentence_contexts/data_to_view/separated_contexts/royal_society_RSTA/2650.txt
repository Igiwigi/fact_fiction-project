CHamperst obtained an analytical expression for the variation and
its dependence on phase, which satisfactorily represents the observations, but it is
not of a simple character. His formula was

Fz (h) cos 2 (72) + fio (h) sin 2 (3 "

where hi is the hour of the solar day, P is the mean period of a lunation in solar days,
and ¢ is the age of the moon in solar days; f,.(h) and f,,(h) are the observed
variations at new moon and one-eighth phase respectively. This formula, it will be
noticed, expresses the lunar variation as, in reality, a solar diurnal variation (h, the
solar time, being the variable) which merely runs through a cycle of change depending
on the age of the moon, This, in fact, was CHAMBERS’ view—he termed the variation
“luni-solar.” It will be seen later, however, that there is a true lunar semi-diurnal
variation which remains unchanged throughout the course of a lunation, as well as
luni-solar components governed by the position of both bodies. As to CHAMBERS’
expression for the variation, while it is numerically correct, it does not aid in
interpreting the phenomenon, because it depends on two complex curves /f,,.(h) and
F..(h), for which no analytical expression was obtained; these two curves are not
independent, as will appear later.
