Tt may of course be urged, that the fibrine, when in solution, may have
impressed upon the corpuscles an adhesiveness which they retained after soaking for
hours in serum, but this seems a very unlikely hypothesis. 1 suspect, therefore, that the
peculiarities of the corpuscles of inflammatory blood are the result of other changes than

puscles of blood remoyed from the body depends on their possessing a certain degree of
mutual adhesiveness, which is much greater in the colourless globules than in the red
discs; and that, in the latter, this property, though apparently not depending upon
vitality, is capable of remarkable variations in consequence of very slight chemical
changes in the liquor sanguinis,
