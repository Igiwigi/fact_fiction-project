We might reasonably, of course,
expect compoundedness as regards both elements. Brief and inadequate as it is, this discussion is at least sufficient to indicate, I hope,
that the interpretation of the values of 9 and + arrived at in any given case or series
of cases is not a simple matter nor likely to be quite straightforward. To all the other difficulties of interpretation is to be added the fact that errors of
sampling in + and ¢ are very high. This became evident at an early stage of the work.
since mere inspection of Table III showed that alterations of f, and M well within the
limits of fluctuations of sampling would produce relatively large changes in + and ¢. The conclusion is fully confirmed by the following investigation.
