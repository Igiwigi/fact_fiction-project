For a pair of edge dislocations the results agree with those of
Leibfried (1949) and Bilby (1950) but not with the original calculations of Koehler (1941). If Koehlerâ€™s calculation is repeated in bipolar co-ordinates the result agrees with Leibfried,
Bilby and the present paper. The error appears to arise from the fact that Koehler had to split
the total energy into self-energy and interaction terms which are difficult to evaluate over
the same area. It is easy, for example, to evaluate the former over a circle and the latter over
a rectangle. When we let these two areas of integration tend to infinity the result obtained
depends on their relative size and shape.
