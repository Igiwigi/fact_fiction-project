13. We have hitherto viewed the object called by me a flat filament, only in some
of its minutest forms. These are sufficient to show that it is a compound structure.
But in order to become more particularly acquainted with this structure, it is requi-
Site to trace the filament into similar objects of larger size. For this purpose, it will
be sufficient to examine sccessively the following figures, from neryous substance,
from muscle, and from the crystalline lens : namely, figs. 117 , 116 , 115 B, 114 B,
62, 53, 92, 56, 54, 84, 131.

14. I have attempted in fig. 55. to represent what has appeared to me to be the
structure of the objects in the figures now referred to. Here (in fig. 55) we find two
spirals, running in opposite directions, and interlacing at a certain point («), in every
wind. This arrangement gives to the entire object a grooved appearance and a
flattened form. It is in fact the structure which, for want of a better term, I have
called a flat filament. The edge of this filament (figs. 114 3, 56 y, 62) presents what
at first sight seem like segments, but which in reality are the consecutive curves of a
spiral thread. A transverse section of snch an object is rudely represented by the
figure 8. This is precisely the appearance presented also by the minutest filament
or © fibre :” and I particularly refer to the oblique direction of the line separating the
apparent segments in the smaller filament (fig. 9 y), in connection with the oblique
direction of the spaces between the curves of the spiral threads in the larger one.

15, In further proof of identity in the structure of the larger and the smaller fila-
ments, it may be mentioned that I have seen filaments of minute size to enlarge, and
give origin in their interior to other filaments (fig. 131).
