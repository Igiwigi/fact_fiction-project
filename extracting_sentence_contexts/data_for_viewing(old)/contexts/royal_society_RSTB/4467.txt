It is interesting to calculate the value of «, the coefficient of thermal expansion,

from the formula
i ie wea! aT (P;—P,) (+0)
ag > ep sp ria (mass) (specific heat) (mechanical equivalent)’

On the right side of the formula we can measure everything directly except a,
while our records enable us to determine the rise of temperature. As a matter of fact,
it is necessary, in the records, to separate the reversible thermodynamic production of
heat from the irreversible “ viscous” one. We have not succeeded in doing this by
any rigidly accurate method, but a more or less approximate value can be estimated
from the records. The result comes out that @ is negative (7.e., the muscle shortens
on warming) and in size between 107° and 107%. Why the muscle has a negative
temperature coefficient it is difficult to say. Rubber appears to have the same, and of
about the same order of size. It would be of interest to repeat the observation on
jellies and on other kinds of rubber or elastic colloidal material. It is striking, how-
ever, that the value of « (lying between 10~° and 10~*), calculated for muscle from the
experiments described here, agrees in magnitude, though not in sign, with the values
given in Tables for a number of materials. For example, in metals « usually lies
between 107° and 2x 107°, gutta-percha is given the value 2x 107*, glass about 107,
