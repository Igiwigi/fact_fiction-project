Finally the large rostrum orbitale is correlated with the shape of the facies orbitalis
and ethmoidalis in this period (Plate 37, B and C).

Turning now to adults we have to consider first whether or not the general shape of the
adult human brain is influenced by the factors established for animals : cephalisation
and body size.

As far as the first point is concerned, we can immediately leave it aside.

In the first place the differences in cephalisation in human races are too slight for us to
expect them to exercise much influence on the general brain shape. This is demon-
strated by the fact that, although the Australians and Negroes,t whose relative skull
capacity is smaller than that of the European, are both dolichocephalic, of the two
races with the highest coefficient, the Eskimos and the Japanese (DuBois, 1921), the
former are very dolichocephalic (index 70-6-72-2: Ftrsr and Hansen), while the
majority of the latter are meso- and sub-brachycephalie (index 78 -3-79 Â°3 : ADACHI).

It is also striking that, whereas in the Mongols the rather small brachycephalic
Buriats have the greatest brainweight (1460 gr., BusumMakary, 1928), Frets (loc. cit.,
p- 248) in 3600 Dutchmen found that the heads with high indices had on an average
a somewhat smaller capacity than those with low indices.

There are various other factors that influence the general shape of the human skull
(and brain), mechanical ones from muscles, ligaments, and the use of the jaw, and
