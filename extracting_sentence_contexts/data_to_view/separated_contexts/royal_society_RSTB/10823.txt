For RNA the sequence space is
Euclidean but the two-dimensional phenotype space is a pre-
topological space. A set is an unbounded space where even
the concept of a neighbourhood does not apply. We tend to
apply ‘Euclidean intuitions’ [68] without inquiring into
whether the space is, in fact, Euclidean. For example, Raup’s
shell coiling model that introduced morphospaces is non-
Euclidean [69]. Moreover, apparent distances computed in
morphospaces may be misleading where constraints on vari-
ation limit the range of possible morphotypes [70].
