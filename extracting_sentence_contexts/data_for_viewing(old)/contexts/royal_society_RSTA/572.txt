and use (1, 2 and 3)

Having provided a brief overview of the four criteria, the following analysis will focus on the
extent of association between these criteria. We conducted Spearman’s rank order correlation
tests to examine the strength of the association between the ACS on each of the graph formats
and respondents’ preferences to select or not select the respective graph format for perceived
comprehension (1), use by self (2) or use for showing to others (3). The results of the tests are
summarized in table 3.

We note that there is no consistent association between ACS and the other criteria for the graph
formats within either pair. Only one of the associations of the 23 tested is statistically significant
(p = 0.04), but, as this association has been observed in isolation, it should be treated with caution
due to the potential risk of a type I error in this case. The fact that we did not find consistent
associations is interesting, given our initial hypothesis that the ACS would be associated with the
other criteria. If respondents were better judges of their actual understanding of a graph format,
we would have expected this to be at least reflected in higher correlation coefficients and more
significant associations for the relationship between assessed and perceived comprehension. It is
possible that other factors influence the association between assessed comprehension and use,
such as the type of planning decision at hand or the prior knowledge and experience of the
respective colleague(s) in question for use for showing to others. These factors may guide choice
more than just assessed comprehension, but are more difficult to capture due to varying decision
and communication contexts. We will return to this question in more detail in the discussion.
