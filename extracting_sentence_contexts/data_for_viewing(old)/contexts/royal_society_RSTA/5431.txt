In the event, under the pressure of writing the final report, and with Henry Chilver’s guidance
in mind, I did indeed come up with some good and reasonably simple ideas of transient capsize
testing (figure 12) based on what I called the Dover cliff phenomenon of basin erosion [40]. I should
add that during my research on articulated mooring towers and ship dynamics, I was greatly
aided by having a first class running mate in industry, namely Rod Rainey (quoted in §5f), whose
razor-sharp mind contributed greatly to the successful outcomes.


The concept of looking at problems not only in depth but also in generality deserves some
elaboration. The capsizing of a ship is theoretically equivalent to the escape of a particle from a
potential well, which has wide applications in physics, chemistry and engineering. So, with no
loss to the Navy, I was able to cast my work in this wider framework. In fact my most cited paper
(see §7 about citations) is on chaotic phenomena triggering the escape from a potential well [41].

(g) Importance of writing books

A book can be thought of as a solid structure built of many of our ‘brick’ modules, and indeed
a series of papers can often evolve into a book. Like the bricks themselves, this structure helps
writers to organize their material, and put it into good, preserved, order. Many researchers have
said to me that they needed to write a book, even if just to keep their own files in order. This was
definitely the feeling that I had when I wrote each of my four books.

One thing that I should mention, in a wider context, is the importance of (someone) writing
a book when there has been a great explosion or breakthrough of research in a field. This is
