(Plate 17, fig. 5) and an isoelectric line, or a line which dips as it proceeds, continued
into a downwardly directed 7 deflection. As a rule there is no true S deflection, but
this may be seen in greater or lesser degree, especially before the pericardium is
opened, If Sis prominent then 7'is upright, a relation not without importance, but
one which must be left for later and separate research.* These variations are
described because the diagrams of surface distribution shown in fig. 1 are, without
exception, from hearts showing no S deflection and an invert 7, and it may be open to
question whether or not this type represents the most habitual and natural heart-beat
in the tortoise. The instability of the tortoise heart clearly emphasises the importance

* There is a similar relation between S and 7’ in the toad’s heart, 7’ being upright whenever S is

prominent and 7' being inverted when S is absent. Evidently these facts may help us to recognise the
meaning of 7 and its inversion.

of obtaining, as an accompaniment of a series of direct surface readings, standard
curves of constant outline, for it is evident to me that any change in the form of the
standard curve is accompanied by a change in surface distribution. Observations
which bear out this statement deserve illustration, for the fact is of consequence. It

will, however, be convenient to deal with this matter more fully at a later stage.
