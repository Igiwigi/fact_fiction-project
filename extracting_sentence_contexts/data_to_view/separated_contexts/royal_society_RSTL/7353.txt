The equation 2y—a=0 indicates an asymptote parallel to
this line, and the equation of the asymptote is easily found to be 2y—ax+5=0. 278. 'The discussion of the equation would show that the curve has an ordinary cusp;
and a cusp of the second kind, or node-cusp, equivalent to a cusp and node; the curve
is therefore a unicursal curve, or the coordinates are expressible rationally in terms of a
parameter ©; we in fact have

a==(0+2(8—#+2p—4)

279. The curve may be traced from these equations (se Plate, fig 2, where the bicorn
is delineated along with a cubic curve afterwards referred to): as $ extends from an
indefinitely small positive value « through infinity to —1—s, we have the upper branch
of the curve, viz.

P=8, gives &==, y=—c, point at infinity, the tangent being horizontal.

p=o, gives z=—1, y=>+, the node-cusp, tangent parallel to axis of y.

O=—2, gives az=0, y=0, the tangent at this point being the axis of -. $=—1—=z, gives =o, y=+, point at infinity along the asymptote.
