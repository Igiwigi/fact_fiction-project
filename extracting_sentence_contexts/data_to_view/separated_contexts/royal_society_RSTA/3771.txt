that its density is equal to that of xenon at atmospheric pressure, it offers nearly
equal opposition to the passage of light, a fact which is highly suggestive, when
the ultimate nature of these gases is considered. Somewhat similar relations are found with the neighbouring series of elements if
their values are reduced to the scale of air as unity. The refractivities are far less
certain, and the results must be accepted with caution ; but the figures are ;—
