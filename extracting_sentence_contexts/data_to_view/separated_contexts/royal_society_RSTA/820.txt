What most probably reflects an increase in particle-particle repulsion
when compared with figure 3 is the RMS speed. In this case, the RMS drops rapidly, more so than
in figure 3, but then as the PMMA particles begin to come into close proximity, mutual repulsion
increases the electrostatic energy, and this is matched by a corresponding jump in the RMS
speed. In fact, the RMS speed reaches a value close to that seen at the very start of the previous
simulation. Ina final simulation of the Whitesides data [29-33], a system is examined that includes
features taken from the two previous results. Figure 5 shows the outcome of a simulation where
there are 36 PMMA and 12 Teflon particles, with the former carrying a charge q = +0.31 nC, but
the charge on the latter has been decreased to q = â€”0.31nC.
