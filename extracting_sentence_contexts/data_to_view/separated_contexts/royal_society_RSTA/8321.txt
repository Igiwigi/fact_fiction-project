Let us now examine the d, — d, separations which are given in Table IV. In the last column is printed Av/C? for d, —d,. The remarkable fact is evident that
Av/C* is constant for a given sequence, while » remains unchanged. The peculiar nature
of the d terms will be dealt with below (§6.4). It seems that for the are spectra the
3d term corresponds to a 3, orbit, but in the remaining spectra they are 4;, The

sudden change in the value of Av/C* lends strength to the idea of there being some
such discontinuity.
