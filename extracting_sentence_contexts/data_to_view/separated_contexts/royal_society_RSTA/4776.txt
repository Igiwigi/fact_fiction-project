This identification of helicity can be implemented concretely by means of Penrose’s ,
contour integral formula, which gives the zero-mass field of helicity 1 corresponding to a twistor
function of homogeneity (—n — 2)—or more properly, an element of a first cohomology group. The
chirality of twistor space means that fields of opposite helicity are represented by quite different
homogeneities, and there is no natural way of adding them, as one might wish to do to express
a real Maxwell field. Another striking fact is that the property of being of positive (or negative)
frequency can be expressed in terms of the geometry of the two halves of twistor space, without
any reference to momenta. For such fields, there is an inner product structure, which can be
realized in twistor space as a (many-dimensional) compact contour integral, without reference
to space-time coordinates. As such, it is manifestly finite and conformally invariant.
