and identify G, with a subgroup of G,,, by putting
Q) = 4y41,:921,55; (1 =1,2,...). (24:3)

IfA is a denumerable limit ordinal or if A = o, (that is the least non-denumerable ordinal),
and if G, has already been defined for all ~<A, then we take as G, the union

G@ =U, 2,6,

aca

We thus evidently define a well-ordered ascending chain of groups
GrGiGiGG.G GG. (24-4)

which can only break off when G, is no longer a free group of rank jy. This can certainly
happen only if« is a limit ordinal, as the definition immediately shows; and it must happen
at the latest for « = w,, for the chain (24-4) is properly ascending, and G,,—provided the
chain can be carried thus far—is the union of $j; denumerable groups, hence itself of order
§, and can no longer be generated by §y elements. Our first aim is to show that the chain
(24-4) can in fact be continued that far, in other words, that for every denumerable limit
ordinal A the union G.=Une, cs

is still a free group of rank Np, provided all G,, with «<A are free groups of rank Xp. G, is clearly still denumerable, being a union of denumerably m many denumerable groups. As union of a properly ascending chain, G, can certainly not be finitely generated.t It only
remains to show that G) is free.
