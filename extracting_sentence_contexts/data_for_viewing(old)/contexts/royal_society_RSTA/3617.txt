OpenFOAM® uses the finite-volume method on unstructured meshes [23,24]. OpenFOAM®
includes pre-processing and post-processing capabilities such as snappyHexMesh and ParaFoam
for meshing and visualization, respectively. We also used other open-source software that
provides pre-processing and post-processing tools for CFD such as Salome and ParaView. Salome
(v. 7.3.0) was mainly used to build the geometry of the different models, and ParaView (v. 4.1.0)
to display some of the images.

(b) Flow domain

The real flow domain is a catheter along with the lateral ventricle in which the catheter is
placed. However, our goal is just to compute the flow rate distribution and shear stress in a
neighbourhood of the VC walls, so the influence that the geometry and volume of the ventricle
might have on the results is negligible. In view of this fact, the lateral ventricle was modelled
as a cylinder (figure 1) to facilitate the task of meshing and thus improving the accuracy and
computational efficiency. The cylinder is 75mm long and its diameter is 16mm. The inner
diameter and outer diameter of the catheter are 1.5mm and 2.5mm, respectively, and the part
of the catheter inside the cylinder has a length of 60mm. The configuration and dimensions of
the VC holes are the same in all models; they are given in figure 2. In particular, the VC has eight
drainage segments, numbered 1-8 from the distal to the proximal segment, along a perforated
area whose length is 14mm. Unless otherwise stated, holes are conical and, furthermore, all the
holes belonging to the same segment have the same internal and external diameters (figures 1
and 2). For the purposes of this study, their geometric features were adjusted following the design
principles established in [14,15], to obtain an approximately uniform flow rate distribution. The
assumption that both the cylinder and the catheter are rigid and straight is a natural simplification
that implies no significant differences in the results.
