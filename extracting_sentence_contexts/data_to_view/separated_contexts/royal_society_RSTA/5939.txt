so that its expectation value vanishes. Numerical simulations in [4] indicated that the time-
asymptotic state of this model was one of complete wealth condensation [4,6,7], also referred
to as total oligarchy, in which all the wealth falls into the hands of a single agent. It is worth taking a moment to understand why wealth concentrates in this model, in spite of
the fact that both agents are subject to the same rules, and the winner is determined by a fair coin
flip. To see why this is the case, consider the wealth wy of the poorest (wealth rank R = N) agent in
the population. Since the poorest agent in the population is also the poorest in any transaction, we
have Aw = ./y At wy.
