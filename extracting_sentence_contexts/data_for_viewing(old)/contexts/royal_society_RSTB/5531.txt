portion of the hemoccel remains insignificant in size till the stage shown in fig. 4, when
the rudiments of all organs have been laid down. Median sagittal sections of embryos
of this stage commonly present the appearance of a longitudinal row of blood cells lying
in a narrow space between the yolk and the median ectoderm (fig. 18).

The fate of the median mesoderm is the same for all segments from the mandibular
to the posterior abdominal segment. In the thorax the sub-somitic mesoderm is large
(fig. 12) and as the limb buds develop, its more ventral part passes down into the hollow
of the appendage and gives rise to the intrinsic muscles of the limb. That part which
lies closely apposed to the ventral side of the somite gives rise to extrinsic muscles of
the leg and to the ventro-longitudinal muscles of the body wall (fig. 19). There has
been no attempt made to determine the precise fate of mesoderm in the limbs, beyond the
fact that muscle tissue is formed there. Two recognisable extrinsic muscles of the leg
arise over the median part of the leg rudiment. Mesoderm cells arrange themselves
in curved tracks, as seen in transverse section (fig. 19), and pass outwards from the inner
angle of the leg to the body wall immediately ventral to the somite.

The cells become prominently elongated as they arrange themselves in this manner,
and at the points of contact with the ectoderm the latter becomes much thickened,
owing to modification of its cells to provide muscle attachments. In addition to this
