The matrix of these fossils is a very fine, green silt-stone which formed a thin,

restricted lenticular band in a rock of normal coarse grey sandstone. The first
specimen (figs. 98, 99, Plate 25) was found in pieces among the debris on the floor of
the quarry known as Wayne Herbert, near Newton, S.W. Herefordshire, and it is
a remarkable fact that the caudal region was found by Mr. H. A. Toomss two months
before the rest of the specimen, and that neither fragment was collected on account
of the Pteraspis, which at the time showed merely as a black streak across the fractured
ends of the two slabs, on one of which there was a fine Cephalaspis and on the other
the remains of an Acanthodian. Although several other fragmentary remains were
obtained later, the band itself was not located for nearly a year, chiefly owing to
obscuring of the face of the quarry by vegetation after it had fallen into disuse, but
it was finally found to be a thin bed at the bottom of the quarry-face, about 2 in.
thick, and covering an area of approximately 9 ft. by 4 ft. On three sides it either
passed into the coarser, non-productive rock or just thinned out ; but how much had
already been quarried away is not known, probably not a great deal.
