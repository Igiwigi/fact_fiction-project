I am not acquainted with any exceptional instance. The testimony of crystallization,—It will sometimes happen that certain quantities
of AB and CD are mixed in an amount of water which is insufficient to keep in per-
fect solution AD, should the whole of A combine with the whole of D, although the
salt itself is a soluble one*. In such a case, if Berman's view be correct, either
no AD will form, however concentrated the solution, or, should double decomposi-
tion ensue, it will form to the fullest extent possible, and may be expected to crystal-
lize out at once with something like the rapidity with which precipitation usually
takes place, If, however, BerTroLLeT's theory be a true expression of the fact, a
certain amount of AD will always be formed, but it may remain dissolved in the liquid,
although if the whole of A had entered into combination with D it must have sepa-
rated: yet on concentration AD will make its appearance; and should this, or
anything else, determine the formation of erystals, or should they ensue on the
primary mixing, the crystallizable salt is pro tanto put out of the field of action, and
a redistribution of the acids and bases will take place with further crystallization,
until an equilibrium is obtained. Now the latter of these deductions describes what
actually does take place, but there are several cireumstances attending crystallization
from a mixture of salts which are not readily explained, and which I have as yet but
imperfectly investigated. The testimony of diffusion,—Professor Granam has shown-+ that binary compounds
vary greatly in the rates at which they diffuse through water, Let it be supposed
that AB and CD are mixed in one of his diffusion-cells, and that the compounds of
A diffuse more rapidly than those of C.
