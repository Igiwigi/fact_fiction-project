variant structure at an underlying finer level than that which is resolved by the continuum
treatment. In addition to [11], other current SMA models make use of a scalar and a second-order
tensor internal variable, e.g. [8], but these do so in a different way with respect to the present
approach, as the variability of the tensor field is strongly constrained by the scalar one. More
generally, allowing for a fully independent variability of the two fields, a treatment that was
advocated already in [11] and used in a one-dimensional setting in [20], provides a framework
that can naturally describe phase transformations and martensite reorientations (e.g. [6,21-23]).

Here, we present such a unified overall description of the microstructure within a finite strain
generalized framework of a structured continuum whose constitutive functions may depend also
on the spatial gradients of ยง and M.

A second distinguishing feature of the proposed framework is the fact that the constitutive
information is specified through a free energy and a dissipation function following the approach
proposed in [24,25]. This approach was suggested for use in the context of SMA modelling
in [26], and subsequently began to be developed in a one-dimensional setting in [20,27].

By focusing on a specific and experimentally motivated aspect of rate-independent response,
the dissipation function turns out to be completely determined by quantities that can be
interpreted as constitutive functions that describe the internal resistance encountered by the phase
transformations. In [20,27], it was shown that considerable modelling flexibility can be obtained
by the consideration of internal resistance functions depending on the actual value of the phase
