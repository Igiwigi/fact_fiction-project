Whether one can infer a similarity in the nature of the hosts from such figures is very
doubtful. This is indeed highly improbable, for it is very difficult to imagine that a
host containing a dead advanced parasite larva is of similar chemical composition to
a host containing a live parasite pupa. But such hosts have in common the fact that
they are very unsuitable for the development of the parasiteâ€™s progeny. It is clear from
the present results that any possible advantage accruing from the absence of disturbing
movements on the part of the parasite larvae is wholly counteracted by other more
repellent characters possessed by the dead larvae. It seems impossible to assess the
importance of movements of the parasite larvae by the present methods; any effect
they may have is obscured by the change in the chemical composition of the host
after death.
