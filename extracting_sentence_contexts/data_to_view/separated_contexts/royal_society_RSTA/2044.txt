The morphological axial ratios of the rubidium salt are intermediate between those
for the potassium and cesium salts. Those of the ammonium salt are close to those
of the rubidium salt, and thus partake of an intermediate character in the group. This fact is in complete harmony with the supposition of true isomorphism of the
ammonium salt with the three alkali metallic salts of the group. MONOCLINIC DOUBLE SELENATES OF THE IRON GROUP. 431

The following table institutes a complete comparison of the crystal angles of the
four salts.
