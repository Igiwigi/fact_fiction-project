TI incline, however, to the opinion of their
I being accidental stars (of which multitudes exist in the surrounding region). z But here, as in the former object, the feature which gives a peculiar interest to
£ the whole nebula, and alters entirely the light in which its physical constitution
= must be considered, has been hitherto overlooked, —I mean the faint nebulosity
51 which fills in the lateral concavities of the body, and converts them in fact
S into protuberances, s0 as to render the general outline of the whole nebula, a
S regular ellipse, haying for its shorter axis the common axis of the two bright
= masses of which the body consists, that is to say, the /onger axis of the oval

form, under which it was imperfectly seen by Mzssttr. To this axis the com-
plete figure is symmetrical, and if we are disposed to regard it as a mass in
rotation, it is about this axis that we must suppose it to revolve. In that case
its real form must be that of an ohlate spheroid; and as it does not.
