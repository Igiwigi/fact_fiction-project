The experiments with submorsitans were discontinued
at the 40th day. It is felt that the figures show clearly that the experimental
conditions were not unsuitable for either species. Facts relating to reproduction are also shown in Table IV. The birth-rates have
been standardized and are presented as puparia per 100 female-days. The figure
in the table gives the birth-rate for a five-day period (for a ten-day period after 50th
day).
