So the magnetic line of force
at b will not move parallel to itself, but being inclined a certain degree to the horizon,
when in the normal condition, will be more inclined, 7. e. will have more dip given to
it by the presence of the sun. This is the. fact made manifest by the needle when in-
dicating the position of the line as to inclination (2908.) at Hobarton, Toronto or
elsewhere, by the motion of its upper end; for it is manifest that whatever happens
on one ide of the place of the sun and magnetic equator, when, as in our supposition
(2920.), they coincide, will happen on the other. MDCCCLI, K
