As a working rule for the calculation of possible anomalies we take the Brodsworth results
for m, and m,, since the plots of Z and H against 1/r? give reasonably straight lines. The
polarizations m, and m,, will be proportional to the field components Z and H and to the
demagnetizing coefficients. That m,/m,, = 1-3 whilst Z/H — 2-5 is probably due to the fact
that the greater part of the arch is nearly vertical, the demagnetization coefficient being
therefore greater in the vertical direction. The anomalies at each underground site due to
those passages containing arches and rails, in each case a standard number per unit length,
may now be calculated. Brodsworth

The computed effects of the passages MB and HE at the base-point are Z Ily and
H —+7y.
