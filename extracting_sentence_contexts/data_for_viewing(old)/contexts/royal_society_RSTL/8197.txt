mens shoy that the longer axis of each cell becomes suddenly deflected in the horizontal
direction. That such is the case is shown, not only by their general aspect, but by the
Areversal of the direction of their transverse bars, which are now vertical, and not hori-
Azontal as before. Many of these deflected cells are perfectly muriform, but others are
more or less prosenchymatous. In the immediate neighbourhood of the cellular tract
Ithere is a considerable disturbance of the paralleligm of the small contiguous barred
=vessels, 80 that the origin of such of the latter as contribute to the formation of the
foliar bundle is not easily traced ; but, however originated, some of them accompany the
Sdeflected cells to constitute that bundle. In no case do any of the inner and larger
Zvessels of the medullary heath take any part in the formation of these bundles; and my
"Zpresent impression is that all those which do 8 should rather be regarded as belonging
to the innermost part of the woody zone than to the exterior of the medullary cylinder #,
Whichever is the fact, I am convinced that these vessels are the exact equivalents of
:2those furnishing the foliar bundles in the true Lepidodendra. These bundles were
needed, in the very earliest stage of the growth of the young shoot, to sustain the deve-
Sloping leaves; and though at this stage of its development the woody zone was obviously
Erepresented in a very feeble manner, it nevertheless fulfilled its functions in contributing
Sits quota to the foliar nutrition. But there remains to be explained the supposed absence
â€”<of true medullary rays mentioned by CorDa as characterizing his Diploxylon, but which
Swere observed by BRONGNIART in his Sigillaria elegans. None of these writers were
Saware of the existence of barred or scalariform cells in the medulle of these plants.
S Consequently when Corpa found barred tisswes running horizontally, not only in the
large lenticular spaces separating the ligneous fasciculi, but also in the smaller ones
= 8eparating individual lamine, he concluded that all these were necessarily bundles of
Abarred vessels, and in consequence denied the existence of medullary rays. Since, how-
