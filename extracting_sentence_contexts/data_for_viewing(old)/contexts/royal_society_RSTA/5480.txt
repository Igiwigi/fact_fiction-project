genomics and systems biology, to provide solutions to the ever-growing demands
for treatments?

As mentioned previously, this meeting attempted to address a wider range
of questions than is normally the case for a highly focused scientific event.
A key feature was to match potential scientific and technological solutions to the
challenges faced by humankind into wider social, economic and ethical contexts.
A recurring theme throughout was the need to ensure not only that the models
used for prediction were well-tested, but also that all of the input data were correc
and appropriate. Another general comment, echoed by many speakers, was tha
pessimism in the face of formidable change is not the way forward: what is needec
is a sustained effort by scientists, engineers and clinicians to engage the general
public, to educate and inform and, through their wider acceptance of the facts anc
findings, to develop national and international policies that can genuinely change
the way we live, benefit H. sapiens as a whole and ensure that our continuec
survival is not merely a matter of chance. In this context, it is appropriate to
remember the comments of Lord May PRS (Anniversary Address 2005) that the
important aspects of science are ‘laden with values’ while the facts of science are
‘value free’. This profound view will spur future efforts to recognize, monitor anc
model resource changes; and hopefully to adjust individual and societal behaviour
to prevent future calamity.

A number of new questions have clearly emerged from this event, held in the
delightful surroundings of Chicheley Hall. Among these were: how can the public
perception of, and trust in, global warming predictions be improved; how often
