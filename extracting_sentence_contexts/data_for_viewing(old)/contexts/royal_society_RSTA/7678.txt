the anticipated Love-wave phase; the present problem is so much more complicated that
a similar procedure could not be contemplated.

Alternatively, we may look for a new transformation of the ¢- and w-contours which will
separate out that part of the disturbance which predominates at great distances. It will be

found that such a transformation is possible and that we do, in fact, obtain as the dominant
motion a certain superposition of the free waves which may be propagated over the surface
of the elastic system. We shall first investigate these free-surface waves without reference to
the generating pulse.

MEDIUM WITH A SINGLE SURFACE LAYER

Consider the elastic system consisting of a semi-infinite medium of density p,, elastic
constants A,, /. on which lies a finite depth H of material of density p, and elastic constants
