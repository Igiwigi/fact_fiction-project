In this case, the white load cell
measurements show the greatest degree of nonlinearity in the signal (RMSEmax = 0.23) and at the
same time the greatest oscillation in the degree of nonlinearity (A = 0.108). At closer examination,
similar behaviour is observed for the red load cell. The reason is likely to be related to the fact
that both these cells are located at the bow position and are in contact with the wave before the
other cells. The results for wave height 60 mm also gravitate to a unique value of 0.195 (figure 3b). The plot shows that the results are more scattered for the wave periods lower than 2.0s, while for
wave periods greater than 2.0s the degree of nonlinearity of the records is almost the same.
