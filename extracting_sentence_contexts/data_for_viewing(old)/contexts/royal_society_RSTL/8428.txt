93. Thus, for example, the metal of the interior of a discharged cannon is exposed at
any point at once to compression radially to the bore and to two orthogonal tensions,
longitudinal and circumferential, and it is known that the resistance of the material
thus is less per unit of section than of the same exposed to tension or compression in a
single direction only.

94. Another question may arise. Tf the earth's solid shell be of very considerable
thickness (as it almost certainly is), and if we conceive a cubic unit of it at a large
