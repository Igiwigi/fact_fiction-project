In
addition, these structures were later shown to be insensitive to Reynolds number, and that they
had a similar shape and behaviour in the slug section of a transitional pipe flow as in a fully
turbulent pipe flow [32]. In related work, Hwang [33] showed that the most energetic structures in a channel flow are
the self-similar structures in the log-layer, and suggested that the size of each of these structures
is characterized by its spanwise length scale. Similarly, Hellstr√©m et al. [31] showed that the
azimuthally decomposed POD modes are in fact self-similar with respect to its azimuthal mode
number. This was identified by tracking the wall-normal peak location (yp) for the first POD mode
with respect to its azimuthal wavenumber kg. This relationship is shown in figure 3a, where the
peak location follows the self-similar behaviour yp/R = 27 C(ko R)~!, shown by the dotted line.
