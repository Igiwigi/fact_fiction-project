posed, that the, bark of a crab tree was transmuted into the
alburnum of an apple tree, or that the sinuosities of the bark
of the crab tree could have been obliterated; had such trans-
mutation taken place, There is not, however, any. thing in
the preceding cases, calculated to, prove that the newly gene-
rated bark was not .converted into alburnum _; and the elabo-
rate experiments of DUuAMEL sufficiently evince the difficulty
of producing any decisive evidence un this case ; nevertheless
I trust that I shall be able to adduce such facts as, in the ag-
gregate, will be found nearly conclusive.

Examining almost every day, during the spring.and sum-
mer, the progressive formation of alburnum in the young
shoots of- an oak. coppice, which had been felled two years
preceding, I was wholly unable to discover any thing like the
transmutation of bark-into alburnum. The commencement of
the alburnous layers in the oak (quercus robur) is distinguisghed
by a circular row of very large tubes. These tubes are of
course generated in the spring ; and during their formation, I
found the substance through which they passed to be soft and
apparently gelatinous, and much less tenacious and consistent
