The bundle conforms in type to that of the middle of the petiole (Plate 10, fig. 31),
the antenne being well developed. Slide No. K606a (U.C.L.) is of exceptional interest,
since it shows the direction of development of the xylem. Although apart from one
small area the parenchyma enclosed by the filaments has collapsed, leaving a cavity,
the outer margin in each case is fringed by lignified tracheids, among which spiral
protoxylem elements can be detected. The tracheids constituting the antennz and the
central bar, on the other hand, consist of immature, relatively thin-walled elements,
so that differentiation was evidently from without inwards (Plate 10, fig. 31), a feature
which Scorr (38) has shown to be characteristic of Botrychioxylon also.

The cortex consists of homogeneous parenchyma, the cells of which are arranged in
radial series, and a companion section (Slide No. K606s, U.C.L.) reveals the fact that
these cells are still meristematic and form small spindle-shaped groups, the ends of which

dovetail into one another (text-fig. 28). The epidermis

itself consists of small regular cells, but is remarkable for if

the development of large numbers of hairs of a most
peculiar and specialised type. Those present in the Kidston
slides (text-fig. 29) are smaller and less highly differentiated
