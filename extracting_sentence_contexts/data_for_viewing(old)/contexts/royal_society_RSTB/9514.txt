policed in its own terms. Nobody, I take it, thinks that corrupt
police officers or unethical lawyering are exclusively found in
jurisdictions with adversarial procedures. Officials’ criminality
or ethical incompetence cannot plausibly be laid at the door
of adversarialism.

Rule-breaking aside, it might be said that adversarial pro-
cedure especially encourages, and empowers, police,
prosecutors and defence lawyers to stretch the boundaries of
ethical behaviour by using information very selectively, sup-
pressing any potentially relevant information unhelpful to
their own case that they are not positively legally bound to dis-
close, and presenting their cases to fact-finders in a highly
suggestive and carefully scripted manner sometimes arguably
bordering on active deception or ‘lying by omission’. These alle-
gations are not groundless. Sophisticated comparative lawyers
have concluded that ‘inquisitorial’ systems of criminal pro-
cedure, which predominate outside Anglophone jurisdictions,
are culturally and ideologically more committed to truth-seek-
ing than adjudication organized on adversarial lines [59]. The
general worry is compounded in relation to expert evidence,
because science is expected to be the paradigm of objectivity
and factual rectitude and there are enhanced risks, relative to
lay witnesses of fact, that experts themselves might collude
with or be co-opted into adversarial partisanship.
