One answer may be that the replacement of the O. curvinotus, and gsdf* is the male-determiner in O. luzonen-
master may allow the trigger to get better. Another answer sis [40,82]. Despite sharing dmrt1bY, O. curvinotus is
may come from the fact that the master trigger is not really phylogenetically closer to O. luzonesis than to O. latipes.
a ‘master’ in the sense that it acts at the very start or ‘top’ Extensive studies on dmrt1bY from O. latipes showed that
of the gonadal development process. As already mentioned, transposable elements inserted in the promoter of this gene
the bipotential gonad expresses the complete machinery to brought cis-regulatory elements which led to expression

respond to a male or female sex-promoting signal, and the within the sex-determination window [83]. In this species,
