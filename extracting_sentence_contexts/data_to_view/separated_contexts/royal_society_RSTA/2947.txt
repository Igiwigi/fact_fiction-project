'= dd/ot, then ¢ = F (ax, a’ot) is a solution of the given equation. So we
need only concern ourselves with 0°¢/0.c* = d¢/dt, and the results will apply to bodies
of any linear dimensions and any uniform diffusivity. Let us suppose the boundary
conditions are: ¢ = 0 when « = +4 for all values of t; ¢ = 1 for all values of « when
t= 0; in fact the familiar case of a uniformly heated slab, the faces of which are
suddenly cooled. The method of this example is so simple that it can hardly be
novel. It is introduced to show how easy it sometimes is to obtain approximate
integrals by arithmetic of equations usually treated by complex analysis.
