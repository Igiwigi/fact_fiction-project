Evidently we have here a case of true hybridization, but the peculiar type of
inheritance cannot properly be compared with inheritance in other organisms until
at least a second generation is obtained from the hybrids.

We have already mentioned in Section 7 that in our hybrids the presence of
characters is never so complete asin the pure forms. In the cross 2. acutus
or E. esculentus? Xx HE. miliaris $, when the inheritance was maternal, as in the
years 1909-11, the presence of posterior epaulettes and posterior pedicellarize was
never so well marked as in the parent forms of H. aecutus and E. esculentus. In
addition, the appearance of these characters in the hybrids was to a certain extent
delayed, and their growth, after their first appearance, was slower than in the pure
species. This fact has also been noticed by Depatsteux (16). LANG (50) has
observed that in crossing snails, the rate of development of some of the characters
in the young hybrids is much slower than in the pure forms. In these experiments
Lane crossed Helix hortensis and H. nemoralis, where the parents are red and
yellow. In the F, generation he got a ratio of 3 yellow: 1 red, but as they grew
older this changed into a ratio of 3 red: 1 yellow. Moore (64) in a recent paper
has drawn attention to this fact with regard to the inheritance of skeleton characters
in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus % x S. franciscanus $. In all cases he found the
development of characters such as spinousness, length of arms, and body shape, was
much retarded in the hybrids. He suggests that, as only half the substance that
produces the characters in the pure forms is present in the hybrids, their development
will necessarily be much slower.
