First, as to the excitability and condition of the cortical
representations of the affected muscles, it was found that they had not lost their
excitability, but, if anything, were more excitable, and that in the case of the crossing
experiments, they had interchanged their position, In one the flexion centre was
found where, normally, the extension centre should have been, and extension centre
where the flexion centre should have been, and in the other experiment the same was
also indicated. This agreed with the observations of CUNNINGHAM, and was opposed
to those of Sreranr. The second point was with reference to the comparison between
the experiments and the control, as “it was found that the fact of the divided nerves
being united in their old position without any crossing, did not result in a recovery of
function any sooner than in the experiments where nerve crossing had been done” (loc. cit., p. 146) and “the course of restoration was not markedly different from that of the
cases in which the same nerves were divided and united in a crossing” (/oc. cit., p. 147).
