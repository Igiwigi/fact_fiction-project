third cysteine is required (in addition to the pair that form with mammals of retroviruses with non-covalently associated
the highly conserved intramolecular loop in the TM ecto- Env subunits [26]. Similarly, many examples of gamma-type
domain) to participate in a disulfide bond formed with SU TM sequences can be found among ERVs estimated to have

~ of Bos taurus, BoERV1, that is estimated to have integrated

into the germline of the ancestors of cattle between 58 and
126 Ma [56]; and the chimpanzee ERV, CERV1, estimated to
have integrated as long ago as 82 Myr [57].

One of the first indications that env has its own story to
tell is apparent from the fact that the TM types of severaâ€™
genera do not segregate with the RT classes [16] (figure 2).
While retroviruses that cluster with class I ERVs are associ-
ated only with the gamma-type TM, retroviruses clustering
with class II ERVs are associated with any of the three TM

Among the orthoretroviruses and related ERVS are found
three types of envelope glycoproteins (again, the env of epsilon-
viruses is excluded). Each type is distinguished by features of
secondary structure found in the TM amino acid sequence.
The three TM types that are found among class | and II retro-
viruses are here referred to as the gamma-type, the avian
gamma-type and the beta-type (figure 1). Importantly, the TM
