may in fact be solved by the methods of the first part; for y
may be considered as a constant quantity, and if in the solution
of x =wX (Probs. 9, 10, and 14, Part I.) we put arbitrary
functions of y instead of the- constant quantities which occur,
we shall have a solution of the given equation, thus a parti-
