Granville, M. D. F. R. S. F. L, S. Physician in ordinary to

H. R. H. the Duke of Clarence ; Member of the Royal College

of Physicians, and Physician- Accoucheur to the Westminster
General Dispensary. Read April 16, 1818. Dxar SiR,

Waurx1 proceeded, two years ago, to Paris for the purpose
of studying till farther, and in a more adyantageous manner,
the particular branch of the medical profession I have em-
braced, you did me the honour to request that I would com-
municate to you any fact, which might occur to me during
my stay in that capital, calculated to elucidate the pro-
cess of generation. The good fortune I enjoyed in being
admitted into the Maternite, or Great Lying-in Hospital, than
which no other similar public institution in Europe, except
perhaps that at Vienna, is better calculated to advance the
study of the obstetric art; and the frequent anatomical inves-
tigations at which I assisted, through the kindness of Mons. CHAVUSSIER, one of the most distinguished professors of the
Faculty of Medicine, have, I am willing to believe, placed it
within my power to satisfy you on the subject of your request.
