any other light ; and that I was not undeceived in the course of it, may be attributed
to the small number of specimens then placed at my disposal for the inquiry by my
late friend Professor E. ForBes, and to the circumstance that these specimens were
of the type that presents most resemblance to that of a Bryozoic polypary, and were
all deficient in the central nucleus, which is the portion most indicative of their
Foraminiferous nature. Nevertheless, the marked dissimilarity in structure which I
found to exist between the disk of Orbitolite and the polypary of Lunulite or of any
other undoubted members of the Bryozoic group, made me even then express myself
doubtfully as to its title to be associated with them. In this Memoir, published two
years previously to M. p'OrBicxry's first announcement of the fact, I showed that the
genus Marginopora must be abolished, since its sole representative is s0 closely allied
in structure to the Orbitolite of the Paris basin, that no doubt of their generic iden-
tity can be entertained; the existing M. vertebralis, in fact, being only specifically
distinguishable from the fossil O. complanata, by a difference in the form of its super-

ficial cells,â€”a character to which the more extended knowledge of this type has made
it clear to me that not the slightest value is to be attached (see Sect. IV.). I showed
that in one as in the other, the cells are normally closed-in over the whole snrface;
that the cells of the two surfaces are separated from each other by an intervening
stratum, traversed by a set of round cells or passages of its own, with which each
Superficial cell communicates by two small apertures ; and that the only real exter-
