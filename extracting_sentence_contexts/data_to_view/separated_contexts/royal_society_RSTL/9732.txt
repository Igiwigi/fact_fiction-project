The distance between the axis of the
lever and of the mass was about 2 centims., and the length of the index such as to
give a multiplication of 12. The various columns in the following records of the experiments with these instru-
ments have the same meaning as those in the last 8eb of records.

Fiery SET OF EXPERIMENTS. These experiments, which were made on the line A D, chiefly differ from the third
set in the fact that the smoked glass plates, instead of being at resb whilst the
pointers of the seismographs were indicating the back and forth motions of the ground,
were drawn along horizontally by means of clockwork. These plates were strips
of glass about, 2 feet in length, and from 3 to 6 inches in breadth, carried on a gmall
three-wheeled carriage. This carriage was attached to a strip of paper which was
pulled along by means of a Moss telegraph instrument.
