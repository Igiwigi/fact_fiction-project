unchecked-even in the present month. of- January)-we should
have in. the whole 248 fragments, an, average, of about 10 to
each planaria ; but if we allow-these creatures. to multiply. in
a double or treble degree when at liberty, and supplied with
proper food, we may. then form. a tolerable estimate of the
extent to which their reproductive powers might be carried. In concluding this; history-of the. P: cornyta, I may, remark,
that the smallest portion detached. from the. tail, s0 small in-
deed as to be scarcely perceptible, is sufficient to constitute the
active principle or germ of the. future, animal; but in. this
case these animals when perfect. are so. extremely. small, as
to lead one at the-first: glance to. believe, that the parent ani-
mals. produced their. young perfect-and in. a.living state'; that
they. were in fact vv7parous. I shall close this paper by: a, few. general: observations on
the planaria nigra, the most common. of the British planariz.
