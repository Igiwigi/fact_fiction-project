I will begin by explaining, in a few words, in what this fact consists, together with
the principal researches which I made in the commencement for the purpose of dis-
covering its laws. Having prepared a galvanoscopic frog, I laid its nerve upon one
or both the thighs of a frog prepared in the ordinary manner ; this done, on applying
the poles of a pile upon the lumbar plexuses of the frog, at the same time that the
maseles of the thighs were contracted, contractions were excited in the galyanoscopic
leg, the nerve of which reposed upon the thigh of the other frog. I discovered the
same fact, placing the nerve of the galvanoscopic frog upon a muscle of the thigh of
a rabbit, and exciting the muscle to contraction by means of a current which
traverses its nerve. I have even seen contractions of the galvanoscopic frog occur
without applying the electric current for the purpose of contracting the muscle which
ought to induce the contractions, adopting for this purpose any other stimulus to the
lumbar plexuses or to the spinal marrow. I finally tried these experiments, introducing
between the nerve of the galvanoscopic frog and the inducing muscular surface very
fine laminz of different substances.
