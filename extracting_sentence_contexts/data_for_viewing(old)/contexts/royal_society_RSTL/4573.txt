a dead weight or by impact.


678 MR. FAIRBAIRN'S EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY

And lastly. On the strength and value of wrought-iron frames and ribs as applied
to ships and other vessels*.

PART I.

At the commencement of iron ship-building, in which I took an active part, the
absence of acknowledged facts relative to the strength and varied conditions under
which the material was applied, was the principal reason which induced me to enter
upon this inquiry. I have extended the investigation into the best methods of rivet-
ing, and the proportional strength of rivets, joints, &c., as compared with the plates
and the uses for which they are intended. The latter is a practical and highly im-
portant inquiry, as great difference of opinion exists amongst engineers and others, as
to the form, strength and proportions of rivets, and the joints of which they form an
essential part. I therefore considered an experimental investigation much wanted,
not only on account of its important practical bearing, but what was probably of
equal value, in order to remove existing discrepancies and to establish a sounder
principle of construction founded upon the unerring basis of experiment. From these
considerations I bestowed increased attention upon the inquiry, and endeayoured to
render it practically nseful. Before detailing the experiments, it may be necessary
