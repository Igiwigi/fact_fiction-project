ON THE TEMPERATURE OF INSECTS,

in the same insect, but varies according to certain conditions of the insect. 'These

views were till further confirmed and extended Ã¾y obseryations on the Sphinz Hi-

gustri, S. populi, S. ocellata, Linx., and Cerura vinula, STEPH. 'The first and last of

these insects, from their large size and frequency of occurrence, afford us the means

of ascertaining all the facts connected with the temperature of larve, and are those

on which most of my subsequent observations have been made. It is at about the

fifth or sixth day after the larva of Sphinz ligustri has assumed its last 8kin, that it

evolves the greatest quantity of heat. It then feeds most voraciously, and usually
weighs about 80 grains.
