'The aurora was seen at Manchester, as has been stated ; but it does not
appear to have attracted much attention at this place. I have not been able
to trace any account of the phaenomena having been seen further south.

These are all the material observations I have collected ; from which it must
appear that the descriptions every where given evidently apply to the same
luminous arch. In proceeding from north to south we find the arch gradually
adyancing in altitude, always crossing the meridian to the $0uth of the zenith,
till we arrive about Kendal, at which place it crossed nearly in the zenith,
and when at Warrington its culminating was to the north of the zenith. It is
further remarkable, that in all the places the arch seemed to terminate nearly
in the magnetic east and west, or at two opposite points of the horizon ; these
facts indicated the great height and extension of the arch.

In order to apply the data to calculate the height of the arch, it is evident
that observations at the extremities of the magnetic meridians are to be pre-
ferred, and those on or near the same meridian, all other circumstances being
the same. Unfortunately, the Edinburgh and Hawick observations do not
harmonize together : however, those at Jedburgh, a place nearly of the same
latitude as Hawick, seem to show that both the others are wrong, or rather
perhaps, that they had not been cotemporary with each other and the rest of the
observations. 'The Hawick altitude is probably too low, and that at Edinburgh
considerably too high.

In this uncertainty we may be allowed to take the observations at White-
