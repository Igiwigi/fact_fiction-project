the octameral arrangement of the mesenteries, a hexameral disposition, in being often
twelve in number, it seems that the question of the affinities of the Rugosa may fairly
be reopened. 'The presence of well-marked calcareous septa in Cryptohelia and other
Stylasteride (which septa are equal to the tentacles in number, but nevertheless to be
regarded, like those of Heliopora, as pseudo-septa) is significant. 'The marked tetra-
meral arrangement of the septa in Rugosa, and the presence in many forms of tabule,
are certainly characters not opposed to the alliance of these corals with the Alcyona-
rians; and the fact that paired series of opercula occur in certain Rugosa, which are
compared by LINDSTROM, their discoverer, to the skeletal structures of certain Primno@,
secims to be evidence in fayour of such an alliance of the very strongest kind. In no
Madreporaria do paired hard structures, at all resembling those of Primnoe or of
Goniophyllum pyramidate, occur. The opercular structures in the coralla of Cryptohelia
and Zepidopora can scarcely be regarded as comparable with the opercula of Rugosa.
'The structures are merely folds of the lip of the calicle, and are continuous with it and
immoyable, not movable separate articulate structures. Many Rugosa show an arrange-
5 ment which may well be compared to the distinction of dorsal and ventral regions in

Alcyonaria. The most important distinctive character of the Rugosa appears to be the
occurrence in them, alone of all Anthozoa, of intracalicinal gemmation *.
