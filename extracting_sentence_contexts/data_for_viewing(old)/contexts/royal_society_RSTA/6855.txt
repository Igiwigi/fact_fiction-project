Although most of the material now presented has been in existence for some two years, we
had not intended publication until a complete solution (covering the ‘supersonic’ regime)
could be presented. Now, however, circumstances are altered in that one of us (J. R. G.)
will be leaving this country shortly for Australia; and on that account (since the new method

was developed only in the last few weeks) it has seemed desirable to record this partial
ment now, leaving the supersonic regime for discussion later. It has still to be establis
that the alternative method does in fact converge under supersonic conditions.
