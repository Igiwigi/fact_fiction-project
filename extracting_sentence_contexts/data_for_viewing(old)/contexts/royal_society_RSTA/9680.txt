accurate to at least 1 in 10,000. This has since been verified independently by
Worrr and Warers (‘ Bull. American Bureau of Standards,’ vol. 4, p. 64, 1907), who
give the value 1°43330 volts at 15° C., in terms of modern standards, for Clark cells

constructed with washed mercurous sulphate according to the specification then
adopted.

The idea that the absolute values of the mechanical equivalent deduced from the
continuous-electric method were uncertain to the extent of more than 1 in 1,000, and
had recently required correction, appears to have arisen from the fact that some of
the results were originally expressed in terms of the conventional, or legal, value,
14342 volts at 15° C., of the Clark cell, adopted twenty years ago. This value was
known at the time to be inaccurate, and was employed merely for the purpose of
comparing results with those of other observers who had also assumed the conven-
tional value.

The resistance of the standard platinum-silver coil employed in the current
measurements was probably known to 1 in 10,000 in terms of then existing standards,
but it has been suggested that some uncertainty existed with regard to the heating
effect of the current. The coil was designed with eight wires in parallel, so that its
rise of temperature in a well-stirred oil-bath when carrying 8 amperes (4 watts in
each wire), should not exceed 1° C., or 1 in 4,000 increase of resistance. The currents
