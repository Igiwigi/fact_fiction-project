after the Latin name for the city of Copenhagen where their work was done. Their first publication
was a report of X-ray wavelengths, without supporting X-ray plates [71], but shortly afterwards
thoroughly convincing X-ray spectra were published by Coster (figure 8) [72]. Chemical isolation
of hafnium followed shortly afterwards.

The naming of element 72 led to controversies fuelled by the aftermath of the Great War that
lasted for many years. Thus in an editorial for Chemical News in 1923, W.P. Wynne wrote:

We adhere to the original word celtium given to it by Urbain as a representative of the great
French nation which was loyal to us throughout the war. We do not accept the name which
was given it by the Danes who only pocketed the spoils of war. [73]

Neither Coster (Dutch) nor von Hevesy (Hungarian) was in fact Danish. Celtium continued to
appear in French textbooks during the interwar years, and the International Committee on Atomic
Weights was eventually asked to arbitrate on the matter. The Committee initially prevaricated by
suggesting that both names could be used. They eventually found in favour of hafnium, but only
after Urbain’s death in 1938 [74].

(b) Elements 43 and 75

In 1871, Mendeleev had left room for an element under manganese—eka-manganese [1].
Refinement of his table led to a second element in the same group below eka-manganese, which


was dubbed dwi-manganese. The first effort to use X-ray spectroscopy to identify element 43 was
