I. When the silent discharge is passed through pure and dry oxygen, a contraction takes
place. This contraction proceeds, at first rapidly, but afterwards more 8lowly, till it
attains a limit, which, in one of our experiments, amounted to oth of the original volume
of the gas.

II. 1f a few electrical sparks be passed through the gas in this contracted state, it
expands till it recovers about three-fourths of the contraction ; but, however long the sparks
are passed, the gas never recovers its original volume.

WH. When electrical sparks are passed through pure and dry oxygen, it contracts, but
to @ much smaller extent than when acted on by the silent discharge. The oxygen is, in
Fact, brought to the same volume as when electrical sparks are passed through the 8ame gas.
previously contracted by the silent discharge.

IV. When ozygen, contracted either by the silent discharge or by sparks, is exposed for
Â« 8hort time to the temperature of 270* C., it is restored to its original volume, and, on
opening the vessel, the ozone reactions are found to have disappeared. ;

The following experiments, taken from a large number which gave similar results,
will serve to illustrate the foregoing statements.

%. In a vessel, whose reservoir had a capacity of 5 cub. cent., sparks were passed for
ten minutes, and produced a contraction of 5'9 millims., as measured by the change of
levels of the acid in the siphon tube. By heating the vessel afterwards to 300? C., the
