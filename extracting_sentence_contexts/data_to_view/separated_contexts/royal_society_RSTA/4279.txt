Conclusion 3

Gibbsian thermodynamics [3,6,7] works consistently for finite and infinite systems, because 28
the underlying mathematical and statistical foundations, most importantly Liouville’s theorem, [Ss
merely rely on generic conservation laws that arise from the Hamiltonian structure of the IS
microscopic dynamics. Working with infinite systems is generally easier as this limit often (but
not always) forgives a certain laxness in defining entropy and thermostatistical observables,
because various different definitions may show the same asymptotic behaviour when the particle
number N is allowed to go to oo. As mentioned before, this is quite analogous to the fact that
the Newtonian limit c— oo is generally easier to handle than a full relativistic treatment at
finite speed of light c, which of course does not mean that Newtonian dynamics is more correct
than relativity. Just as relativity compels us to think more carefully about how to formulate
fundamental physical laws, the thermostatistical analysis of finite systems forces us to pay more
rigorous attention to mathematical and physical consistency criteria [8] in thermodynamics. This profound insight can be attributed to Gibbs, who wrote on page 179 of his fundamental
treatise [3]: ‘It would seem that in general averages are the most important, and that they lend
themselves better to analytical transformations.
