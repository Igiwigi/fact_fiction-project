Leptostrobus longus 495 DESCRIPTION OF PLATES 507

Leptostrobus cancer n.sp. is described from well-preserved but broken material occurring in the York-
shire Inferior Oolite (Middle Deltaic). Its fruiting appendages prove to be two-valved capsules,
each valve housing a row of small seeds, probably of inverted orientation and with apical archegonia. The new facts have led to a reinterpretation of Leptostrobus, and it is now recognized that the Green-
land Liassic fossil Microcheiris enigma is the same as Leptostrobus longus. Circumstantial evidence is adduced for referring L. cancer to Solenites vimineus (also called Czekanow-
skia murrayana) and other species of Leptostrobus to other species of Czekanowskia. Leptostrobus, as now understood, cannot be placed in any existing family, but for reasons of con-
venience no new family is at present instituted.
