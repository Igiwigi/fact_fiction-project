paired fins of Holoptychius, of Dipterus, or of Phaneropleuron, though the fin-rays and surface-scales are still
less developed in the modern than in the ancient fich, The endoskeleton of Zepidosiren, again, is as nearly as
pos8ible in the 8ame condition as that of Phaneropleuron, and is more nearly similar to the skeleton of the
Caolacanths than that of any other recent fish [quare Acipenser? A. G.]; while, perhaps, it is not stretching the
8earch for analogies too far to discover in the stiff-walled lungs of Lepidosiren a structure more nearly repre-
senting the ossified air-bladder of the Cozlacanths than any with which we are at present acquainted, among
recent or fossil fishes. Furthermore, Lepidosiren is the only fish whose teeth are comparable in form and
arrangement to those of Dipterus. Though Lepidosiren may not be included among the Crossopterygidae, uor
even in the order of Ganoidei, the relations just pointed out are not the les distinet ; and perhaps they gain in
interest when we reflect that while Polypterus, the modern representative of the rhombiferous Cros8opterygidea,
is that figh which has the most completely lung-like of all air-bladders, Zepidosiren, which has just been shown
to be, if not the modern reprosentatiye of the eycliferous Orossopterygida, yet their * next of kin,” is the only
fish which is provided with true lungs. These are unquestionable facts. I leave their bearing upon the great
problems of zoological theory to be developed by every one for himself.”


556 DR. A. GUNTHER'S DESCRIPTION OF CERATODUS.

the type of a sixth family. Ceratodus, having the fins lobate in an eminent degree,
would appear to belong to this snborder; and therefore T shall attempt to examine the
affinities of the Dipnoi to some. Crossopterygian fishes, and finally, perhaps, arrive at a
conclusion regarding the limits of this suborder.

I take first the type of the family Ctenododipterini, viz. the genus Dipterns.
