'Z A. Earty AMYLOLyYSIS.
Ys the early, rapid change the result of the action of a ferment, or is it due to

changes in the liver cells ?
The rapidity with which it occurs is entirely opposed to the idea of its being due to

the amylolytic ferment which may be extracted from the liver as from other organs,
and which, according to all observers, acts very slowly.
The fact that the mechanical destruction of the liver-cells so markedly inhibits the
process is also strongly opposed to the idea that the essential agent is a soluble
ent.
SThe connection of the process with the condition of the liver cells favours the view
{Bat the activity of the cells is the agent causing the amylolysis.
EThe influence of temperature and of fluoride of sodium, the increased amylolysis
wider chloroform, ether, and pyrogallic acid which accelerate the katabolie changes
B the liver cells, and the absence of increased amylolysis with morphin, curare, nitrite
amyl, and salicylate of soda, seem to point to intra-cellular changes being the
portant factor in this early period.
spFinally, the direct production of glucose, without intermedial bodies, marks off the
@hanges at this period from those oceurring later.
This early change in the excised liver is simply a continuation of the vital process
