the free ends. Binnie, by using a finite series of Fourier terms for 60, in effect compels
that stress component to vanish at either end: our treatment indicates that in fact it
does not vanish.

Example 4. Centrifugal stresses in a conical rotor

26. To illustrate the extended theory of §§ 6-8 (Section I) rotational stresses were
computed (by D. N. de G. A.) for the conical rotor shown in figure 14. Very little further
discussion of method is needed, since (§8) the stress function A satisfies (9) as before
and the boundary conditions (11) are altered only by an addition of specified terms to
their left-hand sides: this means that §§ 19-22 hold without substantial modification.
