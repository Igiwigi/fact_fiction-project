The large proportion of Ilford Special Rapid plates used at the eclipse was due to
the fact that experience in developing the check plates showed that these suffered less
than the others from the high temperature of the water (78° F.). Ice was generally
available for the check plates through the kindness of Sr. Gracerra ; but the supply
failed after the eclipse, and formalin was used to harden the films. This was un-
satisfactory except for the I.8.R. plates, and so plates P, S, T, W were brought home
undeveloped. The developing at Principe was done at night, and the drying was
accelerated by use of alcohol.

The use of an 8-inch stop in front of the object-glass was suggested to us by
Mr. Davipson, who showed that a great improvement of the images resulted ; it was
originally intended, however, to use the full aperture for part of totality. Early
measures of check plates made at Principe soon convinced us that the results from the
full aperture were greatly inferior, and we decided to rely entirely on the 8-inch
