'The successive performance of these numerous experiments without any considerable
error or mistake is truly difficult, and we need not be surprised if a certain divergence
appears between the actual and the theoretical result. The various experiments recorded in the three preceding sections constitute a body of
exact information as to the chemical properties of ozone, through which it may be
hoped that this important question will be finally removed from the domain of arbitrary
speculation and brought within the precincts of science. It only remains to consider
the bearing which these facts have upon the theory of the subject. We may first remark that in the total system of experiments no evidence whatever is
afforded of the existence in the electrized gas of any other © simple weight” than the
*8imple weight” * 5, and the hypothesis of AxprEws and Tarr as to the decomposition
of oxygen by the electric discharge has no support in facts. TI shall therefore assume
the unit of 0zone to be constituted of 80me number of these © simple weights;” and as a
