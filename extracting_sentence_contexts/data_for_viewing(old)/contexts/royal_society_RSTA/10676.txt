parallel planes, which is one of those treated of in the present paper. His solution
is expressed in a series, not of circular functions, but of hyperbolic sines and cosines
of nz, the successive values of n being obtained as roots of a certain transcendental
equation. This enables him to satisfy the conditions at the curved surface, but the
arbitrary coefficients are finally determined by the conditions over the plane ends.
He assumes both the radial shear and the molecular rotation in a diametral plane
to be given by known functions, f(7) and F(7), over the plane ends, and from these
he succeeds in obtaining the coefficients. As he has only a single set of the latter
left to carry out the identification, his functions (7) and F(7) are not really inde-
pendent. Theoretically only the shear f(7) should be required, and in a practical
problem even this is unknown, the total pressure being all that is given. The actual
distribution of this pressure does not appear to enter into Professor Scuirrâ€™s solution,
Also the fact that the values of 7 are roots of a transcendental equation singularly
complicates the solution from a numerical point of view, and Professor ScHIFF appears
to have made no attempt to translate his results into numbers. |*

It has therefore appeared worth while to apply the solutions involving circular
functions of z to problems such as those sketched above.

Of each of these I have given a concrete numerical example. Indeed, the greater
part of the work has been spent on these numerical examples. The labour of calcu-
lation has in most cases been considerable, owing to the slow convergence of many of
the series involved, which has necessitated special methods of approximation.

* Since writing the above, I find that the problem of the cireular cylinder under a symmetrical strain
