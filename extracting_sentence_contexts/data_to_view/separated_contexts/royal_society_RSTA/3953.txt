In general, they can be stored and transported at room temperature, while the ris mea)
of matrix and analyte degradation is low. Because of the high stability, post-mortem specimens :
can be collected and analysed [53]. One of the problems related to hair analysis is the fact that a]
dying, bleaching or exposure to heat or sunlight may affect the results [54,55]. Owing to these DNS
factors, analytes can decompose, while other chemicals (including drugs of abuse) may adsorb iG
on the hair surface leading to erroneous results [56]. There are also concerns about the rates of 18
analyte incorporation into hair matrix.
