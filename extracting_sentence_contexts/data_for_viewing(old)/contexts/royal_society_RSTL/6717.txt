External Gemmulation.

In Tethea Lyncurium we have gemmules produced externally, which are perhaps much
more entitled to that designation than any of the reproductive organs previously
described. The fasciculi near the base of the Tethea are protruded considerably beyond
the surface of the animal, and at the termination of each there appears a small mass of
sarcode, which assumes a more or less globular form. If their bodies be immersed in
Canada balsam and examined microscopically, they will be found to contain not only the
spicula projected from the parent, but a second series, which have been secreted in the
mass, and which have assumed the mode of disposition 80 characteristic of the skeleton of
the parent Tethea, I am indebted to my friend Mr. T. H. Stewart for this interesting
fact, and for the specimens illustrating it. 'They were found in Plymouth Sound.

Fig. 19, Plate XXXIV. represents one of these gemmules with a portion of the
skeleton fasciculus on which it is produced, under a linear power of 50.

Propagation by Sarcodous Division.

"The fact of the resolution of the sarcode of the interstitial tissnes of Spongilla into
small masses of unequal size and variable form has long been known to naturalists, and
that when separated from the parent body each becomes capable of locomotion, and of
ultimately becoming developed into a perfect sponge. CaRTER, in his valuable paper
published in the Journal of the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, No. 12,
1849, has given a minute account of their structure and motions when separated from
