Mr. Hontoway in the ‘ Philosophical Transactions’ for 1723 on the beds of fuller’s
earth in Bedfordshire. This describes the pits by Woburn, which have been worked
intermittently ever since, and it is from these pits that the present specimens appear
to have originated,

Woopwarp (1887, p. 378) gives references to the earlier notes on the Woburn
beds, and remarks on the fossils of Leighton Buzzard, Woburn, and Potton Lower
Greensand, many of which are derived from older horizons.

The actual age of the beds, however, is determined by the fact that they are
clearly overlain by the Gault, and also by the presence of indigenous fossils such
as Waldheimia woodwardi, Terebratula depressa, Opis neocomiensis, Trigonia
aleformis, and others in situ.

Lamptuen and Waker (1903), in an important paper on the neighbourhood,
established the fact that, in undoubted Lower Greensand which was overlain by
Gault, was a fossiliferous band containing a fauna with distinctly Upper Cretaceous
affinities. From the present point of view, it is of interest to note this in connection
with the flora, which also suggests a more modern aspect than that of the preceding
beds. It is also germain to the subject to note Lampiucn’s and WaLKEr’s remark,
p. 264, in their summary, where they say: “ The lithological characters of the bed
indicate a sea-bottom of moderate depth, swept by powerful currents; and the
