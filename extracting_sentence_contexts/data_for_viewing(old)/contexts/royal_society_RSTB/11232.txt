is low (mp < 0.25), (1) alternative stable state regime II tends to
be avoided fora larger range of mg (figures 3 and 5b); (2) the PE
is exaggerated, meaning that the metapopulation has dam-
pened variance relative to its constituent populations (figure


4a); and (3) the time required for the population(s) to recover
following an induced disturbance is lower (figure 4b). Interest-
ingly, the largest PEs are observed when straying is just large
enough to enter regime II, where one population assumes a
subordinate state, and the differences between the subordinate
and dominant population densities are largest. This does not
appear, in fact, to be a robust condition because the system
relies to a large extent on the dominant population as the
source, whereas the subordinate population assumes the role
of a sink. However, recovery time was measured with respect
to the aggregate biomass of the metapopulation (N7 = N; +
Nj), and despite the source-sink dynamics that emerge in
regime II, the aggregate biomass of the system recovers more
quickly in this region following the near-collapse of both popu-
lations (figure 4b). From this perspective, the existence of
asymmetric dominant/subordinate alternative stable states
could be considered to be more robust with respect to the
recovery time of the total biomass, or less robust because one
population is always at greater risk of stochastic extinction.
