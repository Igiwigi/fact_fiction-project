to be 0-04 to 0:05 Daxter, In 4 the question of the seat of the electromotive
forces on which this and the other observed differences are dependent is discnssed.
From preliminary considerations he concludes that inasmuch as it, is out of the
question ©* das Blatt zu zerstiickeln” s0 as to investigate the electromotive properties
of its parts separately, the only way is to start from the well grounded assumption
that wherever the same organisation exists there will be similar arrangement of
electromotive forces, and accordingly that in the individual cell the electromotive force
will show a distribution which has a definite relation to its long axis. Hence, inasmuch
as the form of the cell admits of but few poxsibilities, we may, by ascertaining which
of these possibilities when taken in relation with the known arrangement of the
cells in the leaf, affords the best explanation of what is actually observed in the dis-
tribution of electrical tension on the surface of the leaf, elect that which accords best
with fact. In order to get at this result Professor MuUNK employs a method of investi-
gation which I shall not endeavour to describe in detail, bub content myself with
stating that it is founded on the assumption that it is possible to represent the living
cell, as regards its electromotive properties, by a zinc cylinder having a zone of copper
and 8urrounded by a uniform layer of a moist conductor ;t and that a schema or model
made up of a number of snch cylinders arranged like the cells of any living part of a
plant would exhibit electromotive properties similar to those of the organ it represented.
Stated as shortly as possible, the actual arrangement of the parenchyma. cells of the
leaf of Dionzea is as follows : in the lobes the cells run all in one direction, namely,
parallel to the veining and at right angles to the midrib. Tn the midrib the cells of
the ridge (under surface) run longitudinally, but those of the trough (upper zurface)
are continuous with those of the cells of the lobe. For reasons which need not be
here entered on (see p. 86) Professor MUNKk considers that the arrangement which
