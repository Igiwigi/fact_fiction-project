parative (as in ‘the house is nearer the river than the road’).
In vector grammars, such cases can be dealt with by assign-
ing ‘near’ a vector in between the cluster of prepositions
and the cluster of adjectives.

In computational linguistics, vector grammars (which
have a close relation to neural networks models of linguistic
structure from the 1990s [150,151]) are experiencing a new
wave of excitement following some successes with learning
such grammars from data for practical natural language pro-
cessing tasks [152-155]. These successes are due not only to
the ability to represent gradedness but also (and perhaps
more so) to the fact that models with continuous values
allow gradual learning procedures (in these papers, the pro-
cedure is ‘backpropagation through structure’ [156]).

While vector grammars have, to the best of our knowledge,
not been applied yet to music and animal vocalizations, we
expect that they offer much potential in these fields. Efforts to
apply symbolic grammars in these domains often encounter
difficulties with dealing with phenomena that seem funda-
mentally continuous in nature, such as loudness and pitch
variation, beat, etc. Musical examples would exhibit micro-
differences in pitch corresponding with syntactic function
(e.g. raised leading notes), complex note features (such as
