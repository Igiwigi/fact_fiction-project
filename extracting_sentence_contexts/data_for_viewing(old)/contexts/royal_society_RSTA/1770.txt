elevated edges. The very good agreement between experiments and simulations demonstrates
that the multiphysics-multiphase FEM simulation which incorporates the real intrinsic thermo-
elasto-mechanical properties of the ablator and the substrate as well as the proper EOS to treat
phase transitions can lead to high prediction capabilities for the early time heating dynamics of
the ablator. An interesting observation resulting from the FEM simulation is that the observed
displacements on the ablator’s surface are of Rayleigh waves type [47] and can be transferred
from the ablator into the substrate since such displacements include both longitudinal and
transverse motions which decrease exponentially in amplitude within the substrate. However,
this behaviour inside the substrate cannot be monitored experimentally. It is also important to
mention here the very good agreement between simulations and experiments and for the crater
formation spatio-temporal dynamics within the plasma ablation phase as well as for the predicted
ablation depth, which occurs at times well after the laser—ablator interaction time. Besides the
fact that this agreement is among others an additional experimental result which allows for the
confirmation of the multiphysics FEM model’s capabilities, it may be of excessive importance for
the early time laser pulse imprint ‘footstep’ spatio-temporal dynamics prediction in ICF-related
experiments.

Figure 3 shows a time sequence of simulation images from the TEP to the plasma ablation
phase of the ablator’s displacements generated by its interaction with the laser pulses. The
perturbation transfer from the ablator to the substrate is demonstrated to happen from the very
first moments of the interaction within the TEP phase. Further investigations are in progress to
