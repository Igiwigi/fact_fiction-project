shows that it may take a large number of periods (here, approx. 30) before the growth rate of a
material line converges to the topological entropy of the flow.


Another feature of interest in figure 10 is the non-monotonic growth of material lines. As
shown in the inset of figure 10, during the four legs of the protocol the growth rate is much
greater at the end than at the start, and the length of the line may even first decrease when a
cylinder starts moving. This is due to the reversal of the rotation sense, which makes a cylinder
unwind the filaments it has stretched while rotating in the opposite sense, if the rotation of the
other cylinder has not moved the filaments enough. This happens, for example, for fluid particles
located on right of the domain when the inner cylinder starts moving. Note that the unwinding
is less pronounced for greater values of 61, because each cylinder can perturb all fluid particles
more before the other cylinder reverses its rotation. In fact, the global stretching factor of a line is
not affected much by such unmixing / unwinding phases, because the growth rate is controlled by
the parts of the line that wind efficiently on the figure-eight braid. Nevertheless, the temporary
decrease of the length indicates that the protocol is inefficient for stretching a fraction of fluid
particles.

7. Measuring the quality of mixing from stretching factors

The topological entropy of the different flows, that is the asymptotic exponential growth rate of 13
material lines that we have studied above (figure 10), may be considered as a measure of the ao
mixing efficiency of the flow: the longer the interfaces, the more efficient is molecular diffusion, 78
hence mixing. Nevertheless, the topological entropy is a mean quantity, which does not account : 4
for the inhomogeneities of stretching. In this section, we examine the efficiency of our different :
