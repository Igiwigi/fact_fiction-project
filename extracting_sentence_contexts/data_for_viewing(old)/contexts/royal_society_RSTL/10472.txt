had already been formed in considerable numbers, it was clear that the development
proceeded in a basipetal direction. This could be proved as follows, on the as8ump-
tion that leaves formed subsequently to thoss already developed would form approuxi=
mately as many pinnz as they. The foliage-leaf of this plant of Dioon formed about
50 pinne> on each side. In one young leaf, which showed no sign of apical growth,
there were about 25 pinnz on each side, while those nearer the base were 8nccessively
smaller than those above, till their identity was gradually lost in the s8mooth ridge ;
a considerable space, however, intervened between the lowest traces of the undulation
and the sheathing wings. These facts being 80, and the next older leaf having a
larger nnwber of pinnz, while the next younger one had fewer, the conclusion may
bo safely drawn that there is Â« formation of pinne in basipetal order of $uccession.
SBut this does not exclude the possibility of a simultaneous development in an acro-
petal 8UCccession, ab least among the earliest formed pinne, and the observation of
ES anges leaves, in which the formation of pinne is jusb beginning, gives good evidence
Sthat there is also an acropetal 8uecession, which is, however, s00n arrested. Thus on
Zthe youngest leaf of the plant in question, which bore any traces of pinne, it was
Slistinctly seen that those at the extreme apex of the leaf were smaller than those
Slightly lower, while those lower still were again smaller (Plate 89, fig. 32). This
Sppearance not being supported by obseryations of more than a single specimen, is
Seapable of two interpretations: (1) There may be, and I think that there almost
Jertainly is, a weak acropetal 8nccession, only a few pinnz being formed subsequently
