numerous straight lines of transverse cell-walls to traverse the section horizontally from
within outwards, as shown in Plate XLIIL. fig. 17, 7. There is no doubt that the walls of
the more tubular of these elongated cells are thickened by internal depositions of lignine,
and that they thus assume the character of bast-tissnes. I have already described thin-
walled cells arranged in regular rows which, in outward form, closely resemble those of
Plate XLIIT. fig. 17, but occurring in the primary and secondary medullary rays of
Calamites. The tissue is a very peculiar one. I have not succeeded in discovering any
structure absolutely identical with it elsewhere than amongst these Carboniferous plants.
T have already referred, both in my preceding memoir (Part IL.) and in the present, one,
to the fact that transverse sections of this prosenchymatous layer of the bark exhibit the

& cells arranged in regular radiating lines proceeding from within outward, as in the wood
8 of the Conifere. On seeing such sections, it is difficult to resist the impression that we

= being composed of ordinary parenchyma. The same remark applies to the structure
S of the persistent petioles, except that in transverse sections of the latter we find the
Z position of the central vascular bundle very distinctly marked, as in the scars of the
& ordinary Lepidodendrya. Tt will be remembered that this was not the case with the
= leaflets of the smallest twigs. Plate XLIII. fig. 18 represents part of a tangential section
ie of a cluster of these petioles made close to the subepidermal layer of bark. In their
