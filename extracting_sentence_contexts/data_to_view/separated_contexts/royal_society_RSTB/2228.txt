© The longest periods through which I have maintained individual experiment have
E ~, been six months and five months respectively. Not a little surprising is it to find
S = that the movement which, on account of its being the most easily evoked and the
one evoked alone when depression of reflex activity is great, may be called the
‘2 primary spinal reflex of the limb, is the very movement which has been often urged
3 to be par excellence the most eminently cortical one, namely flexion adduction of
hallux. I have previously drawn attention to this significant fact.t Similarly in
3 the fore limb, flexion-adduction of thumb, though often instanced as an action
-g of peculiarly cortical nature, is really the most frequent and facile pure spinal
& reflex of the upper extremity. Its large and predominant representation in the
‘ cortex is concomitant with, rather than in contrast against, a large and predominant
= representation in the spinal cord. So also in the wry-neck reflex obtainable from
& Vth cranial nerve, and especially from IInd and IIIrd cervical roots, the movement,
& a turning of the chin and neck (with some lateral rotation of the head) away from
3 the side of excitation, we have another example of a movement preponderantly
E represented in wide regions of the cortex (Ferrier, from frontal cortex ; ScHArER,
E from occipital cortex), also preponderantly represented in an extensive set of
© bulbospinal reflex mechanisms.
