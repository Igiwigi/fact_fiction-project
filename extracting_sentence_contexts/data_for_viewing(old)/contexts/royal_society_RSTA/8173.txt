movement about the lower part of the disc as can be seen in fig. 12, Plate 22, the circula-
tion at the top of the neighbouring ridges and the forces between the individual particles
all playing their part. The top of the discs is, however, perfectly clear cut, as can be
seen in the same figure.

The waviness of the ridges when there is much dust in the tube is a consequence of
the general circulation. When there is plenty of dust, the ridges towards the antinode
are large, being, say, in the case of a tube 3-5 cm. in diameter, nearly a centimetre high
at the middle. Now the surface of the reversal of velocity is, as shown in Section 4 of the
paper on “ Circulations,” about 0-58 cm. from the wall of a tube of this diameter, so that
the ridges extend upwards, at their mid-point, into the region of reversal of velocity of
the general circulation. The wavy and unstable appearance is due to the fact that the
middle part of the top of the ridge is tending to be carried by the general circulation in a
direction opposite to that in which the general circulation urges the shallow extremities
of the ridges. While the locking action of the vortex motion prevents actual transport
of the ridges, there is a continual wavy motion of the upper part of the ridge, due to
the conflict between the spacing influence and the two opposite directions of the general
circulation. The same reversal of the velocity of the general circulation at a certain
distance from the walls of the tube leads to the curvature of the ridges seen, ¢.g., in
fig. 30, Plate 24, and to minor phenomena of this nature which need not be further
described.

In connection with the initial stages of the motion of a particle from rest on the
floor of the tube a paper by Haroup Jurrreys* is of interest. He discusses the action
