in Cenine it is probably for the avoidance of silt, as in Asellus, whereas in Ephemerel-
line it is produced in clear waters to save the gills from mechanical injury. Such a
covering is developed in widely separated Ephemerid nymphs (NeepHAM and Murpuy,
1924), living in diverse environmental conditions, but with the sole purpose of saving the
gills from injury of any kind. Such a convergent evolution has often baffled the
taxonomist, and there is no doubt that the true relationships of the Ephemerellinse
and Ceenine will become clear only when the mode of life of these animals is better
understood.

Prosopistomide.

The most remarkable nymphs are those of the genus Prosopistoma, which appear at
first sight to be small Apus-like Crustaceans, and, in fact, were referred by their
discoverer to the Branchiopoda. Through the kindness of Mr. L. Beranp, of Museum


AND EVOLUTION OF THE TORRENTIAL FAUNA. 195

National dâ€™Histoire Naturelle, Paris, I have been fortunate to examine a few specimens
of these curious animals. With the exception of the tail region, the head and body are
broadly oval in appearance and are greatly depressed. The dorsal surface is convex
and the ventral is somewhat concave. The slender legs terminate in powerful claws
and are concealed underneath the body. The organism is thus admirably adapted
to present a stream-line form to the current (compare its form and position of legs with
Psephenid larvee, p. 204). Forming the margin of the body there is a strong and narrow
