by barium, calcium, strontium, yttrium, and erbium. Tt is unaffected, or slightly
diminished, by beryllium, didymium, and lanthanum (se figs. 17, 20, 22). Tb is obvious
that the action of the rarer metals beryllium, erbjum, didymium, lanthanum, and
yttrium is but feeble in any direction when compared with the effect of calcium, &e.

The contracture is increased by barium, calcium, strontium, yttrium, and beryllium.


PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION, AND ANTAGONISM. 225

Contracture produced by barium is enormous (Plate 9, fig. 24, a-g). When the drug is
locally applied its curve resembles greatly that produced by veratria (Plate 9, fig. 24, b).
Tt appears to us to be an interesting fact that an inorganic element and an organic
alkaloid should have such a similar action. Their action coincides also in the modifica-
tions which it undergoes by heat and by potash. The barium contracture, like that
caused by veratria, is abolighed by cooling the muscle down, or by heating it con-
giderably above the normal. The contracture may be permanently removed by
cooling down, 80 that ib does not return when the muscle is again raised to the
normal temperature. Like the veratria contracture, however, it is abolisghed much
_more certainly by heat (Plate 9, 6g. 24). There is a more marked tendeney for
Sthe barium contracture to relax snddenly than that caused by veratria. It is also
Zr easily abolished by repeated stimulation.

In regard to the effect of these drugs on contracture, the same differences are to be
Sdtzerved between their action when injected into the circulation and when locally
