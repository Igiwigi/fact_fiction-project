Grovs* and DantsLL4 employed with
success the points of different metals, and arrived at interesting results : I also
published some experiments I made on the voltaic arc} in 1841. Subsequently
MM. Frzeav and Fovcavrr observed some remarkable facts of the same kind on the
occasion of an investigation into the intensity of the light emitted by charcoal in the
experiment of Dayyh. The researches made up to the present time, have already led
to many results, of which I shall consider only the most important.

1. That the voltaic arc may be produced, a pile of greater tension is required than
that which is necessary for the ordinary calorific and electro-chemical phenomena.
