I traced
the sensitive nerves into the substance of the muscles : I found
that the fifth pair was distributed more profusely to the
muscles than to the skin; and that estimating all the nerves
given to the:muscles, the greater proportion belonged to the
fifth or sensitive nerve, and the smaller proportion to the
seventh or motor nerve. On referring to the best authorities,
as MecktL,* and my excellent preceptor MoxRo, the extre-
mities of the fifth were described by them as going into the
muscles, 0. that of this fact there cannot be a doubt. Having in a former Paper demonstrated that the portio
dura of the seventh nerve was the motor of the face, and that
it run distinct from the sensitive nerve, the fifth, and observing
that they joined at their extremities, or plunged together into
the muscles, I was nevertheless unwilling to draw a con-
clusion from a single instance ; and therefore cast about for
other examples of the distribution of the muscular nerves. It
was easy to find motor nerves in combination with sensitive
nerves, for all the spinal nerves are thus composed; but we
wanted a muscular nerve clear in its course, to see what
alliance: it would form in its ultimate distribution in the
muscle.
