Parallel-aligned (PAL) liquid-
crystal panels allow for pure phase-only modulation, i.e. without changing the polarization of the
incoming linearly polarized light. The phase masks can typically be refreshed at a 60 Hz rate; only
ferro-electric SLMs typically allow for switching at kHz rates, but only between two phase values. A first important difference from the idealistic set-up arises from the fact that SLMs are
typically not transmissive but reflective, which leads to back-folded optical set-ups. Moreover,
the Fourier filtering is mostly not carried out ‘on axis’, as depicted in figure 8, but one modifies
the set-up to an ‘off-axis’ configuration [28,36], where—in order to get a cleaner image—one adds
a blazed grating, i.e. a sawtooth phase structure where the phase rises linearly from 0 to 27 within
one grating period, which has the property to (ideally) diffract an incoming plane wave into only
one direction. When using an SLM, the blazed grating can be implemented by simply superposing
the sawtooth phase pattern to the phase mask used for Fourier filtering modulo 27.
