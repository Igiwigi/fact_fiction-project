Since both are constructional it seems probable that chromo-
some structure after pachytene must in some way be different from chromosome
structure at mitosis. The words ‘‘after pachytene” are used intentionally rather than
“after pairing”’, for these geometrical considerations of the spiral apply to all chromo-
somes at the first meiotic division, whether paired or unpaired (e.g. as in figs. 68,
73 from the triploid). The physical basis of this difference cannot at the moment be
fully specified, but one fact regarding it will be described on p. 199. THE EARLY MEIOTIC PROPHASES

The way is now clear for examination of the early meiotic prophases. The general
appearances of these are shown in figs. 10 e¢ seq., Plate 16, and the details in figs. 29-45,
Plate 17.
