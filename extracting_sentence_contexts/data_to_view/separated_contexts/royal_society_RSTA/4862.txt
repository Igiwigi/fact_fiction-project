A natural question is the extent to which we can infer from such information
the vanishing, or non-vanishing, of various cohomology groups. Here are some results along
this line. Let us begin with the fact that Mj 1 (F,) = 1. By the Lefschetz Trace Formula, this is equivalent to

2n
S\(-1)'Trace(Frobr, AR F@F*’))=q".
i=0

Already the trace on the H2" is q”. This suggests that Hi(A! , F @ F”) vanishes for i # 2n.
