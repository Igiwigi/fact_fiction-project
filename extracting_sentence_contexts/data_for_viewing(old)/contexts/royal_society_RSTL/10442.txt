to that of the higher Metazoa, The general occurrence of this structure—which,
80 far as the evidence at command shows, is homologous throughout all the groups
in which it is found—is a very striking fact which probably has an important
phylogenetic significance. Tts universal occurrence among the Anthozoa and complete
absence from the Hydrozoa is a strong argument in favour of the more primitive
nature of the latter group. From the fact that the Anthozoa are the most primitive
group in which the stomodzenum appears, it might be concluded that this group
represents the stock from which the higher Metazoa have descended. Tt seems,
however, much more probable that the line of descent has been through some primitive
Turbellarian form which, in common with the polyps, derived the stomodzum from a
still earlier group. What this origin of the stomodzum was is still an unsolved
problem. The hypothesis that the stomodzeum is to be regarded as the introverted
manubrinm of a Hydrozoan, though a plausible one, has no embryological facts in its
favour, and can hardly be accepted without additional evidence,

$ 9. Development of the 8epta.

The septa make their appearance at about the same time with the s2omodeum, and
are well developed within a few hours. As we shall see below, the eight radial septa
of the anterior part of the body, which are characteristie of all Aleyonaria, differ
entirely in structure and mode of origin from the peduncular septum, a strueture
which is found in the Pennatulacea alone. Hence it will be convenient to deseribe
separately the development of the two forms of septa.
