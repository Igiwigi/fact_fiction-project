Next, we observe that (eo,J~teo) =0, where (-,-) denotes the inner product in
D°({0, 1]). This implies that e9 € (ker(£*))+ = im (L), and thus there exists e; € D'({0,1]) such that
eo = Lei, so that the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue 4 =0 for L is at least two. In fact,
differentiating (3.2) in c, we obtain cL(d-Xtw) = 7 Xtw, SO

e1 =COcXtw (3.8)

satisfies Le; =eg and thus represents a generalized eigenvector of £ associated with the zero
eigenvalue. As we have seen, the spectrum of £ always contains at least a double eigenvalue at zero. Following a similar argument, one finds that the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue 4 = 0 is
higher than two if and only if there exists e2 € D!({0,1]) such that Ley =e), which is equivalent to

(e1,J~‘e0) =0. (3.9)

We will now prove that this can only happen when the derivative of the c-dependent conserved
