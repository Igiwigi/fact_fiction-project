at different wavelengths, the ratios between the magnitudes of EDs and MDs vary, leading
to scattering suppression at different angles [47,49]. For a square lattice of such spheres, this
would result in the wavelength-dependent Brewster angles, as verified in figure 4f. Moreover, the
wavelength-dependent Brewster angle can be also observed for s-polarized incident waves [49],
which is unaccessible at conventional interfaces where there is only dominant ED excitation. Here,
we discuss only the scattering suppression at different angles based on interferences between ED
and MD, which can certainly be extended to higher order multipoles.

5. Electric and toroidal multipoles

Though dynamic toroidal multipoles play an essential role in the expansions for arbitrary
charge-current distributions [15,17], they had not attracted much attention until the recent
demonstration of TDs in engineered metamaterials [19]. This is largely due to the fact that in
the far field toroidal multipoles are identical to their electric multipolar counterparts [17]. At
the same time, conventional multipole expansions are usually conducted for charge-current
distributions that are far smaller than the effective wavelength, where the contributions of toroidal
multipoles are negligible [15,18]. Though the isolated excitation of dynamic toroidal multipoles
would require careful structure engineering to match the special corresponding near-field current
distributions [17,19], it is also shown recently that even simple homogeneous dielectric particles
can support TDs [18,6163], though they are co-excited with the electric and magnetic multipoles.
