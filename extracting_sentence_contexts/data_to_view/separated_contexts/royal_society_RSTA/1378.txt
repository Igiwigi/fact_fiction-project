Generators of Q of one system correspond to trisecant planes of ¢, which pass through P.
Such generators are projections of @-planes of 2 which pass through P’. Each of the
corresponding trisecant planes contains four base points of ®, and conics through these

* A general @’-surface can, in fact, be represented on the plane @ by cubic curves through A,, ..., As
and we can take c, to be represented by a quartic curve with double points at A,, Ao, A, and passing through
A,and A,. The points A,, Ay and A, and the line A,A, will then represent lines of the ’-surface which
are chords of ¢,.
