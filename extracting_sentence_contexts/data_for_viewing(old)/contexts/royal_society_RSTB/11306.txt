1. Introduction

Understanding how human populations acquire, and use, social information is
one of the central challenges of cultural evolution and the focus of a highly
active, interdisciplinary debate [1]. Social learning, or cultural transmission, is
defined as learning that is facilitated by observations of, or interactions with,
another individual or their cultural products [2,3]. It supports the spread of
adaptive information, accumulated over generations [4—6], yet also bears the
risk of transmitting outdated, misleading or inappropriate information,
especially in changing environmental conditions [7]. But there is no unique
way in which social information can be acquired; in fact, a large number of
social learning processes have been identified in the literature (e.g. [5,6,8]).
Research aimed at identifying learning processes in human populations can
be roughly divided into two groups: experimental laboratory-based and theor-
etical modelling-based approaches. Laboratory-based experiments, in particular
‘microsocieties’ (e.g. [9-12]) and diffusion chain experiments (e.g. [13-16]),
have focused on uncovering the variety and subtlety of human social learning
strategies, providing a powerful framework for studying cultural evolution
empirically (see [1,17] for comprehensive review).

In the following, we focus on theoretical modelling-based approaches. These
evolutionary models of learning have mainly focused on understanding which
individual and social learning strategies are expected to have to evolved in
