Cornwall, with investigations of the methods best adapted for imparting great
angular velocities. By Davies GiLBeRT, Esq. President.

IN the year 1827, some obseryations I had made on steam engines were ho-
noured by a place in the Philosophical Transactions. I am therefore induced
to lay before the Society further particulars illustrative of the progress by which
that most important machine has reached its actual high state of improve-
ment. On a subject of less magnitude I should not have presented to the
Society a mere collection of matter in detail, unconnected by any general ar-
rangement of the facts: but eyery thing appears to me of great interest that
bears on the history of an invention that has continually adyanced towards
perfection by the aid of chemical, mechanical, and mathematical sciences ; an
invention that has already altered and improved the condition of mankind ;
and seems destined to produce consequences the most beneficial to civilized
s0ciety, by extending the dominion of intellect over muscular power and brute
force. I am moreover desirous of preserving information derived from docu-
ments which haye never yet passed out of private hands, and are consequently
liable to be lost or destroyed.

For all practical purposes the steam engine must be considered as origina-
ting with Mr. Newcomex; the introduction of a moyeable diaphragm between
the active power and the vacuum or less elastic medium, being essential to the
