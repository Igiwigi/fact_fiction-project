For the years 2012 and 2014, the difference between the marginal probabilities p(Cg) was
5p = —0.0622 (a positive sign for the Republican Congress outcome probability). Because we :
are dealing with the whole population of voters, we can articulate that these differences are [=
large enough to indicate a substantial preference reversal. We stress that the preference reversal : 3
occurrence is in fact more complex than just switching preferences between two parties, because :
there is also the ‘no voting’ electorate that similarly can alter their preferences from voting to not mea)
voting in the years 2008-2014. As such, this subpopulation of ‘non-voters’ could contribute to the :
changes of the voting statistics, implying that not only changes in party affiliation occurred, but a]
also changes in the overall voting activity. We hope to approach the problem of ‘non-voters’ in ae
one of the future publications. ied

Next, we formulate the LTP [45] to observe if the conditional probabilities of some random i
variables (in the context of this analysis, the C conditioned on P) follow the principle of additivity .
in respect of the total probability of the realization of C.
