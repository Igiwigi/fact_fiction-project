“it is said the Ginger-beer Plant was intro-
duced into Britain by soldiers from the Crimea, in 1855 ;” but so far as I can discover
this was a mere conjecture, and is not to be taken as an accepted piece of history. Dr. Ransome informs me, in a letter dated April, 1891, “some say it was brought
from Italy,” but this, again, I have failed to substantiate more definitely. ‘The whole
question as to whence it was first derived, in fact, is enshrouded in mystery; and it
is to be hoped that these studies may so draw attention to the matter that some light
will be thrown upon it at a future time. All agree that it is handed on from family
to family much in the same way as yeast or “ barm” is by brewers and bakers. As to its nature, the most conflicting views have been put forward.
