which points to non-homology of sex chromosomes across hand, female-biased sex ratios in a population, as seen in
amniote GSD lineages (but see e.g. [33], critically discussed many protogynous sequential hermaphrodites and ESD

amniotes evolved from ancestral sequential hermaphrodit- (although opposed by individual selection), reducing the
ism, which turned into ESD via a heterochronic shift, that two-fold costs of sex. This cost stems from the fact that
is, by moving the timing of the ontogenetic period of sex males cannot themselves produce offspring, and thus a

change from the adult to the embryo. Subsequently, the loss sexual population with a 50:50 sex ratio grows at half the
