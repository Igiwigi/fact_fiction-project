are seen in the middle, with adenoid cells at the circumference (Plate 10, fig. 2,
e. imterves, and ad. t.) suggesting an adenoid invasion from without. Inâ€™ the case of
some of these structures, the arrangement is reversed.

In what category are we to place these epithelial bodies? Their mixed
epithelial and lymphoid nature at once suggests thymus, and this seems, on the

whole, most probable. The proportion of epithelial to adenoid tissue is perhaps
not greater than is found in the thymus of young birds.* Against the supposition
that they are parathyroid is the fact that embryologists have not observed any
parathyroid in the course of development, and also, from a general view of the
comparative anatomy of the parathyroids throughout vertebrates, one would expect
that in fishes they would be represented by separate structures, lying outside and
independent of the thyroid gland. Mavrert describes epithelial bodies connected
with the gill clefts in fishes, but these seem to have been of a different nature.

Mustelus vulgaris has the low type of cell lining the vesicles, which are in this
respect almost identical with those of mammals.

In Acanthias vulgaris the gland is flattened and of irregular shape, and is situated
towards the end of the tongue under the coraco-mandibular muscle.
