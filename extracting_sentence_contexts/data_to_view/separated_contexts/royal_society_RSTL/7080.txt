This example may serve to show how inadequate are those considerations which are
frequently regarded as affording a satisfactory solution of these important problems. If
we are to pronounce an opinion on such slender data, the more probable hypothesis
seems to be that which associates silver and the allied metals with the other electro-
positive elements. In the two cases (namely mercury and cadmium) in which the fact
can be experimentally determined, W=A. In other instances also, such as that of zinc,
there is every reason to believe that this is the case. As hypotheses thus accumulate the probability diminishes of the conclusions which
are based upon them.
