H, and Cl, molecules into atoms, which, giving rise to a larger number of systems in
the gas mixture, causes an expansion, But the immediate effect of such a dissociation
would not be to increase the volume at constant pressure. For the volume at
constant pressure is proportional to the sum of the kinetie energies of all the
molecules ; and by a mere dissociation this total kinetic energy cannot be increased,
so that the volume would at any rate not increase. In fact, we have

pv = 43mnC*,

where 7 is the number of molecules per unit volume of molecular weight m, and C is
their mean velocity. Then, in dissociation, Smn is unaltered, and in the most
favourable case, where no energy is needed for the dissociation, C is unaltered. But
now the total number of molecular systems is increased and the average kinetic
energy of the molecules is diminished, as in place of certain molecules m with velocity
C we have molecules $m with velocity C.
