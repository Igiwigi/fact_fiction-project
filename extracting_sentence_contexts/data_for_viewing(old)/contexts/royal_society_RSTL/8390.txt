were present cannot be ascertained with absolute certainty; but I have scarcely any
doubt but that the animal possessed the complete typical number, forty-four, and that
therefore four incisors are wanting from the lower jaw. In the upper series there were
certainly eleven on each side. As in the specimens of Nesodon from the same locality,
they have acquired a very dark, almost black colour.

All the teeth have crowns distinctly separated from the long and tapering roots, and
with a well-marked cingulum around their base ; but as compared with most Ungulates
having distinct crowns to the teeth, they are decidedly © hypsodont,” or long-crowned,
contrasting especially in this respect with the early © brachyodont” forms, as Palwothe-
rium, Anoplotherium, Dichodon, Hyopotamus, &c.

They are arranged in both jaws in a perfectly unbroken series, being, in fact, in 80me
places (especially at the antero-lateral region of the mouth, where gaps are 0 frequent
in recent Ungulata) 80 crowded as to be pressed out of the straight line and to overlap
one another, as in the lower jaw of Nesodon imbricatus. 'The adaptation of the form of
the teeth on both sides to this position, and the accurate adjustment of their contiguous
surfaces, shows that it is a natural conformation. They are, moreover, of very nearly
even height throughout the series, and in their configuration present a remarkable and
gradual transition from the first incisor to. the last molar, easily traced in both jaws,
and more even and regular than in any other known heterodont mammal. Indeed it is
only by the analogy of other forms that they can be separated into the groups, con-
venient for descriptive purposes, designated as incisors, canines, premolars, and molars.
They are therefore most instructive in throwing light upon the homology of the com-
ponent parts of the different teeth throughout the series.
