2 quite independent of and disconnected with each other, and both take their rise as
Soutgrowths of the epiblast of the neural canal.
'Z The next Torpedo-embryo (Plate 16. fig. Db), though taken from the same female,
= is 80omewhat older than the one last described. The cells of the notochord are consider-
> ably vacuolated; but the segmental duct is still without a lumen. The posterior nerve-
S rudiments are elongated, pear-shaped bodies of considerable size, and, growing in a
S\entral direction, have reached a point nearly opposite the base of the neural canal.
& They till remain attached to the top of the neural canal, though the connexion has in
each case become a pedicle s0 narrow that it can only be obseryed with great difficulty.
Â© It is fairly certain that by this stage each posterior nerve-rudiment has its own
S 8eparate and independent junction with the spinal cord; their dorsal extremities are
S nevertheless probably connected with each other by a continuous commissure.
A The cells composing the rudiments are still round, and have, in fact, undergone no
important modifications since the last stage.

The important feature of the section figured (fig. D b), and one which it shares with
the other sections of the 8ame embryo, is the appearance of connective-tissue cells around
the nerve-rudiment. 'These cells arise from two sources; one of these is 8upplied by
the vertebral rudiments, which at the end of the last stage (Plate 16. fig. C, vr) become
split off from the inner layer of the muscle-plates. The vertebral rudiments have
in fact commenced to grow up on each side of the neural canal, in order to form the
mass of cells out of which the neural arches are subsequently developed.

The dorsal extremities of the muscle-plates form the second source of these con-
nectiye-tissue cells. These latter cells lie dorsal and external to the nerve-rudiments.
