We are thus forced to the conclusion that a mixture of heterogeneous groups,
each of which exhibits in itself no organic correlation, will exhibit a greater or less
amount of correlation. This correlation may properly be called spurious, yet as it
is almost impossible to guarantee the absolute homogeneity of any community, our
results for correlation are always liable to an error, the amount of which cannot be
foretold. To those who persist in looking upon all correlation as cause and effect,
the fact that correlation can be produced between two quite uncorrelated characters
A and B by taking an artificial mixture of two closely allied races, must come rather
as a shock.*

The better to illustrate this, I take some data recently deduced by Miss C. D. Fawcett.
