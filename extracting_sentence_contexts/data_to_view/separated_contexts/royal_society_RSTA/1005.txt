The
apparent concentration after the spray had condensed was about four times that
determined by the KI “droplet.’” This was due to the presence of SO, which would
have affected the KI and not the Griess tests. (The fact that the spray affected the
KI more than the Griess, seemed to suggest that other oxidizing agents were
present besides NO,.)

(2) The effect of washing the gases at t.d.c. + 50° was to give the same apparent
concentration for both types of “ droplet,” so that this process removed the inhibitors.
