transit times to Southern Ocean surface waters, which results in reduced Fe losses.

(a) Evidence of the stabilization of hydrothermal Fe from GEOTRACES sections

Across our modelling experiments, we find some support for the role of Fe stabilization in
hydrothermal plumes. The models with stabilization do a much better job for the GP-16 and
GA-02 sections, perform similarly to those with greater absolute Fe fluxes for GA-03 and
overestimate the hydrothermal anomaly for the CoFeMUG section. This suggests the need for an
improved process-level understanding of biogeochemical processes occurring at different ridge
crests and within their associated plumes; this includes understanding the nature, abundance and
ultimate impact of Fe stabilization. Taken at face value, stabilization of Fe within plumes appears
less important for the Atlantic sections, but this may rather reflect the fact that there is at present
no study mapping the extent of hydrothermal plumes in the Atlantic Ocean (as has been done in
the Pacific). Indeed, the distal signal of hydrothermal Fe seen in the GA-02 transect that occurred
away from any known ridge site does require stabilization for our model to be able to reproduce
it. On the other hand, the CoOFeMUG and GA-03 sections were zonal and sampled across both the
ridge crest and the prevailing meridional transport.

At present, there are three working hypotheses for chemical processes governing the longevity
of Fe in hydrothermal plumes [33]. The first emphasizes stabilization of Fe by organic ligands
[15,34], the second highlights an important role of Fe-sulfur nanoparticle pyrite [35,36], while
a third emphasizes the importance of colloidal Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide phases. Each mechanism
will have distinct influences on the residence time and reactivity of Fe within the plume.
Laboratory studies on synthesized pyrite have documented relatively slow Fe(II)-S2 oxidation
