By
step 2 we obtain, once again, that z'*(t) < 2R}, for all 0 <t<T. Putting these estimates together
yields, similarly to the previous case,

t B \2/2a-1)

It remains to analyse the third case, (3.16). First, we need to introduce more notation:

D=A, (r=

r 9v(P)

We will need some basic facts about ,,. Step 3. Consider &, = ®,(r) given in (3.19) with r > R5.
