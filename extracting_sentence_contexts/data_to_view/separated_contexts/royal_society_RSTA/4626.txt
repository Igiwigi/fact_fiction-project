Indeed, we have no information about the values of u on Iy, since I, is, in
general, not the level set {1 = a} as well as not the level set {1 = 8}. Furthermore, for any direction
e € R" functions (Deu)+ = max{Deu, 0} and (Deu)— = max{—Deut, 0} are, in general, not sub-caloric
near Iy. The latter fact causes serious difficulties in studying the regularity properties of solutions. Figure 3. Eventual structure of the free boundary. (Online version in colour.)

We will also distinguish the following parts of I’:
FEC) = Fa(u) {|u| =0) and Fy (u) = Fa(u)\Ty
The sets Te and I; are defined analogously.
