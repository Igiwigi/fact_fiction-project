In a fully formed embryo and in the hatched larva
(figs. 8 and 6), a pair of rounded lobes are found to exist immediately in front of the
prothoracic legs. In the embryo they have the appearance of a pair of limb-buds
(fig. 9, Plate 2) and might lead one to a false conclusion that an additional head or
thoracic segment was involved. Apart from the fact that no separate neuromere or
somites exist for such a supposed segment, any doubt as to its real significance is
removed by tracing its origin. In the state shown in fig. 1 it will be seen that the length of the prothoracie segment is
greater than that of other segments. As the first walking leg develops, a prominent
protuberance appears on the anterior side of its basal joint, fig. 3.
