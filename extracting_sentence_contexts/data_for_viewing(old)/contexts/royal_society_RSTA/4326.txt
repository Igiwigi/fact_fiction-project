amplitude fluctuations in the time domain. Knowing the importance of the amplitude functions, it
is surprising to see that, up to this time, the study of AM fluctuations in data has never attracted as


much attention as the FM. One of the difficulties in amplitude-related analysis is how to define the
amplitude fluctuation for a non-stationary and nonlinear signal in general. Ideally, the amplitude
should be the envelope to a FM carrier. A well-known tool, the Hilbert transform, seems to fit
our need. But as discussed by Huang ef al. [2,11], the Hilbert transform could not extract a well-
behaved smooth envelope for an arbitrary signal. Furthermore, the Bedrosian theorem [14] clearly
indicated that the Hilbert transform would favour the fast-changing component of the signal. In
the case of an AM signal, the Hilbert transform would only compute frequency from the higher
carrier wave components. In most cases, the Hilbert transform-defined envelopes are also highly
oscillatory and verge on nonsensical results [3]. In fact, the envelope for an arbitrary time series
cannot be defined meaningfully as discussed in [11]. The only way a unique envelope can be
defined is through the IMF [2]. This requires the time series to be decomposed by the EMD first,
as given in equation (1.3).

For any process having prominent cyclic variations, the time-domain analysis is especially
effective. Let us designate all the prominent modes with discernible modulation patterns as
waves and the rest as random modulations with no features. Then for any additively decomposed
component, we will have

cj(t) = F(w1,W2,W3,...,N), (5.1)

with w, as waves and nas featureless noise. It is possible to represent an amplitude function as
