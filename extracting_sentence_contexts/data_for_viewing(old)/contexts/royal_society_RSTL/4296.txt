PROXIMATE PRINCIPLES OF SOME OF THE LICHENS. 397

- These numbers give C;; Hz; O,, as the formula of the acid in the Lecanora tartarea,

which is exactly the formula of gyrophoric acid. In fact the acid in the Lecanora
tartarea is identical in all its properties and reactions with the acid in Gyrophora
pustulata, 80 that no doubt can be entertained that both lichens contain one and the
same colouring principle, viz. gyrophoric acid.

The Ether Compound.

Gyrophoric ether was also formed by boiling the acid from the Lecanora tartarea
in strong s8pirits. As might have been expected, it proved also identical in compo-
Sition and properties with that obtained from the acid of the Gyrophora pustulata.
The following are the results of its analysis :â€”

I. 0:337 grm. ether dried in vacuo and burned with chromate of lead, gave 0'7595
