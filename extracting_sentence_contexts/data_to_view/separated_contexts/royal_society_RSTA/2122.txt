Specimens obtained from drill core material, which has : 3
not spent long periods of time exposed to seawater or subaerial conditions, might better preserve
the in situ Fe redox state versus specimens obtained from dredging or outcrops. We included
specimens from dredging and outcrops in the current database because they are a significant Lo
number of the samples for which Fe redox was measured. In fact, Fe in bulk rock dredge samples iS
is significantly oxidized relative to other sample types (electronic supplementary material, figure 1s
Sih). Core samples, which might be expected to be the least oxidized, appear more oxidized than a
outcrop samples; however, the difference is not statistically significant (electronic supplementary aed
material, figures S4d). However, bulk rock outcrop samples do have a greater range of Fe(III) /Fer an)
values extending to fully oxidized while values from core samples do not exceed 80% oxidized =
Fe (electronic supplementary material, figure Sih).
