If they are
found at variance, the assumed hypothesis must be relin-
quished with candour as erroneous, but should it, on the con-
trary prove, on a multitude of trials, invariably to accord with

the results of observation,- as nearly as. our means of deter-
mination authorise us to expect, we are warranted in believing
that the principle of nature” is obtained; as: we-then have, all
the proofs of its being-s0, which men can haye of the ,justness
of their theories: a constant and perfect agreement-with/the
phenomena, as far as can be discovered. ;

The great criterion in the present case-is, whether-on. the
conversion'of a substance into: its/ Several compounds; .and- of
these-into one another, the simple ratios always: obtain which
the principles of the theory require. Amongst the: multitude
of instances which-I could adduce, in--support of such being
the fact, T will,-for the sake of brevity, confine/-myself to a
few-in the substances/ which: have- come under consideration
above, as they will likewise give- the grounds on which some
of the proportions in the table have been assigned, and every
chemist, by a careful repetition of the experiments, may easily
determine for himself to whatattention the-present theory is
entitled. Lead = - == of sulphate of lead
= £of sulphuret of lead
Sulphuret of lead = of lead
= of sulphate of lead

Sulphate of lead = 4 of lead
= £& of sulphuret of lead
Antimony = _== + of powder of algoroth

= $ of sulphuret of antimony
Sulphuret of anti-
mony = =22 of powder of algoroth. In the experiments by which these relations were ascer-
tained, the portion of powder of algoroth and sulphate of lead
