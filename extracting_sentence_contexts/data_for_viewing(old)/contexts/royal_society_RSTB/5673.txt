Habitat and Distribution.—Occurs typically in shallow water, attached to Zostera
weed, stones, wharves, etc., and ranges from Boston, Mass., to North Carolina. Is known
to occur down to a depth of 24 fathoms.

Source of Material.—The individuals examined were obtained from Zostera at Woods
Hole, Mass., in September, 1927.

Dimensions —The specimens used for cultures were about 15 mm. diameter. The
species apparently becomes sexually mature at about 12 mm. and attains a maximum
size of about 25 mm. diameter.

Remarks.—This is a species very closely allied to Molgula tubifera, and in fact
HarrMeyer included this last-named species and others within Molgula manhattensis.

Development.—The development is remarkedly similar to that of M. tubifera, in the
nature and size of the tadpole, the outgrowth of a long primary ectodermal ampulla,
and in the size of the egg and associated structures. This may be seen by comparing
figs. 1, A-F and 1 FI, I, J.

Development occurs outside the parent body and its rate is close to that of M. tubifera,
while as far as could be judged from two cultures, the free-swimming period of the
tadpoles are much the same. The ability to hatch by means of rupture should the
normal digestion method fail is well developed. The respiratory waves of constriction
along the primary ampulla are readily seen, and were first recorded in this species by
