224 MISS I. B. J. SOLLAS AND PROF. W J. SOLLAS ON A STUDY OF

for a very short distance between the splenial and dentary and for a longer distance
it is applied to the inner surface of the lower of the two processes into which the
dentary divides as it passes backwards. The upper and stronger of these two
processes is bifurcate at its extremity and receives, in the notch of the fork, the
pointed anterior end of the surangular. Between the angular, surangular, and the
upper and lower backwardly projecting branches of the dentary, is the well-known
oval vacuity which has been described by so many authors.

The angular possesses, as Broom has described, a complicated form. Its exact
relations to the other bones are difficult to determine without the help of sections.
These reveal the fact that the surangular is a bifurcate bone, one limb, the lower,
being applied to the upper surface of a ventral and anterior process of the articular,
and the prominence thus formed is clasped by the bifureate posterior end of the
angular. The angular extends upwards, reaching the ventral surface of the surangular
for a considerable distance in front of this interlock.

Turning now to the dorsal surface of the ramus, the surangular is seen to have
considerable thickness and to meet the articular in a suture which is directly
transverse for some distance on the outer side and then runs obliquely inwards and
forwards against a short dorsal anterior process of the articular. The ventral
anterior process of the articular is at first narrow, but expands as it passes forwards.
It is separated by a considerable interval from the angular which lies on the outer
side of it. Looking at the ventral surface of the ramus, it is seen that a long,
