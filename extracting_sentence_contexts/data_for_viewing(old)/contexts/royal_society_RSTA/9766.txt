pure linear scheme g, ... are the same for every ray of the beam.

Taking rectangular axes Oayz, let the equation of the surface separating the-region
of index » fiom that of index x’ be

2a = Bi +2)+4C(yt+7yP. . . . ...=. . (5)

Let a ray

y = Bx+b, z= yxte,
in the original medium be transformed by refraction at the surface into
y = Ba’ +0, 2 =y2'+e',
where the axes are, in fact, the same but are accented to indicate the difference of
medium.
The positive direction of the x-axis is that in which the light is travelling.

In the diagram P, is the point where the original and emergent rays meet at the
surface, PP, is the original ray, P’/P, the emergent ray, and (0, b, c) are the co-
ordinates of P, (0, 6’, c’) those of P’, and we shall take (a), 0), ¢)) as those of P,.

If (1, m, n) (U, m’, n’) are the direction cosines of an original and emergent ray,
(p, q, 7) those of the normal to the surface at the point of incidence, we have the
