from this, but with increasing doubt as to spurious links. In fact the long succession
of p links in series in the lower part would seem to point to connection with a diffuse
linkage. The presence of such a spurious link is shown directly also by the appearance
of the line 27783 in two places, cols. d and g indicating a eyele.

AuP. P, (1) = 41172794, P,(1) = 37357°62, P(#) = 7063812. The linkage as
shown in the map is much smaller than in the case of Ag. This is doubtless due to the
fact that in both cases the chains start with the long series of ¢ links. In Ag several
of these in succession lead up to the ultra-violet region from which chains run back
again towards longer wave-lengths. In the case of Au, however, two of these
long e links carry right across the observed region, and if the Au linkage is analogous
to that of Ag, the points from which linkages would run back again are beyond the
observed. Possibly some may exist amongst HanpKr’s ultra-violet, but the observed
possible errors in 7 are so excessive, due to the very large multiple of dA as well as to
large possible values of dA, that it is best to neglect them. There are several links in
the neighbourhood of 17260, where e (—4d,) = 17264°03, and of 17258. It is possible
these may be e links modified in some way not yet known. In the lists, however,
the attempt has been made to explain all these modifications by displacements on the
links in general.
