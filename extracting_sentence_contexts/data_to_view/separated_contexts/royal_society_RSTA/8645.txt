But the important fact for our present enquiry is that the role played by a large
quantity of Hydrogen is directly contrary to that played by a small trace, and we
may argue that the mechanism of inter-action of the two gases is quite different in
the two cases. A definite phenomenon has been quantitatively isolated which demands
for its appearance only a spectroscopic “trace” of one of the acting gases. This reversal of the effect of a trace of Hydrogen, by the admixture of more
Hydrogen is, however, interesting in another way, for it introduces us to a striking
difference of behaviour between Diffuse and Sharp series.
