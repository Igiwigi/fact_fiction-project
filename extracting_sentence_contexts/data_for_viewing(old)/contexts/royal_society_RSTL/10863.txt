who, both by his own work and by his analysis of the work of others, has contribu
enormously to our knowledge of magnetism, and the paper of CarysrTar, to whi
allusion has been made, render 8ome parts of this task at once comparatively eagy
and almost unnecessary. But contributions continue to be added at a rate which
s00n makes the best summary incomplete, and, to a greater extent than T am a b
some of the results of this paper may be repetitions of work already published. | Even
then, however, T hope they may not be without value, on account of the facts (1) that,
with the single exception of the experiment of $ 121, the magnetisation dealt with
has been as nearly uniform as it is practicable to have it, and (2) that very nearly all
the observed values of magnetism and magnetising foree have been reduced to
absolute measure. It may be added that the snbject with which this paper deals has,
in addition to its scientific interest, a special practical importance at the present time,
on account of its very obvious bearing on many points relating to the industrial
applications of electricity, and particularly to the design of dynamo-electric machines,

$123, The work described in this paper was done during 1881-1883 in the
Physical Laboratory of the University of Tokio, Japan, with the help of four Japanese
students, without whose assistance, both in the taking of observations and in the
arithmetical labour of reducing them, it would have been impossible for me to have
