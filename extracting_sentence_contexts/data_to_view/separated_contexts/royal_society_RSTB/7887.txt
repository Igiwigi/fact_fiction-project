It has been shown in
a previous section of the present paper (p. 102 and figure 1) that in all probability the
sixteen foetuses below 8 kg represent a series of stages of gestation up to about half-term,
while the fourteen of 80 kg and over represent a group of animals nearing full term, and
E117, with a foetus weighing 45 kg, was probably about 16 months post-coitum. Thus
there is a gap in the series of pregnancies, and stages immediately after half-term are not
represented. This has to be borne in mind in the interpretation of the condition of the
ovaries, together with the fact that early implantation and pre-implantation stages are
also not represented. The ovaries of several animals at different stages of pregnancy are shown in figures 14,
16 and 18, plates 5 and 6. The available material covers the gestation period from an early
uterine stage to very near term, and post-partum animals are also available.
