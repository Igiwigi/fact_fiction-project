Results were pretty encouraging in order to extend the model developed so far to a fully three-
dimensional simulation with the possibility to increase the Reynolds number or consider real
geometries characteristic of industrial processes. Another interesting possibility to be analysed
in a future work is the inclusion of temperature field reconstruction. Many works of the recent
past, in fact, have been addressed to the solution of conjugate heat transfer in porous medium,
considering local properties of both metal and fluid in energy equation reconstruction. The
effect of temperature in terms of zero-stress viscosity or, in general, in terms of non-Newtonian
fluid behaviour can be included in future work in order to better characterize the injection
moulding process in a relatively complex domain. This aspect can give important indications
to be considered while designing polymer stamps for daily use components.
