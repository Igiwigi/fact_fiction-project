proved to be carbonic oxide. Pure iron, then, is capable
off taking up at a low red heat, and holding when cold, 415 volumes of carbonic oxide gas. j
This fact was confirmed in various other experiments. It explains partly, if not
entirely, the abundance of carbonic oxide observed among the natural gases of iron in
experiments 1, 2, and 3. In the course of its preparation wrought iron may be supposed
to occlude six or eight times its volume of carbonic oxide gas, which is carried about
ever after.
