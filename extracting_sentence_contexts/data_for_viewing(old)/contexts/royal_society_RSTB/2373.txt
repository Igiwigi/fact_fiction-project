CoNCERNING THE INFLUENCE OF LIGHT UPON BLAzE CURRENTS.

No portion of this investigation has given me more trouble than that relating to
the influence of illumination upon the response to electrical stimuli. Whereas the
converse influence of electrical stimulation upon the response to luminous stimulation
has been clear and manifest, 1am unable to say definitely whether electrical stimuli
are more, or are less, effective after prolonged illumination. I should, indeed, have
preferred to omit all reference to this doubtful point in the present paper, but the

fact that I have carefully examined into the possible parallelism between luminous
and electrical stimulation effects in different states of eyeball makes the omission
unadvisable, and I think it will be preferable that I should give a brief account of
these somewhat unsatisfactory results. Moreover, the very facts that no clear results
have been obtained, and that there is very evident defect of parallelism between
effects of luminous and of electrical stimuli, are, although negative items of evidence,
points of some possible future significance.

At an early stage of the investigation, I noticed more than once that an eyeball
put up as usual in a dark box gave larger blaze currents than an eyeball put up on
electrodes and exposed to the continuous effect of ordinary light.

I therefore made a set of experiments ad hoc—hisecting the heads of pithed frogs,
