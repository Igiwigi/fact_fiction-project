a pipe, and the influence of friction in retarding the velocity of waters moving
in canals and pipes, in which he made the square of the velocity to be in the
inverse ratio of the length of the pipe : he determined the co-efficients by expe-
riment, and thus obtained a formula expressive of the conditions of the uniform
motion of water in open canals. The greater part of these hypotheses may be
said to have been removed by the more extensive researches of Dupuar, His
great hydraulic work, published in 1779 and 1786, contains a series of the most
valuable obseryations, whose results accord very nearly with the new formula
of the motion of water in pipes and open conduits ; and his experiments, with
pipes inclined in various angles from the 40,000th part of a right angle to 90
degrees, and in channels which yaried from a line and a half in diameter to
areas of seyen or eight square toises, seem to comprehend every case of in-
clination ; 80 that by collecting a prodigious number of facts, both with com-
pressible and incompressible fluids, he obtained a general expression for all
cases relative to the friction and cohesion of fluids : but a logarithmic function
which he introduces in it, by a sort of approximation, gives it a character of
uncertainty, which restrains its use, and shows the necessity of fresh researches.
