will do 80 even when considerably diluted (1818.). When such red acid is used be-
tween iron and platinum, the conducting power is 8uch, that one half of the permanent
current can be overcome by a counter thermo current of bismuth and antimony. Thus
a sort of comparison is established between a thermo current on the one hand, and a
current due to the joint effects of chemical action on iron and contact of iron and
platinum on the other. Now considering the admitted weakness of a thermo current,
it may be judged what the strength of that part of the second current due to contact
can, at the utmost, be; and how little it is able to account for the strong currents
produced by ordinary voltaic combinations.

1851. If for a clean iron wire one oxidized in the flame of a spirit-lamp be used,
being associated with platinum in pure strong nitric acid, there is a feeble current, the
oxide of iron being positive to the platinum, and the facts mainly as with iron. But the
further advantage is obtained of comparing the contact of strong and weak acid with
this oxidized wire. If one volume of the strong acid and four yolumes of water be
mixed, this solution may be used, and there is eyen less deflection than with the strong
acid: the iron side is now not sensibly active, except the most delicate means be used
to obserye the current. Yet in both cases if a chemical action Ã¾e introduced in place
of the contact, the resulting current passes well, and even a thermo current can be
made to show itself as more powerful than any due to contact.

1852. In these cases it is safest to put the whole of the oxidized iron under the
surface and connect it in the circle by touching it with a platinum wire ; for if the
oxidized iron be continued through from the acid to the air, it is almost certain
to suffer from the joint action of the acid and air at their surface of contact.
