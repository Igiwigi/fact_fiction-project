This is experimentally verified through pH-dependent rheology experiments (figure 5b). These
properties are consistent with what is classically reported for FMOC-based peptides [53,54].

Why do SLC16:0 and SLC18:0 sophorolipids, which only differ in two methylene groups,
undergo a similar micelle-to-fibre transition with decreasing pH, but result in hydrogels with
different sensitivity to pH? The answer could be found in the different melting-crystallization
profiles between the C18:0 and the C16:0 derivatives of sophorolipids (electronic supplementary
material, figure S9a). The former shows a glass transition temperature, Tg, at about 56°C and two
well-defined first-order transitions at 77°C upon heating (fusion) and cooling (crystallization).
This value is not much different than the melting temperature of stearic acid (69°C). On the other
side, SLC16:0 shows no first-order transition in the 10°C to 110°C temperature range but only an
ill-defined second-order transition between 85°C and 100°C (electronic supplementary material,
figure S9b). Considering the fact that the melting temperature of palmitic acid is 63°C, it is highly
unlikely to expect first-order transitions (fusion/crystallization) of SLC16:0 above 110°C. This
suggests that acidic SLC16:0 molecules are in a more fluid state at room temperature, a fact which
could explain the continuous micelle-to-fibre transition rather than abrupt crystallization.

SLC16:0 forms fibrillar hydrogels, as observed for other synthetic [25,83] and microbial
[44,48,50] glycolipids. SLC16:0 hydrogels have very interesting rheological properties, which can
probably be explained by the good homogeneity of the fibrillar network. They can reach elastic
moduli above 10 kPa below 3% and have thixotropic properties with fast recovery. For the latter,
they show an average of 60% and 80% recovery, respectively, after 20 s and 5 min, of their initial
storage modulus, while they show a 80% and 100% recovery, respectively, after 20 s and 5 min,
of their storage modulus immediately preceding the applied stress. Thixotropic hydrogels with
fast and complete recovery of the viscoelastic properties are interesting systems, especially for
