]. Introduction

One of today’s most widely used cryptographic protocols is the Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES), which requires a shared and short secret key to be known by the communicating parties.
This key is usually distributed using asymmetric cryptography such as the Rivest-Shamir—
Adleman (RSA) or the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The security of these protocols relies on the
computational complexity of the mutual underlying mathematical problem. While this problem
may be hard for a classical computer, it does not necessarily have to be hard for a quantum
computer. In fact, quantum algorithms are already known to solve some of these problems
efficiently. In general, one can say that security based on algorithmic complexity is always
endangered by a correspondingly large increase in computational power even of a classical
computer or by advances of classical algorithms.

In the history of cryptography, the only information-theoretically secure way of encrypting
information is by way of the one-time pad. As the key for this method has to be as long as its
plain text, it has been challenging to provide a method to efficiently distribute keys between
distant parties. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a protocol that solves this problem by
exploiting features of quantum mechanics to detect a potential eavesdropper during the key
distribution stage. In comparison to conventional cryptographic protocols, the security proofs
for QKD rely on a minimal set of assumptions and bound the security of the entire protocol in an
information-theoretic manner on the basis of fundamental physical laws. While the security may
