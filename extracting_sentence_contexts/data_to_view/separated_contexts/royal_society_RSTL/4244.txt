Now it will easily be
scen that such a result as this would follow, if we were to suppose the tidal influence
of the sun and of the moon to be equal. On this supposition, it is plain that the
high water would always occur half-way between the sun's transit and the moon's
transit. Hence at new moon the high water would be at noon; as the moon went
away to the eastward of the sun, the tide would be later and smaller ; till, when the
moon was at, 6" distance from the sun, the tide would be at 3"; but would in fact
vanish. After this point, the tide would reappear at 9* a.w., or a little later, the
inferior transit of the moon now taking the place of the superior one, in determining
the tide ; and from this time the tide would be gradually later and larger, till, at full
moon, it would again be at noon ; and 80 on. This appears to agree pretty well with
the phenomena of the tides at Tahiti, as determined by Sir E. BeLcnes.,
