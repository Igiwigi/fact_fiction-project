study of them.

We have observed no pulses which could be ascribed to transverse waves. This is in
accordance with theory, for an explosion in an infinite homogeneous medium would
produce only compressional waves. If there is a free surface and the initial disturbance
is a vertical blow on it, distortional waves will also be produced; but Lamb (1904) has
shown that such an impulse produces a distortional wave that has only about half of the
amplitude of the compressional wave, this would be obscured by the disturbance
following the arrival of the compressional wave. With a charge buried at a finite depth
the effects will presumably be intermediate between those for the infinite and semi-
infinite media. Ina quarry blast the conditions are somewhat different, and approximate
to an impulsive tangential force on the ground. This might be expected to produce a
large distortional wave, and in fact transverse waves are usually observed from such

blasts (Leet 1938, chap. 7).

7. AMPLITUDES

A quantitative study of the amplitudes of the waves is a matter of some difficulty, for
the recorded amplitude depends on (a) the distance of the shot from the geophone, (4)
the amount of explosive, (c) the depth of the hole in which it is buried, (d) the amount of
tamping employed, (e) the sensitivity of the instrument and its variation with frequency,
(/) the way in which the geophones are buried, as well as on geological factors. No
attempt has been made to disentangle the effect of all these variables, but certain
qualitative considerations are useful in the interpretation of the records. First, in clay
