selection should favour a very strict regulation of these strains leads to activation of many stress resistance
substances, including their deactivation upon usage. In genes, including components of the immune system
fact, activation of cytotoxic compounds is usually such as antimicrobial peptides and ROS-protective
followed by secretion of anti-inflammatory molecules antioxidant enzymes (Murphy et al. 2003; McElwee
