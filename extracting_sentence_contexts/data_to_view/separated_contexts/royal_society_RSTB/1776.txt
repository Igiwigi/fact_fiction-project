The doubtfulness of these data may be judged by the fact that
the reported fertility of the fathers above 66 is an increasing one! But Jet us add
that physiology admits conservation of male generative power till 80 years. The facts we have mentioned lead us to suppose that this power is not fully
developed before the age of 25. This supposition finds support in the observation
of the natality shown at younger ages. If in consequence of the insufficiency of the
data we summarize all the younger husbands into two groups, we find that those
under 22 years have a natality of 334 per cent., those of 22 years of 26-9, whilst the
following three years of age show an increase,

We may thus assume that the male generative power reaches its climax in married
life at the 25th year, that it declines above and below this age, and that it arrives at
its null-point at about 70 years.
