The mean of the largest and smallest hourly values exceeds in every case the true
mean from the 24 hours; but the excess is not large, and, though slightly less in
winter than in the other seasons, varies comparatively little throughout the year.

The mean of the individual daily ranges is, on the average, no less than 24 times
the amplitude of the regular diurnal inequality.

The ratio borne by the irregular to the regular range is distinctly greater in the
winter and equinoctial than in the summer months, showing a fairly well marked
maximum in October and November.

Taking the year as a whole, the mean of the individual daily ranges exceeds the
mean value of P by about 10 per cent.â€”a somewhat remarkable fact ; the Yatio borne
by the former quantity to the latter falls slightly below unity in three of the winter
months, but seems nearly uniform from March to September.

The (numerical) non-cyclic effect resembles the mean of the individual daily ranges
in being largest, absolutely considered, in winter, while showing the largest: ratio to
the mean value of P in the equinoctial season. The large size of the average non-
cyclic effect, when taken independent of sign, is an important element in determining
the significance to be attached to the results obtained in Table II. where it is treated
algebraically.
