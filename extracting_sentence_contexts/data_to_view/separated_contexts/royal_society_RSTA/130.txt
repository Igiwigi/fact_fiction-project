This journal issue
has drawn together a picture of current research. While it offers neither an
exhaustive review nor detailed descriptions, we hope that recent progress and the
potential for future work have been highlighted to the reader. The issue of scale separation, if such in fact exists in wall-bounded flows, is at
the heart of all scaling theories, and this likelihood increases with increasing
Reynolds numbers. New experimental facilities have permitted the study of ever
higher Reynolds numbers, and yet the measurement accuracy prevents us from
distinguishing between opposing hypotheses concerning even the mean-velocity
scaling. The greater urgency seems to be the ability to resolve all the scales, and
not simply move towards ever increasing Reynolds numbers.
