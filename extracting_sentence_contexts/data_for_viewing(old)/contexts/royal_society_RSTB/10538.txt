The consequences of climate change for local biodiversity are little under-
stood in process or mechanism, but these changes are likely to reflect both
changing regional species pools and changing competitive interactions.
Previous empirical work largely supports the idea that competition will
intensify under climate change, promoting competitive exclusions and

competition may in fact buffer communities from biodiversity losses that
are typically witnessed at broader spatial scales. In this review, we apply
