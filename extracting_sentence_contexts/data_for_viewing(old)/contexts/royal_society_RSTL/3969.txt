The new substance belongs in fact to the class of the amides, which it resembles

In the year 1841 Dr. STExHoussF published an interesting paper on a peculiar oily
matter, first noticed by DogBereINER, which occasionally appears in very 8mall
quantity, in the preparation of artificial formic acid from sugar or starch, oxide of
manganese, and dilute sulphuric acid, and to which he gave the name of artificial oil
of ants. Dr. STExHoUsE, in the investigation above referred to, succeeded in pre-

* It may not be amiss perhaps to mention, that in the method adopted the organic substance is strongly
heated in a hard glass tube with a mixture of hydrate of soda and quicklime. 'The whole of the nitrogen is8ues
thence in the form of ammonia, and being condensed into hydrochloric acid, is afterwards converted into chlo-
ride of platinum and ammonium, from the weight of which that of the nitrogen is easily calculated.
