Macropus, and Phascolarctos show just the reverse condition, and the hyoid articu-
lates with the skull by means of the stylohyale. Whether this is a coincidence or
not can only be ascertained by the study of further examples of the two sub-orders
of the Marsupialia.

The Auditory Ossicles.

Descriptions of the ossicles of the three models have been given already, but it is
instructive to draw comparisons between the different stages. The models illustrate
very clearly the kind of evolution which the ear ossicles have undergone, and they
indicate very strikingly the change of function which has been accomplished. In
figs. 4 and 5 Meckel’s cartilage is seen to take a very definite and important part in
the formation of the lower jaw. In fact, it might be said that the lower jaw
consists mainly of Meckel’s cartilages. The portion that has been termed the malleus
is continuous with the general cartilage, and, from a study of the sections, it can

only be considered as the articulare of Meckel’s cartilage. By methods of comparison
the same conclusion is reached, that is to say, the malleus is the modified articulare
of the rod of cartilage known as Meckel’s cartilage. This theory rests upon con-
siderable evidence, whieh is clearly emphasised by many writers, and especially by
Retcuert, Kinestey, and Gaupp. The proofs put forward in support of this
hypothesis are based upon the examination of the morphological relation of the
