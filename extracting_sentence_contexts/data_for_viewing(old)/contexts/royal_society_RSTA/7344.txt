The method can, of course, be used with the machine as a glider, or with the engines
and airscrews in action.

We find with comparative ease that, under certain conditions, Lanchester’s phugoids
represent a first approximation to general longitudinal normal flight.

We also find that, in addition to Lanchester’s first approximation, other first approxi-
mation paths can be obtained and various new paths are dealt with briefly, e.g. the
“extended” phugoids, which are more correct than Lanchester’s phugoids. The method
can also be applied to “ three-dimensional” phugoids which give the Immelmann turn ;
the slow spin of the stalled aeroplane; the slow roll; etc. In fact, first approximations
to the most important aerobatics have already been obtained by the method of this
paper. Some have been worked out in detail already ; others are now being investigated
by the writer and collaborators. Further, a method has been devised for the systematic
study of the equations of motion for the deduction of possible first approximations in
an a priort manner.

Second and higher approximations are not difficult to obtain, when once a first
approximation exists. In particular, the looping motion of an aeroplane in normal
flight has been worked out by one of the author’s research pupils, to a second approxi-
mation, by means of a mathematical process which represents a possible alternative
to step-by-step integration and has the advantage of being applicable immediately
to any initial conditions.
