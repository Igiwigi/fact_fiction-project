tm-pte.org Intracellular Ca”* signalling plays central role in the regulation of the secretory

processes of the exocrine pancreas. It is a well-known fact that in the exocrine pan-
creas acinar cells secrete digestive enzymes and pancreatic ductal epithelial cells
secrete HCO; rich alkaline fluid that washes the digestive enzymes out from the
pancreas. The prompt coordination of the secretory events of the two cell types
is essential and Ca** has a central role in both pancreatic physiology and patho-
physiology. Recent studies suggest that these two cell types cannot be handled
separately since they are more likely integrated into a functional unit [1]. This is
further amplified by the neurohormonal regulation of exocrine pancreatic
secretion. It has been demonstrated that acetylcholine (the main stimulatory neu-
rotransmitter of the pancreas) is released from the parasympathic nerve endings,
releasing digestive enzymes from the acinar cells [2], whereas at the same time
enhances the pancreatic ductal fluid and HCO, secretion via M3 metabotropic
cholinerg receptor (M3R) mediated Ca?* release [3]. In addition, the circulating
