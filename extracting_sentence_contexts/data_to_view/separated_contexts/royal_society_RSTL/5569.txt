872 SIR P. G&. EGERTON ON CHONDROSTEUS,

light by these discoveries, and the more extended obseryations based thereupon, fully
corroborate the conclusion arrived at by Professor AGas81z, that this genus, although
differing generically from the Sturgeons of the present epoch, belonged, nevertheless, to
the same family. These facts I now proceed to particularize in detail, commencing
with a general description of the most perfect specimen, and proceeding step by step
through the anatomical characters displayed in the several UL OPEc ns 1 have examined,
8 far as their state of preservation will allow,

The most perfect specimen yet discovered (Plate LXVII. I) is contained in a nodule of
indurated lias. The rostral and caudal extremities are deficient, and it is otherwise much
injured by the attempts to relieve it from the matrix in which it is imbedded.
