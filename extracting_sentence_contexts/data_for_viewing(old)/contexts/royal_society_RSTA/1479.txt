of which can be directly related to the action of a state-switch.

Superresolution approaches can be grouped into continuous and single-molecule methods
(e.g. SMLM). Abbe’s model of imaging does not require, and almost precludes, the assumption of
a discrete (molecular) nature of the sample. It also does not require any ‘switching of states’.
Nonlinear methods such as NL-SIM or STED yield a super-resolved image surpassing the

combined excitation/emission Abbe limit. These and other methods are perfectly well described : =
by assuming a nonlinear, or ‘multi-linear’ (meaning multiple patterns influence the emission in : =
a linear way) dependence of the detected light on the local excitation intensity. All involved 13
quantities such as local concentration and local excitation and emission intensity can conceptually : =
all be continuous quantities and do not require the assumption of state switching in the model DR
describing the image formation. The fact that the sample does indeed consist of molecules that : re
each are in well-defined states at any moment in time is currently more of a problem to these 1
‘continuous’ methods than a gain. In NL-SIM and RESOLFT, the switching statistics causes 8
unwanted super-Poissonian noise, meaning that multiple photons are typically detected from the : 3

same state of the molecule. Research towards exploiting the single-molecular discrete switching
nature has begun with methods such as MINFLUX, ROSE, ModLoc, SIMPLE and SIMFLUX
[22,23], but will doubtlessly continue towards nonlinear SIM or STED approaches.

Violating the assumption that a molecule is always in a well-defined state (as in ‘state
switching’) can be exploited: as described in [8], Rabi oscillations between molecular states can
