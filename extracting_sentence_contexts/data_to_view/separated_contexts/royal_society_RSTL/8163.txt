oo oO We see, therefore, that 7he locus of the poles of an avis in regard to all the four-point
conics whose planes pass through it is a cubic curve in the tangent plane touching the
chief tangents at A, which point is therefore a node on the curve. We might have inferred this from the fact that on any line through A there is only
one point B, while this point coincides with A in the case of the two chief tangents;
since at a point of inflexion all the four-point conics contain the inflexional tangent. Number of siz-point conics through an avis. We have now to determine B 80 that the equations (3'), (4'), (5), (6') may be simul-
taneously satisfied.
