Figure 1. Diagram representing the integration of sexual systems and mechanisms of sex determination in a common framework. The different states are represented as
discrete although in fact there is a continuum gradient of possible, intermediate, states. The idea of the evolutionary transitions along a gradient of phenotypic plasticity
was postulated by [2,4]. Epigenetic mechanisms underlie and made possible this phenotypic plasticity.
