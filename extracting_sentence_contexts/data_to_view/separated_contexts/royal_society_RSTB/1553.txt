In reference to the movements of the tripus if seems to us not improbable that the
relation of its erescentic process to the slit-like groove between the oval plate and the
elastic root of the transverse process of the fourth vertebra must also, to some extent,
limit and control the lateral motion of that ossicle, even if it does not altogether
prevent the possibility of any such movement, when the protractor musele is quiescent
and the plates are not pulled outwards and upwards. On the other hand, the
contraction of these muscles, and the consequent vpward and forward movement
of the plates, will necessarily confer upon the tripodes a wider range of possible
lateral motion. In fact, as we shall subsequently have occasion to point out more in
detail, any increase in the volume of the anterior chamber of the air-bladder will
mainly depend on the movements of the oval plates in the way just described, but
it is precisely such movements that will give to the tripodes an increased range
of lateral motion, and, at the same time, the capacity for reyistering the degree of
distension of the bladder, Conversely, the compression of the air-bludder by the
elastic recoil of the plates when their protractor muscles cease to contract, will
necessarily have the effect of confining the movements of the ossicles within
comparatively narrow limits. In the general structure of the various parts of the mternal ear, and of the
recesses in which they lie, Auchenipterus closely agrees with Mucrones. Lateral cutaneous areas are well marked, but the oval plates of the “ élastic-
spring” mechanism, to a large extent, prevent the lateral walls of the anterior
chamber trom coming into direct contact with them, but behind the plates the lateral
walls, and to some extent the outer walls of the lateral compartments also, are
in close relation with these areas.
