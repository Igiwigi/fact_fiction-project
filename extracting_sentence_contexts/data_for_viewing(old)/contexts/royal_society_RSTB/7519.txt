The second parameter required, plastochrone ratio, lacks something of the immediate
simplicity of divergence angle, and to this shortcoming may possibly be added its un-
familiarity as a botanical concept. It is, nevertheless, a most efficient measure and one
which is well known as the complement to ‘divergence angle’ in many geometrical con-
structions (e.g. the logarithmic spiral) employing the method of polar co-ordinates. Again,
phyllotaxis is largely dominated by Fibonacci systems; all classifications of these in the past
have been based on Fibonacci numbers, and, indeed, for many purposes some such treat-
ment is both natural and desirable. Since all these systems have very similar divergences
they differ from one another practically only in their plastochrone ratios. But whereas the
magnitude of the divergence angle, i.e. its proximity to 137-5°, immediately conveys the
knowledge that a Fibonacci system is under consideration, the accompanying plastochrone
ratio, in itself, does not with equal facility indicate to the mind the position of the system
under consideration in the Fibonacci scale. In fact, of course, that position is fixed by it,
and, as may be seen from figure 2 or from the first two columns of table 1, as the plasto-
chrone ratio falls towards unity the parastichy system most nearly orthogonal changes,
or rises, from one characterized by low Fibonacci numbers through those with higher and
higher pairs of these numbers.
