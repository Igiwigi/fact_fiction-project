With renewed precipitation the water-level again rose, and at the same time new
lake deposits were formed in which were incorporated the implements of early man.
It has naturally been impossible to find any remains in the deposits which still lie
beneath the lake, but in sections exposed not far from its present shores and about 50 ft.
above the lake one or two Chellean implements have been found. These are an indica-
tion that it was during Chellean times that the lake was again rising. That this rise
was continued to at least 200 ft. above its present level is shown by the discovery of
two unrolled Chellean implements in some gravels exposed at Kabua waterhole.

As Dr Leakey has pointed out, similar types of primitive hand axe have been known
to occur even with Acheulean cultures, and they are therefore not absolute evidence of
the Chellean age of these deposits. Nevertheless, the fact that such primitive types
were found, while more advanced ones were completely absent, is in itself some
evidence that they are of early age, for wherever Acheulian implements occurred they
did so in considerable quantity. It should also be remarked that deposits about 130 ft.
above the Kabua waterhole gravels bore implements of Acheulian stage 3 upon their
surface. Furthermore, no fauna of any kind was discovered in any of the deposits
which yielded Chellean implements, while, on the other hand, those which contained
Acheulian artifacts were usually highly fossiliferous. The appearance of this fauna,
which is of nilotic type, in beds with Acheulian implements dates the connexion of the
lake basin with the Nile fairly accurately. The importance of those deposits which are
unfossiliferous except for a few Chellean implements, lies in the fact that it is just such
an absence of fossils that would be expected in deposits laid down between the time
of the extinction of the Kaiso fauna and the arrival of the Nile fauna at the height of
