or, if the restoration is to be effected by antagonist muscles
under the same circumstances, then, the flexion and extension of
every part of the limbs will correspond, as to time.

I have not met with any arrangement of blood-vessels ana-
logous to those described, except in the carotid artery of the
Lion. May not this peculiarity be subservient to the long conti-
nued exertion of the muscles of his jaws, whilst holding a
powerful animal, such as a Horse or Buffalo, and thus enable
him to retain his prey, until it is wearied out by ineffectual
struggles ? I believe also, that those animals which chew the
cud, have a plexus of arteries in the neck, analogous to the rete
mirabile: but this fact has not yet been verified in all the rumi-
nating quadrupeds; and the eftect of these arrangements seems
rather to operate as sluices to the arteries of the masticating
muscles, than directly as the means of retarding the velocity of
their fluids. It is however necessary to examine these $ubjects
more accurately,*

As I have instituted a series of experiments and inquiries,
with the hope of elucidating this subject, it would be improper
to trouble you, or the Royal Society, with any physiological
reasonings until these are completed.

I have the honour to be, &c,
