u+dv+¢?w = o'(u'+¢v'+¢?w’),

ut+yo+ pu =o'(u'+yo' +P’),
where o’ and w” are the conjugates of w in k(¢) and k(y). Omitting the accents we can now
writet

x=u+ot+oew, y=ut+fot+fw, z=ut+ywt+yu,

where a, f, y is a permutation of 0, ¢, y. Since an interchange of X and Y in theorem 11 does
not affect either the hypothesis or the conclusion, we can suppose that «, f, y is a cyclic
permutation of 4, ¢, 7.

t This result can also be deduced, using the fact that (1, 1, 1) is a lattice point, from the proof of lemma
5 given in Davenport (1943).

Having determined the nature of the lattice A, we now return to the lattice A,, which
converges to Aas n-+00 through some sequence of positive integers. The lattice A,, is therefore
