pit coal from organized bodies; and, considering the general
facts which have been long observed, together with those lately
adduced respecting the Bovey coal, and the substance which is
found with it, we seem now to have almost unquestionable
evidence, that bitumen has essentially been produced by the
modification of some of the proximate principles of vegetables,
and especially resin.

Modern chemistry had comparatively made but a small pro-
gress, when the illustrious BERGMANN published his Dissertation
entitled Producta Ignis sublerranei chemice considerata ; for, at
that time, the extent and power of chemical action, in the humid
way, were very imperfectly understood. In that part, however,
of the above work, where he speaks of the fossil wood of Iceland,
