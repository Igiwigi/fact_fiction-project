With
this in mind, this studyâ€™s focus has been to better understand how cacti use airborne moisture. The challenge of this particular research study has been to assess how and if dew droplets
move along cacti spines and whether there is any evidence to suggest that the dew from these
spines is transported internally to the plant through the areoles. Assessment of these water
movement mechanisms has stemmed from the fact that this study has broad interest across
many disciplines and, as a consequence, has been uniquely positioned with regard to access to
measurement equipment. This has included the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
other techniques to determine the transport of water on the surface of the cacti and within its stem
with the focus being on whether cacti use dew droplets as a source of water, other than ground
water transported by their root system. To achieve this, an initial assessment was conducted to
determine whether the dew droplets on the spines move and if so, in which direction.
