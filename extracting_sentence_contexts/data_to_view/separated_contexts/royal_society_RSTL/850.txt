The different neutral salts have, compara-
tively, feeble powers of attraction for the tanning principle ; but,
that the precipitation they occasion in astringent solutions, is
not simply owing to the circumstance of their uniting to a por-
tion of the water which held the vegetable substances in s0-
lution, is evident from many facts, besides those which have
been already stated. The solutions of alum, and of some
other salts which are less soluble in water than tannin, pro-
duce, in many astringent infusions, precipitates as copious as
the more s0luble saline matters ; and sulphate of lime, and other
earthy neutral compounds, which are, comparatively speaking,
insoluble in water, speedily deprive them of their tanning prin-
ciple. From the different facts that have been stated, it is evident
that tannin may exist in a $tate of combination in different sub-
stances, in which its presence cannot be made evident by means
of solution of gelatine ; and, in this case, to detect its existence,
it is necessary to have recourse to the action of the diluted acids. In considering the relations of the different facts that have
been detailed, to the processes of tanning and of leather-making,
it will appear sufficiently evident, that when skin is tanned in
astringent infusions that contain, as well as tannin, extractive
matters, portions of these matters enter, with the tannin, into
