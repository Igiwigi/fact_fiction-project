To demonstrate the significance of our proposed approach, we compare with three categories of
baseline models, including compartment models, statistical models and neural network-based
methods.


— Compartment models

1. RobertWalraven-ESG [65] approximates the SEIR model with a mathematical
model that initialized from a particular skewed Gaussian distribution.

2. UCLA-SuEIR [18] further considers Untested/Unreported compartment than the
SEIR model based on the fact that exposure to the virus can also infect the
susceptible group in a certain period.

3. JHU_IDD-CovidSP [66] is a variant of the SEIR model which aims to generate more
realistic infectious periods by employing an Erlang distribution to model the time
in the Infected compartment.

— Statistical models

1. ARIMA [67] is an autoregressive moving average model and leverages the past
values to explain the given time series.

2. PROPHET [68] pays more attention to the nonlinear trends of seasonality and holiday :
