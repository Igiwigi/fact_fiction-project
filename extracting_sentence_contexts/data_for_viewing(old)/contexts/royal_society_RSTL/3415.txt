originated with, or was supported by him. He advocated the existence of a beaded
tissue, but not such as I believe to exist in nature. To point out his fallacy, there-
fore, is not to overturn what is here contended for. And with regard to the propor-
tion in 8ize which such beads or particles may chance to bear to the globules of the
blood, it is a question long ago set at rest by LEEUwENHotek and Movs, the latter of
whom gives accurate relative admeasurements of these parts, and points out their
disparity. It is a point, too, which cannot determine the question, since no necessity
has been or can be shown why the beads of muscle should conform to the size of the
blood-globules, or even of their nuclei, But Mr. Skzy's most pointed argument is
this: © That in the Cod and Haddock, in which the striz are of extreme beauty and
delicacy, the ultimate filaments present no appearance of a globular arrangement,
but are distinetly continuous and uniform throughout their whole length,” Yet
even granting this fact to be substantiated, it would scarcely invalidate the strength

of the arguments above advanced, which speak to positive appearances. However,

having been led to make the muscles of these fishes an object of special study, I am

not able to confirm Mr. Skegy's remark, but have found their flesh to present the

8ame characters with that of others of the same class, many of which have been also

made the subject of observation, as the Skate, Whiting, Halibut, Salmon, &. The

most obvious microscopic characters of these seem to be the following. The primitive
