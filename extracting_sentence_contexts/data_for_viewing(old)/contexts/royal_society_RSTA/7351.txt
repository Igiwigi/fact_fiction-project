of the screw thrust just balancing the drag at each instant; it is the smallness of the
drag and the screw thrust separately, compared to the lift and weight, that makes
Lanchester’s approximation possible. It is best when @,=0.

(b) « small, of the first order, Ty of order —3, or larger. We get the same results as in § 8,
the extended phugoids.

(c) « negligible, Ty of order —2, or larger. We get the same results as in § 9, the neutral
phugoids.

(1B) LARGE POWER: POWER PHUGOIDS: ZOOMING

17. (a) k of zero order, Ty of order —2, or larger; Lanchester power phugoids. Using the fact
that w’ is a second-order quantity, as given by the third equation (14-5), the first two
equations of (14:5) now become, as a first approximation,
