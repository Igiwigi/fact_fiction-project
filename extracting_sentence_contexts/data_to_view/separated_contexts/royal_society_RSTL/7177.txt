ROSACEUS. 683

LAMARCK'S name, therefore, and the general acceptance it has met with, I feel constrained
to follow the example of Dr. J. E. Gray, Mr. NoRMAN, and Professor WyviLLe THOMSON,
in reverting to the previous designation given by FREMINVILLE. Although Lawanck clearly differentiated Comatula as a generic type from Asterias,
Iphiura, and Furyale, he was very far from apprehending its most essential peculiarities ;
his description of it is strangely incorrect as regards one of its most prominent,
tures, since he not only overlooked the true mouth, but described the anal funnel as
e mouth, and placed it in the centre of the disk, which is contrary to the fact. © Au
tre du disque infcrieur ou ventral des Comatules, la bouche, membraneuse, tubuleuse
en forme de ac, fait une saillie plus ou moins considerable s8nivant les esxpeces. Ce
ctere singulier, qu'on ne rencontre jamais dans les Euryales ni dans les Ophiures,
Yuble rapprocher les Comatules de certaines Mcdusaires.”
