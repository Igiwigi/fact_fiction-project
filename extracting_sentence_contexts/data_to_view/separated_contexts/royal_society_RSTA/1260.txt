Commenting on this argument, Orr remarks* : “
held that neither does it afford a proof of the stability of the motion.” Orr argues
that the supplementary solution is completely determined by the necessity of neutralising
at the boundaries the values of ¥ and d¥/éy as given by (19); and that Kenvin has
assumed without justification that it consequently starts from zero at t= 0. If the
supplementary solution is in fact to start from zero, solutions of the type (19) must not
only satisfy both boundary conditions initially, but also be capable of representing any
arbitrary initial disturbance. Later Orr objects to KeLvin’s assumption, that the supplementary solution will
come asymptotically to zero as ¢ increases to infinity because this is true of the primary
solution (19). He says} that this can be asserted only of the bowndary values of the
supplementary solution ; and he concludes that “ Lord Kevin has not proved stability,
even for infinitesimal disturbances.’{
