Coffee has formerly been largely grown, but now is never cultivated, as the hurri-
canes 80 frequently destroy the crops. Pair-sized trees, the remnant of old plan-
tations, are now found fruiting freely. Vanilla grows well, and is tried in 8ome
spots. The want of water is now a great difficulty in the way of manipulating the
Sugar-cane, which is therefore not much grown. Formerly Indigo plantations
covered some of the central portions of the island, but now its cultivation has
ceased.

That the soil of the island is good, and that water was formerly abundant, the
fact of s0 many plants being cultivated clearly proves; but at the same time their
cultivation must have acted very prejudicially on the indigenous vegetation.

< From all these causes then indigenous plants haye suffered, and the aspect of
Yhe vegetation now is a yery peculiar one.

Z The elevation in the island is not sufficient to render possible any marked
ifference betwixt the vegetation of the higher and of the lower parts, and the
selative amount of moisture is about the same in the two regions, as the hill-tops
Ae Seldom enveloped in mists. But we do find some plants which only occur in
The upper parts, while others are found only on the lower districts or on the shore.
