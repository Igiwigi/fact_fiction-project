Main Deposit had not been reached. The mechanical difficulties to be overcome in
transporting excavated material to the surface from the bottom of the Lower Fissure
excavation were great. It was therefore decided to discontinue work there and to
attempt to reach a similar level by excavating the breccia of the floor of Kotzetang
cave. In laying out the preliminary survey of this work, a special study was made of
the eastern end of the 1928 cutting. Access to this part of the deposit was difficult
and could be had only through a narrow opening which in 1928 had been broken into
the uppermost western part of the Kotzetang. Here there was now discovered a few
undoubted, though indeed most crudely chipped, artifacts of vein quartz embedded in
the hard breccia (Quartz Horizon 1, 51; fig. 30). This horizon was also characterized
by the presence of much black pigment, the latter in places being of the consistency
of wet powder. Chemical examination of this powder subsequently demonstrated that
the black coloration was in fact almost entirely due to its high content of free carbon,
such an accumulation of charcoal furnishing definite proof of the local action of fire
(Buack, 1931).

Quarrying operations in the hard breccia of the floor of Kotzetang cave, beginning
at a level approximately 5 metres below that of Quartz Horizon 1, were begun by Mr. Pet,
assisted by Mr. Pren, towards the end of April. This work was pushed on vigorously,
and before the end of June the now classic stratum known as “ Quartz Horizon 2.”
or “Cultural Zone C,” was encountered. Here thousands of crude stone artifacts
were found im situ in actual association with Sinanthropus remains (Jaws G1 and G2
together with clavicle and skull fragments) in the fire-blackened strata of that horizon
(PEI, 1931).
