However, motivated by the fact that adding this optimal amount of noise in real
system is not an easy task, parameter-induced stochastic resonance (PSR) has then been proposed
as a convenient solution to take benefit of the noise enhanced property in the field of signal
processing [29,30]. Later, the concept was extended to two-dimensional signals in the image
processing field. In fact, the underlying strategy of PSR consists in changing the intrinsic
characteristic of a nonlinear system to induce a cooperative effect between the input excitation
and the noisy nonlinear system. In image processing, these techniques have revealed better results
than a classical low-pass filter to denoise black and white images [31]. In fact, the measure of
performance used in this study was the bit error ratio between the original noiseless image and


the processed image.
