refractive bodies, probably oily in nature, floating loosely in the vacuole (see figs. 4 and 5,
Plate 12) ; while the cell, as a whole, is less translucent than an active Saccharomyces
cell. The fact of Mycoderma usually appearing at or near the end of a fermentation,
depends partly on the absence of oxygen during the activity of the yeasts in the
liquid, and partly on the domination of the principal form at the time. It was always
easy to suppress the Mycoderma in my cultures by putting the tubes, flasks, &c.,
into an atmosphere of hydrogen or carbon-dioxide. I suppose this is because the
Mycoderma is a√©robian, though, as already stated, it can be grown (in pure cultures)
under circumstances where very little free oxygen must exist.
