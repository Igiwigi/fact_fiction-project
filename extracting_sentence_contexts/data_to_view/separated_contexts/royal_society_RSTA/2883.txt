(1+C/0)-', as was first discovered by SurHERLAND* ; while the
last equation shows that, if the molecules attract or repel one another according to
the inverse n™ power law, then y is proportional to the (n+3)/2(n—1) power of 6,
It is interesting to notice that Lord Ray.Ercut predicted this law of variation from
a consideration of dimensions alone; the present formula is complete, with an exact
analytical expression for the numerical constant. If we write « for the viscosity at
0° C., the three laws just indicated may be written

When the molecules repel one another according to the inverse fifth power of the
distance, the last equation becomes

ul hy = 6/ 90,
which was obtained by MAXWELL. Experiment shows that the second formula (generally known as SuTHERLAND’S
formula) agrees far better with the actual facts than the others. MaxweE..’s two
hypothetical laws, « « 6" and «0, are obeyed (even approximately) by very few gases. The law »« 6 (where s = (n+3)/2 (n—1)) represents the variation much better in most
cases, but even this applies only over a small range of temperature, after which a new
value of n is required.
