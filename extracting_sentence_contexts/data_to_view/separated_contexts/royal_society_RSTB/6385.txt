This statement should be understood in the sense that the cells were
capable of forming them under certain conditions. If, however, a culture is made from
a big cell picked out from a plankton sample, or derived from a big auxospore, the
resulting population is not capable of forming auxospores for a considerable length
of time. This fact also applies for the pennate diatoms (GEITLER 1932). In fig. 27 measurements are given of a line (Axp.) derived from an auxospore at
the end of March. On 7 April the average diameter was 94-24.
