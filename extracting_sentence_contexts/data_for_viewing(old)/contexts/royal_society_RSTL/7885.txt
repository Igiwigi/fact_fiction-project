248 DR. HUBERT AIRY ON A DISTINCT FORM OF TRANSIENT HEMIOPSIA,

It is hardly necessary to indicate, in the outset, the broad distinction between Trans-
jient and Permanent Hemiopsia. The latter, as the more important, has naturally
received the larger share of attention from the ophthalmists, and a reference to their
works will show its characters to be markedly different from those of the transient forms.
In Dr. Bapzr's recent work on © The Natural and Morbid Changes of the Human Eye,”
p- 447, © Hemiopia ' is clearly described as presenting three varieties, of which the first
is the only one that comes into comparison with the transient forms, and the chief cha-
racteristic of that first variety is concisely stated in these words: © The line of demarca-
tion between the sensitive and blind part of the retina is vertical and sharply defined.”
This fact, together with the permanency of the graver form, and its association with
intra-cranial tumours, apoplexy with hemiplegia, &c., will be found to offer strong points
of distinction between the permanent and the transient forms of Hemiopsia.

Most writers on the subject refer, as to a fountain-head, to Dr. WoLLasTtoN's well-
known paper © On Semi-decussation of the Optic Nerves ” (Phil. Trans, 1824, I. p. 222),
in which he gives a graphic account of two attacks of © halt-blindness,” with an interval
of twenty years between them.

On comparing his account with later descriptions, I think it will be recognized that
WorLLAastoNn, ARAGO, and BREWSTER are describing one form, while Sir Jonx HERSCHEL,
Sir CnarLes WHEATSTONE, the Astronomer Royal, and Professor DurouR, with myself,
are describing another (which had also been noticed by Dr. ForugRG1LL and Dr. PaRRy).
