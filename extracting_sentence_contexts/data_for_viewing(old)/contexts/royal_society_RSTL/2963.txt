proof this, both that the pupa was transpiring through the pupa case, and also that
the transpired matter contained carbonic acid.

Conclusion.

The very great length unto which this paper has already been extended, neces-
sarily prevents me from entering 80 fully into all the circumstances connected with
the evolution of heat in insects as the great importance attached to this interesting
subject demands; I shall, therefore, review the contents of this paper, and other cir-
cumstances connected with the production of animal heat, with as much conciseness
as possible.

On comparing the whole of the facts we haye just examined, we cannot fail to ob-
serve the yery close relation which subsists between the amount of heat developed,
and the quantity of respiration. We haye seen in the larya, the pupa, and the
perfect insect, that when the respiration is accelerated the temperature is also in-
creased, and that when respiration is diminished the temperature 8ubsides. When
the insect is sleeping, its respiration gradually becomes slower, and its temperature
continues to lessen until the insect is aroused, when immediately after the first respi-
rations it is again increased. When the insect falls into a state of hybernation, and
its respiration is suspended, its eyolution of heat becomes 80 likewise. When the
insect is most active, and respiring most yoluminously, its amount of temperature
is at its maximum, and is very great, and corresponds with the quantity of respira-
tion, and, as in the Bee, an immense quantity of heat passes off into the surronnding
medium. When the insect wishes to impart heat to its young it can do s0 at plea-
