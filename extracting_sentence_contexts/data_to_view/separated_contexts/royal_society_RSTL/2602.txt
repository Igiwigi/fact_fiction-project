ſomewhat more northern ſituation 'may agree better with the

£ anges of declination -of Arfturus and Sirius, which capital. Nars may perhaps be-the moſt proper to lead us in this hypo-

theſis ; but as we ſhould be guided by faCts in reſearches of this

Hature, it may be as well to expe the affiſtance of future ob-

Ervations before we are'too particular in determining | this:
Þoint +,

S lt may be expeCted I ſhould alſo mention ſomething concern-

few diſtant hints. From the annual parallax” of the fixed
tars, which, from my own obſervations, I find much leſs than
:has hitherto been proved to be, we may certainly admit
Ewithout entering into'a"ſubje& which T reſerve for a future
Opportunity) that the diameter of the earth's orbit, at the
Wiſtance of Sirius or Ar&urus, would not nearly ſubtend an
Angle of one ſecond; but the apparent motion of Arfturus, if
wing to a tranſlation of the ſolar ſyſtem, amounts to no leſs
han 2,7 a year, as will appear if we compound the two mo-
ons of 1/ 11” in right aſcenſion, and 1' 55” in declination,
Into one ſingle motion, and reduce it'to an annual quantity,
