But the momentum
of such a wind system is very great, and it is hard to see how it can be originated
and how destroyed. The Isothermal Region. The explanation that has been given of the temperature distribution carries with it
an explanation of the fact that the value of H, is greater over the high-pressure area
than over the low. For if we take a line starting from A and rising vertically, then
turning and descending vertically to C, the displacement of the air along such a
line from A to C will carry with it the displacement of any peculiarity of the
temperature gradient. For the same vertical displacement simply alters the tempe-
rature of each element by the same amount, but leaves unaltered the difference of
temperature between any two elements of the vertical parts.
