Similarly, magnetic helicity is involved in the saturation (and possibly the


enhancement) mechanism of the large-scale dynamo when the magnetic field is strong enough to ls |
react on the velocity [38]. More specifically, the generation of magnetic fields by turbulent motions was described 3
analytically more than 50 years ago; it did emphasize the central role played by kinetic helicity in : =
the large-scale dynamo. Since helicity can be viewed as a specific combination of velocity shear [3
components, one that remains invariant in the inviscid case, one can remark that helical dynamos 13

in fact also cover the case of shear dynamos. When using a classical turbulence model (one similar
to what was described in the previous section, but Markovianized), one observes a substantially
different critical magnetic Reynolds number for the onset of dynamo action whether or not the
flow is helical [39], a result corroborated by DNS [40]. It has also been realized that, even in the
absence of helicity but with helicity fluctuations, a dynamo is still at play [41] although it needs a
larger separation of scales to be established.
