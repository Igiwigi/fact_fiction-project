If f>2 the dominant
terms are the pair for which Ap, is largest, and since 4, +0, g, is an oscillatory function
of n, whose order lies between n~! and n'*~!, since (from § 4-1), Ay, <4

Essentially because of (4-39), an improved estimate of g,,(q?) is to be sought by displacing
the ‘finite parts’ of the paths of integration in (4-29) as far as possible to the right. For the
first integral the path gets caught on the branch points v = -+-ic, and it is from these that the
principal part of the integral is contributed. Hence the remainder term in (4:40) can be
shown to be in fact O{n~! (log n)~3}.

4:7. Calculation of g,(q?). The best method is to use the differential equation (2-8).
