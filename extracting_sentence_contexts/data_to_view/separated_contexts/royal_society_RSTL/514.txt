360 Mr. HaTcneTT's Experiments on Zoopbytes,

after the solution of the phosphate-of lime, was of a gelatinous
consistency, and exhibited but very imperfect traces of organi-
zation ; by the others, however, a completely formed membrane
or cartilage was left, retaining the figure of the original bone. When therefore the component parts of shell and bone are
considered, it appears that the essential characteristics are, car-
bonate of lime for the one, and phosphate of lime for the other;
and that their bases consist of the modifications of a glutinous,
gelatinous, or membranaceous substance. I experienced much gratification in tracing the progressive
and connected changes in the composition of the various shells
and bones ; and a considerable increase of pleasure arose, in pro-
portion as the observations made on those bodies were corrobo-
rated, and the chain of connection extended, by the develope-
ment of the facts resulting from the experiments on Zoophytes,
which form the principal subject of this paper. It will now be proper to review these: experiments, and to
examine how far they agree with those made on shell and bone,
| and how far they tend to prove, that these substances are all of
a nature closely connected. The experiments on the Madrepores afforded the following
results.
