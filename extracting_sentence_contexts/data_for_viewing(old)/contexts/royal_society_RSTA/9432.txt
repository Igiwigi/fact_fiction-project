CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATION TO PROBLEMS IN HYDRODYNAMICS. 477

Adverting for example to §14, it is seen now that the provisional exclusion of a
negative value of ny was an unnecessary piece of caution. For ny negative the flow
would take place in a region like that on the
left of the arrows in fig. 16. It is true that
in this flow the velocity at infinity would be
infinite, but then there is no irrotational con-
tinuous flow possible in the region which does
not have infinite velocity at infinity. The
flow is, in fact, no more impossible than is the
region in which it is supposed to take place.

kind not likely to be directly useful in physical applications is

where f and g are rational algebraical functions, or any functions which have no
infinities other than for w infinite. The vector angle, on the linear range c > w> —e,
is x = g (w) (c?—w*)'*, and the angular range is zero.
