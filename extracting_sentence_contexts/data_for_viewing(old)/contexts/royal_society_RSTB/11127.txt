three main linked cortical regions that are almost invariably
activated in any number task: the parietal lobes bilaterally,
particularly the intraparietal sulcus, and the left frontal
lobe [20-22]. Butterworth [2] reports evidence that the
development of the parietal lobes is markedly atypical in
learners with dyscalculia, a congenital disability in learning
about numbers and arithmetic; moreover, evidence from
twins suggests that in some cases of dyscalculia, the neural
abnormality is inherited. These parietal regions support
more than simple numerical tasks; Amalric & Dehaene [23]
show that they are ‘recycled’ by professional mathematicians
doing advanced mathematical tasks, and that the neural basis
of memory for mathematical material—facts and formulae—
is distinct from language-based memories.

Nevertheless, many studies over the past 100 years have
found that damage to the human left parietal lobe alone results
in impairments in various number tasks [24]. So, what is the
role of the right hemisphere? Semenza & Benavides-Varela
[25] recruit a variety of methodologies to answer this question,
from neurological patients and standard neuroimaging, to
reversible inactivations induced by transcranial magnetic
stimulation and direct current stimulation of the cortex.
They conclude that there is a ‘bilateral orchestration’ of the
left and right hemispheres, with the right, like the left,
