realized that improved performance was possible if the materials were bioactive,
hat is, if they elicited a biological response that led to bonding between the
implant and the surrounding tissue. This would promote osseointegration and
reduce the need for a further revision procedure to replace the original prosthesis.
Presently, the average lifetime of orthopaedic implants is of the order of 15 years
11]. With patients requiring implants getting younger and younger, this is a
strong driver to extend the lifetimes of implants, and so reduce the number of
revision surgical procedures.

One approach to improve the integration of non-ceramic implants such as the
itanium alloys used in femoral stems is to coat the metal with a ceramic [12].
Although alumina has been used, HAp is a preferred contender because it is
ioactive and thus will bond to the surrounding bone. In fact, for many years
13,14] it was considered that the precipitation of such an HAp layer on an implant
was a key indicator of bioactivity, or bone-bonding ability. This position is now
oeing challenged [15], since some crystalline calcium phosphates (e.g. B-TCP)
90nd to bone without the formation of an HAp layer.

Inert bioceramics may be considered to be first generation biomaterials;
second generation biomaterials include the bioactive glasses pioneered by Hench
who has argued that the third generation biomaterials [16] will involve the
use of regenerative, instead of replacement, materials. Consequently, a deeper
understanding is required of the mechanisms of bioactivity, and the nature of
the biological response that leads to bonding between the biomaterial and the
surrounding tissue. In particular, one needs to consider the role of the biomaterial
