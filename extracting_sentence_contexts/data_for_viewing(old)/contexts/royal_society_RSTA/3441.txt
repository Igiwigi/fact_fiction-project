to the discovery of new phenomena, new elementary particles and resonances.

If physicists listened to Bohr (with whom we agree on many points) and abandoned

constructing mental images, the progress of science would be compromised. : =
This is why recent experiments of Couder and co-workers [81], with bouncing droplets : a
(http: / /dualwalkers.com), may help perhaps to develop one day a more intuitive understanding 3
of wave-particle duality and of quantum phenomena. : XS
There is still no general agreement how to interpret QM and QFT and how to reconcile them : _
with general relativity. In our opinion, a rigorous epistemological and ontological analysis of QFT : Ss
is still lacking. Dh
Incorrect interpretation of QT and/or incorrect mental images of quantum particles and 13
measurements lead to paradoxes and to speculations which are pure science fiction. 1S

Leslie Ballentine said in his book: ‘Once acquired, the habit of considering an individual
particle to have its own wave function is hard to beak. Even though it has been demonstrated
strictly incorrect’ [33]. Statistical contextual interpretation, inspired by Bohr and Einstein, seems
to be the most cautious [29,33,35-37,61]. Several arguments in favour of statistical interpretation
of QT and how it may account for all properties of quantum measurements, including the
uniqueness of individual outcomes, were given by Allahverdyan et al. [82,83].

According to the statistical interpretation, quantum states and operators are treated
as mathematical abstract tools enabling quantitative predictions to be compared with the
experimental data. Whether QM is emergent from some more detailed theory of quantum
phenomena is an open question.
