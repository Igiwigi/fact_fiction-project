11. We must conclude that the air
remains luminous in the centre of the spark rather longer than near the poles. This
fact, which is very apparent for the luminosity of the metallic vapours, will be
referred to again further on (p. 210). The displacements on this photograph being the first that were actually measured,

luminosity as far as that line is concerned to =4x10-". The air line at 3995,

the best methods of drawing the reference lines (see p. 198) had not been adopted,
and these lines were therefore at unequal intervals.
