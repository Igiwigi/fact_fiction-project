Consequently, for solutions
to the effective-theory field equations arising from the action (2.18), one has the conserved total
energy

B= | ax (Sam + vii), Ql)


which is simply equal to the standard, positive semidefinite, energy of Maxwell theory alone. Although allowed by the field equations, the g field does not contribute to the total energy. Clearly,
the fact that g may be removed by the residual harmonic symmetry is the reason for its non-
appearance in the total energy (2.41). At least in the source-free theory we have considered so far,
the g field may be considered redundant.

3. Covert symmetry breaking

(a) Scalar electrodynamics

In ยง2, we have seen that the unambiguous leading-order dynamics of the D =5 system (2.4) is just
d=4 Maxwell theory.
