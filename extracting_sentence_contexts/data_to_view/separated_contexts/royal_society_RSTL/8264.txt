Another remarkable cireumstance connected with the ursine remains, and which has
Qalready been alluded to, is the number of instances in which bones obviously belonging
Bo the skeleton of the same animal were found collected together in one spot.
© Amongst the most remarkable of these collections may be mentioned one which,
Bough not recorded in the © Register,” was found, as we are informed by Mr. PExGELLY,
S+* on the 29th July, 1858, upwards of 2 feet deep in the third bed, immediately north of

rtly overlapping the astragalus, is the left radius ; and attached to the specimen, when
"at firs came under my notice, was the detached lower articular end of the same radius,
Avith the scapho-lunar fossette entire. In a * Report of Progress in the Brixham Cave”
Blrawn up by Dr. FaLcoxer in Sept. 1858*, this specimen is described as a © superb
Specimen of the bones of left hind leg, comprising the femur, tibia, and fibula folded
Sogether, with the patella and astragalus # 8itu.” © These were found,” the Report
