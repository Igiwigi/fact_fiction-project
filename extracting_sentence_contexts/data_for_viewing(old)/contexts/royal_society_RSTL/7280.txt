pared a black surface with a white one; but the surfaces were seen to be white and
black through the transparent gum, which in both cases was the real radiator. _ The
ame remark applies to Mas80n and CourTfsrts. Every particle of the precipitates
they employed was a varnished particle ; and the constancy they observed was, IT
imagine, due to the fact that the main radiant in all their experiments was the 8ub-
stance employed to make their powders cling to the surfaces of their cubes.

Gum or glue is a powerful radiator; in fact equal to lampblack, and it is a corre-
spondingly powerful absorber. The particles surrounded by it had therefore but 8mall
chance of radiating through it. T sought to remedy this by the employment of a dia-
thermic cement. Sulphur is highly diathermic ; it dissolves freely in bisulphide of
carbon, and at the snggestion of a chemical friend I employed it to fix the powders.
The cube was laid upon its side, the surface to be coated being horizontal, and the
bisulphide, containing the sulphur in solution, was poured oyer the surface. Before the
liquid film had time to evaporate, the powder was shaken upon it through a muslin
sieve. The bisulphide passed rapidly away in vapour, leaving the powder behind
imbedded in the sulphur cement. Each powder, moreover, was laid on sufficiently
