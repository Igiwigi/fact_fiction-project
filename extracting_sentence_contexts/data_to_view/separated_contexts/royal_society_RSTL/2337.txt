THE facts which I communicated in my former paper on this subject appeared
80 inexplicable on any known principle, that T am induced to present my
snbsequent observations to the Society, although I have not sneceeded in
ascertaining the causes of the singular effects which I have observed. From
the experiments described in that paper, it appeared that a magnetized needle,
when vibrated exposed to the 8un's rays, will come to rest sooner than
when screened from their influence: that a similar effect is produced on a
needle of glass or of copper ; but that the effect upon the magnetized needle
greatly exceeds that upon either of the others. To the experiments from
which this was inferred, it might be objected, that the magnetized needle and
the other metallic needle were not of the same weight, and that the effect
upon an unmagnetized steel needle had not been compared with that upon a
Similar needle magnetized.
