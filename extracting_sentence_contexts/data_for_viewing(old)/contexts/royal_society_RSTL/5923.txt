contemporaneous events of Asiatic life, leads us to documentary beginnings of a great
development, more or less chronologically determinable. But when we come to con-"'
s8ider more closely the unmistakeable purely historical time, before Mgxzs, of separate
kingdoms and particular provinces, we discover that those earlier ages belong to a period,
when the foundation of that entire development rested upon the formation of language
and mythology. The author believes that he is justified in maintaining this to he a fact
in historical science.”
« Records forming a documentary history of nations extend to about 4000 years before
our era, and an early period of long duration must necessarily have preceded these.
& When, on the grounds set forth in our Fifth Book, we assign to that period a duration
A of from 6000 to 9000 years for Egypt, and from 15,000 to 16,000 years for man's exist-
5 ence, it is no arbitrary and presumptuous application of research, but an emancipation
T of ourselves from error which throws everything into confusion. 'The first epochs of the
= history of the human race demand, at the least, a period of this extent, and its com-
= mencement, 20.000 years before our era, is a fair starting-point in the earth's history.”
