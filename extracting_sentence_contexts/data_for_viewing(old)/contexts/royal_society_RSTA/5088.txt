crystals, depending on whether the rafts are parallel or perpendicular to the stress axis, the life

may be improved significantly [41,42]. These authors found that, in their particular experimental
alloys, rafting occurred normal to the load axis (N-rafts) at about 60% y’ and parallel to the load
axis (P-rafts) at about 80% y’ and that the creep properties improved with increasing y’. However,
their conclusion that improvements were associated with narrow y channels was not supported
by a model and does not take into account the effect of the morphology (N-rafts or P-rafts).
Furthermore, as the volume fraction of y’ increases, the mismatch changes, which determines
the morphology. In fact, it is known (see [43]) that the raft morphology at a given volume fraction
of y’ has a major influence on the creep life and that negative mismatch alloys producing N-rafts
have the best creep properties. In thermo-mechanical fatigue (discussed in §7), it is shown that
high temperature holds, even at low strains, can produce a rafted structure which undoubtedly
influences the life as discussed below.

During cyclic loading, it was shown that coarsening occurred very rapidly without rafting.
Instead, the small precipitates were rapidly consumed by the larger ones, which had a somewhat
irregular form. The irregular form undoubtedly is due to both tension and compression being
applied with insufficient time in a cycle to attain the equilibrium morphology. Examples are
shown in figure 17 for René 77 [4] and in figure 18 for René 80 [44], both second-generation
polycrystalline alloys that were used for turbine blades and continue to be used. A structure
similar to that shown in figure 17 was observed after only 50 cycles under the conditions given
