Bbmarine currents carrying to the equator the bottom-water of the icy seas.” =1It is, however, to Lexz (who had, in his previous papers of 1831 and others, concluded
at the temperature of the ocean decreases with the depth, rapidly at first and then
gadually, until a point of about 36? F. was reached, when it became insensible) that,
Be are indebted for a more special review and discussion of all the facts known up

exception of those made by myself, were taken with thermometrographs, and especially
with Six's thermometers. Tt is, however, to be observed that all instruments of this
kind are liable to a source of error which hitherto investigators have not borne in mind,
