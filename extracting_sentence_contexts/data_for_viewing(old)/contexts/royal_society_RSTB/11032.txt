telomerase expression has also been found to occur without
concurrent notable enzymatic activity. For instance, tissue local-
izations of the protein and RNA components of telomerase
(ie. telomerase gene expression) do not always match detect-
able levels of telomerase activity [32], and telomerase activity
is often low in adult somatic stem cells although TERC and
TERT subunits are expressed [33]. Therefore, it is questionable
whether the main mechanism that confers the exceptional
proliferative capacities of stem cells is more related to the
expression of those telomerase components than to the
maintenance of telomere length itself. In other words, these
results seem to suggest that TERT or TERC impacts cell func-
tions despite the fact that telomerase activity is undetectable.
This question applies also to our understanding of the influence
of telomerase on individual fitness, opening unexplored av-
enues of research to distinguish between telomere-related and
non-telomere-related effects of telomerase.

(a) Non-telomere-related cell renewal control by TERT
The origin of the telomerase—fitness relationship was tested
experimentally using transgenic mice models either lacking
telomerase expression (e.g. Tert”/~ strains) or presenting an
overexpression of telomerase in given cell types [4]. Tissue fit-
ness may be promoted by two main mechanisms: (i) a rapid
mobilization of the stem cell pool to replace damaged cells
