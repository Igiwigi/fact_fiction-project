itself when we express dynamical facts by it, and consider how we are to reason upon
them through its instrumentality. I shall therefore treat the subject in this natural
order, considering first the construction of the © Organon ” or Instrument of reasoning,
then the ideas suggested to us by that Instrument, and to which that Instrument is
applicable. When the nature of a chemical event has been thus defined 80 that we
clearly see what we have to do, the further inquiry lies before us of the theoretical
s0lution of the problem, namely, given a chemical event, how are we to determine the
events of which that event is compounded? This problem may in all cases be solyed,
The s0lution is effected by means of a peculiar theorem, which occupies in theoretical
chemistry a position analogous to that held in theoretical mechanics by the theorem
of the parallelogram of forces. Lastly, T shall give examples of the application of this
theorem, to actual events and things, when the chemist will have an opportunity of
estimating the bearing of this theory upon facts and its practical utility.

Sxeorron I,

(1) Our total information as to the identical relation of ponderable matter is com-
prised in a system of equations constituted upon the principles explained in Part T.
Section VI. When we are adequately impressed with this important truth a chemical
equation becomes a study of transcendent interest, and we are led to consider in a new
