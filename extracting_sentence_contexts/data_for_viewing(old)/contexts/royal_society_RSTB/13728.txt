by recent theoretical models showing that puzzling cultural
evolutionary patterns such as periods of stasis interspersed
by sudden increases in cultural traits need not depend on
exogenous factors such as abrupt changes in population
size and connectedness [46,47]. Instead, sudden increases in
cultural complexity can result from the emergence of cultural
traits that facilitate the emergence of other related traits
[21,37,48].

(c) Type Il cumulative cultural evolution generates

cultural dependencies
The fact that natural phenomena are not readily available but
must be progressively uncovered using solutions that harness
less deeply hidden natural phenomena creates cultural
dependencies, which some have argued is the core of what
CCE is about [6,21,37,49,50]. This contrasts with solutions
accessible through Type I CCE that need not depend on
pre-existing solutions. Take the wheel experiment mentioned
above for instance [5]. An individual with flat priors about
the task will have the same probability of producing the
least good and best solutions since all configurations have
exactly 1 chance out of 20736 to be produced (20736 being
the number of possible configurations). Because the prob-
ability of producing the best solution is small, multiple
