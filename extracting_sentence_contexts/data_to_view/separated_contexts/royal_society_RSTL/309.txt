accurate computation, | or particular in-
duction. But this pale luminous arc, b c, fig. g, as it appears onthe
planet, not when it is at its greatest elongation, when we see
half its illuminated surface, but at a time when it is approaching
very near to its inferior conjunction, is in fact only the appa-
rent, but by no means the real extent of the twilight, in a per-
pendicular direction east and west from the circle terminating
the dark and illuminated hemispheres. ,

This real distance must evidently fall much short of the
length of the abovementioned arc. The following is the
method I have adopted to deduce the real extent of the twilight
of Venus, from the apparent one as scen at the points of the
CcusPs.
