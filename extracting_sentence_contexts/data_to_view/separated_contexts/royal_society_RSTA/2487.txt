The additional lemmas, appealed to on lines 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8, do not at all touch the central
considerations that lead to the fundamental lemma. That part begins with proving the structural
identity for chains c’ =’ U h{c’] of a subset b’ of a, where a is any system and h any function from a
to a. This general fact can be instantiated for the two chains c and c*; that fact, in turn, allows the
partitions used in the proofs of the fundamental lemma to define the bijections h* and h**. Here is a
diagrammatic summary:

The proofs of the structural identity for the two chains are instances of the same proof presented in
its general form below. This almost linear proof is not presented for its completed structure, but
for the possibility of indicating how it was constructed through a sequence of partial proofs with
gaps that are filled successively by forward and backward moves. (I use the line numbering of


the completed proof; the numbering in the sequence of partial proofs is dynamic.
