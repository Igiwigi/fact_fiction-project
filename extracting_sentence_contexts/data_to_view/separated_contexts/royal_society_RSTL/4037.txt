My
endeavours to discover signs of any, by the aid of the condenser, have been entirely
fruitless. Likewise there are no signs on opening the circuit of any electric current
in circulation. I have made myself quite certain of this fact by means of the galya-
nometer, employing at the same time a pile of tetanized frogs. The phenomenon which we have studied thus at length belongs clearly to the
nerve, and takes its origin from the relation, the nature of which is yet undetermined,
which exists between neryous influence and the action of the electric current accord-
ing to the direction of the Jatter. It has been distinctly proved in the fourth series of these electro-physiological
researches, that the passage of the direct current destroys the excitability of the
nerve, and that this is not the case with the inverse current, which acts in a contrary

manner, The direct current acts by exciting, when it commences, a contraction which
we know to be stronger than that produced in the same case by the inverse current.
