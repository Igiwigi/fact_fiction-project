ARIENS KAPPERS ON SOME CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SKULL AND BRAIN. 413

It is on account of these facts that Kurz found the Chinese brain to resemble more or
less the (very brachycephalic) Orang-Utan brain, and tried to trace the origin of the
Mongol race from this anthropoid, a statement not based on sufficient evidence,
although the polyphyletic origin of the human race is accepted by authors like MELcHERS
and KnAatTscH.

The frontal lobe of these Chinese brains strikes us by the height of its slope. This is
obvious if we compare it with Dutch or Japanese mesocephalics. The Chinese frontal
lobe is somewhat less semicircular, but has some resemblance to a highly curved nose,
an appearance correlated with the fact that the facies orbitalis of the skull is fairly high
and has a more oblique or vaulted shape than in other meso- or sub-brachycephalic
skulls, e.g. the Japanese (and Dutch). As a consequence the thinner lower part, the
rostrum of the frontal lobe, is more evident in the Chinese, a feature already noted by
PaRKER and MILs (1886) and by Dercum (1889, 1892).

The average of the Japanese-skull is slightly less mesocephalic than the Chinese.
Apacut gives the Japanese an index of 78-3 for the males and 79-3 for the females ;
others give it a slightly higher index, 80-82. Thanks to the kindness of Professor G.
Fuse, in Sendai, I had at my disposal eight brains from Japan, all of them well fixed. In
Plate 45 I give photographs of three of these brains. In all my specimens the following
points may be seen :â€”
