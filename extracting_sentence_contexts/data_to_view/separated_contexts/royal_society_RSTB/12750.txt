is that they naturally include inter-individual variation
in decision-making to the extent that it exists in the human
population recruited from. This can be contrasted with
theory, where variation is often ignored under the assumption
that it is simply noise, despite the fact that theory modified to
include such variation shows it has evolutionary conse- 3, Experiment 1

complement rather than replace existing methods.
