appropriately presented in court (see ยง2(b), below), if those

who make the judicial case decision do not take it on board
correctly, then the entire forensic contribution is distorted, if
not corrupted altogether. The forensic evidence in theory
and in practice can be flawless, but de facto, its contribution
and effect on the legal proceedings (and the judicial system in
general) can be considerably damaged and degraded (if not
made totally inappropriate). This, although indirectly, is a
concern for forensic science.

Cognitive neuroscience has many insights into how humans
function as trier of fact, and can (and should) be used to improve
these processes [5]. For example, understanding human
memory and cognitive load gives insights into what forms of
information are well encoded, well remembered and well
used. For instance, the primacy and recency effects demonstrate
how order and sequencing of information influences what actu-
ally is most remembered [6], as do anchoring effects [7]. Other
examples would be how judicial case decisions on length of sen-
tencing are affected by whether crime photos are in black and
white or in colour [8], and how attractiveness of suspects also
influences judicial decisions [9,10].

Such examples well illustrate that an understanding of
