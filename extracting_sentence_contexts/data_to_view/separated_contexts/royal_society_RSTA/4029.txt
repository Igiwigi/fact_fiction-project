The answer probably lies in both the kinetic and thermodynamic
properties of BslA interfacial adsorption. We have previously shown [30] that BslA has to
overcome an energy barrier in order to adsorb to an interface. Combined with the fact that an
air—water interface is less hydrophobic than an oil—-water one, there may not be a sufficient kinetic
window for BslA to adsorb and form a robust and well-organized interfacial layer on the surface
of an air bubble. To reinforce this point, we monitored the relaxation of a BslA film formed on a pendant drop
after compression at an oil—water interface as a function of equilibration time. We observe that
there is a clear dependence between the equilibration time and the robustness of the film (figure 5).
