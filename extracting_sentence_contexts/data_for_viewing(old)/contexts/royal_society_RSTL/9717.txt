the descending series ultimately diverge for all values of » for which they do not
terminate, but the converging terms may be used for the calculation of J*(z); and this
formula was m fact employed by HAnsENn in the calculation of his tables of J*(z)
and J(@)*. If v=p+4, p being an integer, the series terminate and we obtain a
finite expression for J-+4(z).

Replacing the sine and cosine by their exponential values, this formula may be
written

Ta)= ang i(—) "a+ o*B},
