For example, the second
freezing point which we mentioned as occurring at 625° does not represent a state
in which a liquid having the composition Au;)Aljo is in equilibrium with solid. For in
the solidification of this alloy the liquid part of the matter in our crucible has, ever
since the first freezing point at 850°, been getting richer and richer in gold, until
when the freezing point at 625° is reached the matter still liquid is of the composition
AusAl,, or thereabouts. In fact all the freezing points on the horizontal line through
G are points of equilibrium between this same liquid and a certain solid, In an equili-
brium curve as usually drawn all these freezing points would be represented by the
point G. The other lines of second and third freezing points have a similar meaning. ON GOLD-ALUMINTUM ALLOYS.
