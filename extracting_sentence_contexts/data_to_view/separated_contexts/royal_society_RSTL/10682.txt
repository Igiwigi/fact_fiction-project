Hence the
lipochrome present in the enterochlorophyll (in this case) of Ostraea differs from that of
Spongilla and plant chlorophyll in giving only one band, Jt resembles KUANE's
rhodophan or zanthophan, while in Spongilla and in plants the lipochrome is more like
chlorophan.t

On extracting the soap with ether this became a yellow-green colour, and showed
a faint band in red and abrupt absorption of the violent end of the spectrum. * Ti seems highly probable that the individual differences found by me on saponifying enterochloro-
phyll are due simply to the fact that it is present in various stages of formation, presenting a parallel in
this respect to plant chlorophyll. + According to Kituxs, loc. cit., chlorophan gives two bands, rhodophan, a very broad dark sbading,
absorbing the spectram from D onwards towards violet, and recalling to mind tetronerythrin, which 1
am inclined to think it is, and xanthophan one band.
