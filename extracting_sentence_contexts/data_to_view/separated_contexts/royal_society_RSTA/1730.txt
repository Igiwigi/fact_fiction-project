This could be achieved by overlapping
two gas jets of differing pressure or by the presence of an obstacle in the gas jet (although the
latter would result in a shock).

4. Discussion

Here we have shown that two kinetic effects on the Biermann battery become important when the
electron mean free path can no longer be considered small compared to the electron temperature
gradient. This is due to the fact that LTE breaks down in this case and the electron distribution
function is no longer Maxwellian as the transport becomes nonlocal. Firstly there is the direct
effect of the distortion of the distribution function on the electric field, which has been previously


considered [6,7]. The electric field causing the Biermann battery is given by equation (2.3) in
the general case where the distribution function is not Maxwellian.
