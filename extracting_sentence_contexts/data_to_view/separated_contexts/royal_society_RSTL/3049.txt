FARADAY'S EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY, (SERIES X11.) the point 80 near that sonorous brushes passed, then the current of air age
ceased, and the surface of the water became level,

1441. The discharge by a brush is not to all the particles of air that are near the
electrified conductor from which the brush issues; only those parts where the rami-
fications pass are electrified: the air in the central dark parts between them re-
ceives no charge, and, in fact, at the time of discharge, has its electric and induc-
tive tension considerably lowered. For consider fig. 14.
