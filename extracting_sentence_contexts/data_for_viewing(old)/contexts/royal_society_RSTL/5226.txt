220 DR. TYNDALL ON MOLECULAR INFLUENCES.

The body to be examined is reduced to the shape of a cube, and is placed, by means
of a pair of pliers, upon the four supports abcd; theslider $ is then drawn up against
the cube, and the latter becomes firmly clasped between the projections of the piece
of ivory II', on the one side, and those of the slider S, on the other. The chambers
mm' being filled with mercury, the membrane in front of each is pressed gently
against the cube by the interior fluid mass, and in this way perfect contact is secured.
In fact the principle here applied is the same as that made use of by Fourrer# in his
thermometer of contact, although both instruments have nothing else in common.

The problem which requires s0lution is the following :—1t is required to apply a
source of heat of a strictly measurable character, and always readily attainable, to
that face of the cube which is in contact with the membrane at the end of the slider,
and to determine the quantity of this heat which crosses the cube to the opposite
face in a minute of time. For the solution of this problem two things are required :
—ſirst, the source of heat to be applied to the left hand of the face of the cube, and
secondly, a means of measuring the amount which has made its appearance at the
opposite face at the expiration of a minute.

To obtain a source of heat of the nature described the following method was
