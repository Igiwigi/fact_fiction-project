and theoretical work [35], and the most relevant ones for public engagement with climate
change and geoengineering are those that capture ‘self-enhancing’ values and ‘self-transcendent’
values. Self-enhancing values are those that relate to personal achievement, or the accrual of
wealth, power or status to oneself. Self-transcendent values, in contrast, are those that relate
to the promotion of interests beyond oneself—for example, concern for the welfare of others,
the natural environment or an interest in equality. We used four items from the Schwartz [35]
values inventory which measure self-transcending values and four items which measure ‘self-
enhancing’ values to capture these opposing value orientations (see electronic supplementary
material, appendix S1).

When participants had completed all the questions, they read a debriefing screen which
informed them of the purpose of the experiment, explained that they had been subject to a
minor deception (a fictitious website and ‘expert’ quotation), and provided some background
information about the motivation for the study.

The inter-item reliability of each of the multi-item scales in the study was analysed using
Cronbach’s a coefficient. The climate change scepticism score was 0.93 (considered ‘excellent’), the
self-transcendent values score was 0.78 (considered ‘acceptable’) and the self-enhancing values
score was 0.65 (considered ‘marginally acceptable’ [36]). We therefore included all three scales
in subsequent analyses (although the coherence of the self-enhancing values scale was only
‘marginally acceptable’, the extent to which similar scales have been used successfully in previous
work [26] gave us confidence that the items could meaningfully be combined).
