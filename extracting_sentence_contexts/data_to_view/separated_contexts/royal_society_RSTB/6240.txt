But it seems possible that there
are only two sets of canines. And so far as the evidence goes there is no satisfactory
proof of a dental succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars are
not all equally developed suggests that in this later Therocephalian there may be a
dental succession. In the Whaitsidae it is probable that there is a set of molar teeth
that became lost later on and are not replaced. In the only known skull, Lycideops
longiceps, which is certainly immature, there is a series of small molars which will
probably be shed, and possibly not replaced.
