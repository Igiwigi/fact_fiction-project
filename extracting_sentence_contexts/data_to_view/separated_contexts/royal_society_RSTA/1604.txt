In the course of the
experimental study a considerable number of specimens have been examined, all of
which are the manufacture of the British Xylonite Company. The salient features of the material are its great flexibility and toughness, and the
ease with which it can be drilled, turned or machined. By suitable adjustment of
the condition of nitration of the body the hardness of the material can be varied
through a considerable range, but owing to the difficulties created by the stress of
war it has not been possible to make this investigation cover materials possessing a
great range of hardness, and in fact all the specimens taken were originally selected
