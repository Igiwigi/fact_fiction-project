predictions of the steady-state actin distributions (as parametrized by IT) in the cell on 4x 4

posts with alternative properties (i.e. ky = 15 and omax = 1500kPa but all other properties fixed at
their reference values).

for cells plated on arrays of 2 x 2, 3 x 3 and 4 x 4 posts. The observed features
vividly reproduced in the simulations include: (i) concavity of the cell membrane
between the posts; (ii) highest actin concentration near the cell perimeter and
immediately adjacent to the posts on the cell periphery; and (iii) a central region
with a low actin concentration (especially clear for the cells on the 2 x 2 and
3x 3 post arrays). Undoubtedly, there exist some discrepancies between the
observations and predictionsâ€”notably, the curvature of the cells between the
posts is slightly under-predicted by the model. We attribute this to the fact
that many elements of the cytoskeleton such as microtubules and intermediate
filaments are not explicitly modelled and a more refined analysis is required to
increase the fidelity of the predictions.

(iii) Scaling of forces with number of posts

The steady-state average forces (denoted as FX corresponding to the peak
value of Fy.) are plotted in figure 5a as a function of N. The predictions are
in excellent agreement with the measurements of Tan et al. (2003). Two regimes
emerge from the theoretical model: upscaling for NV < 8, where FX, increases with
increasing NV, and downscaling for large N, where Fy, decreases with increasing
N. These two regimes can be rationalized as follows. When the number of posts
