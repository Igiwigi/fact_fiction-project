science*, than to go in search of phenomena, his account of which might be questioned
by those indisposed to admit his leading ideas. If those ideas be correct, they will
be found, he believes, to afford a precision to Physiological doctrines which they have
never before possessed ; and to open out, a vast number of new lines of inquiry, which
promise an ample harvest of results, not only valuable in a scientific view, but likely
to be fertile in applications to various departments of the therapentic art. At any
rate, it is very important that Physiological science should be considered under the
same dynamic aspect, as that under which the Physical sciences are now viewed by
the most enlightened philosophers ; and he trusts that the present attempt may thus
aid in its advancement, even if it shouJd answer no higher purpose.

Supplementary Note.—[Since the foregoing paper was written, the author's atten-
tion has been drawn to the fact, that Mr. NEweorr had been led, in the year 1845—
* by the close relation shown by Dr. Farapay to subsist between light and electri-
city, and by MaTrEvccr between electricity and nervous power, and by the known de-
pendence of most of the functions of the body on the latter,” —© to consider light as
the primary source of all vital and instinctive power, the degrees and variations of
which, he suggested, may, perhaps, be referred to modifications of this influence on
the special organization of each animal body.” (See *Athenzum ” for Dec. 6, 1845.)
These views were embodied in a paper © On the Natural History of Meloe,” presented
to the Linnzan Society, and printed in the 20th volume of its Transactions. But as
the passages in which they had been enunciated were omitted by the desire of the
Council of that Society, no other public record of them exists than that just cited —
Nov. 20, 1850.]
