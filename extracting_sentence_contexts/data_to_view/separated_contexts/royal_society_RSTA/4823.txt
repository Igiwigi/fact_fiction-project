Indeed, the relation found here for quiet
Sun heating, equation (4.8), has the same scaling. In our expression, however, Bis the density of
small-scale flux elements, rather than a vertical magnetic field strength. In point of fact, we tacitly
assume the concentrations have local field strength B. >> B in order that they be distinct entities. Notably, the local field strength does not enter our estimate of heating, since heating is assumed
to occur in the corona rather than within the photospheric concentration. Expression (4.8), and its interpretation, matches the one derived by Longcope &
Kankelborg [26] under the consideration of interacting mixed-polarity magnetic elements.
