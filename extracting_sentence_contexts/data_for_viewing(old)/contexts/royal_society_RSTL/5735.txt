= The tube Y, Experiment 23, was made with a lap-joint, which caused it to deviate
Z a true circle in form, to the extent of nearly a quarter of an inch, the double

F Tisting powers of the tube. According to the results in the Table, there was a loss of

Z The foregoing experiments were instituted for the purpose of ascertaining the resist-
8 ance of tubes to collapse, when the ends were securely fixed to unyielding discs (as is the
S Â©se with the flues of a boiler), and rigidly kept apart to prevent their approaching one

results obtained from tubes of this construction have already been recorded, but
We have yet to ascertain to what extent tubes of the same size and form follow the same
in their resistance to external pressure when their ends are left free to approach
bach other. 'To 8olve this question two tubes were made, similar to those previously
