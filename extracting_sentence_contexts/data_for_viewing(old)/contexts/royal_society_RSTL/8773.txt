much further with the wind than against it, even when the wind was not more than one
foot per second.

But when the sky was clear and there was a heayy dew, the sound could be heard as
far against a light wind as with it, and sometimes much further. On one occasion, when
the wind was very light (about 1 foot per second at 6 feet above the ground) and the
thermometer showed 39 degrees at 1 foot above the grass and 47 ag 8 feet, the sound
was heard at 440 yards against the wind, and 270 yards with it.

Now the nights on which ARaGo made his experiments were clear ; there was a heavy
dew, and the thermometer at Montlh&ry showed that at that elevation the temperature
was 2* F, greater than at Villejuif; 80 that after the experiments just described there is
nothing surprising in the fact that the wind did not produce much effect on the
sound.

A good reason (as I have previously stated) may be given in explanation of these
changes in the effects of the wind. The wind tends to lift the sound proceeding against
it and to bring down that which is travelling with it. 'These effects are greatest near
the earth and diminish as we proceed upwards (for the simple reason that the retarda-
tion of the wind is greater near the surface). The effect of the wind, therefore, will be
to intensify the sound proceeding against it at sufficiently high elevations (this was
found to be the case in my first experiments) and to weaken the sounds proceeding with
it at, points at, 80me height above the surface—that is, when the 'sound which is brought

rough surface is a most effectual barrier to 80und—sound produced close to ono ide of the stack being quite
