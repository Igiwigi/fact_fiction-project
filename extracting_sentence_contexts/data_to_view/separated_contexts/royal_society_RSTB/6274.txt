The upper part of the bone forms a
large part of the wall of the brain-case, and it passes forwards to form the inter-
orbital septum and the wall of the olfactory lobes (what I believe to be the pre-
sphenoid and most others call the sphenethemoid). Very probably if a young Phyto-
saur were examined we should find the pleuro-sphenoid and the pre-sphenoid distinct
bones. The fact that the two elements are fused in the Phytosaurs, and also in the
Embolomerous amphibians seems strongly to support the view that they are ossifica-
tions of the same lateral wall cartilage. In the Therapsids, so far as is known, we only find an ossified pleuro-sphenoid in the
Therocephalians, the Bauriamorphs, and some Gorgonopsians. It apparently never
occurs in Anomodonts or Cynodonts as a bone.
