Figure 4b shows soliton velocity as a function of Qd. Interestingly, the threshold value of
Qd, when the soliton starts to move, depends on IEC, but this dependency is not monotonic. This can be explained by the fact that Ej contributes to both the chain potential and the force
acting on the soliton; whereas Qd contributes only to the force. Another interesting feature of
the velocity dependence on Qd is its non-monotonic character: instead of expected continuous
growth (because increasing Qd corresponds to the rise of the applied force), we observe a slight
