siderably weaker than the muscular current, operating on frogs asphyxiated, killed
with sulphuretted hydrogen, or in the coldest weather. This difference decreases in
proportion to the robustness and vivacity of the frog, 80 that in the spring and
summer, choosing very strong frogs, the signs of intensity and the duration of the
proper current equal and eyen surpass those of the muscular current. 1

I was desirous of again studying the proper current in piles composed either of legs
alone or of half thighs of frogs, or of entire frogs (figs. 5. 7. 8). In general, as I
found before in my former experiments, these three piles produced currents the in-
tensity of which was sensibly alike in all. This coincidence seems at first rather
singular, considering the diversity of the internal resistance of the three piles, and
admitting that the electro-motor element of the proper current resides in the leg alone.
'The experiments which I shall report at the close of this memoir, explain this fact
sufficiently clearly.

Comparing, however, the three above-mentioned piles, composed from frogs which
had been exposed previous]ly to the action of debilitating causes, I have always found
that the signs of the proper current, in the pile composed of the legs alone, somewhat
exceeded those of the other piles.

I would here refer to another experiment, described at page 1:6 of my Treatise,
performed with a pile (fig. 6.) of half frogs, from which the upper half of the thigh
had been taken away. In this pile the proper current is in opposition to the muscular
current, for which reason the current obtained is very weak, and sometimes null. I
have till, however, constantly observed that if the frogs employed for this experiment
