There can be little doubt, however,
hat the vessels which have been termed afferent brachial arteries, those vessels which
Alrain the great brachial plexus and pass up the cirri, have true walls. S This latter fact seems to favour the opinion that the lacunes themselves may have
roper walls, and that all these channels are connected from end to end with the central
grgans by continuity of tissue ; to fayour, in fact, Joann HuNTER's views with regard to
Ahe blood-sinuses in the lower animals. I have failed, however, to discover any such
Fontinuity of tissue demanded by the hypothesis of our great anatomist. If such had
Sany other than a hypothetical existence, it ought, one would think, to be demon-
Strable in the Terebratulida ; for perhaps in no other molluscous animal are the peri-
Apheral blood-channels 80 beautifully displayed, and, from the peculiarity of their arrange-
ment, 80 easily submitted to examination by even the highest powers of the microscope.
