The series of microscopic researches published
by Pratz{ are unique in their kind (vide p. 20). Careful study of this paleeonto-
logical work indicates a certain connection between the observations made by Pratz
on Jurassic and Cretaceous genera and those made on recent corals by v. Kocu and
v. Hemer. But, from the fact that each author had already concluded his own work
before seeing the other's, written contemporaneously, the zoological and the paleon-
tological interests have remained, so to speak, estranged and have mutually missed
all the significance which they might have had. Moreover, v. Kocu and v. Harper
did not agree in the details they gave of the skeletal-forming cell, and the matter
has been somewhat in abeyance. The zoologists who have since published papers
support v. Kocw; hitherto no paleontologist has taken up the question.
