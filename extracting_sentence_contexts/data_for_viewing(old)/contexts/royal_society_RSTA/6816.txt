Invariance of r.m.s. deflexion on adding sources of fluctuation

The form of (19) is instructive. From (19) and (11¢c) one can obtain Ising’s result by
considering, for example, only the random couple, provided that only the mechanical
damping is considered, the electromagnetic damping and the random e.m.f. being ignored.
This arises from the fact that FF and (G?/R2) EE are proportional to x and G2/R respectively,
which is substantially Zernike’s explanation of why his calculations give the same results
as Ising’s. It is worth stressing this point, as it gets at once to the origin of the confusion which
exists on this subject. If one desires a picture of what is happening, EE and FF may be
regarded as measures of the tendency of the corresponding random forces to produce fluc-
tuations in current and deflexion respectively. The form of the numerator of (19) then
indicates, as might be intuitively expected, that the tendencies of the two random forces
to impart mean energy to the coil are indeed additive; but the fact that the total damping
term, which is also additively constructed, appears in the denominator implies that the
resultant mean potential energy stored in the suspension is determined by the ratio of the
total tendency to deflect to the total damping. The tendency of each source of fluctuation
to produce a deflexion is automatically related to the damping that it introduces; the
relation ensures that the mean energy stored in the suspension cannot be changed by adding
