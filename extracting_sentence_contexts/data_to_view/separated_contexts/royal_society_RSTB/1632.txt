For some unaccountable reason there seems to have been started the notion that
the Tadpole’s tail is not a phylogenetic, ancestral organ, but that it owes its existence
to adaptation to the aquatic life of the larva. Certainly the aquatic life keeps the
tail functional and preserves it for some time, but it is present, nevertheless, in the
embryo of Hylodes martinicensis, which undergoes its metamorphosis within the egg. The presence of a chorda dorsalis and spinal cord in the tail of the anurous Amphibia,
and the fact that the tail is constructed exactly like the anterior portion of the axial
column, demonstrate the untenability of the notion mentioned above. The Tadpole’s
tail represents a typical vertebral column before the appearance of cartilage. Strictly
speaking, the tail begins with the first or second postsacral vertebra.
