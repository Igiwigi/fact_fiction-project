It was evident, that in all changes in which acid and alkaline
matter had been present, the acid matter collected in the water
round the positively electrified metallic surface ; and the al-
kaline matter round the negatively electrified metallic surface ;
and. this principle of action appeared immediately related to
one of the first phanomena observed in the VoLTaic pile, the


chemical Agencies of Electricity. 13

decomposition of the muriate of soda attached to the paste-
board; and to many facts which have been since observed on
the separation of the constituent parts of neutrosaline and
metallic-s0lutions; particularly those detailed by M. M. Hi-
SINGER and BERZELIUs.*

The - first experiments that I made immediately with
respect to this subject were- on the decomposition of solid
bodies, insoluble, or difficultly soluble in water. From the
ellects of the electrical agency on glass, I expected that various
earthy compounds would undergo change under similar cir-
cumstances; and the results of the trials were decided and
Satisfactory.
