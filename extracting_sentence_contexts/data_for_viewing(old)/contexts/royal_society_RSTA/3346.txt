The atmospheric pressure Patm is constant along the free surface [35].

In what follows, we will introduce the potential theory formulation of Euler’s equations in
order to formulate a boundary integral equation useful for studying particle trajectories beneath
a Stokes wave travelling along the free surface. We consider Stokes waves which are smooth
solutions to Euler equations. These are nonlinear, periodic travelling wave solutions of spatial
period 4 and speed c. The speed is taken to be positive and, without loss of generality, we study
waves propagating to the right. All dependent variables in the above system of equations are
A-periodic and will be written in terms of the travelling variable (x — ct). The wave profile 7 is
taken to have only one crest and one trough per period. The wave profile decreases from crest to
trough. Moreover, n, u and P are symmetric with respect to the crest, while v is antisymmetric. In
the absence of stagnation points in the flow, the symmetry of the free surface (visible in all figures
presented in the paper) is guaranteed by the fact that the wave profile is monotonic between crests
and troughs. For irrotational waves the reader will find details in the book by Okamoto & Shoji
[36], while for rotational waves, details are in the article by Constantin et al. [37].

We take the undisturbed water level to be at y=0 in such a way that the mean-zero (wave
elevation) condition

is satisfied.

We now recast the Euler equations in terms of potential theory. Let ¢(x,y,t) be the velocity
