Fr=1), nmax is unbounded due to lack of damping (e.g. friction) and a resonance condition
exists. This is defined as the Proudman resonance [13]. However, in reality, due to friction and
topographic effects, the ratio |nmax/ns|, defined as the resonant factor ¢ [8], is limited and has been
observed and predicted to reach a maximum value of 5 [35,47,61]. Typical speeds of atmospheric
disturbances are 20-40 ms~!, which correspond to shallow water wave speeds in water depths of
between 40 and 160m.
When Fr < 1, corresponding to deep water waves (U < c), equation (2.2) yields [51]:

i.e. the surface water displacement is equivalent to the stationary case of the inverted barometric
factor (1hPa~+1cm). For Fr >1, (U>¢c), a relatively higher speed of the atmospheric
disturbance yields n ~0 [20]. This is due to the fact that the time interval for energy transfer
from the propagating pressure disturbance is insufficient for an ocean response [60]. However,
in the case where Fr > 1, defined as a supercritical storm, a wake similar to that behind a
high-speed marine vessel is generated, resulting in meteotsunamis [62]. Another feature of the
Proudman resonance is that when Fr <1 atmospheric pressure and water displacement are out
of phase with an elevation above mean level, while when Fr < 1 they are in phase when the wave
is a depression.
For the case when Fr ~ 1, where the atmospheric propagation is across a shelf with gradually
varying water depth, Hibiya & Kajiura [47] derived the sea surface displacement as
n_ 1X

where W is the width of the air pressure disturbance and X; is the distance travelled by the
pressure disturbance across the shelf (‘fetch’). Therefore, the fetch or duration of the disturbance
