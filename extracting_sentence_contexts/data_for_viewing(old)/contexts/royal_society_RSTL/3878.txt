spinal vessel becomes very much smaller, and about midway between the second and
third abdominal ganglia sends off a pair of smaller branches, which are given in like
manner to the posterior part of the same branchiz. It then continues its course as
a very minute trunk to the third ganglion. At this point the direction of the lateral
vessels given off from it is altered (fig. 33.7. 1). Instead of passing laterally backwards
they are now directed outwards and forwards, to distribute the blood to the anterior
part of the fourth pair of branchize. This altered direction of the vessels is necessary
in order to convey inwards to the hody the blood that is passing forwards along the
subspinal vessel in the tail to be acrated in the posterior branchiz of the abdomen
before it is again transmitted to the heart. That this is the case is proved by the
fact, that a single median trunk (7. 2.) is given off from the under surface of the sub-
Spinal vessel beneath the ganglion in the first caudal segment. This trunk is directed
forwards into the seventh or terminal segment of the abdomen, lying loosely like
those which are directed backwards in the anterior segments. When opposite to the
posterior part of the fourth pair of abdominal branchize it is dilated and divided into
two branches, which together form a dilatation like the anterior ones before they are
directed outwards and are joined by other venous trunks and distributed over the
branchize. This is the mode of distribution of these vessels in the great Scorpion,
Buthus afer, Lzacn, but a slight variation is found in some other species. Thus in
the specimen formerly* examined, Buthus costimanus, Roc, or a species nearly allied
to it, instead of a pair of branches given off from the subspinal yessel midway between
the second and third abdominal ganglia, I found an azygos vessel given off beneath
the latter, and which having passed forwards, midway between these ganglia, was then
