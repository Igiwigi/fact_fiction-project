sure will, however, not be uniform in the region of contact but will be at a maximum
at the centre of this region and will fall off towards the perimeter. It is reasonable to
suppose that under a sufficiently high pressure the lubricant film can be broken
down, allowing the metal surfaces to come into contact and weld together. Only a
portion of the lubricant film in the region of contact (the most compressed portion)
will be broken down and the extent of breakdown and subsequent seizure will vary
for different lubricants. The formation of these metallic joints will greatly increase
the resistance to motion, and the extent to which breakdown of the film occurs will
therefore largely determine the nature and magnitude of the frictional force necessary
to maintain sliding. Differences in the nature of the sliding would therefore be expected
for different lubricants and it has been shown earlier in this paper that such differences
do in fact exist. Similarly the amount of tearing that occurs between the surfaces
will largely depend on the extent to which the lubricant film has broken down during
sliding, and as has already been mentioned, marked differences are observed in the
appearance of the track for different lubricants. According to this view the frictional
behaviour and the wear between the lubricated surfaces are largely determined by
the ability of the lubricant film to prevent metallic contact.

Further experiments with different combinations of metals should afford confirma-
tion of this theory. The more plastic the metals, the smaller will be the pressures in the
region of contact and hence the less the extent of breakdown of the lubricant film. The
position is complicated by the fact that the strength of the adsorbed film will vary for
different metals, and also by the fact that at the points where the film breaks down
three distinct types of metallic junction may occur, depending on the nature of the
