The least-square method (dashed blue line), on the other hand, recovered
the phase sensitivity function faithfully for a small impulse strength in (b). The estimate is,
however, deviated from the other two curves for a large impulse strength in (c). In fact, as the
impulse strength is increased, the estimation error increases much more rapidly in the least-
squares method (dashed blue line) than the multiple shooting method (solid red line) (figure 3d). The least-squares method [43,46] assumes that phase of the oscillator evolves linearly in time
according to the natural frequency. This approximation is effective as far as the external force is
weak.
