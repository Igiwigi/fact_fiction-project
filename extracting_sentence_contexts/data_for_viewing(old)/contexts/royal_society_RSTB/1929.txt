There was no clear evidence of the passage of degenerated fibres dorsally through
the tegment to the region of the third nerve nucleus; and although there was no
certain evidence of degeneration in the posterior longitudinal bundles, scattered
black dots were usually observed in these tracts.

2. In those cases in which the frontal lobe was extirpated anterior to the pre-central
frontal sulcus, a much more extensive degeneration existed in the pes cruris, for not
only was there degeneration of the most mesial fibres, as already described, but also
of a considerable number of those lying external to them. This was also noted in
the pyramidal fibres of the pons.

Our experiments do not throw any new light upon the destination or the function
of the efferent frontal fibres. From the fact that the tract diminishes in size as it is
traced downwards into the mid-brain, it is evident that fibres are being given off
along its course; but we have been unable to confirm the observations of Marinesco
(38), who found degeneration in the nucleus caudatus, by MArcurâ€™s method, after
extirpation of the frontal lobes in monkeys. Some of the fibres of the pre-frontal
system were traced into the substantia nigra, where they terminate; an observation
which is confirmatory of those of BecHTEREw (12) and Wirkowsk1 (42), who found
degeneration and atrophy of this structure in several cases of old-standing lesion of
the anterior limb of the internal capsule. The remainder of the fibres of this system
pass into the tegmentum pontis, where they terminate probably in relation with the
seattered ganglionic cell-groups of this region.
