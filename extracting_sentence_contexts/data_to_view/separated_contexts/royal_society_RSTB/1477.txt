the mean numbers only vary from 5120 to 9520 larve per litre, any error from
his source would be too slight to produce the effect noticed. Again, as the arm
engths are all percentages on the body lengths, and as the body lengths tend to
with increase of temperature, it might be possible that the arm lengths,
lot being affected by the temperature to the same degree, should apparently increase

length on rise of temperature. The fact that the larve developed at 20° to 22°,
thich have considerably greater arm lengths than those developed at 18° to 20°,
ve also a slightly greater body length, proves that this is not the case. This
fact proves that the relative maturity of the ova and spermatozoa can account
t in small part for this increased arm length at higher temperatures. Thus, the
body length may be taken as an approximate index of the maturity, and, though

the period of least body length corresponds with that of the highest temperat
during development, yet, as we have just noticed, the inverse relation between.
