has also remarked; Gonp has used the law sin’ @, which fits the observations very
closely. Scuusrer adopted the law sin? 6 (or Q,*), which represents the facts
moderately well, though distinctly less well than sin’ @. ScHmrpt’s expression was

(29) (0°31 Q,.2—0°082 Q,”) sin (2¢+ 154°).
The seasonal variation of amplitude has been represented by ANGor by the formula
(80) cos? d/d?,

where 6 is the sun’s declination and d its distance. Its magnitude is well illustrated
by the following results of an analysis of the Batavian barometric observations for
the period 1866 to 1905 :—

Spring (February to April) . . . 1°026 sin (2¢+156°'0),
Autumn (August to October) . . 1'022 sin (2¢+168°°9),
