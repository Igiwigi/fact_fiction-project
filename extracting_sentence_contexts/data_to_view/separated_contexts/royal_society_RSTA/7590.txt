the set of points A (0,) thus defined is filling
~upa region. Because of this A (6’,) will be
© called the region of acceptance corresponding
Eto the fixed value of 0, = 0’.
o> It may not seem obvious that the region of
‘acceptance A (6,) as defined above must exist
‘5 (contain points) for any value of 0,. In fact,
it may seem possible that for certain values of
-2 6, the hyperplane G (6,) may not cut any of
Sthe intervals  (E). It will, however, be seen
Sbelow that this is impossible.

= As mentioned above, the coordinates %,, x,
2x,...%, of any sample point E determine in Fic. 1—The general space G.

= the space G the straight line L (E) parallel to .

£ the axis of 0,. If this line crosses the hyperplane G (6,) in a point belonging to

EA (0,) it will be convenient to say that E falls within A (0,). :

If for a given sample point E the lower and the upper estimates satisfy the

S inequalities 0(E)= 0,5 6 (E), where 0’, is any value of 0,, then it will be con-
venient to describe the situation by saying that the confidence interval 5 (E) covers

G6’,.
