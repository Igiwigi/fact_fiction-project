In this Annelid, therefore, as in the Leech, the fluid contained in the digestive $ac-
culi is the true equivalent of the chylaqueous fluid of the peritoneal cavity of other
Species. In the Leech this latter cavity is almost obliterated, in Aphrodita it is
spacious and occupied by a fluid, colourless and limpid as water. Moreover, in
Aphrodita, the peritoneal cavity is distinguished from that of air other Annelids by
the fact that it is lined by vibratile epithelium, in which respect it is allied to the
Echinoderms. The fluid which fills the digestive cazca in Aphrodita contains no
determinately organized solid bodies, another respect in which it resembles that of
the diverticula of the stomach of the Starfish. The blood-proper in this aberrant
Annelid is perfectly fluid, devoid, that is, of all morphotic elements, and yellowish in
colour.
