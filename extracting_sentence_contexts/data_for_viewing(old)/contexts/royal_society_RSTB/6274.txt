theca externa forms a thin connective tissue coat around the whole follicle. There
is a thin but clearly defined connective tissue membrana propria between the theca
interna and the membrana granulosa.

e. The follicle during pregnancy

The number of follicles 160 p. in diameter and over, which presumably corresponds
with the number with antra, present in the ovaries during pregnancy varies from
8 to 59, the mean number being 25. There does not appear to be any significant
change in their number during pregnancy. This fact is brought out in fig. 7, in
which the number of follicles is plotted, the pregnancies being arranged in order

Pregnancies arranged in order

Fic. 7â€”Graphical representation of the number of follicles with antra (160 y in diameter and larger)
present in each pregnant animal according to stage of pregnancy. The successive stages of
pregnancy are arranged in order on the abscissa beginning with fertilization at the origin and
ending with approximately full-term on the right. A = stage of passage of ova from tube to
uterus. B = stage of implantation of embryos
