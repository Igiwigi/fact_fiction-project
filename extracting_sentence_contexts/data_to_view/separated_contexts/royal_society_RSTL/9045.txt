Such excitable tracts are by no means
constant as to their position in different individuals ; but the fact of their occurrence
tends to show that the reflex action we are contemplating is effected, not by means of
an equally diffused excitability on the part of the whole nervo-muscular sheet, but by
means of functionally differentiated tissue-tracts, which, during the experiment, act as
afferent nerves. (c) Next I must draw attention to a fact which will presently be proved of the highest
importance in relation to the subject we are considering. It may be remembered, from
Plate 32 in my former paper, that the entire margin of Aurelia aurita is fringed by
a number of exceedingly delicate tentacles. These tentacles are highly retractile ;
and the point to which I have now to direct attention is this, that when any portion

of the irritable surface of Aurelia is stimulated Zoo gently to start a contractile wave, it
may neyertheless be sometimes observed that those tentacles which are nearest to the
seat of stimulation respond with a sudden contraction, then those next adjacent to them
on either side do the same, and 80 onâ€”there being thus started in the margin two im- -
pulses which travel with equal rapidity in opposite directions, and the passage of which
is marked by the 8uccessive and intensely sudden retraction of the numberless tentacles
by which the margin is fringed.
