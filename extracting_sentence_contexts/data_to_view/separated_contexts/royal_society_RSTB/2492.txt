Of less interest in this connection is a
monostelic genus Heterangium, which has secondary wood but no pith,

One of the most important genera of the Cycadofilices is Medullosa. In this genus
the fibro-vascular system is polystelic, 7.¢., made up of a number of anastomosing
concentric strands. It differs strikingly from the ferns, however, in the fact that its
“‘steles” are surrounded with secondary wood, and the primary wood is often largely
abortive, being replaced by parenchyma and constituting the so-called partial piths. The concentric strands have a varying configuration. The external ones which, on
the basis of the stelar development of the Ferns and polystelic Angiosperms we may
probably regard as primitive, often form continuous zones, while the medullary
bundles are star-shaped.
