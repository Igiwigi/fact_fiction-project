The ingot is undeniably a uniform solid solution. We have no other chills of Sn 15. The fact that in this group of alloys all the primary « is absorbed at 790°, and that
only at lower temperatures does « again crystallise, accounts for the singularly
disjointed appearance of the combs seen in the unchilled alloys. The photograph of
Sn 12, published in our paper in the ‘ Proceedings,’ vol. 68, shows this peculiarity,
but in slowly cooled ingots of Sn 14 it is much more marked. For in Sn 12 a little
of the primary « has persisted, and so decided the orientation of the new «, while in
Sn 14 there were no such nuclei, and the character of the primary « combs is not in
the least reproduced in the later crystallisation.
