But on the other hand, it is a now generally accepted
fact that whereas the ovarian changes characterising the early development of the
corpus luteum are the same, whether or not the discharged ovum is to become
fertilised (in other words, that the so-called corpora lutea vera and spuria are by
origin identical structures), yet the later changes depend upon the occurrence or non-
occurrence of pregnancy. In this sense the further development or degeneration of
the corpus luteum may be said to be determined by the state of the uterus. From these and similar facts it may be inferred that the functions of ovulation and
cestrus do not stand to one another respectively either in the relation of cause to

* The questions concerning the ovary generally as an organ of internal secretion, and its possible
