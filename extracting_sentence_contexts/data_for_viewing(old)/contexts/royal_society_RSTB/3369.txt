Thus he shows a possible way in which the calcium carbonate and the iron
sulphide might have been deposited round the plant tissues which they served
to preserve. It will be noticed that for the carbonate of lime the soluble sulphate is
demanded.

We have shown throughout this paper that it is just in those beds in which we
get the evidence of marine conditions above the coal, presupposing the presence of
sea water, that we find the mineralised “ coal balls” in the seam.

We may adapt the process suggested by the “Challenger” Reports and Stocks’
work, making the changes required to bring it into harmony with the facts our series
of analyses have revealed. From them we see that the part played by iron pyrites
is not so great as was supposed by Stocks, and that it may even be almost absent, as
in Analyses Nos. I, II, and TV in our Table I. Further, that magnesium carbonate
commonly occurs in considerable quantity in the “coal balls,” and may often be
present with calcium carbonate in the proportions of dolomite,* or in the form of a
mixture of dolomite and calcium carbonate.

We may represent the process of reduction and deposition of the sulphates very
erudely as follows :—

CaSO,+MgSO,+4C = 4C0,-4+CaS-+ MgS,
MgS+CaS+4CO,+42H,0 = 2H,S+CaCO,.CO,+MgCO,.CO,,
