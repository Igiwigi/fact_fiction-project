Resulting /T-area isotherms are shown in figure 7a for
several different equilibration times. We found that, for increasing equilibration times, the change
in 7 occurs at larger and larger areas. This is due to the fact that BslA, while applied directly to the
interface, is soluble in water and some of the protein will be lost to the subphase upon application. The larger areas at which the change in /7 occurs are simply caused by the protein that was
initially lost to the bulk during application diffusing back to the interface. This is one reason why
trying to obtain a mean molecular area measurement for a soluble surfactant is not reliable.
