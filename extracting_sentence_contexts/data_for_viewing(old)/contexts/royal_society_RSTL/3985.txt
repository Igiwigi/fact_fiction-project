and an imperceptible stationary deviation. Making a fresh section of the muscle
and recomposing the pile, the result was the same. And in this case, likewise, the
conductibility was not changed ; consequently the alkaline or acid solutions act as I
had before found water act at a high temperature. I will here repeat an experiment
which I wade, merely to show its accordance with those related above. Sixteen half
thighs of frogs were immersed for a few seconds in water at about 50? C. On taking
these elements out of the warm water and bathing them with cold water, I constructed
a pile, closed the circuit, and had a first deflection of 12 in the direction of the mus-
cular current, and the needle stopped at 0%. After having renewed the internal
surface of the muscle by making a fresh section, I recomposed the pile, and the signs
of the current were the same as before. And also in this case I assured myself of the
fact, that the conductibility had not been sensibly changed by the action of the hot
water. I will add, moreover, that it is not to the repeated washing in pure water at
the ordinary temperature, that the diminution in the intensity of the muscular current
is to be attributed. I have very frequently seen the same deflection slightly varying
in intensity, produced by a pile of a given number of elements, or half thighs, some-
times washed in pare water, at others not washed at all. Eyen a solution of chloride
of sodium highly concentrated, is capable of diminishing considerably the signs of
the current produced by a pile of which the elements have been immersed for some
seconds. Thus, whilst sixteen common elements produce a first deflection which
mounts to 90*Â®, and remains fixed at from 20? to 22?, if these elements be left for a
few seconds in the saturated solntion of the sal marinus and then taken out, the first
deflection is about, 60*, and the needle becomes stationary at between 8? and 109.
