(6) Total numbers in a non-breeding season should be obtainable from a modification
of the ‘Lincoln index’ (Lincoln 1930); but unfortunately it was only from February on-
wards that the whole population seemed finally to be at risk to the traps (p. 527). Direct
estimates of the February population, corrected for bias by the method of Chapman (1951)

CRS 58+1 28+1 5+1

sia distal Sara US? 2-1

| 142, 125, 164.

These estimates will be high if in fact some dilution was still occurring, but we may check
this by using two of Jackson’s methods which allow for it. Assuming mortality independent
of age (which was probably true by February)

81x83 134741
24 33+18+2

N 111.

We may also use Jackson’s ‘re-recapture’ method which does not make this assumption.
Instead, the following relationship is assumed:

marked animals recaptured ___ total catch
