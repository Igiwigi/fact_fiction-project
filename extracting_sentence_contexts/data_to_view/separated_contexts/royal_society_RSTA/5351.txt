To give different points of view and balance to my ‘academic’ judgements, I give the two
views from engineering consultants. The first is from Eilif Svensson (ES-Consult, Denmark)

who spent some time with us in the UCL stability group in 1971, and writes in a personal : =

Advanced programmes contain hidden assumptions (and semi-hidden in mediocre :s
manuals). Apart from this the user himself has to decide on important assumptions such i=

as boundary conditions—a fact that even the best programme package cannot compensate :3

for through complexity (a great number of degrees of freedom) offering a perception of 8
correctness. In that case the users own simpler, carefully drafted, model may yield better :8
results. Another issue which annoys me from time to time is the unreflecting acceptance of : &

codified provisions.
