Whometimes, however, the orange band was strong where the citron band was almost or
quite absent. It is almost certainly one of the earthy metals, as it occurs in the

Finaolublo oxalates, in the insoluble double sulphates, and in the precipitate with
Zammonia, It is not precipitated by sodic thiosulphate, and, moreover, ib must be
