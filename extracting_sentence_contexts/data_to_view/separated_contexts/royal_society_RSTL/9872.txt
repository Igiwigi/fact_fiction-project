The difference in 8ize between the thymic corpuscles and the coloured blood cor-
puscles is seen to be very great in some classes of Vertebrates, and we have no reason
to believe that the one are ever immediately transformed into the other (se Plate 92,
figs. 72, 73, 74, and 75, be and The). x

There is one fact which presents considerable difficultiesâ€”.. e., that the blood of the
foetus and of the newly-born animal contains a considerably larger proportion of coloured
to colourless blood corpuscles than is the case in the blood of adults. This was first
noticed by Dxx1s (95), and then by Paxum (96), and yet the thymus is certainly more
active during foetal life and during the first years of growth than it can be during adult
life, when it is composed in a great measure of connective-tissue.
