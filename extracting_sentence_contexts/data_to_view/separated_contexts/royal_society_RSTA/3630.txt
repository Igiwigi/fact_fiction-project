Coleridge and Murdoch, Davison [38] proposes that scientific facts about climate change are
received through acts of either imagination or fantasy and that subsequent actions depend on
these perceptions. Murdoch writes ‘The world which we confront is not just a world of “facts”
but a world upon which our imagination has already worked.’ An imaginative act demonstrates
a willingness to change one’s image of the world through what one encounters and is required
to step out of the cycle of ever accelerating production. By contrast, an act of fantasy involves a
closing in and a projection of the world as one wishes it were—the outlook attributed to climate
scepticism/denial and techno-optimism about supply-side solutions. Figure 4 provides an illustration of this distinction between imagination and fantasy.
