Ifa supersonic region is extended far enough, any Mach line that is not a branch line
must meet a limit line. For simple waves this is a well-known result (Shepherdson 1946, 1947; Courant &
Friedrichs 1948). That it is true in general follows from the fact that any Mach line that is
not cusped, and not a branch line, must have a limit point of its family if the Mach line
extends over a sufficient distance, by virtue of (30) and of the corresponding equation for
hg, since F(a, Â«), G(o,2), N, and sin 2u are all positive. It may, of course, be possible to
consider only a portion of the supersonic field (supposed bounded, at any rate in part,

* In that case h, is discontinuous, since a simple wave is flanked by regions of uniform flow; the centre is an
isolated limit point of the first order (cf.
