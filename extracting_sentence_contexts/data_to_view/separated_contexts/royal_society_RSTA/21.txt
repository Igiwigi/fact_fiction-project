In order to obtain clusters of practical relevance, the kernel f(-|@, 7) should be carefully selected
to reflect the shape and properties of a cluster for the application at hand. A standard choice is
the multivariate Gaussian distribution, f(-|0, ~) = N(- | 4j, 4j). In fact, the widely used k-means
algorithm can be seen as a limiting case of the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture models, where
the kernel is N(- | Mj, 071) [40,41]. This highlights that k-means imposes restrictive cluster shapes,
specifically, all clusters have the same spherical shape of equal size in all dimensions, with only
the centres j4; allowed to differ across clusters. More generally, Gaussian mixture models relax
this assumption by allowing different ellipsoidal shapes and sizes across clusters.
