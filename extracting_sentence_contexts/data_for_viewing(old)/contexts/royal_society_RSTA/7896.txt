The disparity between H and H, is then due to the presence of the boundary walls,
and of the oscillating wake.

Since the boundary walls were the same distance apart when either cylinder was
in the tank, their distance from the cylinder in non-dimensional units was not the
same for each. The conditions of flow then were neither strictly identical nor identical
with the conditions of flow in an infinite fluid; e.g., on a line y= 1-5 there were
differences in the value of v determined with each cylinder of 0-005. Now H, is a
harmonic function tending to zero at infinity whereas H becomes very small at the
outer boundary of the fluid. It will be seen then that the rate of decrease outward of
H, is less than that of H, a fact which is clearly apparent in fig. 10, in the inset along
a= -+ 3-0.

As the wake was oscillating the region behind « = — 3-0 was neglected in the present
work owing to the difficulty of timing the photography so as to obtain a set of photo-
graphs of the wake at any one phase of oscillation. Now the functions X and Y in
the equation ;
