Taylor et al. [31] suggests that different numerical methods are better suited to either the NT or
the FT regimes, not both. We also note that, in our results, it seems that the transition between the
two regimes is not clear-cut.

It is interesting to note that the scaling of the wavenumber with 1, ie. m~1Â°/*, has already
been suggested in two previous works [17,18]. Vella et al. [17] used a scaling argument along

12


the lines of [15] to explain the wrinkle number observed at onset (the NT behaviour). Such an
argument should only be used to determine the FT behaviour, however; the apparently good
agreement between the two is, we believe, an accident of the fact that the wrinkle number
at onset only reaches the expected 17/9 scaling when t S> 1 while, for the values investigated
previously [17], the NT behaviour was still transitioning between the t <1 and 1 > 1 regimes.
A later consideration of the global energy consistent with the FT approach was given by Vella
et al. [18]. This result predicted some variation in wrinkle wavenumber with indentation depth
(though did not observe such variation), but did not take into account the spatial variation of
the wrinkle pattern. As we have seen in this work, the radial variation means that there are no
simple scalings for the evolution of the wrinkle pattern with applied indentation: one can see that
the wrinkle number increases or decreases with indentation depth depending on whether one
remains at fixed radial position, or moves with the edge of the wrinkled zone.
