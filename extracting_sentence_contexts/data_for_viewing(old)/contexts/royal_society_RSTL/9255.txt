E by the circumferential distance from the end of the cut at which the stimulus is applied,
= and also by the radial distance between the cut and the point of stimulation. For
S instance, in figure 1 suppose a cut AB, + of an inch long, to be made pretty close to
© the margin and concentric with it, then a stimulus applied at the point ©, just below
= the middle point of A B, would have the effect of making the polypite move about
& to yarious parts of the bell, without being able in the least degree to localize the
= eat of irritation. But if the stimulus be applied at d, the polypite will probably
= be s0 far able to localize the seat of irritation as to confine its movements, in its search
5 for the offending body, to perhaps the quadrant of the bell in which the stimulation
.2 is being applied. If the stimulation be now applied at e, the localization on the part
2 of the polypite will be still more accurate; and if applied at f (that is, almost beneath
S one end of the cut AB) the polypite may succeed in localizing quite correctly.
= These facts may also be well brought out by another mode of section, which is
2 dexcribed in my former paper as © cutting round a greater or less extent of the mar-
= ginal tisue, leaving one end of the resulting strip free, and the other end attached
in s8itu.” If this form of section be practised on Tiaropsis indicans, as represented at,
= 9, k in the figure, it may always be observed that irritation of a distant point in the mar-
 ginalstrip, such as g or h, causes the polypite to move in various directions, without any
© gpecial reference to that part of the bell which the irritated point of the marginal strip
S would occupy if in 8itu, But if the stimulation be applied only one or two millims.
Q Atfrom the point of attachment of the marginal strip, as at 7, the polypite will confine its
localizing motions to perhaps the proper quadrant of the bell; and if the stimulus be
applied $till nearer to the attachment of the severed strip, as at j, the localizing
motions of the polypite may become quite accurate.
