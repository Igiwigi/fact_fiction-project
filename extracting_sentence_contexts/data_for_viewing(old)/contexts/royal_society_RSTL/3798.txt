84. The filaments in plants have often appeared to me to be 80 placed, that, by
alternate contraction and relaxation, they might influence the contents of cells. And
surely the structure of these filaments is snflicient to induce the belief, that they per-
form an important office in the circulation, including the elevation of the sap. An
office of this kind may perhaps belong to spirals in the roots, and elsewhere, snch as
those in figs. 87 to 90; exhibiting, as some of these do, almost transverse striz, like
those of voluntary muscle in animals.

85. A structure presenting the same appearance as that of the essential part of
muscle, being found to pervyade, it may be said, all other tissnes, it is evident that
this structure alone does not account for the contractile property of musecle. To
what then is the contractile property of muscle owing ? This inquiry my observations
do not enable me to answer. It is the duty of an investigator to record the facts he

meets with ; difficult as they may be to account for, or eyen paradoxical as at times
they may appear.

86. It seems probable, however, that to the spiral structure of the filament (< fibre”),
we may attribute the elastic and resilient qualities of certain parts; such as elastic
tissue, and cellular tissne, as existing in and under the cutis, and in the parenchyma
of the lungs; the latter being intimately connected with the question, whether the
lungs are resilient in expiration.
