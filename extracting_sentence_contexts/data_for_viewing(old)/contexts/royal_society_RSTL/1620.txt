the time of HiryaRcnvs, who lived in the second century
before our Saviour, (vide WEIDLER1 Hist. As!ron. p. g1g9; et
Tycnroxis BrRaneg Mechanica) and was continued to be used
by astronomers for upwards of fifteen centuries afterwards.
(2.) The next account that occurs is by J. MULLER, RE-
GIOMONTANUS, sive Joannes de Monte Regio, who flou-
rished about A. D. 1460, and, in a posthumous treatise ex-
pressly on this subject, intitled Scripta clarissimi Mathema-
ti M. Joaxnnis REciomMonTANi de Torqueto, Astrolabio
armillari, Reguld magnd Ptolemaicd, Baculoque Astronomico,
&c. &c, in quarto, printed at Nuremberg in 1544, has
given a pretty full account, not only of the armillary as-
trolabe, but also of the torquetum, which in fact was no-
thing more than a portable equatorial, and may be consi-
dered as the first instrument truly of this kind. As this trea-
tise is become extremely scarce, and I know of only one
copy in this kingdom, I take this opportunity of apprizing
the curious, that it is to be met with in the Britich Museum.
A $hort description, however, of the torquetum, with a plate
of the instrument, will be found in Mons, BAaiLLY's Astro-



of the Equatorial Instrument. 69
