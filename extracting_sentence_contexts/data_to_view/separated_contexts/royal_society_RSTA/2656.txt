There are two ways to increase the muon number for each quasi-beam, one is to increase : S
the angular and spatial bin sizes, and the other is to increase the data collection time. Increasing a]
the bin sizes has a negative effect on the image spatial resolution. On the other hand, due to : <
the fact that the cosmic ray muon rate is relatively low, to gather enough muons to reconstruct : >
a high resolution image is time-consuming. Furthermore, the assumption of a straight muon io
beam path by the quasi-beam worsens the image spatial resolution even further, because the 18
actual muon paths inside the matter are most likely to be curved due to the multiple scattering : s
effect. Therefore, for applications that require a high spatial resolution, an image reconstruction 18

algorithm not relying on an explicit muon beam is required.
