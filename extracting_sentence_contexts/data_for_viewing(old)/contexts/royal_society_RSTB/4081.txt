S hydropore, while pouch II is slightly behind this opening. Pouches III and IV
PA project backwards from the posterior convexity of the crescent, while V continues

a later than these. For stone canal, see p. 256.

3g Although the left posterior cwlom is cut off behind the hydroceele, since the crescent of the latter
g follows the curvature of the alimentary canal from cesophagus to anus, it is reasonable to look on the
q hydrocele pouches, in spite of their slightly different times of formation, as forming a series in which
A pouch I is morphologically the most anterior and pouch V the most posterior. MErTscHNIKOFF (63, p. 34)

long ago called attention to the fact that the true posterior end of the larva is at the anal opening, since
the latter is the ventrally shifted blastopore. Bury (8, p. 431) has also expressed the view that the most
anterior of the hydrocele pouches are those between which the hydropore and the stone canal come to lie.

Dorsal Horn of l.p.c.â€”Meantime the l.p.c. has been extending in other directions,
and in particular it has grown out dorsally and to the right in the form of a process
well known in Asterid development as the dorsal horn of the /.p.c. (Plates 18, 19,
figs. 8,10). This horn never acquires a communication with the right middle or
right posterior cceloms. However, during the later larval stages it comes to open
