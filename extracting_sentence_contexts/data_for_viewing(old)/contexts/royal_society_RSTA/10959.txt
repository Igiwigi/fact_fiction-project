the brightest part measured in the scale of reciprocal wave-length.

Summation for all Molecules having Definite Velocities both Athwart and in Line
of Sight.

§ 42. For these we have a definite position « of maximum brightness, and definite
resultant velocity v. We have to integrate for the different lengths of train.

Now Tarr* has shown that, of all atoms moving with velocity v, a fraction e~*
penetrates unchecked to distance p, where

We may write this function of v as follows :—
