Sand for the canonical form a*+#*+2*+67xyz, they acquire respectively, not indeed
(1+8”), but the simple power (1+8P), as a factor, viz. in this case
CU =(1+8P){ (—1+4P)(w+3*+2)+ — 18tays}
DU=(1+8P){F(_ 5+4P)(a%+-* +2) +3(1—10P)zy2} ;
it was in fact by means of this condition as to the factor (1+8P), that the foregoing
_expressions for CU, DU were obtained *.

* M. AroxnouD, in a letter dated Berlin, 17 June 1861, has pointed out to me that the covariants
CU, DU are in his notation Ps,, Or, and that they belong to the forms called Conjugate Forms, $ 27 of
his memoir. But the explicit development of the properties of these covariants is not on this account the
less interesting. Added 20 Sept. 1861.—A. C.
