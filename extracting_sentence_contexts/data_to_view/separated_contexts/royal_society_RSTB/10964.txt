Indeed, the regions
that were activated during the recognition of Arabic numerals
in all subjects were expanded in professional mathematicians
and became responsive to abstract expression such as integrals
or differential equations. The findings are compatible with the
idea that high-level mathematics ‘recycles’ brain areas involved
in simpler concepts such as number or space [13].

(b) Control studies
In two further studies, we sought to replicate the observed
dissociation between mathematical and general semantic pro-
cessing, and to probe the nature of the boundary between
language and mathematical processes [14]. In a first control experiment, similar to experiment 1, we
probed the influence of semantic content on the math/

Figure 1. A reproducible dissociation between mathematical and general semantic knowledge. The figure shows brain activity in professional mathematicians evoked by
(a) complex mathematical and general semantic statements [8], (b) simpler facts asking for an immediate response and (c) elementary declarative, negative and quantified
statements. (Left) Brain maps showing areas of greater activation during reflection on mathematical statements versus non-mathematical statements (blue) or vice versa
(green). (Right) Average fMRI signal in representative math-telated areas.
