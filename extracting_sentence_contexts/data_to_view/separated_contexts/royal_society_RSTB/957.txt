IIl.—-Acrion or Amy Nirrire on THE Buoop Pressure. Descriprioy or
Metuop oF INVESTIGATION. The large amount of attention which has been bestowed on the action of nitrite
amyl during the last thirty years, has established certain facts regarding it which
recognised on all hands; but it has left us in considerable doubt as to the oceurre
of other phenomena which are described by some investigators, but questioned |
others. The explanation of even the most evident nitrite effect, viz., the fall
blood pressure, is still disputed. ; The principle observed in the experiments, which it seemed advisable to make,
order to obtain further information on the action of nitrates, has been to carefi
analyse and contrast the effect produced by exactly measured quantities of the pu
bodies upon the whole organism, or certain of its tissues.
