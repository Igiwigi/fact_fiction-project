Urophyllopod. »

He gives on pages 69-71 of his © Untersuchungen,” &c., a long, minute, and
extremely ingenious explanation of the way in which this Urophyllopod stage of
development became converted by secondary modification into the Malacostracan
Protozoia, and afterwards, by still greater modification in the same direction, into
the typical Zo#a of the higher Decapods. The facts which have been detailed and tabulated with reference to the metamor-
phosis of the Sergestide and Penavs seem to substantiate at least a portion of this
view, and to show that the typical Zoza is a 8econdary modification of the Protozoa ;

but a comparison of these forms with the metamorphosis of FZuphansia, upon which
Cravs lays especial emphasis, seems to demand a directly opposite interpretation. If the Zoza has been produced by a secondary modification of the Protozo#a we
shonld expect to find the characteristics of the Protozoza better preserved in the
Schizopods than in the lower Decapods, and if we find in the Schizopods certain
features of the typical Zota, which are absent in the Protozou of the lower Macroura,
we can hardly accept withont question the interpretation which sees, in secondary
modification of the latter, the origin of the Zoza. In FPuphausia the somites appear
in regular s8nccession, from in front backwards, but the somites of the abdomen

X acquire appendages before the pereiopods appear, and there is a stage when the
a abdomen is fully developed and the thorax almost absent ; a stage which, therefore,
£ resembles the Brachyuran Zoza more perfectly than any stage in the development
