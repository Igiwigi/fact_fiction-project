the spectrum follows the overall distribution of crossings, but it has a larger local density of crossings especially around the :B
maximum of the distribution. Interestingly, this maximum is found close to the Mott-insulator transition in the ground state of ical

our one-dimensional Bose—Hubbard model [20], a fact that most likely has to do with the reordering of the spectrum around
this transition briefly discussed in [21]. (Online version in colour.)

The case with finite F represents a paradigm of a many-body Floquet Hamiltonian, which is
analysed in detail elsewhere [7,11,19]. Pl6tz et al. [7] show, in particular, that the transition from
the regular to the chaotic regime as a function of F can be well captured by the analysis of the
width distribution of the detected avoided crossings [7,26],
