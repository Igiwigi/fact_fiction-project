the sheets have fused, the ventral body wall separating the plates and pectoral muscles
should continue to shrink and finally disappear, and why the contraction and degenera-
tion in the sheet of flattened cells should become largely restricted to a narrow, mid-
ventral band.

The view that there is an active streaming of cells from either side towards the
mid-ventral line accords better with the known facts. Such a streaming of tissue would
produce the median accumulation of cells described in Part I and, as previously
stated, local degeneration might be expected to occur under such overcrowded con-
ditions. It is necessary to assume, however, that the two streams of amoeboid cells
pull the sternal plates, and probably the pectoral muscles also, with them towards the
mid-line. Unless this happened, the two streams of flattened cells would not become
rapidly shorter, which is the observed fact; they would only become increasingly
scanty and diffuse, which would mean that the ventral body wall would not shrink
and the sternal plates would remain apart. The displacement of differentiated tissue
by the amoeboid migration of less differentiated cells is a familiar feature of tissue
cultures, as will be described later, and it would not be very surprising if a similar
phenomenon should occur in normal development.

Whether it is considered that the union of the sternal plates is due to spontaneous
median shrinkage and degeneration, or whether the alternative view is accepted that
the plates are pulled towards the mid-line by an active streaming of cells from either
side, either hypothesis rests on the two assumptions that there is a movement of
undifferentiated tissue in the ventral body wall in a median direction, and that this
