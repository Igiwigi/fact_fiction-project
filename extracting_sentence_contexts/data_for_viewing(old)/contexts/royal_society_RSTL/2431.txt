There are numerous considerations of a theoretical nature, especially respecting the
compound particles of matter and the resulting electrical forces which they ought
to possess, which I hope will gradually receive their development ; and there are
numerous experimental cases, as, for instance, those of compounds formed by weak
affinities, the simultaneous decomposition of water and salts, &c., which till require

investigation. But whatever the results on these and numerous other points may
be, I do not believe that the facts which I have advanced, or eyen the general laws
deduced from them, will suffer any serious change ; and they are of sufficient impor-
tance to justify their publication, even though much may remain imperfect or undone.
Indeed, it is the great beauty of our science, CHEMISTRY, that advancement in it,
whether in a degree great or small, instead of exhausting the subjects of research,
opens the doors to further and more abundant knowledge, overflowing with beauty
and utility to those who will be at the easy personal pains of undertaking its experi-
mental investigation.

872. The definite production of electricity (868.) in association with its definite
action proves, I think, that the current of electricity in the voltaic pile is sustained
by chemical decomposition, or rather by chemical action, and not by contact only.
But here, as elsewhere (857.), I beg to reserve my opinion as to the real action of
