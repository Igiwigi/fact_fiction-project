300 MR. J. LARMOR ON A DYNAMICAL THEORY, &c.

H’ = 3H/(uz + 2) and uniform magnetization I’ = (u — 1) H’/47- inside the iron,
whether the law of induction is linear or not. Thus for this case of a sphere the
mechanical forces exerted on the iron involve no distribution of forcive throughout its
volume, but simply an outward normal traction of intensity {(4? — 1) sin? @ — w+ 1}
H?/87 over its surface: that being so, the stresses agree with Kircanorr’s values,
and the elastic strain produced in the sphere is given by his formule,* the result of
course involving only very slight deformation. In fact, taking the axis of w along
the direction of I’, it is clear that an elastic displacement (u, v, w) of the type
u=au+ be (y+?) + cx, v= w= a's + Va (y? + @) + cx satisties the conditions
of the problem for the case of a sphere, the constants being determined by satisfying
the equations of internal equilibrium and adjusting the surface tractions. In addition
to this mechanical deformation there will be the intrinsic deformation above deter-
mined (§ 83) arising from the molecular changes produced by the magnetic polarization.

Precisely similar formulee express the mechanical stress in a sphere of solid dielec-
tric matter situated in a uniform electric field.

I desire to express, as in previous Memoirs, my obligation to the friendly criticism
of Professor G. F. FirzGeraup, which has enabled me to remove obseurities and in
