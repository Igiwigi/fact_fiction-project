factors can also exert strong influences on intraspecific vari-
ation in social systems. As shown by Schradin [130] (see
[144]), flexibility evolves especially in unpredictable environ-
ments with repeated similar changes, or in marginal habitats
[145], selecting for genotypes that enable a broad reaction
norm for social behaviour. A broad consensus appears to be
emerging among behavioural ecologists, however, that ecologi-
cal constraints on behavioural flexibility should no longer be
studied in isolation of other factors [135,143].

(b) Developmental constraints

Another set of constraints is based on the fact that genetic infor-
mation and cellular components and processes shaping
behaviour within-species is translated via developmental pro-
grammes into proteins, which in turn are combined to furnish
the proximate agents underlying behavioural modulation
such as hormones, neurons and muscles. Species-level consist-
ency of these processes, which may ultimately underlie
phylogenetic signals, can be brought about by a number of
mechanisms, including insensitivity to environmental change,
set-points in homeostasis, polygene genes, developmental
canalization and the costs of maintaining continuous individual
behavioural flexibility [15], which can be surprisingly low [130].
However, there is also variation in the behavioural outcomes of
