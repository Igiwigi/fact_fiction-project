But the processes by
which the requisite development of the foetus is effected in the first of these modes,
vary remarkably; and s0 far as they have been investigated in the different orders
of Mammalia, to which true viviparous or placental generation is peculiar, a very
regular gradation has been traced towards the oviparous or ovoviviparous modes,
in which the exterior covering of the ovum never becomes vascular. As lactation has been generally regarded as exclusively associated with a true vivi-
parous generation, the arguments adduced in favour of the mammary nature of the
abdominal glands of the Ornithorhynchus have been supposed to imply a necessary
belief in the accordance of its mode of generation with that of the higher orders of
Mammalia. They have consequently been objected to most strenuously by those
pbysiologists who maintain the oviparous nature of this animal*: and various ex-
planations have been offered, with a view to reconcile the lately ascertained facts
respecting the mammary glands with the oviparous theory of the Monotremata, and
their supposed position in the natural system as a distinct class of Fertebrata, The
reasonableness or necessity of these objections would have been more apparent if the
essential dependence of lactation on placental development had first been demon-
strated : for with respect to the observations+ against which they were directed, these
were confined to the elucidation of a single disputed and doubtful point in the eco-
nomy of the Monotremata ; the uterine apparatus being considered 80 far only as
was necessary to determine the correspondence of its periodical changes with those
of the mammary glands ; while the objections to the oviparity of the Ornithorhyn-
chus extended only to the theory which maintained that the ovum was expelled with
a calcareous covering, and that embryonic development took place after exclusion
by a process of incubation. In proceeding now to the more immediate consideration of the structure of the
