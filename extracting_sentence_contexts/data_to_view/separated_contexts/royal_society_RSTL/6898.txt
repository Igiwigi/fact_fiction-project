On a coast 80 exposed to the action of the
sea, and with cliffs constantly though slowly yielding to its incessant action, it is not to be
expected that traces of old raised beaches should be preserved, except at a few sheltered
spots. These we have at places 80 closely allied to the present contour of coast—
showing, too, old cliffs forming, like the present range of cliffs, bold escarpments to an
old sea—that although I conceive the channel to have been considerably widened since
then, I am satisfied that it existed at the time of the low-level gravels, whatever doubt
there may be of its prior existence. There is no palzontological objection to this view,
inasmuch as the land and freshwater Mollusca had spread over this country at an anterior
period; the greater bulk of them had in fact made their appearance in this country
previous to the Boulder Clay, and many at the period of the Crag. A nearly similar
observation applies, with few exceptions, to the Mammalia. With a climate, however,
such as we have inferred, and with a channel of less breadth than the present one, the
sea between the two lands might have been frozen every winter and have allowed of the
pas8age of man and large animals, as happens at this day in latitude 52? at the island
of Saghaleen, where the strait between it and the adjacent mainland is frozen every
winter for a period of 80me months#.
