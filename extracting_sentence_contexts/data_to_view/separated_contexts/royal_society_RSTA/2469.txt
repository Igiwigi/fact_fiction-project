If we kept dragging paths, as
shown in the figure, we would conclude that those two paths were the same. Now, as there are
two blank cells, we see that we cannot identify all paths. In fact, we conclude that if before we
had nine different paths, after these identifications we only have two paths.

(c) The analogy between paths and proofs

We now start to relate paths and proofs. Let us consider figure 1. There we had nine different
paths and these paths came from different applications of the rewriting rules, and these different
applications of the rewriting rules mean that we have different proofs of the statement f is in I.
