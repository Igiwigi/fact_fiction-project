It is remarkable
how well the root-hairs have been preserved, even in the intrusions (Plate 5, figs. 27,
clearly seen with a lens, 28; Plate 6, figs. 41, 43, 46), a fact which suggests that they
continued to function as well as in the roots outside. The invading roots almost invariably run lengthwise through the petiole. Whether
they grew downwards or upwards, or some in one direction and others in another, is a
question which will be discussed presently.
