The distinction is extremely useful, and so long
as further mutations, or turns of the kaleidoscope, do not interfere with those
characters which we regard as generic, or impose upon them new “ generic”
characters, the descendants of the first species will continue to belong to its genus. In the case of the Ceylon endemies we seem to have caught most of the genera still
in the stage of one species each, but a few have two or three, and two, Doona with 11
species, and Stemonoporus with 15, have gone a stage beyond this. The fact that in widely separated islands, such as the Hawaiian, the proportion of
endemic genera is larger, though the number of endemic species is not so large,
would suggest that perhaps
position of specific differences affecting the same character. The fact that in Ceylon
there are six families, five with one species each, and one with two species, with all
species endemic, goes to show that it is possible for all representatives of a family to
become endemic. When we turn to the genera in the other families we find quite
a number in which all the species are endemic, which give the following Table :—
