Mr. Muxs Home 8uggests that the lakes need not have been very deep—that the
glens themselves were 80 obstructed with detritus as to reduce their depth to 100 feet. If 80, ib is not easy to 8ee how the upper end of Glen Roy could be 80 comparatively
free from detritus, and yet 80 large an accumulation of moraine matter and gravel
remain in its lower end, below its junction with Glen Glaster, where the scouring
action of the outflowing water must have been greater. The argument that the valleys may have been subsequently deepened is disproved
by the fact that, with the exception of the narrow river-cut channel, the valley floors
remain as when left after the previous general glaciation, glaciated rocks showing
everywhere in the bed of the valley of Glen Spean, and in places in Glen Roy. The © marine theory,” which regards the © roads” as old sea beaches, was briefly
alluded to by Macovrroocn. It was afterwards brought forward with his usual power
of illustration, but 8ubsequently abandoned, by Darwin.
