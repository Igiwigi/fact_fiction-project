only two quantities that involve the time dimension. Being independent of yp, it is
also independent of ¢ since these are the only two quantities that involve the mass
dimension. Hence we are left with the fact that % is a function of ¢ and /, that is
n=fe/l. If this were so, there ought to be a distinct stability ratio, for 2 would be
completely determined by the ratio c/l. The previous work shows that this is not
