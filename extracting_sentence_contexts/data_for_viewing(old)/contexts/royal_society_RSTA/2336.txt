examples of these dependencies are displayed in figure 4. For these examples, we set a constraint
on the parameters v) = v2, which allows reduction in the choices for material parameters. We have
also marked the limiting values of Go/G as v + 0, computed by solving the quasi-static problem
shown in the electronic supplementary material. Additionally, we indicate the admissible and
forbidden regimes in these plots by the thick and thin lines, respectively.

Figure 4a refers to the situation where the stiffness of the vertical springs c was varied.
An interesting point is that the range of admissible regimes grows with the decrease of c. For
instance, in the case 41 =0.05, 42 =0.1, there are three distinct intervals of admissible and
forbidden regimes. A similar variation in the regimes is also observed for a high contrast in model
parameters in a simple chain and a square-cell lattice.

The other plot, figure 4b, illustrates the fact that even though the macroscopic properties, such
as speeds of sound v1,2 and stiffness c of the springs between the chains, remain the same, the
microlevel fracture properties vary. The energy release rates take different values and, moreover,
qualitative changes in the admissible regimes occur. We see a growth in the admissible regime
with an increase in 4; while j12 remains constant, for all presented cases. Furthermore, for a
chosen crack speed, there are quantitative changes that are reflected in figure 2b for (n), where
we see differences in the values of this function and in the wavelengths of the radiated waves.
