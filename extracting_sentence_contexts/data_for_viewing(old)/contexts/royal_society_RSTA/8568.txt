The possibility of a direct connection between the Ratio and the torsion constant
raised an interesting point.

When an impulse is imparted to the suspended system at rest at its centre of
equilibrium it produces a throw which is inversely proportional to Vc. If, on the other
hand, a couple is applied continuously the first throw is inversely proportional to c;
and even if the couple is not constant its effect will be proportional to a higher power

* This of course meant fresh “ gallowsing ” ; but the fact that this only altered the moment of inertia
of the specimen from 1:44 1074 to 1-55 10™ indicates that the alteration it produced in the hang
was small.

of 1/e than the square root provided the time its application lasts is not small compared
with the quarter period of the system.

From this it follows that if an instantaneously applied impulse is succeeded by the
