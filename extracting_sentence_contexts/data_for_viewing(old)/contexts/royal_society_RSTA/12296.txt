u
the idea being that with a finite speed of propagation the lines of force would lag, and thereby acquit
curvature out of the magnet’s meridian; so that a distant needle instead of pointing straight at
magnet would be tangential to these lines, and would therefore be slightly deflected during the spin.

We now see, however, that no such aberrational effect is to be expected, except on a corpuscular view
of magnetic propagation.

Concerning the effect of motion of other kinds, certain things are experimental}
known ; ¢.g., motion of the receiver is known to cause aberration, however the fact
be precisely accounted for; and motion of the medium alone is known not to cause
aberration of any perceptible magnitude, else would terrestrial surveying operations
be inaccurate. But no experimental data as yet obtained are evidence concerni
small quantities of the second order, and it will be well to examine critically and
geometrically the whole subject of wave motion from a moving point to a moving
telescope through a uniformly moving medium, all the velocities being possibly
different in magnitude and direction. So far as steady and uniform motion is
concerned this may be considered the most general case. ¢
