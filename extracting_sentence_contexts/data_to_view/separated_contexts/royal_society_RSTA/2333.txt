Amorphous halos tend to reveal the ‘* most probable ”’
inter- or intra-molecular distances in a non-crystalline system ; and the non-crystalline
fraction of the hair substance, being built of combinations of «-amino acids which must
have certain relatively small spacings in common, would naturally yield such a halo. In addition, the effect will be further enhanced by a certain proportion of matter, in
heterogeneous orientation, corresponding to the aligned crystallites which give rise to
the «-photograph described above. ‘That there actually is some crystalline protein in
random orientation is shown by the fact that in several of the photographs obtained a
weak ‘‘ powder ring” can be traced passing through (001). * See papers by Herzoe, SponsteR, Mark and others. 80 W. T. ASTBURY AND A. STREET ON X-RAY STUDIES OF
