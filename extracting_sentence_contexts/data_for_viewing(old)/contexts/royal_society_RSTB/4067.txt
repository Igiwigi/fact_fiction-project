figures for any given region are relatively constant from animal to animal, we may
build up the picture and include other heart surfaces by overlapping -the fields of
observation, This method avoids displacement of the heart in any given animal
during the course of an experiment, for only a single surface is examined in a given
heart. Three figures (figs. 6, 7, and 8) of the right surface are given as illustrations.
The fields of observation include the whole of the right and dorsal portions of right
ventricle, and a complete base-apex strip of left ventricle. The whole or part of the
central region is also included. In each diagram the central region is the earliest part
of the right ventricle to be excited. It is also to be noticed that the apex of the

of a second only being found between them. We think this conclusion is due to the fact that his
observations were almost confined to the base and left apex of the ventral surface.

right ventricle may be included amongst the earlier regions (figs. 6 and 7); on the
other hand, it may be relatively late (fig. 8). Following the descending branch of
the right coronary artery, the times decrease. The same tendency is seen in moving
from the base (dorsally) of the left ventricle to its apex. The figure for the actual
apex of the left ventricle, 7c. the vortex, is always low (figs. 7, 8, 9, and 10), and
often this region rivals the central region on the ventral surface of the right ventricle,
in the race for priority.
