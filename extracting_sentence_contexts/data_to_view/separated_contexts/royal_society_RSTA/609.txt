We spiked each RNA-Seq experiment (figure 1a) with an external RNA
standard whose sequence does not align anywhere in the E. coli genome. Reads mapped to the
spike in sequence showed high reproducibility between biological replicates. With this twist,
the RNA-Seq datasets, normalized to the living cell counts (determined by FACS) were used to
calculate the absolute copy number of each mRNA per cell (equation (2.1)). We were able to map
reads to 4254 ORFs in LB and 4269 ORFs in MM. (In E. coli, the total number of genes including
tRNA, tRNA and non-coding RNAs is 4496.)

Cells grown in LB medium have about three times more mRNA transcripts than cells grown
in MM (approx. 7800 mRNA copies/cell versus approx. 2400 mRNA copies/cell; figure 1b);
