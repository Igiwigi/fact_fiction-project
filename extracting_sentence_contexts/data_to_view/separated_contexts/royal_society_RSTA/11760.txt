A Bitangential Congruency.  (§§ 22-26.)

§ 22. Take for another example the equations

(A+Bp2+Op2) {B (y—p.2)! + C (vo—pyt)?— 13 = {Bey (y— Pe) + Cpa (yo— Pa)
(at+bp,+epe) {b (ype) +e (ys— pase)? —1 5 = (bp, (yi— Pe) +P (Ya Ps) *. These define y, — p,x, and y, — pw as functions of p, and ps, and are, therefore,
the Clairaut form, and may be integrated by substituting ¢, for p, and ¢, for py,

The integral in this form will represent four lines of a congruency, which co
in fact of all the common tangents to the two quadrie surfaces


OF SIMULTANEOUS ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. 537

Ax’ + By? + Cy,? = 1,
ax? + by? + eye = 1. The first of the differential equations may be written
(A + Bp, + Op,') (Aa® + By,? + Cy? — 1) = (Aa + By,p, + Cyops)’. One of the integrals is, therefore,
a (A + Be? + Ce,*) (Av + By,? + Cy? — 1) = (Aa + By,e, + Cysey)®.
< Thus, one of the equations that give the singular solutions is
Fie, de, + Ce, de.) (Ax? + By,? + Cy, — 1) = (By, de, + Cyy dey) (Aw+ By,c, + Cyge,).

$ This last equation only contains #, y,, Ya, in the combinations y, — cx, Ya — Cy,
and the same will be true for the other equation of the same form that may be
lerived from the second equation of the complete primitive.
