white streaks parallel to the surface of the cortex of the upper limbic arc, being lost
beyond the upper marginal angle, whence no similar white streak can be detected
until we arrive opposite the great mass of the projection system which here takes a
lateral position. Here again we observe a delicate medullated stripe in the firs
cortical layer running towards the limbic suleus, but losb prior to its arrival ab thab
spot. This stripe is even shallower than the deeper arcuate stripe in the upper limbic
are.

Region of expansion of central olfactory fasciculus —It will be remembered that the
termination posteriorly of the inferior limbic are is characterised by the large size of
the nerve-cells of its second cortical layer—the modified olfactory type. If horizontal
sections of the occipital end of the frozen brain be carried through this region, the
following facts may be readily confirmed. Mos internally is the curved border of
the cornu ammonis ; next to it comes the granule region, extended from the upper
limbic are ; still further outwards is the peculiar region alluded to ; and beyond its
boundary (the limbic 8ulcus) is the curved surface of the extra-limbic portion of the
hemisphere.

To the naked eye a great dissimilarity is at once observed betwixt the appearance
of the extra-limbie and the limbic portion. The former exhibits a medulla which has
a 8light translucent aspect and is of a pale tint, but markedly contrasted with the
perfectly opaque and brilliant white colour of the limbic medulla. The line of demar-
cation, again, betwixt these two is sharp and abrupt, and extends from the depths of
the corpus callosum directly outwards to the limbic suleus. Microscopic examination
clearly shows this difference in colour to be due to the vast preponderance of medullated
