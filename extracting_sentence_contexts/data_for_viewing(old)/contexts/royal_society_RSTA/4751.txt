A modulated MTS is characterized within the assumption that its constituent elements are
embedded in a uniform periodic texture. More specifically, we identify the local texture and
the relevant value of homogeneous reactance with those of a periodic texture which matches the
local geometry. We will refer to this concept as ‘local periodicity’ (figure 3). The identification

of the local periodic structure is facilitated by the fact that the lattice is often Cartesian and the
modulation is obtained not changing the local period, but changing the dimension and orientation
of the elements inside a uniform lattice. In the following, we will refer to a lossless substrate with
thickness h and relative permittivity er, and to metallic patches arranged on a square lattice of
period d.

The local periodicity assumption allows for the definition of average tangential fields in a
simple way using a local Floquet-wave (FW) expansion. To this end, let us define p = xX + yy the
observation point on the lattice and impose across the periodic cell a phasing kd in the x direction
and kyd in the y-direction (figure 3). The transverse wavevector k; = kyx + kyy is associated with
this phasing. Denote as e;(p, k;) and h;(, k;) the surface tangential components of the total electric
and magnetic field on the surface, in the limit for z approaching zero from positive values.
Throughout this article, time harmonic fields are considered, with suppressed time dependence
