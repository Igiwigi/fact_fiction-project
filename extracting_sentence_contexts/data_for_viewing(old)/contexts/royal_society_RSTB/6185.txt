system other than those apportioned to the mere labyrinthine reflex arcs.

What Berrrorr failed to note is that the symmetrical posture is maintained only
so long as the head keeps motionless. The whole art of relinquishing hold of the
animal so that it will maintain a symmetrical posture, is to withdraw the fingers
without moving the head. Once the head suffers any effective displacement,
whether by spontaneous activity of the frog or otherwise, the previous asymmetry
is at once resumed.* Indeed, close observation shows that the one necessary
condition for resumption of the old posture is head movement or head displacement,
and no sensory stimulation that fails to cause head displacement is adequate to
disturb the temporary symmetrical posture.

These facts throw a new light on the experiment. It is precisely the labyrinthine
proprioceptors that are liable to stimulation by movement of the head. As we
have already seen, experiments with the totally delabyrinthized frog show that the
muscle receptors themselves are adequate to hold any posture that has once been
successfully imposed. â€˜Consequently, in the present instance, we have no need to
go beyond the labyrinth in searching for the cause of the inevitable, final reversion
to asymmetry. It is a displacement of the head, whether of passive or of physio-
Jogical origin, that conditions a labyrinthine reflex, with, as its effector result, assump-
tion of spinal torque. As a corollary to this conclusion we also infer that, so long as
the head remains motionless, no labyrinthine reflex and no labyrinthine excitation
occurs.

Before we leave the Berrrorr experiment, one other remark may be made. By
