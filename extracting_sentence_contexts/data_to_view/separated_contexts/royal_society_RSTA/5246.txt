With the knowledge gained of the mechanical properties of Cu—Be flexures, the challenge
presented by the PTB result for G led us to think of a torsion balance in which the test mass
assembly would be suspended from a Cu-Be torsion strip [10-12]. The obvious advantage we
saw at the time of the torsion strip over a torsion wire, was that the elastic torsional stiffness
of a strip depends mostly on the third power of its thickness while the maximum load that
can be suspended depends on the strip’s cross section which, for a given thickness, can be
made arbitrarily large by increasing its width (as long as the width remains much smaller

‘Minimizing the elastic stiffness of a wire torsion fibre is still important in order to reduce anelasticity and ultimately the
thermal noise it produces.


than the strip length). In fact, we found that for wide strips under heavy load there exists an
additional gravitational restoring torque that can be much larger than the elastic component. The
gravitational part of the restoring torque, being lossless, opened the possibility of designing a
torsion balance having large test masses suspended from a wide torsion strip thus increasing
the gravitational signal by many orders of magnitude and having a torsion balance with much
higher quality factor, Q, than a fibre of the same cross section. The torsion strip design with a
high-resolution sensor of angular motion therefore circumvents Boys’ argument.
