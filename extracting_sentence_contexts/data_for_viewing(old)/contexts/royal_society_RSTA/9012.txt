significance.

As regards the groups of three, forming the series « to ¢, there is also a close general
agreement, and the few irregularities may well be caused by imperfect estimates of
the wave-lengths and intensities in the two spectra, or by the approximate super-
position of lines of other substances. If it were not for interference by metallic
lines in the case of the sun, a good test would be provided by the series investigations.
Supposing the coincidences to be genuine, the wave-lengths of the solar lines should
show the series relations with the same order of accuracy as those of the ammonia lines
themselves, and the intensities of the lines should be consistent with the series
relationship. This test cannot be completely applied to any one of the six series, on
account of near coincidences with metallic lines, but it may be worth while to take
the chief lines of the dseries as an illustration. The facts with regard to these are
collected in Table IV.

It will be observed that while three of the metallic lines (8341°967, 3320°788,

* In order to get a rough idea of the proportion of coincidences which might be merely accidental, the
37 ammonia wave-lengths in the region 3363-5 to 3358°0 were compared with the 47 solar lines from
3563°5 to 3558°0. The total number of approximate coincidences yas 14, as compared with 34 in the
true region, and of these, 5 were with lines assigned to metals. There was no systematic agreement
of intensities in this case.
