Some branches also of the golden pippin trees, which I men-
tioned in my former communication of 1795, being much
cankered, were cut off about a foot above the junction of the
grafts to the stocks, and were regrafted with a new and
healthy variety. Parts of the wood of the golden pippin, in
which were many cankered spots, were thus placed between
the newly inserted grafts, and the stocks ; and these parts
have subsequently become perfectly free from disease, and


primarily impaired by Age. 181
the wounds, previously made by canker, have been wholly
covered with new and healthy bark. These facts, therefore,
satisfied me, that the debility and diseases of old varieties of
fruit of this species, did not originate in any defective action
of the bark or alburnum, either of the root, or of the stem
and branches, and'my attention was consequently directed to
the leaf and succulent animal shoot. A few crab-stocks were grafted with cuttings of the golden
pippin, in a situation and soil, where I had previously ascer-
tained that the wood of the golden pippin rarely remained in
health at the end of a second year; and, as s0on as the
annual shoots had acquired sufficient growth and firmness,
numerous buds of a new and luxuriant variety of apple,
which had recently sprung from seed, were inserted in them. During the succeeding winter, the natural buds of the golden
pippin branches were destroyed, and those inserted suffered
alone to remain; and as 800n as the leaves of these had
unfolded, and entered on their office, every symptom of
debility and disease disappeared in the bark and wood of the
golden pippin ; and each continued to perform its office, just
as well as the wood and bark of the young scedling stocks
could have done under similar circumstances.
