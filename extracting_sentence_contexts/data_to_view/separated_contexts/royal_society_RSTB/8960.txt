Including a costing component to PD-based
variation in complementarity across a large number of different prioritization therefore provides a different priority list com-
phylogenetic templates; however, this will prevent full paralle- pared to EDGE and other metrics that only make use of data
lization of the computational costs, which represents a on phylogeny and threat. The differences shown by our
significant barrier to tractability. We found that taking comple- approach from these metrics reflect the urgent need to find
mentarity into account did not in fact make a difference to our a consensus among conservation protocols for efficient con-
overall ranking; this was most probably because there were not servation planning [18], and also the value of conducting

many examples of closely related species in our cohort under comparative studies and cost-benefit analyses to explicitly


and quantitatively compare different conservation strategies
and forecast potential outcomes before the implementation
of conservation initiatives [49]. For example, as our study
compared the ability of two phylogeny-based prioritization
methods to conserve future PD, one interesting direction for
future research would be to compare these to a random
species selection [50]. The recent expenditure of conservation resources for our
cohort of bird species was shown to perform strikingly worse
than the optimal conservation protocol for maximal PD gain
with the same total available funds.
