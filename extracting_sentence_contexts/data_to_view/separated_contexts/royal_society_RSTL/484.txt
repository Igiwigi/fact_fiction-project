in volume will be nearly 119 to go; and this estimation differs
as little as might be expected from that gained by the action
of mercury upon the compound. It may fairly be concluded, that M. Gay Lvussac's principle
of the combination of gaseous bodies, in definite volumes,
strictly applies to this compound, and that it really consists of
four volumes of chlorine to one of azote; and the volumes
likewise exactly coincide with the laws of definite proportions;
and the detonating compound may be regarded as composed
of one proportion of azote 26, and four proportions of chlo-
rine 261,

I attempted a comparative experiment on the proportions in
the compound, by estimating the quantity of azote produced
in the decomposition of ammonia by it ; but I found that this
process was of no value for the purpose of analysis, for water
appeared to be decomposed at the same time with the ammo-
nia, and nitric acid formed ; and, in consequence, the quantity
of azote evolved was much less than it would have been, sup-
posing the ammonia decomposed by the mere attraction of
chlorine for hydrogen,

The results of the analysis of the new compound are inte-
resting for several reasons. They shew, what seemed- probable from other facts, that
there is no strict law of analogy, which regulates the combi-
nations of the same substance with different substances. As
three of hydrogen combine with one of azote, and one of
hydrogen with one of chlorine, I thought it probable that the
new compound would contain three of chlorine to one of
azote, which is not the case. This compound is the first instance known of one proportion

of a substance uniting to four proportions of another substance,
without some intermediate compound of 1 and 1, 1 and 2, and
1 and g; and the fact should render us cautious in adopting
hypothetical views of the composition of bodies from the rela-
tions of the quantities in which they combine.
