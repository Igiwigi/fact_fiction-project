boring and the drawing up of sections; (6) by the recognition, from the nature of the
fen beds, of equivalent phases of development in different parts of the fens; and (c) by
dating the fen beds, especially the peats, by pollen analysis.

1. SECTIONS BETWEEN WISBECH AND THE FEN MARGIN

In shallow coastal bays or wide estuaries, such as the fenland basin, it is clear that the
relative movement of land and sea may have had very great influence on the course of
peat formation. In such an area the seaward deposits will tend to be silts and clays and
the landward deposits peat: during submergences the silts and clays will transgress
previously formed peats, and during emergence peat will extend seawards over the
silts and clays. Thus an alternate wedging out of silts and clays on the one side and of
peats on the other is to be expected, and this is, in fact, realized. We can cite in con-
firmation the figure by Wildfang (fig. 20) of a schematic section through the east
Friesian marshes between Dollart and the Ley Bucht. Landwards there is only one
peat bed, seawards there are two, separated and overlaid by marine deposits, and at
places between, there may be four or five peat beds. It will be realized that the peat-
clay junction is nowhere really a synchronous horizonâ€”it marks, at each point where
it occurs, the time at which fresh-water conditions gave place to semi-marine, or vice
versa. At the same time it is perfectly clear that the section represents two phases of
extensive peat formation, and two alternating phases of marine transgression, and to
this extent the main beds of the marsh deposits do occur with sufficient constancy to
have a separate and recognizable identity.
