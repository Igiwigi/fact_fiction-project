would be likely to give rise, in every case, to dangerous hemorrhage subsequent
to parturition, a ciremnstance not in accordance with daily experience.

NoorTwycn, Reperts, Halter, Dr. W. and Mr. J. HuxTer, and Dr. Doxaip
Moxo, do not appear to have examined the gravid uterus and its contents in
the natural state of the parts, but after fluids had been forcibly injected into
the hypogastric and spermatic arteries. The laceration of the deciduous
meinbrane covering the orifices of the uterine sinuses followed this artificial
process, as well as the formation of deposits of injection in the vascular struc-
ture of the placenta, 'giving rise to the deceptive appearance of cells. That
this took place in the examinations made by Raperer* and MoxroF, does
not admit of dispute; and the following facts render it more than probable
that the HuxTERs were also misled, by the effects of artificial distention of the
placenta, from the extravasation of the fluids forced into the uterine vessels.

In the course of last autumn, the preparations of the gravid uterus in the
Hunterian Museum at Glasgow were examined at my request by Dr. Nino ;
and in none of them does it appear certain that any great blood-vessels pass
from the uterus into cells in the placenta ; but in many the deposits of injection,
causing the appearance of cells, were observed evidently to be the result of
extrayasation. No preparation in the collection seems to have been expressly
