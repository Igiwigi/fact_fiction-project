This correlation is found to be
approximately 80%. This is higher than 65% found in [11] for a canonical turbulent boundary
layer that was justified as a result of the footprint caused by the superstructure-type events in the
log region. The fact that the correlation is higher in FST cases supports the direct penetration of
the FST large scales into the boundary layer and down to the near-wall region (this correlation is
even higher for case D, approx. 85%). Given the similarities of the scale interactions with that of high Reynolds number canonical
boundary layers, there is grounds to test the predictive inner-outer model of Marusic et al. [10],
also detailed in Mathis et al. [11], for the turbulent boundary layers in the presence of FST. This would confirm the analogy between the two flows and validate the applicability of the
model to this non-canonical case.
