heat is obtained from fuel when/it is burnt quickly ; and they
show that in all cases the temperature -of the acting bodies
should be kept as high as possible, not only because the gene-
ral increment of heat is greater, but. likewise, because those
combinations are prevented which at lower temperatures take
place without any considerable production of heat : thus, in
the Argand lamp, the Liverpool lamp, and in the best fire-
places, the increase of effect does not depend merely upon the
rapid current of air, but likewise upon the heat preserved by
the arrangements of the materials of the chimney, and com-
municated to the matters entering into inflammation.

These facts likewise explain the methods by which tem-
perature; may be increased, and: the limit to certain methods.
Currents of flame, as it was stated in the last section, can
never raise the heat of bodies exposed to them, higher
than a certain degree, their own temperature ; but by com-
pression, there can be no doubt, the heat of flames from
pure supporters and combustible matter may be greatly in-
creased, probably in the ratio of their compression. In the
blow-pipe of oxygene and hydrogene, the maximum of tem-
perature is close to the aperture from which the gases are
disengaged, i. e. where their density is greatest. Probably
a degree of temperature far beyond any that has been yet
attained may be produced by throwing the flame from com-
