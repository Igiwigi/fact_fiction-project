of functional derangement of any kind in which any impediment exists tro decarboni-
zation, as is the case especially in most diseases of the organs of respiration.

From the facts which I have already succeeded in ascertaining, there is good
reason for believing that the above view is, in the main, correct. Turning to the
history of the three cases of blue urine which first attracted my attention, I find
that one died phthisical ; the second, thongh living, has undoubtedly tubercular
disease of the lungs, with greatly diminished capacity of respiration ; while in the
third case there have been evidences, although less marked, of lung affection.

Again, turning to the histories of the twenty cases in which samples of urine were
st aside for observation, and in four of which samples indigo became developed in
considerable quantity, I find that these were also cases of phthisis. These facts
possess the greatest interest, and appear to point clearly to the causes which
determine the presence of indigo in the urine.

From other observations not yet completed, it appears, however, that indigo is not
developed in the urine in all cases of phthisis. If the urine voided be very acid,
or if the affection of the lungs be of but trifling extent, no great development of that
substance will take place. Neither, on the other hand, is the occurrence of indigo in
the urine by any means limited to cases of phthisis, as it may occur in abundance
in any case, no matter from what cause it proceeds, in which there exists great
impediment to the elimination of carbon from the system, as in scarlatina, Bricur's
disease, cholera, &c.
