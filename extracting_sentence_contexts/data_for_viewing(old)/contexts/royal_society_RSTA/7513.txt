or @,—0, = 0°63(0,—,) for the dipole.

In practice, the constant will probably lie between these two values and for the present
purpose we may take as a rough approximation

4-0, = 0-5(0,—W,). (4)

If the relative angular velocity of the outer part of the core and the mantle is to have the
value found in § 3, o, —a, must be about 0-36° per year. The maximum relative velocity at
the boundary of the inner and outer parts of the core will then be 0-055 cm./sec. The argu-
ments of II (p. 444) would give the corresponding radial velocity as 3-4 x 10~4cm./sec.
This may be somewhat underestimated as it is computed on the assumption that angular
momentum must be conserved in the radial motion of every particle, in fact the electro-
magnetic forces tend to restore a rigid body rotation and thus increase the radial velocity
necessary to produce a given differential rotation.
The maximum toroidal field is shown in III to be

$n (wy —0,) BH (1—B5/a°),

where H, is the field at r = 6 (either uniform or dipole). The above value of w,—w, gives
150 gauss for the toroidal field if« = 3 x 10~®, H, = 4 gauss and the core is divided into two
equal parts.

The above explanation of the westward drift is imperfect in that the field in the core is
assumed instead of computed from the equations of magneto-hydrodynamics. Eventually
