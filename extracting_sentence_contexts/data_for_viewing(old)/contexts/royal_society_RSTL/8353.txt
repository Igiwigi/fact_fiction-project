exactly resembling the mycelium of the Penicilium glaucum. Amid the fibres were
numerous minute dots like yery young Torule. There was no proper aerial fructifi-
cation, No Bacteria were found.

In both these instances the organisms evidently belonged to the class of fungoid
vegetations represented by the Penicilium glaucum and the sugar-fungus. But their
mode of growth was 80 entirely different, that it was equally evident that they were not
identical with either of those species, and, further, that they were totally different from
each other, These were the only two instances, out of many hundred experiments, in
which I witnessed the development of a fungoid vegetation in a liquid which had been
exposed, for however short a time, to the heat of boiling water.

The facts just enumerated are far too few, and of too exceptional a character, to permit
a deduction in fayour of abiogenesis ; but they certainly impose a reserve which is
highly significant. If future investigations should establish the occurrence of abio-
genesis, this would not overturn the panspermic theory, it would only limit its univer-
sality; and it may be predicted with some confidence that if abiogenesis exist the con-
ditions of its occurrence can only be determined by an inquirer who is fully alive to the
truth and penetrating consequences of the panspermic theory.
