The controls at
U.C.H. continued as before, and in the corresponding years gave average broods of
136, 64 and 103, with 1-5, 1-4 and 5-7 per cent. dextrals. We also tried to make comparisons at Merton (London tap water) and Leeds (soft
moorland water), but breeding was unsatisfactory in both places: so far as they go,
the data show no effect on E-ness. We have, too, the fact that annual fluctuations (statistically real) in brood size and
percentage of dextrals occur in < strains which we should class as pure lines. Thus in
672 (‘Table VI) we have—

In 1927 there was a parallel rise in the strain 671 (fig. 3, p. 77), in 1929 in 677 (Table VI),
and in 939 (Table I) strains.
