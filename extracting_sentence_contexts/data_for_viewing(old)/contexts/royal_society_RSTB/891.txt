Witch or Pole Dab, Pleuronectes cynoglossus, the lower side is not white but grey.
. He sent us four specimens of this species, and we found that the superficial layer of
§ the skin, outside the scales, contained a layer of closely crowded iridocytes, and large
-& radiate black chromatophores uniformly distributed over the whole surface, but not
very close together. There were, however, no coloured chromatophores, no lipochrome
was present, although on the upper side orange chromatophores were present as
bi usual, The internal layer of the skin on the lower side contained neither argenteum
nor chromatophores. In this species the colour of the upper side is not so deep as in
the Plaice, Flounder, or Turbot, and both upper and lower sides are more pigmented
in larger than in smaller specimens. It should be noted that this species belongs to
deeper water than the Plaice, Flounder, Turbot, and other species, Its young have
not been found at less depths than 80 fathoms, and the adult has been taken at all
depths up to 700 fathoms. Perhaps the peculiarity is related to the fact that light
at greater depths is more dispersed than in shallow water, and therefore affects the

Fish more equally on the two sides. We do not know that the habits of the F
expose the lower side more than usual, but any Flat Fish rises from the botte
occasionally, and in deep water, the light being more diffused, may affect the
side more on these occasions. On the other hand, the explanation may be that # :
species became a Flat Fish more recently than others, and has, therefore, not advance
