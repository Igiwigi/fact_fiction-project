fe well as the rdlations iter sc of tle different parts of the two last-mentioned

objections can be urged, and are equally inconsistent with any other at present

The division of the air-bladder into a small, elastic, and expansible anterior portion,
ind a relatively large, inelastic, and inexpansible posterior division, renders that organ
S admirably adapted for the measurement of the varying volumes of the contained guses,

A |uteral walls, which alone are directly connected with the recording Weberian ossicles.
Â© Negarded, in fact, as an article of physical apparatus. the air-bladdev may be compared
