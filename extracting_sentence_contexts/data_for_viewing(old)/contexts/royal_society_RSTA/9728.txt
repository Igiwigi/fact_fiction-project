traces of further precipitation of the second constituent in the grain boundaries. At
205° further precipitation had occurred in the grain boundaries, but the total amount
precipitated was very small compared with the relative amount of the $-phase present
in the alloy quenched from 430°. From this we conclude that the z-solubility-limit
diminishes slightly between 430° and 205° (the second transformation of the 6-phase is
at 211°), but that the change is not more than a few tenths of an atomic per cent. Alloy
_41-07 remained homogeneous after the above treatments, and also after cooling from
300° to 100° over a period of two weeks, and being maintained at 100° for a further eight
days. :

Discussion.—The figures given in the collected tables are taken directly from the
above work. As will be appreciated from the data in Tables XXTIT and XXIV, a
few of the alloys showed slight inverse segregation in spite of the fact that they were

sand castings. But the liquidus and solidus and the « and @ solid solubility curves
respectively are so close together that very little error can have been introduced on
this account. The cross-section of alloy 39:43 in Table XXIV, quenched from 628°,
showed traces of the $-constituent except in the immediate centre (inverse segregation).
In this section the centre of the flat disc was drilled away and the outside portion
analysed so as to give the composition of the part which was two-phase. At 605° the
entire section was homogeneous.

indium, supplied by Messrs. Adam Hilger, Ltd., was used. The purity of this metal
