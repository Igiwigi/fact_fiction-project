Sow experiments which I lately made at the request of Mr.
5 Home, and which he has done me the honour to mention in
his ingenious Paper on the teeth of graminivorous quadrupeds,
induced me to turn my attention more particularly to the che-
mical examination of shell and bone, especially as the former
appeared to have been hitherto much neglected.

The time since these experiments were began, has not been
sufficient to enable me to enter into all the minutiz of the che-
mical analysis of these substances; but, as some remarkable
facts were ascertained, I have now ventured to bring them for-
ward, with the addition of some observations, although, as yet,
the whole is little more than a very imperfect outline.

The first of these experiments were made on the shells of
marine animals; and, to avoid repetition and prolixity, I shall,
in a great measure, once for all describe the menstrua, the pre-
cipitants, and the mode of operation.

When s$hells were examined, they were immersed in acetous
acid, or nitric acid diluted, according to circumstances, with
4, 5,+6, or more parts of distilled water; and the solution was
always made without heat.
