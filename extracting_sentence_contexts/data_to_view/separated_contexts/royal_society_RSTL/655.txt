The more I canvassed this new opinion, the greater num-
ber of circumstances in favour of it occurred to me; one of
the strongest of which is, that there is no other mode I am
acquainted with, by which animal fat can be formed. To this
may be added the curious circumstance of the sleeping ani=

8 mals, which lay in $0 large a supply of it, in a short time, to |
= serve for their winter's consumption, having a formation of
bo the intestines almost peculiar to themselves, in which there is
S no valve to distinguish the colon, and no fixed course for that
D intestine; 80 that the contents pass along with more facility,
S and remain a shorter time in the canal, the food being suffi-
Z ciently plentiful during the summer to compensate for this
ie want of economy, by which the lower intestines receive more
= abundant supplies for the production of fat. These intestines
'Z remain empty during the sleeping season, 80 that no fat can
= be formed in that period.â€” With this very important informa-
> tion, thus procured, in support of my opinion, I have been led
F to prosecute this inquiry with increased ardour, and shall now
E bring forward the facts I have been able to ascertain in con-
5 firmation of my hypothesis. These I shall detail in the order
= in which they were acquired, thinking it better to lay before
S the Society the regular process of the investigation, than to
[E grasp at once at the conclusions, which in the end of it I have
8 felt myself authorized to draw. I shall therefore begin by stating the circumstances under
which adipocere is formed from animal matter, most nearly
resembling those in which the contents of the lower intestines
in living animals are placed ; and this I shall do from facts,



in the Intestines of living Animals. 149

entirely within my own knowledge, the specimens of the
adipocere being now in my possession ; and afterwards go
on by bringing forward proofs that a substance similar to it is
formed in the colon.
