inhibition, social anxiety phenomena requiring distinctive vocabularies. On the one hand, variation in

brain patterns affects a child’s susceptibility to displaying certain behaviours

should the setting invite them. Because most investigators assume that vari-

ation in brain chemistry or anatomy, inherited or acquired during gestation,

is the basis of most temperaments, it is reasonable to suggest the existence of

human brains vary in the concentrations of more than 150 molecules and in the
densities and locations of the varied receptors for each of these molecules. These
patterns have not been discovered. However, none of these brain profiles
generates only one class of behaviour. Rather, each is linked to an envelope
of possible responses. The person’s interpretation of a bodily feeling produced
by the brain profile, and always the features of the immediate setting, determine
the reaction most likely to occur.

On the other hand, variability in irritability, ease of being soothed, activity
level, and frequency of smiling and vocalization have been treated as observa-
ble reflections of a pair of complementary, abstract temperamental dimensions
called ease and regulation of arousal states. Because these terms fail to specify
