momentum and consequent dissipation of energy. But in a rotating field of constant
value there is no diminution of the strength of the magnetising force. The molecules
are always under the same restraint, and the movements impressed upon them will
be more uniform and unidirectional. It is true that with small magnetising forces,

when but few combinations are dissolved and the movement is of a quasi-elastic
nature, the amount of energy dissipated will not be greatly different from that
dissipated in an alternating field of equal strength. In fact, since the molecular
changes will be forced to take place in one direction only, there will be on the
average a greater resistance to movement, and in consequence an increased dis-
sipation of energy. When, however, the field becomes stronger, each molecule will
develop a tendency to rotate in synchronism with the field and be less affected by
the magnetic influences of surrounding molecules. At this point the hysteresis will
show a considerable diminution which will become more marked as the field increases
in strength, until finally every molecule will rotate in unison with the field with
complete absence of oscillatory movement, The value of the hysteresis under these
last conditions will furnish an important clue to the nature of hysteresis. If the
hysteresis sensibly vanishes at this point it will be strong evidence that the damping
of the movements of the molecules is not due even partially to mechanical friction,
but must be produced by some action which is called into play by the rapid oscil-
