His fortunate: observation was received with the greatest caution by zoologists in
Zneral, and several undertook researches upon the subject to demonstrate the error
ato which they assumed he had fallen. The researches of RaTHKe upon the ASfacus
iatilis, of MM. Miixe-EpwarDs and AUDOUIN upon marine Decapoda, together with
Sos of Mr. WesrwooD upon the genus Gegarcinus, for a considerable period delayed
Bo general acceptation of the fact that the Zoea is the larva of a Decapod.
2 RaTHKE, in 1840 *, published the results of a second investigation on the subject, being
Sis rescearches upon Pagurus, Astacus marinus, and Hyas. In these he corroborated
ae statements of Mr. 'TH0MsON, and admitted that, * relying on the history of the deve-
'Zpment of the Crayfish, and trusting too much to analogies in the structure of tull-
Srown Decapods,‚Äù he had done Mr. 'Tnowso0N injustice in not putting faith in his dis-
Byery. E 1t was not long after Mr. 'Tuomso0x's first valuable discovery that good fortune placed
SHithin his reach the opportunity.
