Lanatzy in his “ Recent Observations on Degeneration of Nerve Tracts in the
Spinal Cord,” ‘ Brain,’ 83, makes the remark that Boucuarp§ had in 1866 noticed in
man that the descending degeneration in the lateral column was greater after injury
to the medulla, than after injury higher up, and that the medullary fibres were
situated in the lateral border of the pyramidal tract; he called them the “fibres
commissurales antérieures longues.” Laneury, in discussing the question, agrees
with StzerRINGTon that the cortical pyramidal tract is smaller than that given by
Fiecusic, and proposes the name of descending medullary tract for the other fibres
found degenerate in the region of the pyramidal tract after lesions of the medulla.

To sum up, it may be stated that the existence of fibres, following the course
indicated above, is not negatived by any anatomical fact. It has been shown that
just as in the case of the inner fibres of the posterior longitudinal bundle, and the
antero-lateral columnar fibres, there exists a group of unbroken fibres which extend
from the quadrigeminal region into the lateral column of the cord. It has been
shown that these fibres undergo a descending degeneration, and that they must not
be confounded with the fibres of the cerebellar tract, to the inner side of which they
lie.
