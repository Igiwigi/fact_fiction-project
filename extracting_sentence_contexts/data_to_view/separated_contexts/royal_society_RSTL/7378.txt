The splint bones may
enfold persistent cartilage, or this pi#h may be absorbed ; whilst in other cases we find
the secondary bone rambling away far from the cartilage which served at first as its
model, and running up and down any aponeurotic tract that may be available for it. Splint bones are not called 8econdary because of any lateness in their appearanceâ€”they
are the first to appear; but cartilage is the first, or embryonic skeleton, and in certain
low Vertebrata never takes on a calcareous condition. One important difficulty turns up in this part of our research, and that arises from
the fact that certain parts of the face, viz. the pterygo-palatine arcade, ossify as early
as the earliest splint bones, whilst the tissnes of the embryo are still simply cellular. Careful attention to this matter has led me to see that the difficulty is not at all insu-
perable, and that it does not in the least affect the distinction between the two classes
of ossifications.
