The interdependence of % and V ought to be expected from general principles. 4 can
only depend on V, , ¢, / and p, where / is some length of the body and y, is the viscosity
coefficient. If % is independent of V, then it is independent of p; since these are the

only two quantities that involve the time dimension. Being independent of yp, it is
also independent of ¢ since these are the only two quantities that involve the mass
dimension. Hence we are left with the fact that % is a function of ¢ and /, that is
n=fe/l. If this were so, there ought to be a distinct stability ratio, for 2 would be
completely determined by the ratio c/l. The previous work shows that this is not

the existence of the range of stability in an inviscid fluid we are forced to introduce
viscosity. The introduction of a small viscosity coefficient would probably alter the
stability ratios slightly, but the general form of the results, the short stability curve
and the widening range of stability (or, perhaps, just a range of stability) would probably
be unaltered.

The following investigation therefore only deals with the domain in which the
