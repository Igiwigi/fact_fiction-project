The months of July, August, and September should be selected for the examination
of this worm. When opened, after the manner already explained in the case of the
common leech, the whole interior of the body, from the head to the tail, will be found
to be lined by what appears to the naked eye to consist of a bright pink-coloured
flocculent lining membrane. But when detached in pieces and placed under the micro-
5crope, its real composition becomes evident.

The pink tint is due to the colour of the vitellus of the ova, and the membrane-
like appearance of the whole arises from the union and apposition of the individual
ova-laden segmental organs. Successfully individualized, these organs in Albione (fig. 10)
will be found to present the same outline as those of the Leech. They are looped,
horseshoe-like tubes. They are utero-ovarian as in the Leech. Albione differs from the
Leech in two important organic facts. In Albione the cavity of the body is wide and
Spacious ; in the Leech it is contracted and numerously bridled.

In Albione the blood vascular system is in a rudimentary stage; in the Leech it is
highly developed. The ovarian limb, therefore, in the former is not vascular as in the
latter.

'This completes an outline of the account which the author has to offer of the Female
87/tem of the Hirudinei :â€”how universal in extent and distribution, compared with that
which has hitherto been received as the utero-ovarian apparatus in these Annelids!*

* In the grand edition of the Regne Animal, the female system in Zirudo vacea (8e pl. 24, fig. 1, p. 213)
is figured and deseribed as consisting of a single Pouch, the uterus (with its appended vagina) and two
