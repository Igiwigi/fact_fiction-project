The calvarium in all extant odontocetes consists of two frontal
bones, two parietal bones and the supraoccipital bone. The cal-
varia of delphinoids (oceanic dolphins, porpoises) and the
Oligocene odontocete Olympicetust also contain three or four
additional elements positioned at the skull vertex between the
parietals, posterior to the frontals and anterior to the supraocci-
pital. Throughout this article, we refer to these elements as the
anterior median interparietal (AMI) element, posterior median
interparietal (PMI) element and left and right (paired) posterior
interparietal (PI) elements. Some cetaceans only show a single
median element, which we interpret to be the AMI. This assump-
tion is supported by the fact that the PMI is infrequent, smaller
and always occurs in the presence of the AMI.

The AMI is the unpaired bone commonly identified as the
interparietal in cetacean osteology [12,13]. The AMI corresponds
with ip.1 described in [19] and IA in [20]. Posterior to the AMI
are bilateral PIs, which have been described as the left and
right ossifications of the supraoccipital bone [14] or as the third
(and fourth) elements of the interparietal (ip.3 in [19]). For
more on nomenclature/homology of the PIs, see Discussion.
Some specimens also showed a small unpaired PMI situated
between the other three elements (ip.2 in [19]).
