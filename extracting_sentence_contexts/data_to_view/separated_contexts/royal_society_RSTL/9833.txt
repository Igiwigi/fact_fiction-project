water respectively, and as is seen by the gradual slope of the curve in fig. 25 B as a
= whole, there was a slight amount of leakage from some part in consequence of the
:= high pressure ; still the curves show clearly enough that the contractions which occur

= in the condition of the auricles was to be noticed, it seems to me that the only
2 explanation of such curyes as these is that the vagus causes a true relaxation of the
5 muscular tissue of the ventricle, and in all probability of the auricles as well. EX TI, now, we turn to the consideration of the curves obtained by the method of suspending the heart, we
© gee decided indications of the same fact; in many of the curves it can be noticed that with the diminution
BS of the beats cansed by yagus sbimulation, the diastolic line formed by joining the points of greatesb
£ relaxation falls yery slightly nearer to the abscissa than before the stimulation (Plate 69, figs. 15, 17 A, &c.),
© Another peculiarity can be seen in many of these curyes, which is 8ometimes much more pronounced
= than at other times, viz. : that with the increase in the force of the contractions, the diastolic line is raised
-S higher aboye the abscisza ; this is well shown in Plates 68, 69, figs.
