+ A sheep breeder tells me that in Dorset Horn ewes in the south of England the cestrus may recur as
often as every eleven days, each cestrus lasting for only about two hours.

} That cestrus does not generally commence with bitches until external bleeding is over is a fact well
known to dog breeders. But a slight flow of mucus, accompanied by a little blood and a swollen vulva,
may continue for some days during cestrus, or even after. Such, at least, was the case with a Dandie
Dinmont terrier, in the possession of the present writer, for nearly a week after the performance of
artificial insemination.
