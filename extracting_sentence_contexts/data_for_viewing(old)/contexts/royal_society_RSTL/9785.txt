discs high above the tank floor upon their long arms, and completing their movements
in a few seconds. So vigorous are these Star-fish, that they are able to execute this
manceuvre even upon a dry table, although the weight to be overcome is 80 much
greater in air than in water,

It may be added that these Star-fish are not able to ascend perpendicular surfaces,
owing to the rudimentary condition of their ambulacral apparatus.

2, Ecnixi,—In striking contrast to the rapid locomotion of the Echinoderms last
considered, stands the slow locomotion of the Fehinus, which along a horizontal surface
takes place at the rate of only 6 inches per minute, and up a perpendicular gurface at
the rate of 1 inch in 4 minutes. Looking to the slowness of this rate of locomotion, it
must strike us as a curious fact thab there is, perhaps, no animal which can properly
be said to approach the Zchinus in respect of the number and elaboration of special
mechanisms subservient to the function of locomotion, Careful observation has
satisfied us that these 8pecial mechanisms are four in number, and each of these
displays an immense amount of elaboration, We may best consider these four
mechanisms by taking them separately.

(A.) Ambulacral feet, or pedicels—This system is both structurally and functionally
closely similar to the homologous and analogous system in Star-fighes. In the Fechinus,
however, ib is of more use than in the Star-fish as a s8ystem of anchors and feelers,
The form of the Echinus being globular, while that of the Star-fish is flat, it follows
that the animal is more exposed to the displacing influence of currents, because offering
a larger surface for their action. Consequently, a need arises for a more secure system
