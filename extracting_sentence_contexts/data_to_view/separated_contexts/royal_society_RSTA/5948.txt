In general, empirical expectations about the prevalence of : =
a behaviour are crucial, but not necessarily sufficient for norm following. In situations where =

individual and social interests align, but a coordination problem needs to be solved (such as
driving on the right side of the road), empirical expectations may suffice. However, when social
norms prescribe behaviour that goes against narrow, self-interested motives, like in collective
action problems, the associated costs may make self-interested individuals uninterested in
norm compliance regardless of their empirical expectationsâ€”in fact, it provides an incentive
to free ride. In these situations, empirical expectations need to be complemented by normative
expectations, for these often come with the expectation of social sanctions [29]. Similarly,
normative expectations should be met with empirical expectations, since otherwise people may
see that norms can be violated without sanctions.
