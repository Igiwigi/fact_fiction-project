On returning from the West Indies we set about endeavouring to get another
schooner to work in place of the ‘‘ Margrethe,” but then came the Great War, and all
plans for further researches at sea had to be laid aside. The work of the trading
vessels, however, was maintained during the first years of the War, and continued to
yield valuable information. In 1915, for instance, we obtained confirmation of the
fact that tiny larvee occur in summer, and a sample taken at the end of September,
1915, contained eight specimens of about 34 cm. long, ¢.¢., of the same size as those
taken by the ‘‘ Margrethe” in the autumn of 1913. As the War increased in extent,
however, our collecting work died out, and several of the vessels which had been
assisting us were sunk by submarines.
