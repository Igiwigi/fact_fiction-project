at zero incidence. The second problem corresponds with the case of a thin plate aerofoil
which may, be at any incidence. In the particular case of a flat plate aerofoil g(x, z) becomes
the constant ¢ over the plane of the aerofoil, where ¢ is the angle of incidence.

OPERATIONAL TRANSFORM OF PROBLEM
With axes as defined previously we introduce the Laplace transform, with respect to z,

of the fundamental equation

Thus, if d(x, y) = ) e-'=4(x,y, Z) dz is the Laplace transform of ¢, then, using the fact that

with our choice of axes ¢, 04/0z are zero over the plane z = 0
