The compound eyes.

These make their appearance as rudiments in the lasb Protozo#a, but they are
not perfectly developed or stalked until the last Schizopod 8tage, The homology of
the talked eyes of the Malacostracan has been a matter of some uncertainty. They
are usually enumerated in the lis of appendages, and the typical Orustacean is 8up-
posed to have a corresponding somite. CLAUs has pointed out (* Zur. Kenntniss
der Malacostrakenlarva,‚Äù Wiirzb. Zeitschr. ii., 1861. p. 33) that no especial taxonomic
importance can be attached to their presence or absence ; and their mode of origin in
Lucifer certainly gives no 8upport to the view that they have been produced, like the
mandibles, by the gradual specialisation of a pair of ordinary appendages. They do
not rezemble ordinary appendages at any stage, but are formed directly, and the fact
that the period of their development is spread over several moults renders their
history quite different from that of the appendages. As I shall show further on,

gerially homologous organs do not necessarily owe their resemblances to inheritance
from the unspecialised organs of a remote ancestor, and I think that the presence of a
distinet occular 8egment in Squilla compels us to recognise an homology between the
stalked eye and an ordinary appendage, although it, is no doubt true that all the
groups in which stalked eyes occur cannot be traced back to a common stalked-eyed
ancestor, and also true that the stalked eyes themselves cannot be traced back to
