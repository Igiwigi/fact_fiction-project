A physical change had been accomplished in the gold whereby it no longer melted,
though placed under conditions under which a similar rod of gold had previously
melted freely.

It is quite possible that the raising of the melting-point is due to a direct effect of
pressure upon the metal, though we must also consider as possible factors the passage
of a current of 10 to 15 amperes through the rod, a repeated annealing action, and
perhaps some absorbent action by the hot poles of the gases within the cylinder
which might affect their properties, though this last action might have equally well
taken place during the original refining of the metal.

(5) The Occurrence of the Calcium Lines H and K.—In spite of the fact that the
spectrum of gold did not when first examined show any impurity, either recognised
or suspected, very abundant evidence of the presence of calcium is presented by the
photograph taken at a pressure of 10 atmospheres in the region 3550 to A 4000
(Plate 2) upon which the H and K lines appear more strongly than any other line,
being very much more prominent than the gold line /2 at 3898°04, This is the more

remarkable because there is not the slightest trace of either of these lines in the.
comparison spectrum which was obtained by a divided exposure, one-half before the
pressure photograph, the other half after it.
