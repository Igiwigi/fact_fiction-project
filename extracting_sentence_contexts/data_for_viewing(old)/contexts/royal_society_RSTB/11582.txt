suggest the limited utility of satellite cells for cell therapy,
those experiments may have been flawed because they
employed satellite cells that had already lost some of their
expansion and differentiation potential in vitro. Interestingly,
satellite cell markers including pax7 and integrin alpha 7
were expressed at similar levels across substrates, suggesting
that LN-521 is regulating satellite cell activity through novel
mechanisms (C. Penton and P. August, unpublished data).
Plating satellite cells on LN-521 immediately after isolation
by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) appears to fun-
damentally protect the cells from the loss of the expansion
and differentiation abilities. Penton and colleagues are inves-
tigating additional approaches that should permit enhanced
expansion and engraftment to develop advanced therapeutic
approaches for patients with muscular dystrophies.

Previous studies have shown that transplanted hPSC-
derived myogenic cells can fuse with host myofibres and
improve muscle function [55]. However, it is unknown if
hPSC-derived myotubes alone can generate three-dimen-
sional functional skeletal muscle because comparison
studies suggest they are more developmentally immature
