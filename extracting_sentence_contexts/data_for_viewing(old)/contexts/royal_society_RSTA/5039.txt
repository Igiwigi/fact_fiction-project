has been lost, but in a copy annotated by Newton, the following sentences appeared immediately
after ‘wherein the Origin of Colours is unfolded’ (p. 3081), and just before he switched out of his
Baconian, historical style of narrative:

A naturalist would scarce expect to see ye science of those become mathematicall, & yet I
dare affirm that there is as much certainty in it as in any other part of Opticks. For what I
shall tell concerning them is not an Hypothesis but most rigid consequence, not conjectured
by barely inferring ‘tis thus because not otherwise or because it satisfies all phaanomena (the
Philosophers universall Topick,) but evinced by ye mediation of experiments concluding
directly & without any suspicion of doubt. [10]

The suppression of these controversial claims is significant. Newton argues here not only that
colour can be quantified but also that differential refrangibility is an established fact, not a testable
hypothesis—yet this assertion rests on the unstated assumption that the geometrical laws of optics
are valid. Whoever removed these two sentences recognized the strength of its epistemic claims
in the context of an article lacking experimental detail.

4. Sequel: consequences of Newton's 1672 paper

Newton's 1672 paper carried two main implications for the future: the nature of light and the
properties of colour. Most obviously, Newton himself continued to experiment and to revise these
early ideas. In addition, aiming to fulfil their own various agendas, natural philosophers picked
up, developed and consolidated hints and suggestions made by Newton at different times. As a
consequence, what became known as Newtonian views were not necessarily identical either to
each other or to the opinions voiced by Newton at any particular time.
