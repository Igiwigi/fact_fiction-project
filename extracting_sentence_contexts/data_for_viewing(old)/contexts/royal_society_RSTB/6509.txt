The present work has been made possible by a grant from the Academic Assistance
Council and a scholarship from the Marine Biological Association. I wish to express
my sincere thanks to Dr. E. J. ALLEN for his kind interest and the encouragement I
received from him throughout the work, and for the excellent facilities of the Plymouth
Laboratory which he placed at my disposal. My thanks are also due to Miss M. V.
Lezour who identified most of the diatoms I used, and to Dr. E. J. ALLEN, Dr. S. Kemp,
and Mr. F. S. RussELt who read the manuscript of this paper and made various correc-
tions and valuable suggestions for alterations.

CULTURE METHODS

One of the reasons why the life history and physiology of the pennate diatoms is so
much better known than that of the Centricae may be found in the fact that the
former are more resistant and easier to culture than the latter. The classic work on
culture conditions for centric diatoms was done by Mique. (1892-7), ALLEN and
NELson (1910) and ALLEN (1914). The technique used by these authors was either to
pick out individual diatoms under the microscope and to place them in a sterile
culture medium (Miguet’s or ALLEN’s modification of it) or to dilute a small quantity
of a plankton sample containing diatoms in a certain amount of culture fluid and to
subdivide this into a number of culture flasks. In one or the other culture one diatom
species only would develop. Another method employed by ALLEN was to start a raw
culture with one or two drops of plankton diluted in about 250 c.c. of sterile culture
medium which was distributed over a number of Petri dishes. If these are left undis-
turbed for a few days colonies of different diatoms will develop at different spots on
the bottom of the dish. These were picked out with pipettes and transferred into
