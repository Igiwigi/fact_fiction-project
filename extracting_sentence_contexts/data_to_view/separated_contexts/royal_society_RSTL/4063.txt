6. Register of a term-day, September 23% 10" to 22%, with a photographic base-
line; on which the Greenwich observations were laid down at the Royal
Observatory. This register well illustrates a fact that has been frequently
noticed, namely, the gradual subsidence of slow excursions into-small and
brief disturbances. The scale is 15' to 1 inch.
