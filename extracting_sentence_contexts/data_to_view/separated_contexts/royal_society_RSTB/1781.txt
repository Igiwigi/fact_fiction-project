Perrozzo has
adopted this system also for the representation of demographical facts, withont any relation to
their topographical distribution, that is, without referring to a geographical substratum. We arrive

the fundamental requirement of statistical diagrams, that is, to show the change of the facts to the eye
directly, in an immediate way, without appealing to a mental process, for instance, to the view of
figures, This is not the case with isohypsos; one line is like the other, and thus we do not know by
