(a) Localization and subsystems in quantum gravity

LQFT furnishes an example of the role of such a mathematical structure. As described in the
algebraic approach (see e.g. [24]), this mathematical structure arises from the manifold M on
which the LOFT is defined. Associated with any open set U Cc M, there is a subalgebra Ay C A of
the observables with support only in U (e.g. fields smeared with compact-support test functions).
For spacelike separates open sets U, U’, the subalgebras Ay and Ay commute. Moreover, these
subalgebras have nesting and intersection properties just like the open sets. So, the subalgebras
‘mirror’ the topological structure of the manifold given by the open sets, along with the causal
structure. This ‘net’ of subalgebras is the mathematical structure relevant to describing LQFT.
However, this does not appear to be the correct mathematical structure for describing a
gravitational theory. In fact, already at the perturbative level, we discover that this local algebraic
structure must fail. Consider a scalar field ¢(x), coupled to gravity. While [¢(x),@(y)] =0 for
spacelike x-y, (x) is not a gauge-invariant observable. Gauge observables can be constructed

associated with a particle created by $(x).
