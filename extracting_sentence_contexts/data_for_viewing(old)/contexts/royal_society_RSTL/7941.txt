(D, B), and (D, c) (or what is the same thing (a, B)) respectively.

We have

which is the s0lution : the value obtained above was b=1+z, and we in fact have iden-
tically
i+z=—37—3X +2.

It was in this manner that I originally applied the principle of correspondence to inves-
— tigating the number of inflections of a curve, regarding, however, the term x as a special

s0lution ; it is better to put the cusp and inflection on the same footing as above.
