if B be not a positive or negative integer (zero included). In fact, the difference
between f,(«;0) and this expression can, when % («)> 1/2, be expanded in the
absolutely convergent series

This theorem I first prove for the case when 3 (@)>/'>1, by means of contour
integrals similar to those employed throughout this memoir, and then extend to all
values of 6 such that p> 1, by means of the difference formule for multiple Riemann
¢ functions.
IV. Whether 8 be integral or not, in fact, for all values of B of finite modulus,
provided the points +n, n = 0, 1, 2,...0 all lie outside the circle of convergence

where C’ is a contour which embraces the positive half of the real axis and includes
within its bulb the circle of convergence of y (y).
