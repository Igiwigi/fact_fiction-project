It appears to us that as a group the salts of the compound ammonias have a
complex action : they affect the spinal cord, motor nerves, and muscles. The extent
to which these structures are affected by the different compounds varies with each
compound,

The spinal cord appears to be first stimulated, and then paralyzed. The sgymptoms
which lead us to suppose that it is first stimulated are the twitchings which occur in
the early stage in Rabbits and Rats, when poisoned with the substances mentioned in
the tables, and the convulsions which occur in Frogs poisoned by ethylamine and
tetraethylamine-iodide, That the spinal cord is paralyzed at a later stage, both as a
conductor of motor stimuli and as a reflex centre, we infer from the failure of reflex
action both in Frogs and Mammals, and from the fact that a stimulus applied to the
hind foot frequently induces motion, not of the corresponding hind leg, but of one of
the fore legs.

The conyulsions which occur shortly before death in mammals are, perhaps, to
be regarded as due, not to the irritant action of the poison on the nerve centres, but
rather possibly to its paralyzing action on the motor nerves : this motor paralysis
causes enfeebled breathing, and a consequent venous condition of the blood with
asphyxial conyulsions. That the compound ammonias and their salts paralyze the
motor nerves is shown by our direct experiments on the nerve muscle preparation, in
which the nerves were almost always paralyzed before the muscle, The muscles,
however, are by no means unaffectedâ€”at first their power may seem to be increased,
80 that they respond by a more powerful contraction to irritation ; afterwards,
