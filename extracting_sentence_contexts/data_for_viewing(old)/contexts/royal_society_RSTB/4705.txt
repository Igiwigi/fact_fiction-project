March and June, and the dinoflagellates attain their maximum about a month later.
Both groups have a smaller second maximum in the late autumn (19).

Thus the maxima for the soil population coincide closely with those of the marine
and fresh-water plankton, except that whereas the aquatic forms are most active in
spring and only show a minor phase of activity in autumn, the reverse appears to be
true in the soil. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that the annual variations are
produced by similar causes in each case. If this assumption is correct, it follows that
the seasonal changes in protozoal numbers in the soil are not determined solely by the
number of bacteria present, in spite of the fact that bacteria are probably the only
food supply of the species in question, for the aquatic algze which show such closely
similar seasonal changes are not dependent on such a food supply. ‘This conclusion is
supported by the fact that the number of all the protozoa except Oicomonas rose
during March, whereas the corresponding increase in the bacteria was delayed till the
beginning of April.

The annual fluctuations in aquatic organisms agree further with those in the soil
organisms in having little if any close relation with temperature. A marked annual

periodicity was found by ApsTErN (1) even in a lake in Ceylon, where the total range
of temperature during the year was from 25°94° C. in November to 28'28° in May.
On the other hand, the fresh-water organisms are influenced very considerably by rain-
