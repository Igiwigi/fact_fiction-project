Upon theſe Conſiderations it was conjectured, as
no Circuit had as yet been found large enough ſo
to diſſipate the electrical Power as not to make it

perceptible,” that if the non-electrical Conductors
were properly diſpoſed, an Obſerver might be made
ſenſible of the electrical Commotion quite acroſs
the: River Thames, by the Communication of no
other Medinm'than the Water of that River. | But
as perhaps, in what relates to Electricity leſs than in
any other Parr of Natural Philoſophy, we ſhould
draw Concluſions but from the Facts themſelves, it
was determined to make the Experiment. The making” this Experiment drew on many
others, and as\ the Gentlemen concerned flatter
themſelves , that they were: made with ſome De-
gree of Attention and Accuracy, they thought it not
improper to lay a Detail of all 'the Operations re-
lating thercto, before the Royal Society. In order to try whether or no the electrical Com-
motion would be perceptible acroſs the Thames, it
was abſolutely neceſſary that a Line of non-clectric
Matter, equal in Length to the Breadth of the Ri-
ver, ſhould be laid over it ſo as to touch the Water
thereof in no Part of its Length ; and the Bridge at
Weſtminſter was thought the moſt proper for that
Purpoſe, where the Water from Shore ro Shore was
ſomewhat more than 400 Yards.
