nanodisc diameter to D = 500 nm and its height to H = 150 nm. Figure 3a shows the transmittance
of the hybrid system for a variation of the gold nanorod length. Clearly, the electric and the
magnetic dipole resonances of the silicon nanodisc interact very differently with the plasmonic
resonance. While a simple resonance crossing is observed for the electric dipole resonance, an
anticrossing behaviour is observed for the magnetic dipole resonance. An anticrossing is the
signature of strong coupling between two resonators, leading to a hybridization of the resonator
modes. It occurs whenever the coupling strength, which determines the size of the mode splitting,
is larger than the losses in the system, which determine the width of the resonances. Anticrossings
can be observed for any strongly coupled resonator system independent of the physical origin of
the resonant excitations. For example, similar anticrossing behaviour was previously also found
for coupling between ferromagnetic resonance magnon modes and electromagnetic resonance
modes [39,40]. As such, in our hybrid system, the fact that we see a clear anticrossing indicates
the formation of a pair of plasmonic-photonic hybrid modes. The hybrid nature of the modes is
further underpinned by their mode profiles. The interference of the optical near-fields excited in
the nanostructure with the incident radiation is shown in figure 3b for the parameters marked
