The new form is apparently differentiated from its parent in respect to a
single character only, that of colour, and this albinism would appear to be associated
with the absence of a factor for chromogen. .The change has occurred once only,
and has given rise to a form unknown in nature and perfectly constant under all
conditions. It would seem possible to place only one interpretation on these facts,
that of mutation, and accordingly when I was privileged to exhibit this form to the
Linnean Society of London on April 8, 1919, I described it as “an albino mutant of
Botrytis cinerea.” Previous records of mutation in the fungi fall into two groups. In the first are
those changes in genetic constitution which appear to bear a direct and purposive
relation to certain conditions which have operated during the development of the
organism or that of the preceding generation.
