% According to MaxweEtt’s doctrine, the true electric current is always circuital, and
as the sum of the conduction current and the current of displacement, which is the
‘Sime rate of increase of the displacement. But, to preserve circuitality, we must add
Bhe convection current when electrification is moving, so that the true current
