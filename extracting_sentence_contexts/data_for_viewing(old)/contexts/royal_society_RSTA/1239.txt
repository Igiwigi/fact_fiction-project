other words, Xo of (4.1) is the subspace of functions on the unit shell that do not depend on
the radius, and we have an example of relation (5.1)) Moreover, the Robin boundary conditions
describe disappearance of diffusing inactive kinases at the cell’s membrane (i.e. activation of these
kinases); in the limit, this becomes a description of kinases’ activation at a point of the unit sphere,
which is no longer a boundary but the state-space of the underlying diffusion process.


The papers [26,27] extend the result just described to the case where there are two thin layers Lo |
lying on two sides of a semi-permeable membrane. The role of boundary conditions is then played

by various sorts of transmission conditions, but the effect is the same: transmission conditions 13
become integral parts of the limit master equation, and describe jumps of a limit process from 1S
one side of the membrane to the other. The fact that the same biological phenomenon, depending : gS
on ‘geometry’, may be described by a boundary /transmission condition or a term in the master 13

equation is thoroughly discussed, and connections to the underlying, so-called Lévy local time of
stochastic process are drawn.

7. An introduction to asymptotic stability: the Perron—Frobenius theorem

Let us turn to the question of asymptotic stability: a good starting point is a continuous version of : Fd
the classical Perron—Frobenius theorem. To recall it, let X be the space R” with the scalar product if
(-,-). If x = (&)i=1,...n € X then we write x > 0 when & > 0 and x > 0 when é > 0 for i=1,2,...,n. 2m
Let Q= (qij)i<ij<n be an n xn real matrix. Then the formula T(H)x = xe! defines a semigroup : =
{T(t), t = 0} on X. We assume that a
