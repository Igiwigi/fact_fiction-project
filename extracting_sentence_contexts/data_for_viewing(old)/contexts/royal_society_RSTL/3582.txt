another, at the commencement of the green ; and if another, at that of the blue rays:
that, in the case of one description of paper, the maximum of apparent action should
lie beyond, jn that of another within the visible violet; in a third far in upon the blue;
while in a fourth several successive maxima should appear. Still less would any


RAYS OF THE SOLAR SPECTRUM ON PREPARATIONS OF SILVER, ETC. 17

& priori conclusion prepare us for differences in the kind of action at different points
of the spectrum, as manifested by differences of colour produced, or for what at first
sight appears yet more singular, the shifting upon the spectrum itself of the points
where these differences of action commence and terminate, Nor, lastly, could any
penetration enable us to anticipate a fact s0 totally at variance with all our ideas, as
that two rays of different refrangibilities, (and therefore of different lengths of undu-
lation) acting at once, should produce an effect which neither of them acting sepa-
rately is competent to produce at all; a fact which seems difficult to deal with on
any theory of light. These are but a few of the many singular resalts which promise
to render this field of research, hardly yet entered upon, as replete with novelty, va-
riety, and interest, as any other department in the vast field of physical optics.

51. My first experiments on this sn√æject were directed to the detection of inactive
Spaces (if any) in the chemical spectrum, analogous to the dark lines of WoLLastoN
and FraUNHoFER in the luminous one. Possessing at the time no means of fixing a
sunbeam of large area, I operated coarsely with a prism placed horizontally. The
light was introduced through a narrow slit, and the time chosen for experiment when
