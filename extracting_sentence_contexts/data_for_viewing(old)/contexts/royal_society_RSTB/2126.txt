closure.{ The balance was, however, rather in favour of the non-sleeping plants,
among which I found about 12 per cent. clearly open at night, among the sleepers
only one species out of eighteen observed was clearly open, but about 20 per cent.
were just perceptibly open. In the spring of the present year I determined to make
more observations, and these showed my former calculations to be incorrect. When
observations are made on plants at a fairly high temperature, the difference between
sleepers and non-sleepers comes out clearly.

bright light (not sunshine) gave with the hygroscope 25 to 30, while a control plant in duller light was at
12 to 10. Similar differences occur in 2. Ficaria, and doubtless in other species.

* This percentage is probably too high, since I was guided to some of the above plants by the wish
to test Leiraxn’s facts.
