The second source of error, starting with the sixth differ-
ence, is usually small compared with the neglect of third and higher differences at the
boundary. The latter is likely to be really serious, since the boundary is the place where the
biharmonic solution is least well behaved in the computational sense. It is therefore suggested, just as in the case of second-order equations, that the fictitious
point be obtained in terms of internal and boundary points by the use of more accurate

finite-difference formulae. The same objective can of course be attained, as in example 1,
by an iterative procedure in which simple, inaccurate formulae are used to obtain a first
approximation, the errors of which are assessed and inserted as new residuals for the pro-
duction of a better approximation, and so on.
