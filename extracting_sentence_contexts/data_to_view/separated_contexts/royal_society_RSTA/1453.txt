In fact, such models provide scientific
underpinning to Bauman’s illuminating metaphor of a liquid society as one where the rules
change faster than most individuals can adjust to, leaving the majority behind [13]. Influencing
human behaviour through ‘healthy’ social pressure and flow of ideas is a noble goal, albeit one
which walks on a high wire, the name of the (bad) game being plain manipulation for profit. More
precisely, what is hailed as pursuit of knowledge and innovation is, in fact, a very different goal,
named zero sales resistance. Zero sales resistance is an obvious goal for the most rapacious forms of capitalism, spinning
around the ‘money for money’s sake’ paradigm, instead of more enlightened forms of capitalism,
in which money is the just and natural follow-on from healthy innovation, filling genuine societal

gaps.

x<c,thenc—x~c. The damage done by BD brainware at the service of rapacious capitalism is all too evident:
acquisition of private data in return for the dream of ‘celebrity for everyone’, is a super-clever
strategy, as it hits at the very roots of human weakness.
