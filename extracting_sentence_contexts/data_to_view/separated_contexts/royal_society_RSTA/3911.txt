However, the pKas of the metal aquo :
complexes of the metal ions being considered in this work are very similar, with an average pKa a]
of 9.7 + 0.6 across all five metal ions. Therefore, one would expect at most a contribution of 1 kcal DNS
mol! to the differences in activation barrier from differences in nucleophile pKa, whereas the aon
actual differences in activation barrier that are observed both experimentally and computationally [DG
(figure 3; electronic supplementary material, tables $1 and $2) can be as high as 4 kcal mol~? .
between the different metals. Thus, differences in nucleophile pK, are not enough to explain the
origins of the metal-ion selectivity of MPH, especially taking into account the fact that we are
able to reproduce both qualitative and quantitative trends between different metal ions using a
classical model that does not explicitly describe ligand-to-metal charge transfer. The second catalytic role of the metal ions in the MPH active site is to act as Lewis acids, thus
stabilizing the ground and transition states of the reactions involved [3,17,57]. From table 1, it
can be seen that for both the neutral organophosphate and the anionic aryl ester, the transition
states are geometrically very similar between the different metal ions.
