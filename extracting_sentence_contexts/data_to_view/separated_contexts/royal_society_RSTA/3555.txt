Rotation as before will tend
to instability, and the factor which makes for stability will be the elasticity of
the gas. We can now see that there is nothing inherently impossible, or even improbable,
in the supposition that for a gaseous nebula the symmetrical configuration may
become unstable even in the absence of rotation. The question which we shall
primarily attempt to answer is, whether or not this is, in point of fact, a possible
occurrence, and if so, under what circumstances it will take place. To investigate
this problem, it will be sufficient to consider the vibrations of a non-rotating nebula
about a configuration of spherical symmetry. ยง 3.
