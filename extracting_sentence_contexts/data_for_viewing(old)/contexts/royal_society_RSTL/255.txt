From a careful examination of the preceding facts, we must
now be prepared to infer, that all the peculiar phenomena of
mother of pearl, as seen by reflection and transmission, are
owing to a particular configuration of surface ; that the communi-
cation of these properttes to other bodies, is the necessary consequence
of the communication of its superficial structure ; and that none of
the light which is concerned in the production of these phenomena,
has penetrated the surface of the mother of pearl.

What this configuration of surface is, and in what manner it
generates the coloured images, are points of high interest, and
of corresponding difficulty. The facts naturally lead us to
conjecture, that the extraordinary reflections are produced by
faces, either curved or rectilineal, slightly inclined to the
general surface of the mother of pearl. In attempting to
determine this point, I anticipated no assistance from micro-
scopical observations, as it was contrary to all our notions
of the action of bodies upon light, to imagine that a plate of
mother of pearl reflecting an image as perfectly as the mirror
of a telescope, could exhibit to the human eye any superficial
irregularities, These anticipations however were wholly
erroneous. By the application of single microscopes with
powers of 200, goo, and even 400, I have discovered in almost
every specimen of mother of pearl, an elementary grooved
