approach, and in fact would be a more appropriate method to analyse data in
which information about time to event is known in discrete time intervals
(interval censoring). Moreover, although our estimator was based on discrete
time to event, the half-widths of the 95% Wald CI of the estimator proposed here
and that from the Anderson-Gill method were very similar. The difference was
negligible in all simulation scenarios and at most 0.001.
