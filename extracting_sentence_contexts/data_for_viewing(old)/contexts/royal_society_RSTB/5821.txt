In view of these fundamental resemblances in the structure, it is remarkable how
distinct the two plants were in habit. Z. primaria was no doubt a tree-fern of large
size. In comparison, Botryoxylon paradoxum was a slender plant, with the leaves
placed at long intervals on a branched, probably creeping, rhizome.t Other points
of difference lay in the size of the stele, the structure of the cortex, the position of the
roots and the aphlebie.

* For example, clepsydroid petioles having essentially the same structure were present both in “ Clep-
sydropsis ” australis and in Asterochlenopsis ; see Saunt (1930), p. 463, fig. 4; pp. 465-467.

+ Scorr (1912, p. 380) mentions a petiole of Htapleris Scotti associated with the Botrychioxylon, but
adds that there is also an Ankyropteris. The latter, however, can scarcely have belonged to the Botry-
chioxylon. The facts now brought forward make this all the more unlikely, and at the same time enhance
the possibility that Htapleris Scotti was the petiole of B. paradoxum (which may thus ultimately have to be
re-named Zygopteris Scotti), But no one would assert this without further evidence.

} Ina stem of this habit the great development of secondary wood is difficult to explain physiologically ;
perhaps it is a useless legacy from some erect ancestor.

On the whole, the resemblances far outweigh the differences: no doubt the two
plants were very closely allied, if not co-generic. The difference in habit, however
striking, is not inconsistent with generic identity* ; the other points are also of minor
