That is to say,
I have projected by periods (corresponding to the intervals of observation on the
glaciers) the mean temperatures as observed at Geneva and at the Great St. Bernard,
which are regularly published in the Bibliotheque Universelle, the average of which
(separately deduced from the mean of daily maxima and minima, and projected in
the upper part of the figure) may represent not inaptly the average temperature to
which the glaciers in question, and especially the middle and lower regions of them,
are exposed ; and further, this average possesses the advantage of being derived from
data wholly unconnected with the place or parties where and by whom the observa-
tions on the motion of the glaciers were made, and therefore are free from the re-
motest 8uspicion of either in any degree influencing the other.

* This explains a circumstance which has always hitherto been a difficulty to me; the united testimony of
the best-informed inhabitants, not only at Chamouni but elsewhere (as at Zermatt and at the Simplon),
to the effect that during winter the lowest end of a glacier, which terminates in a valley, does not greatly pro-
trude, nor force the snow before it. This arises in fact from the comparative smallness of the motion which

the tongue of such a glacier appears to possess, especially in winter.
