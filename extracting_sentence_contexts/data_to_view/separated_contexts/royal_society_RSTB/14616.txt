In comparison to wild-type
tRNA alleles; however, the tRNA or tRNASYecc A3G:
U70 variants showed no change in mCherry fluorescence per
cell in HEK 293T cells (figure 5a,c), similar to our observations
in N2a cells.

(f) Cell-specific cytotoxicity of transfer RNA-dependent

mistranslation

In N2a cells expressing tRNASKq, we observed significant
cytotoxicity induced by Ser mis-incorporation at Phe
codons. By contrast, in HEK 293T cells we found no signifi-
cant change in toxicity in cells expressing tRNAXG, versus
tRNAXK,. The fact that protein synthesis is repressed in
HEK 293T cells expressing tRNAXA, (figure 5a,c) suggests
that mistranslation occurs at a level that does not cause
increased levels of cell death (figure 6a). The data indicate
that the level of RNA-dependent mistranslation or its associ-
ated phenotypic defects may be cell specific. For each of the
tRNA“ and tRNA variants we recorded no changes in
cytotoxicity in HEK 293T cells (figure 6a), similar to our
findings in N2a cells above.

(g) Mistranslation in the context of proteasome
inhibition

Since mass spectrometry confirmed Ala mis-incorporation is
caused by natural human tRNA“ and tRNA®Y variants, we
hypothesized that additional stress on the cell could reveal a
phenotypic defect associated with Ala mis-incorporation at
Gly codons.
