give the satellite multiples, but as the oun is so small, 3, = 3°62, the close agreement
cannot serve as evidence one way or the other as to the satellite nature of the doublet

and triplet lines in question. The points against the allocation of these lines to the
normal D group are, (1) the satellite separations are not in the usual ratio 5:3 (they
are in fact close to the ratio 3:5), (2) there is no appearance of satellite lines
corresponding to the parallel F lines noted above, and (3) the limit 53081 is somewhat
larger than we should expect from the march of the limits in the other gases.

Taking it, however, as the limit, it is possible with the given value of A, to
calculate the link e, The result is 197+4d»,. The occurrency curve as found from
B’s and W.’s observations is given in Plate 2, fig. 6. The dotted line is the result
when the numerous rough measures by L.D. are included. As is seen the maxima
occur at 195°6 and 198, the calculated, at a minimum. The peaks look as if analogous
to corresponding peaks found in other elements, but the analogy is doubtful. In the
other elements these (much larger ones) are produced by the prevalence of displace-
ments by a few ouns, and by A, operating on (a3) S(*). Such changes here would
be very small and the corresponding effects are really shown by the flattened tops of
