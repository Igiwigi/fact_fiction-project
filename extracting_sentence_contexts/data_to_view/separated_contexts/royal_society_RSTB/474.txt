Reference to the plates
will show that all the specimens showing a solid coracoid region belong to A. owent
(1, Plate 17, figs. 233, 234, 235, and 237), while those in which a poogasaoid is
present are all either A. australis or A.-bulleri. The specimens upon which the present paper is founded are all examples of A.
australis, and they bring to light the remarkable fact that there are striking specific
differences in the development of the shoulder-girdle. Even in F’, which, as already
remarked, is only slightly more advanced than F of the former paper, there is a dis-
tinct coracoid fenestra, and the procoracoid is not formed of hyaline cartilage. This
point is still clearer in G’ (Plate 8, fig. 12), in which, except for the absence of ossifica-
tion, the shoulder-girdle has the characters which my former observations indicated
as being characteristic of the ripe embryo.
