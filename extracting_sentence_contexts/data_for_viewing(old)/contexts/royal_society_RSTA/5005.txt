and they lived well in a substantial house with several servants.

In 1823, the family moved to Swinton nearby. The young James Joule was not a healthy child
and a spinal weakness gave him a slight, though not pronounced, deformity. He did not attend
school and was tutored at home where he made slow progress. Unsurprisingly, he was shy in
company. Indeed, Joule was never able to command respect by the force of a strong personality
and this may well account for his comparative obscurity outside the scientific community. He
needed the support of someone who possessed the gifts he lacked, but it was not until 1847 that he
found that person in the shape of William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin (1824-1907), who, although
6 years younger, had no trouble with self-publicity. Until then Joule struggled, publishing papers
of major scientific importance but making almost no impact whatsoever.

'n fact, the energy content of food is always quoted in kilojoules or kilocalories, the joule and calorie being very small
quantities in this context. Common discourse tends to ignore the factor of 1000!


The definitive account of Joule’s life and work is the book by Donald Cardwell [1]. In 3 |
Cardwell’s description of Joule’s formative years, he stresses the important influence of John

Dalton (1766-1844), a local teacher and natural philosopher with radical scientific ideas who was 3
an early proponent of the billiard-ball atomic theory of gases. From 1834 to 1837, James and his : s
elder brother Benjamin studied under Dalton, receiving twice weekly sessions on arithmetic, :<
geometry, chemistry and physics. Joule’s fascination with experimental work started in this : 3S
period but he did not acquire his obsession with experimental precision from Dalton. According 1g
