The most striking way to exhibit the characteristics of a spectral series is to plot n* â€”n
against the term value, as is done in figure 1. On such a plot, a series obeying a Ritz formula

n* = n+-+-aT, appears as astraight line with slope and intercepta. When ordinary doublet
series are plotted in this way, there appears a characteristic which apparently has not been
mentioned in the literature, the component series plot as nearly parallel lines. This means
that the difference in the coupling of / and s affects the value of # but not ofa. In the present
case of a d-electron coupled to a 4D, core it is evident from figure 4 that quite the reverse
effect is present. In fact, all the series which arise from d,, are parallel to each other as are
those arising from d,,. Between the two groups, however, there is a large difference in slope.
In other words, in this case the spin-orbit coupling of the d-electron produces a large differ-
ence in a rather than in z. The same effect is present in the other groups built on 7D and 'D
but it is less obvious because the analysis is less complete and less certain.

TERM TABLES

Most of the essential information about the copper atom deducible from the spectrum is
given in tables 1 and 2. In addition to the energy levels of Cur there are included the chief
levels of Cum to which the Cur series converge. The Rydberg denominators are, of course,
calculated from the distance of each level from its proper limit in Cutt.
