anaesthesia has the same effects in species as different as
humans or flies. It may not even stop there. Plants such as
the Venus flytrap stop responding to stimulation of their trig-
ger hairs (normally excited by prey insects) when exposed to
ether [78], a volatile anaesthetic also working in man.” The
natural counterpart of anaesthesia—sleep—is equally ubiqui-
tous in the animal and plant kingdoms. Animals that do not
sleep have yet to be found [79], and many plants show clearly
different metabolic activity patterns (and appearances)
during day and night. We experience the difference between
awake and asleep as one of the most fundamental transitions

of consciousness, and the fact that conscious sensations are
lost during sleep is possibly the number one reason why
we believe there is consciousness. If this transition between
awake and asleep is present in all living beings, does that
imply that to these other beings the transition ‘feels’ equally
dramatic? And does it then follow that these beings should,
therefore, be granted consciousness—when awake? We run
into similar problems when we assign specific functions as
central to consciousness. Cognitive function like attention,
access or metacognition, often linked to consciousness in
‘type 1’ theories, seem similarly widespread throughout the
animal kingdom. Attentional processes such as increased
reaction times in the presence of distractors, or the suppres-
