Still lower down, at the lower end of the medulla, both pyramids sink deeply
towards the central canal; previous to decussation, however, numerous fibres cross
to the opposite side in the bundle of the sensory decussation, and with the latter
fibres they lose themselves in the hinder tegmental region.

It seems very probable that the fibres described above serve to counect the
pyramidal system with the motor centres of the quadrigeminal region and bulb.
The decussation of the pyramid is thus not confined to the upper cervical region, but,
as one would expect, is gradually taking place during the descent of the pyramid
through the bulbar segments. As has already been seen, the majority of the fibres
decussate ; a few, however, and this is notably the case in the quadrigeminal region,
appear to remain on the same side. This again accords with the fact that there are
also direct and crossed paths to the motor centres of the cord.
