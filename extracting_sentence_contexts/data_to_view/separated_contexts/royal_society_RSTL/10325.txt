In most,
if nob in all cases, this fact impressed itself strongly on my attention, and I believe
the observation is correct. At the 8ame time we must remember that the © yellow
cells ”—if they are 8ymbiotic algazz—only give oxygen up to the tissues of the animal,
which would still require to be ized in the tissues by a combination with something
else, such as actiniohzmatin or other pigments ; s0 that too much importance ought
not to be attached to the apparent absence or presence of such pigments in the
ectoderm, endoderm, or other parts. Their absence too ought nob to be concluded
from the mere fact that they cannot be detected in certain solutions of these
parts, as there is no doubt that they cannot always be got into such solutions even
when present. Besides these pigments of a direct respiratory use, there are others which appear to
be of use for decorative purposes, and to this class Professor MosELEY's actiniochrome
belongs. TI always found (with one or two doubtful exceptions) that this is a pigment
confined to the tentacles, and, as already stated, it cannot be changed into anything
capable of being oxidised and reduced ; but whether it is intended for a protective
purpose or as a means of attracting prey, further research may decide.
