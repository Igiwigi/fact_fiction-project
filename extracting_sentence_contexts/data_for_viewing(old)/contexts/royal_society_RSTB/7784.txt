(1) Calcite (b) Diagenesis

The calcarenites consist of calcareous particles of sand grade cemented by a granular
mosaic of calcite. The process of granular cementation is familiar and comparatively well
understood (Bathurst 1958) and calls for no special comment. The important problem
about the Sutton Stone concerns the nature of the embedded particles. Flett examined
a thin section for the Geological Survey and concluded that they were recrystallized shell
fragments coated by calcite mud (Strahan e¢ al. 1904, p. 60). Trueman, on the other hand,
took them to be recrystallized grains of detrital limestone. However, undoubted detrital
cacilutite grains are numerous at certain conglomeratic horizons and are never recrystal-
lized to a coarse mosaic. But the recrystallized grains show transitions to unaltered pele-
cypod and echinoderm fragments and often have an irregular shape incompatible with an
inorganic origin (figure 24, plate 2). These facts, taken with the macroscopic evidence of
abundant shelly matter, provide conclusive evidence for Flett’s interpretation. The intense
recrystallization to which the shelly matter has been subjected is probably related to the
freedom of movement of fluids in the original porous sand. The calcite mud rim invites
comparison with the concentric laminae of ooliths and it would not be misleading to
describe the grains of the Sutton Stone as incipient or superficial ooliths.

At a comparatively late stage, when the rocks were consolidated, stylolites developed,
presumably through a process of pressure solution, as is gencrally assumed.
