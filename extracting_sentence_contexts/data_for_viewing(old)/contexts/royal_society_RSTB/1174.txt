any one path by excitation of different regions.

The plan upon which the present paper is framed is, first, to give a historical
retrospect of the work of authors who have opened up the study of electrical
changes in the central and peripheral nervous system ; second, to describe at length
our mode of experimentation, with special reference to the modifications which
we have introduced, then to compare roughly the results we have obtained by our
present method with those which had been previously ascertained by the graphic
method, and so introduce the description of the facts which we have discovered,
elucidating the physiology of the spinal cord both in its relation to the higher centres
and to the peripheral nerves. In describing the detailed results of our experiments
we have found that it is difficult, from the extent of ground covered by the subject,
to adopt a convenient arrangement of facts, and mode of describing the same, which
are free from the fault of repetition. We finally determined to gather the results
together into definite groups, each associated with the excitation and investigation of
particular regions, and refer in the briefest manner to any important principles which
were not directly elucidated by, but only involved in, the particular experiments
under consideration. Finally, we give at length a summary of the general conclusions
which we consider we are justified in drawing from our experimental results.*

disposal the instruments and equipment of the Physiological Laboratory of the University of Oxford.
We are also under especial obligations to Mr. G. F. Burcn, whose constructive skill provided us with
the requisite electrometers, and who very kindly gave his assistance in preparing our photographic
records. .
