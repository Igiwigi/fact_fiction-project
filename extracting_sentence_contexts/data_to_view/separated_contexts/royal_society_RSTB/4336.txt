STOPES ON THE NEW BENNETTITEAN

section, which is that estimated as a fair average in work of this type, this gives a
probably vertical height of the whole cone of about 5 mm. In this space the
rudiments of both the ¢ and the ? organs are recognisable. The fact that there
are distinct indications of male organs is most interesting, as hitherto we have had
no petrifactions of bisporangiate Bennettites from this country or of this geological
horizon, though older “impressions” of Williamsonias are comparatively common,
and THomas (1915) has recently obtained many specimens of an interesting new form
of bisporangiate axis in an allied genus. The diagram in text-fig. 25, p. 482, shows a restoration of the relations of the parts
of B. maximus which is based on the series of transverse sections of the two cones
available. There are no vertical sections of cones with which to compare it, so the
figure is avowedly crudely diagrammatic, but as it brings out the marked differences
in the proportions of the parts between this species and WrELaNnp’s bisporangiate
cones, it may be of interest to compare it with his diagrams,

The details of the various parts of the fructifications will now be considered.
