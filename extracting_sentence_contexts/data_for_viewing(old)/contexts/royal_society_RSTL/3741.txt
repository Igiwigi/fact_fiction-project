bar was brought into the centre of the hollow cylinder in which it swung and held
there; the forces were all in action, and therefore all phenomena of induction passed ;
the arrangement of the forces being that shown in fig. 40, on releasing the bar it was

driven from the cores, whereas when the arrangement was that shown in fig. 41, it
was drawn towards them.

But it does not sufficiently express the facts to say that the bar is capable of two
different states of excitement ; it must be added, that both states exist simultaneously
in the excited bar, We have already proved that the state necessary for the action
of one pole is not that which enables an opposite pole to produce the same action ;
hence, when the two ends of the bar are attracted or repelled, at the same time, by
two opposite poles, it is a proof that these two ends are in different states. But if
this be correct, we can test our conclusion by reyersing one of the poles; the direc-
tion of its force being thereby changed, it ought to hold the other pole in check and
prevent all motion in the bar. This is the case: if, in any one of the instances cited,
the polarity of either of the cores be altered ; if the south be converted into a north,
or the north into a south pole, thus making both poles of the same quality, the repul-
Sion of the one is 80 nearly balanced by the attraction of the other, that the bar re-
mains without motion towards either of them.
