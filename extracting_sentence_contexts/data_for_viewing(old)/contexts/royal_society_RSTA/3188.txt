so that £J and JL are self-adjoint (note that J-! =-J). Observe also that the spectrum of L is
2ni-periodic, because e** Ztw(t) =e +2)" (Ze (z) e2"*7) and Ztw(t) e~2""* is also a travelling
wave with velocity 1. This symmetry is due to the fact that the shift operators $, commute with
the multiplier eT for ne Z. Owing to the time-translation invariance of the solution Xtw, an
important property of L is that its kernel contains

C0 = 07 Xtw, (3.7)

as can be directly verified by differentiating (3.1) in t and evaluating the result at X = Xtw.
Here we assume the generic situation when ker(L) =span{eo}. Similarly, we have ker(L*) =
span{J~teo}. Next, we observe that (eo,J~teo) =0, where (-,-) denotes the inner product in
D°({0, 1]). This implies that e9 € (ker(£*))+ = im (L), and thus there exists e; € D'({0,1]) such that
eo = Lei, so that the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue 4 =0 for L is at least two. In fact,
differentiating (3.2) in c, we obtain cL(d-Xtw) = 7 Xtw, SO

e1 =COcXtw (3.8)

satisfies Le; =eg and thus represents a generalized eigenvector of £ associated with the zero
eigenvalue.

As we have seen, the spectrum of £ always contains at least a double eigenvalue at zero.
Following a similar argument, one finds that the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue 4 = 0 is
higher than two if and only if there exists e2 € D!({0,1]) such that Ley =e), which is equivalent to

(e1,J~‘e0) =0. (3.9)
