map, p. 367). The outcrop of the so-called grey measures of the two coalfields is in
fact continuous near Bridgnorth, where, however, it is very narrow, being only a few
hundred yards across. The red rocks of the Permians (so-called) are, however,
continuous over a very much wider area. In Coalbrookdale and Wyre Forest we
are in fact dealing with a single area, but this is of so large an extent, and the
geology of the northern half is so very different from that of the southern that it is
more than a matter of convenience to subdivide the whole region into two natural
areas—Coalbrookdale and Wyre Forest. We shall have to discuss in some detail,
at a later stage, the relationships of these two districts.

As we shall see from the historical sketch, which forms the next section of this
paper, the geology of the Wyre Forest is very complicated, and at present very
little understood. This is largely due to the fact that the Forest, regarded from
a coal-winning standpoint, is only a minor coalfield, and consequently but little
attention has been devoted to the elucidation of its structure. It has not been
my intention to investigate this area from a purely geological point of view,
nor indeed has the time necessary for such a gigantic task, if undertaken single-
handed, been at my disposal. My object has, however, been to ascertain what light
the study of the fossil floras of the productive measures of the Wyre Forest throws
on its geology, and especially on the question of its relationship to the Midland and
Pennine coalfields. As we shall see, this line of inquiry has not previously been
pursued in this area. Further I have confined my attention, for the present, to the
productive or so-called grey measures, and I have not concerned myself with the red
rocks of the so-called ‘‘ Lower Permian,’ which there is some reason to believe are of
Upper Coal Measure or Keele age.
