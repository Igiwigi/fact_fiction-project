(c) If the synchronism between the wings and halteres is upset by cutting the wings
(raising the wing-beat frequency), there is a clear indication in the movements of the haltere
of an interaction between the two frequencies, the amplitude of the haltere movement
varying at the beat frequency of the two oscillations,

These experiments, considered together with the fact that the haltere is a mechanically
resonant system, suggest that in the normal fly the frequency of the haltere oscillation
is ‘locked’ to that of the wing-beat by a mechanical interaction between the two systems,
that this ‘locking’ is effective only when the natural frequencies of the two systems are
nearly the same, and that the two can function independently when either is upset. To
this must be added also the inherent independence of the halteres on the two sides of the
body; the wings are necessarily coupled through their common motivating mechanisms.

(4) The absolute magnitude of the forces involved
An approximate estimate can be made of the absolute magnitude of the various torques
present at the base of the haltere. The average fresh weights of the halteres of C. erythro-
cephala are as follows:
