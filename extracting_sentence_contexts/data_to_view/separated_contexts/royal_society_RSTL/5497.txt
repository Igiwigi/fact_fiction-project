The expression (m3—7)-! is equivalent to (() —#) , if #=log tang; and this

may be resolved into either of the two following forms; namely,

or (i) WE)

The former, omitting the useless factor 4, gives

ONO AE 6\' (LS ERA VE
(tan; (® anp(<ot3 2) —(coty) (a) ging (tan 5 2)

the latter, taking the lower signs, gives

TESLA ag 0* Neale;
(tang) (@ an7(cotg) (®) == ang). Either of these expressions 1s to be substituted in (33.), and thus the complete value
of 1, is obtained by means of n+2 TI apy n PE nn: Tn general the

n integrations implied in the expression "0 are useless, 50 that we may
Sin = 5 8In ni

substitute 0 for this expression, as was done in the process first given, without ultimate
loss of completeness.
19. If we suppose 7 an integer, and less than z, we may stop the process of art. 17 at
an earher stage, thus
U=ZD,D-1: + T5,
and
T,T,_;.-.Tq.,o,v_g=0,

UL=T,W,:-- T0, a or. 03

or, reducing as before, and observing that 7; is equivalent to

(ﬆin 0) (F) (m9),
we have, finally,

«,=(5in0)-"(5in045n0)" (sn0(4) (5n0)*(c2; ON = AK - (34)

If in this expression we put 0 for the result of all but one of the operations indicated in
the last term, we reproduce the form (21.) obtained in art. 9, which appears in fact to
be always complete. The form (34.), however, as before remarked, will never contain
superfluous constants.

20. It is an interesting question whether the forms thus obtained on the supposition
that # is an integer, are not really general, inasmuch as they are expressible without
reference to that supposition.
