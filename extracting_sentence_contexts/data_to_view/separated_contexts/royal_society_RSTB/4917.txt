The
upper section is seven years above the wound and the lower one five below it, the wound
being where there are seventeen annual rings. It must not be inferred, however, that
the fact of a relatively greater response above than below the wound is essential to the
accumulation of canals in the inner years above. The absolute extent and the fact
that it passes through the nodal region into the younger years are the determining
- factors. The reason for the great extent of the vertical response in comparison with the radial
is probably due to the fact that the cambium is active throughout the whole vertical
extent of the tree at the time of the wound, whereas in the course of its radial activity
the cambium passes through dormant winter periods. There are also greater facilities
for vertical distribution in connection with the currents in the tree.
