This omis-
sion induces me to believe that the French naturalists never
met with a perfect mummy, and that, therefore, the descrip-
tion of a mummy in every respect much better preserved
than any that has hitherto been noticed, must be a desirable
object to the antiquarian, the learned commentators on
ancient historians, and to men of science in general. Baron

question of the identity of the present race of Copts with
the aboriginal Egyptians, whose descent he traces from the
Abyssinians and Ethiopians by a comparative examination of
the crania of several mummies he had collected in the desert
of Saqquarah, and of those of the modern Copts found in a
cemetery near Alexandria, The mummies of Saqquarah,
however, are acknowledged to be very inferior to those of
Upper Egypt by all travellers; and cannot, therefore, be put
in competition with the latter, in an inquiry into the art

capable of illustrating the anatomical history 'of mummies in
general, were communicated to me by the late Dr. Ban,
by Sir E: Home, Mr. Bropie, Mr.
