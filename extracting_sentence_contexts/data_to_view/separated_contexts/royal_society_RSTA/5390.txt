It is worth noting here that
he threshold number of posts, when the behaviour of the cells switches from
an upscaling to a downscaling response, appears to be dependent on cell type;
compare figures 5a, 7 and 9b. However, recall that Deshpande et al. (2007)
1ad shown that this threshold number of posts increases with decreasing post
spacing. We thus believe that the primary reason for differences in the threshold
values seen between figures 5a, 7 and 9b is not cell type but rather is related
o the fact that the post spacing varied for the different cell types investigated
1ere. In summary, the contractile response of MSCs on an array of micro-posts
exhibits the same qualitative trends as smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Further, the contractility model once suitably recalibrated again captures the
observations with acceptable accuracy.
