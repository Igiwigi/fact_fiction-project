sponding to recoil angle @,,,,. The cross-section calculated from these formulae is in fact
greater than the true cross-section because no allowance has been made for the screening
of the nuclear charges by extranuclear electrons. Nevertheless, it may be used to estimate
an upper limit for the probability of occurrence of nuclear recoil tracks longer than 1-7. Figure 4, Recoil process diagram.
