plotting for each wire the family of approximately straight lines corresponding to the
various temperatures, and in this way a check was obtained on the determination of
the constants B and C.

The constants B and C obtained in this manner are set out with the temperature
and diameter of the wire in Tables V. and VI., and will now be discussed separately.

(i.) Analysis of the Convection Constant B.

The theoretical investigations of Sections 4, 5, and 6 suggest that the constant B
be examined in the light of the formula B = 8(@—@,). The third entry in each
compartment of Table V. gives the value of 8 = B/(@—6,) for @, = 17° C., from which
it is seen in fact that 8 is very nearly independent of the temperature ; the slight
increase in its value with increasing temperature may be represented by a small
temperature coefficient b such that 8 = 8,[1+b (@—4,)| and which may be interpreted
as due to the combined variation with temperature of the diameter of the wire, and
the specific heat, density, and heat conductivity of air. The variation of 8 with
temperature is very little greater than that due to the errors of experiment, and the
coefficient b was roughly determined by plotting 8 against the temperature, drawing
in the line of closest fit and hence determining 8, and 6, giving a mean value
b = 0°'000080.

Theory further requires that , be given by the expression 8, = 2 V/ HS pk yTolyy Where
the suffix , refers to the temperature 17° C. That the ratio Ba is constant is
