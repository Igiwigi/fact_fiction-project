as those of 1727, 1738, 1750, and 1761 are at a distance of neatly 11 years, the
differences between the calculated and observed times are always small. The two
maxima of 1649 and 1660 fit in well in a similar manner with the computed times.
These facts are difficult to explain unless we believe in the permanency of the period.
Having thus once more become a partial convert to that belief, I turned again to the
periodogram of 1750 to 1826 (curve B, fig. 2). The small peak showing at 114 years
I had, as explained, ascribed to the years 1800-1826, during which, as I then
thought, the 11-year period had come into existence. In order to clear up the
matter, I investigated separately the five cycles between 1749 and 1794. The
11 years’ oscillation now came out with an amplitude of 256, rather larger than I
expected (the present amplitude being 586), and the phase was such as to give a
maximum in 1747°5. A period of exactly 11$ years would bring us after thirteen
cycles to about 1903°1, agreeing to about two years with the actual date of the
maximum of the 11-year period, as given in Table XII.

[Not much value can be attached to the phase calculated from five periods only at
