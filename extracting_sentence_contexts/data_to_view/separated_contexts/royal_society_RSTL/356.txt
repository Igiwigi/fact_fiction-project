by means of the method given by Mr. Herscner, to which

With respect to the function F it is arbitrary, there. are
however, some observations respecting it, which require
notice; as without an attention to them we might fall into
error, In the first place, it is evident, that we must not

The same observation may be made with respect to making
f*@=»x, forin this caze V @=a, Va=myso, Va=n,
va=vz, and we in fact by assuming this value for f deter-
mine 4 from the equation

F is, yo, x,wvT, 7, &e. } =0

The same objection does not hold when we make f*v=x,
though this considerably limits the generality of the solution;
apparently the most eligible mode of determining F is from the
equation f"+! zy=w, ſor in this case Supposing we are acquaint-
ed with a particular solution of (@) containing any number
of arbitrary constants, such as

on=A {a, a, b, c, &. }
we may substitute for each of these constants an arbitrary
function, such as © :
x {, 14, 7*Þ, ee fon]
for it is evident this function does not change when we substi-
tute f" w for x. But this form of F'is not always correct, it may be incon-
sistent with the original equation. In fact, the only value we
can assign to f which shall not in some measure limit the
generality of the Problem, is to suppose a particular solution
of the given equation.
