While the selection of “heiresses” has largely reduced
the number of brothers and sisters, i.c., the fertility of mothers, the limitation to
marriages of at least 15 years has increased the apparent fertility of daughters; nor
is this inerease at all balanced by the fact that heiresses come from small families, and
may, therefore, be supposed to be the children of rather sterile mothers. The average
number of children of heiresses is sensibly as large as the average number of children
of women who are not in the bulk heiresses, and who have, as in the following case,
been selected with the same condition as to duration of marriage. The fact is that
heiresses are not on the whole the children of sterile mothers ; their high fertility and
their small correlation with their mothers shows us that heiresses in the bulk are
rather the daughters of mothers whose apparent fertility is fictitious. They have,
owing to the sterility or early death of their husband, to their own marriage late in
life, or to some physical disability, or other restraint, never reached their true fertility. Tf this conclusion be correct, and a comparison of the values of M, and 7,,, in this and
the following cases thrusts it almost irresistibly upon us, then we see that the
argument against the inheritance of fertility based upon the fertility of heiresses and
non-heiresses is of no validity.
