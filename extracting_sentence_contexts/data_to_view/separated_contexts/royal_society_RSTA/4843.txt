For example, Testa et al. [70] noted that brightenings
in the Fe XIII moss suggested nanoflare energies perhaps as low as a few 1075 ergs.


(2) Efforts to characterize the ‘hot’ coronal component need to be continued in conjunction
with modelling efforts to understand how coronal plasmas at such temperatures behave. Key to this are non-equilibrium ionization and the treatment of non-classical thermal
conduction. It seems likely that the emission at these temperatures is a very sensitive
diagnostic of nanoflare energies.

(3) Despite the fact that the magnetic reconnection process has long been believed to be
an effective particle accelerator, the results of Testa et al. [69] represent an important
breakthrough. However, the inference of these particles is through a proxy, namely
characteristic mass motions. Radiation signatures associated directly with the particles
would be desirable.
