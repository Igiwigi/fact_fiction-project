Diffusion through Multi-perforate Septa.

We have seen how, by varying the size of a circular aperture in a diaphragm
which divides two regions of unequal density, the velocity of the diffusive flow
between these two regions is made to vary directly as the linear dimensions of the
aperture, the quantity of diffusing substance passing per unit area of the aperture
consequently increasing in the inverse ratio of the diameters. Reasoning from this
fact we were led to anticipate that a thin septum might be so pierced with a number
of small perforations, arranged at suitable distances, that it would exercise but a
small amount of obstruction on a diffusive flow under favourable conditions, although
the aggregate area of the perforations might represent only a small percentage of the
total area of the septum.

Our early attempts to verify this deduction experimentally were made by per-
forating with a fine needle thin pieces of cardboard, previously rendered impervious
by saturation with paraffin, and fixing these on small glass dishes partly filled with
caustic soda solution. By comparing the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide
absorbed in this manner with that absorbed by open dishes placed under like condi-
tions, it was at once seen that perforated septa of this kind do possess all the
remarkable properties which we had been led to expect. But the material of which
