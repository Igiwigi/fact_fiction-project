Investigation of virus — host interactions using

genomic structure was determined. Strongest homologies

were found with HPV1 [15,16]; (vii) viral transcripts have the Sylvilagus floridanus papillomavirus ]
been mapped and the cap sites have been determined [17]. /rabbit model

The virus encodes 10 genes, two of which (LE6, the corre-

frame starting at 154bp, with 272aa in length and E7) Much has been learned about viral pathogenesis using the
code for two essential transforming proteins [18,19], two SfPV1 model. Studies have been greatly facilitated by the
of which are capsid proteins (L1 and L2) [14,20], two of fact that viral DNA is capable of producing infections
which are involved in the control of replication and gene [8,38,39]. Viral infections are initiated in the basal cells and
regulation (El and E2) [21-26] and two others, E9‘E2C thus must gain access to these cells via abrasions in the
(renamed E8*E2) which has no effect on growth of the skin. Wounding has thus been recognized as essential for
lesions but acts as a transcriptional repressor in mammalian papillomavirus infections.
