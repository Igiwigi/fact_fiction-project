The left-hand side can be
recognized as the evaluation of the time derivative by the chain rule. A practical realization of the
said principle is to find the invariance correction to an a priori given initial approximation Fp. The
invariance correction is subject to iteration applied to (4.1) with Fo as the initial guess and 5F as
the correction,

The iteration equation (4.2) is solved subject to the orthogonality condition,
M(Fo + 5F) =M(Fo), (4.4)

which reflects the fact that the values of the macroscopic fields M are fixed by the input manifold
Fo and only their fluxes are corrected. The left-hand side of the linear equation (4.2) is referred to as the invariance defect (ID) of the

approximation Fo,

Analysis of the invariance defect is the first step towards revealing the physical mechanisms
leading to correction. Ap) = 2 DPM $ vrCudaFo — QF). (4.5)

(b) Invariance defect of a local Maxwellian

We proceed with a local Maxwellian (3.5) as the input approximation, remembering that it
depends on flow velocity u and temperature T through the reduced velocity C (3.2).
