There are in fact six other lines close to these three which
must certainly be considered to form part of the diffuse triplet. The wave-lengths
given for these lines by different observers differ considerably, as will be seen from
Table II. A difficulty is caused by the fact that the lines are grouped together in sets
of three, and in each set the lines are very close together ; also the lines are very diffuse .
and with a strong tendency to reversal, so that their resolution is difficult. In a further
attempt to improve the measures the best results were obtained in the third order
spectrum, using the are between carbon poles with a small quantity of manganese
salt in order to prevent the reversal of the lines by the vapour round the crater. The
results are shown in Plate 1, fig. 2.
