Moreover, the root of the ascending process
of the Rhea's prevomer is to be seen ascending over the edge of the deeply bifurcate
yomer (Plate X. fig. 14, v.), which is almost a double bone. This submesial portion of
the prevomer is in reality the proximal portion, which has its immediate relation to
the intermaxillary axis, as the middle splint ; all the rest of the bone, which has spread
out to such an exorbitant size, receives its explanation in the fact that in the Bird this
splint takes up the place which should for the most part be filled by the maxillary. Serially, the preyomer is the homologue of the *interpalatine.‚Äù A large irregular
fenestra is formed in this bone in the adult bird; it is curiously scooped below (Zoolo-
gical Transactions, vol. v. plate 42, pv.), and a notch has appeared separating the pala-

tine from the proximal process; the palatine and zygomatic processes of the prevomer
are not far from parallel, and are nearly of the same length (Plate IX. fig. 4).
