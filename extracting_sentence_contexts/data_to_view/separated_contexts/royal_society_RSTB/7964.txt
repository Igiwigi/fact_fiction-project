Rods, on the other hand, need to integrate the
effects of each photoisomerization, and they need an
exceptionally stable photopigment (i.e. one that has
an extremely low rate of thermal activation). The
greater response summation appears to be brought
about by a combination of isoforms of the cascade
components (including opsin) that provide slower ter-
mination of light-induced activity. The greater thermal
stability is a property of the photopigment molecule,
and may in fact be present in all the ‘shorter-wave’ pig-
ment classes (SWS1, SWS2, Rh2 and Rh1); i.e. it may
only be the LWS pigment, with its chloride-binding
site replacing E181, that exhibits substantially poorer
thermal stability.

(c) Specializations of other phototransduction
proteins in the rod
The phototransduction cascade in cones and rods is
fundamentally the same. The visual pigment is a
GPCR which, when isomerized by light, activates mul-
tiple copies of a G-protein, transducin. This binds to
and activates a phosphodiesterase (PDE), leading to
reduced levels of cyclic GMP in the cytoplasm, and
thereby to closure of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels
in the plasma membrane.
