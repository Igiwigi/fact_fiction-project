One considers two copies of a chaotic system that play the roles of driver (transmitter) and
receiver, the latter receiving signals from the driver, but does not send any back as it is a one-way
communication. To wit, suppose that one considers as the receiver a Lorenz system with variables
x,y,z, and another copy of it, x’, y’,z’, a remotely evolving transmitter which sends a signal to the
receiver replacing x with x’ but leaving the other receiver variables y,z unchanged. In [40] it was
found that the receiver variables which were not replaced, namely y,z, gradually would snap into
sync with their counterparts y’,z’ making all the variables of the receiver totally synchronized
with the corresponding ones in the transmitter. Both systems after that were evolving in complete
harmony.

What is remarkable about this result is that the receiver managed somehow to reconstruct the
remaining signal of the transmitter, that is the y’,z’ part, by using only part of it: the variable
x’. In some cases, it was later found that sync may in fact proceed exponentially rapidly [51].
By using this method and after the work of [40] for the Lorenz and the Réssler systems, many
chaotic dynamical systems have been found that allow for synchronization, a truly remarkable
phenomenon that has since provided the key to many previously unresolved mysteries in
nonlinear dynamics (for more details, we refer to the books [52,53], and the recent review [41]).

(b) Syncin cosmology

Because of relativistic causality, any two spatial points A,B in an inhomogeneous cosmological
space-time may influence each other by sending signals in a one-way manner, A can only
influence B if it lies in B’s causal past, and B can only influence points on or inside its future
null cone. Inspired by [40], we may think of two Mixmaster points A, B influencing each other as
a ‘transmitter-receiver pair’ (‘master-slave’, or ‘driving-response’), and examine the possibility of
