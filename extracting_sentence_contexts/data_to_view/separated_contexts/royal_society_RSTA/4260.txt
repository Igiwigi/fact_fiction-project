The salinity observations are, unfortunately, not very numerous for this month,
being the last. They are sufficient, however, to show an immense extension of the
fresh-water area east and south-east of Newfoundland, and some increase of salinity
in the south-eastern and eastern areas. The most important facts are therefore the extension south-eastward of the cold
and fresh area from Newfoundland, and the fall of temperature, and probably also of
salinity, in the region south-east and south of Greenland. Except near the United States coast, temperature and salinities are lower in 1897
than in 1896, and this difference is greatly exaggerated east and south-east of New-
foundland, In the east and south-east temperature and salinity are higher than
in 1896.
