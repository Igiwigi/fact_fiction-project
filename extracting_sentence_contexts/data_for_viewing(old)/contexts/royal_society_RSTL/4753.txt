2813. These relative and reverse positions of paramagnetic and diamagnetic bodies,
in a field of equal magnetic force, accord well with their known relations to each
other, and with the kind of action already laid down in principle (2807.) as that
which they exert on the magnetic power to which they are subjected. One may re-
tain them in the mind by conceiving that if a liquid sphere of a paramagnetic con-
qductor were in the place of action, and then the magnetic force developed, it would
change in form and be prolonged axially, becoming an oblong spheroid ; whereas if
such a sphere of diamagnetic matter were placed there, it would be extended in the
equatorial direction and become an oblate spheroid.

2814. The mutual action of two portions of paramagnetic matter, when they are
both in such a field of equal magnetic force, may be anticipated from the principles
(2807. 2830.), or from the corresponding facts, which are generally known, Two
spheres of iron, if retained in the same equatorial plane, repel each other strongly ;
but as they are allowed to depart out of that plane, they first lose their mutual re-
pulsive force and then attract each other, and that they do most powerfully when in
an axial direction.

2815, With diamagnetic bodies the mutual action is more difficult to determine,
because of the comparative lowness of their condition. I therefore resorted to the
expedient, before described, of using a saturated solution of protosulpbate of iron as
the medium occupying the field of equal magnetic force, and employing two cylinders
of phosphorus, about an inch long and half an inch in diameter, as the diamagnetic
bodies. One of these was suspended at the end of a lever, which was itself suspended
by cocoon-silk, s0 as to have extremely free motion, and the adjustments were such,
