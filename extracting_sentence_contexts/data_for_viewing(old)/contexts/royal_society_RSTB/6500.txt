Downtonian.


PLANT-REMAINS FROM THE DOWNTONIAN 283

of Cooksonia in all the plant-containing exposures throughout the Downtonian is,
perhaps, even more significant than the discovery of Zosterophyllum in one exposure
on Caldy Island. It has been shown to be a small vascular plant belonging to the
Rhyniaceae. The tracheidal nature of its central strand is established and the
spores, developed in tetrads, had firm and presumably cuticularized walls. The
epidermis was thick-walled. It cannot be said that it is impossible that a plant
of this organization could have grown submerged, or even in the sea, but it seems
highly improbable. The further facts now known regarding the plant discovered
by Bropre in 1852 support CaRRUTHERS’s view ofit as “a true /and-plant’’. A further
indication in the same direction is afforded by the occurrence in the flora of Parka,
a peculiar type of plant of cellular construction and producing cuticularized spores.
While it is again impossible to conclude that the plant could not have grown
submerged, the reasonable view usually held is that it lived on mud or soil, and
that its spores were air-borne. (Don and Hickttne, 1915 ; Sewarp, 1933.) These
three plants point individually, and still more strongly when taken together, to
an element in the Downtonian flora of simple or archaic land-plants of ordinary
cellular and vascular structure.

Leaving until last the consideration of Prototaxites and Nematothallus, there are
some plants in the flora which, by themselves, would suggest aquatic and possibly
