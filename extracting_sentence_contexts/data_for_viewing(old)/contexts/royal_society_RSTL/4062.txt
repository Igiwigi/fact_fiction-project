to the above condition was exhibited by a liver which I examined, which was in an
advanced stage of fatty degeneration; in this the linear arrangement of the cells was
lost ; they lay confusedly together, and were gorged with their fatty contents; the
margin of the lobule, far from exhibiting any tendeney to discharge the retained
secretion, was invested, and, as it were, closely bound by a membrane, not of the _
delicate transparent texture of the basement tissue, but much more opake, and closely
resembling the semi-fibrous aspect of thin layers of false membrane*. TI may here
observe that I have not been able to find any epithelium lining the interlobular ducts ;
the basement, membrane, where it exists, appears quite bare, and through its trans-
parent texture the terminal cells can be plainly discerned with their granular or oily
contents ; this is not in accordance with Mr. Bowman's opinion, who considers © the
epithelium of the lobules to be continuous with that of the ducts ;” from this how-
ever I am led, both by observation and the bearing of the facts now related, to dis-
sent : it then becomes a question, in what manner does the epithelium of the larger
ducts terminate ? 'This is difficult to determine, but I am inclined to think that it
serves only as a lining to those ducts which have no secreting parietes, and that in
these it snpplies the mucous secretion, with which we know they are lubricated. In
the gall-bladder of a sheep examined immediately after death, the basement mem-
brane of the pliczee was found to be beset with particles which had not the usual finely
mottled aspect of columnar epithelium, but seemed to be composed of very minute
globules; in a short time these dissolved away into an amorphous matter. In the
hepatic duet the epithelial particles were very small, about 55th of an inch in dia-
meter; these also disappeared very soon; the general surface was covered by a great
number of globules considerably larger, but of very various size, which closely
resembled the mncous globules in the secretion of the nose or pharynx. A similar
