a fractional exponent denominator # would disappear of themselves, as involving symme-

trically the several n-th roots of unity, and each coefficient would be of the form g*F(9),
F a rational and integral function of 9g. It is moreoyer easy to see that, for the several co-
efficients A, B, C, g will denote the poxitive residue (mod. 8) of n, 21, 3n, . . . respectively.

Hence assuming, as the fact is, that these coefficients are severally rational and integral
functions of g, it follows that the form is

known that the modular equation is as regards u of the order =n+1, there is a known
limit to the number of terms in the several coefficients respectively. We haye thus for
each coefficient an identity of the form

where A and u being each of them given in terms of q, the values of the numerical
coefficients , b, . . can be determined ; and we thus arrive at the modular equation.
