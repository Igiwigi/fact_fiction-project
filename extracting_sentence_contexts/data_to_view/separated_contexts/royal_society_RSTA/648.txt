Neither situation finds
real parallels in quantum-like modelling beyond physics, because the corresponding theories there
do not deal with individual processes (of whatever kind) either of the type considered in classical
mechanics or of the type considered in quantum mechanics. There, moreover, this individuality
manifests itself in the role of Planckâ€™s constant h, which has no equivalent in cognitive psychology
or economics, or anywhere outside physics, at least thus far. In fact, the applications of quantum-
like models in these fields are rarely concerned with how the data in question comes about,
although it is generally assumed that there are processes, psychological (or neurological) and
social, that are responsible for these data. This allows one to deal, in a quantum-mechanical-like
fashion and by using a quantum-like formalism, with estimating probabilities of discrete events. This is similar to the situation that led Heisenberg to his discovery of quantum mechanics.
