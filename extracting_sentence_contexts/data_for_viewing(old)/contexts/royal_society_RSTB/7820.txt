range of interrelated fields. The Discussion Meeting was called to review such developments
and to facilitate further interaction and progress. Contributors addressed both behavioural and
phenomenological issues using data and techniques from cognitive psychology, behavioural
analysis, neuroimaging and computational modelling. Data discussed derive from ‘normal’
