there be found but little altered from their natural appearance.

The greater degree of sensitiveness observable in the dentine immediately below the
enamel, that is, at the point of ultimate distribution of the dentinal tubes, and con-
sequently of the fibrils, may be fully accounted for on the supposition that the latter
are organs of sensation, just as in nerves of sensation the point of greatest sensibility
is that of their ultimate distribution.

The recognition of the dentinal fibrils must lead to a modification of the opinions
hitherto entertained as regards the office of the tubes, namely, that they are for the
circulation of fluids only. The presence of soft tissue would not, however, hinder
the slow passage of fluids; and that fluids do pass through or by the side of the fibrils
is rendered probable by the fact, that they are capable of undergoing change at the
parts furthest removed from the pulp. When the fibrils become calcified near the
surface of the dentine, the hardening material must have been derived from the pulp
when the consolidation has taken place in the crown of the tooth.

The foregoing observations wil. I think warrant the conclasion, that the dentinal
fibrils are subservient to sensation in the dentine, and are the channels by which
nutrition is carried to that tissue.

Further evidence may be adduced in favour of the latter opinion. I have already
observed that dentine may remain for a time apparently unaltered if the pulp be
destroyed and the cavity filled with gold. After a while many teeth so circumstanced
become loose, and when removed it is found that a considerable portion of the den-
