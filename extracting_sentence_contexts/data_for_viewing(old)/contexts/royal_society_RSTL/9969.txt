S The fact that the alloy does not commence to expand again after its phase of con-
Straction till a temperature of 324 C. has been attained, necessitated the raising of the
Zemperature to an _unusnal height. The ceresine employed for heating, ignites when
zhir has free access to ib at 300? C. Moreover, ordinary thermometers which contain a
<vacuum above the mercury cannob be heated above 330* C. as the mercury then com-
=Emences to boil. But these difficulties were overcome, and the ceresine was even carried

0 a temperature of 340? C. by closely covering the experimental trough with a brass
-2plate 80 as to shut out direct access of air, leaving room only for the thermometer and
Sfor the working of the levers. Great, cure was taken to screen the rest of the appa-
Exatus by bright metal plates from the effects of radiation. The thermometer difficulty
was gob over by leaving a little air in the tube above the mercury, by which means it
Ecould be heated to 350* C. with readiness, but, of course, it must be borne in mind that
