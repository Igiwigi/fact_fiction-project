Beall (1941, 1942) made somewhat similar observations on
Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus L.). Such behaviour is consistent with the idea that
active responses to the wind require a visible background, the features of which, when
prominent as on coarse-patterned land, may induce responses up to a fair height, but when
small and inconspicuous, as on reasonably calm water, induce responses only at a much
lower level. Comparable, but less clear-cut indications that reactions to wind were in fact reactions
to the apparent movement of the background pattern, came from the observations over
land. Locusts flying well above the ground appeared to be less consistently oriented into
wind and less responsive to changes in wind speed than those seen flying close to the ground
at the same time (pp. 177, 179 and 183-185). This is the opposite of what we should expect
if the wind acted mainly as a mechanical stimulus, for its speed increases with height.
