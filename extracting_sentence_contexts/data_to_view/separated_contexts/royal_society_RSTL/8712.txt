It might be urged that the two masses which I have called nerve-rudiments are
nothing else than mesoblastic connective-tissue commencing to develop around the
neural canal, and that the appearance of attachment to the neural canal which they
present is due to bad preparation or imperfect, observation. The sections of both this
and the last Zorpedo-embryo which I have been describing clearly prove that this is
not the case. We have, in fact, in the same sections the developing connective-tissue
as well as the nerye-rudiments, and at a time when the latter still retains its primitive
attachment to the neural canal. The anterior root (fig. D b, ar) is 8till a distinet conical
prominence, but s0mewhat larger than in the previously described embryo; it is com-
poxed of several cells, and the cells of the spinal cord in its neighbourhood converge
towards its point of origin.
