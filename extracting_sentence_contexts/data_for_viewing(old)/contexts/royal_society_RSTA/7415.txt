as in the case of the ideal shell, since variations in I, due to offsetting will produce second-
order variations in.

The additional torque I’, due to offsetting may be regarded as being caused by the com-
bined effect of the normal forces on each fin. Let p = a, be the distance from the axis of
the point of application of each such fin force, and write A, = A; at this point. Then we put

Tr, =I,V*A,OC,, (3°53-4)
where I’, is an aerodynamic coefficient which may be considered to be largely independent
of Ay. The angle A, is positive when the fins are inclined so as to impose clockwise rotation
when viewed from the rear. When the fins are not offset A, = 0, so that I’, vanishes.

If the fins are not too small, nearly all the damping couple is due to the fact that, because
of the lateral velocity pr of each part of the fins, the true angle of incidence (downwash being

neglected) is not A, but hel aes (358-5)
by Assumption Al. At the centre of pressure of a fin this is

Ap—4apr/V.
Hence in this case we have T,a=T paz, (3-53-6)

approximately. For the purpose of developing the theory, however, we only require
(3-53-8, 4) and need make no assumptions regarding the coefficients I’, and I’; at this stage.

Drum fins. In many cases the fins are wholly or partly enclosed by a cylindrical drum
