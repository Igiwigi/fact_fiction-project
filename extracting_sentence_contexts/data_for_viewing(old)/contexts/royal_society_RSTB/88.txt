Manchester ’ * a memoir “On a new form of Calamitean Strobilus from the Lancashire
Coal-measures.” The specimen described was found by Mr. BurrerworrH in a
nodule from the Upper-foot coal in Strinesdale, near Saddleworth, in Lancashire. It
was but a fragment, consisting of three nodes and two intermediate internodes. Its
basal and terminal nodes were alike wanting. The portien in our possession belonged
rather to the lower than the upper part of the strobilus. Though but a fragment, its
well-preserved internal organisation sufficed to show the general features of the
strobilus, which differed widely from those of any Carboniferous fructification
previously observed.

I ventured to construct a restored diagram of this strobilus,t and also pointed out
a peculiar arched arrangement of the vessels of the xylem at each node, which I had
hitherto seen only in the true Calamites. This fact, combined with other structural
peculiarities equally Calamitean, led me to conclude that the strobilus was not only
the fruit of a highly developed form of Calamites, but that it was the only one
hitherto discovered which had any claim to that position.}

Seventeen years elapsed before further traces of this fruit were discovered. But a
few weeks ago Mr. James Lomax, of Ratcliffe, one of that small band of auxiliaries to
whose diligence as collectors I have long been indebted for many of the materials upon
which my researches have been carried on, brought me some new sections made from
a nodule given to him by another of my assistants, Isaac EaRnsHAWw, of Oldham.
To my delight I found in these sections several specimens of the long-wished-for
strobilus. What remained of the nodule was subsequently cut in such directions as
promised to afford the best results. We have now not only much additional
