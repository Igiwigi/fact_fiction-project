H. G. CANNON ON THE FEEDING MECHANISM OF THE BRANCHIOPODA. 299

The relative movements of the limbs of Daphnia are difficult to follow and, as far as
I am aware, have never been fully described. It is possible, however, to observe
accurately certain facts which can be plotted in the form of curves and from this the
type of rhythm of the limb movements can be deduced. The fifth, fourth and third limb appear to move forwards almost together, that is,
there is a very small phase difference between them. There is a difference, however,
and it is very important.
