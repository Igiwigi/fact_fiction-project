21, the nucleus of the latter having divided. In
support of this view, in addition to the more advanced age of the ovule of fig. 22,
there is the fact that the cell “a!” occupies the same position relatively to the top
of the nucellus as does the cell “a” in fig. 21. The cell ““m” in fig. 23, in an ovule
considerably more advanced than that of fig. 22, is certainly the macrospore.
