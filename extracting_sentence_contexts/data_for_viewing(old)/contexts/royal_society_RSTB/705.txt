composed of elongated cells; but I cannot positively identify these with a phloem
zone, though such may be its nature.

Fig. 39 represents a tangential section through a part of the branch Plate 4, fig. 30,
intersecting transversely one of the fruit-bearing tubercles in a plane near its base.
We here have a very large number of trachez, showing a slight tendency to arrange
themselves in a radial order, and with vague traces of some cellular tissue intermingled
with these tracheze (C. N. 1976,x33). I have retained in my cabinet one of these
tubercles in its integrity. At its conical apex, this tubercle exhibits exactly the same
contour as those to which I have already called attention in figs. 22, 28, and 24, but,
in addition, the vessels constituting the large bundle corresponding to Plate 4, fig. 39,
are conspicuous at its apical extremity, each trachea being filled with white earthy
matter. This fact demonstrates the absolute certainty that the tubercle was once
prolonged into some large deciduous appendage that has now disappeared, and which
can only have been a strobilus, a large deciduous organ of any other kind being a
wholly unknown thing amongst these Lepidodendroid plants.

In Plate 7, fig. 40, we have a portion of a transverse section of a tubercle belonging
to a larger Ulododendroid stem than those already described. The transversely inter-
sected divergent bundle, /, is again wholly tracheal, consisting of a very large number
of vessels, and having a diameter of about â€˜07. This is immediately invested by a
cortical zone of very minute cells, #, which, in turn, is surrounded by another zone, m,
of similar cells of rather more variable sizes. This, again, is invested by an imperfectly
completed circle of radially arranged prosenchymatous cells, Still more externally we
