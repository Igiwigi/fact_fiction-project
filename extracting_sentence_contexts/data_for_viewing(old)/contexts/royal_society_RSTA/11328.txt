From the eight experiments ReGNAvLY calculated a formula for the change of
temperature with pressure over the whole range; from this Grirrrrus finds the
value of dt/dp at 760 millims. to be 0-082.

It happens, however, that the experiment made at 763 millims. is one, the result of
which diverges more from the calculated value than almost any other, and therefore
the value to be taken as the boiling-point at 760 millims. is appreciably uncertain.

The most probable value for this point, as deduced from these observations of
REGNAULY, is given by different authorities as 448째-38, 448째째34, and 447째-48.

In view of this uncertainty, and also of the fact that the Meyer tube apparatus is
so entirely different in its construction from that employed by Recyavuir, we deemed
it advisable to obtain some further evidence as to the validity of the application of
ReeNavur's value of dt/dp to our experiments. As our own observations happened
to be all made within a small pressure range, we selected from the records of the
platinum thermometers in regular use at Kew Observatory, the results of the different
determinations of the sulphur-point made with thermometers K.1 and K.3, and from

these, caleulated by least squares for each thermometer a formula representing the
