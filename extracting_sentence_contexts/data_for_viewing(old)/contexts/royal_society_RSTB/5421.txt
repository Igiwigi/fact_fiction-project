364 S. M. MANTON ON THE EMBRYOLOGY OF A

of the mesoderm, and the formation of the heart and segmental excretory organs. The
later embryological stages of the Malacostraca have not been investigated in much
detail, and usually with poor fixation of the material. In view of the recent work of
Cannon (1924 and 1927) on the development of Estheria and Chirocephalus, where the
presence of segmental coelomic cavities in the mesoderm and their relation to the heart
formation has been demonstrated, it became highly desirable that some Malacostracan
should be examined with similar care. A Mysid, although it is not liberated as a free-
swimming nauplius, can be taken as one of the least specialised Malacostraca, possessing
a long tubular heart, simple antennal gland and most of the external features of the
caridoid facies. For these reasons, and for the fact that abundant material is available,
the type selected was Hemimysis Lamorne.

However, it became evident that an examination of the earliest stages was equally
necessary, and the development from segmentation stages onwards has been followed.
In spite of abundant literature on Malacostracan germ-layer formation, the accounts are
incomplete and often inaccurate, owing chiefly to inferior technique. In the Peracarida
the origin of the germ layers and the formation and closure of the blastoporal area have
not been satisfactorily worked out in any one type. Among the Decapoda the recent
work of SoLtaup (1923) on the Palemonine is the most complete and careful
account so far produced. Very little is known of the development of the Hoplocarida
apart from the complicated metamorphosis. The embryology of the Syncarida is
unknown. The literature contains much that is contradictory, especially concerning
