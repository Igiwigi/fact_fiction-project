differ materially in the laws of their elasticity, owing to differences in their respective
Heterotatic Coefficients.

It may be observed, however, that this complete independence of those two systems
of axes and coefficients is mathematical only ; and that their physical dependence or
independence is a question for experiment.

31. On Real and Alleged Differences between the Laws of the Elasticity of Solids, and
those of the Luminiferous Force,

For every conceivable system of tasinomic coefficients in a solid, the plane of
polarization of a wave of distortion is that which includes the direction of the
molecular vibration and the direction of its propagation, being, in fact, the plane of
distortion.

On the other hand, it appears to be impossible to avoid concluding, from the laws
of the Diffraction of Polarized Light, as discovered by Professor Stokes, and from
those of the more minute phenomena of the reflexion of light, as investigated
theoretically by M. Cavcny and experimentally by M. Jawix, that in plane-polarized
light the plane of polarization is perpendicular to the direction of vibration, or rather
(to avoid hypothetical language) to the direction of some physical phenomenon whose
laws of communication are to a certain extent analogous to those of a vibratory
movement.

This constitutes an essential difference between the laws of the Elastic Forces in a
