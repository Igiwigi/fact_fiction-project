By merely shakin
with mercury the opacity can be removed. It will be evident from the above discussion that the probable sources of error in
the measurements tend to give too low a value, and hence, on @ priori grounds, a
high value is more likely to be correct. Although in an absolute determination we
do not wish to lay too much stress on the point, we may draw attention to the fact
that the mean percentage difference from the mean in the case of our determinati
is considerably smaller than that of any of the other observers, a result which is
probably due to the large values we obtain for the observed rotation.

The water employed was distilled just before use, and boiled in a platinum dish in

order to remove dissolved air. The values obtained for the magnetic rotation 4
given in the following table, coils I. and II.b, being employed throughout.
