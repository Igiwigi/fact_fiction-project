than that caleulated from the diameter of the tube. This is probably due to the fact

that the tube was immersed in water at a temperature considerably lower than that
of the room in which it was filled, and the consequent contraction of the mereury first

No trouble was experienced from irregular refraction in the glass, except probably

occupied shightly different positions in the tube. Another portion of the tube was
