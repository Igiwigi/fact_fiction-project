is nearly constant if the gases have no chemical action on each other. This law is in
harmony with the kinetic theory, from which in fact it is deducible.

k was also found by Loscumrpr to vary inversely as the pressure p of the inter-
diffusing gases, and directly as the square of the absolute temperature, so that

For the combination carbon dioxide + air, which is the important one for our
purpose, Loscumipr found k° = +1423,

Whether & as ordinarily defined is a true physical constant, or is subject to varia -

tion with the ratio of the mixture of the interdiffusing gases, has occupied the
attention of several physicists, and is a subject of considerable importance in the
present inquiry, where we are dealing with the diffusive flow of atmospheric carbon
dioxide whose dilution is excessively great. QO, E. Mayer, in his ‘ Kinetic Theory of Gases,’ in deducing the theoretical formula
of diffusion from the kinetic considerations of MAxweLL and Sreran, showed that
whilst theory is in accordance with observation in so far as the influence of tempera-
ture and pressure of the mixture are concerned, the formula also leads to the con-
clusion that the value of & should vary with the number of the molecules of one or
the other kind of gas in unit volume of the mixture, and that / “ therefore assumes
a different value at every different place in the mixture that is being formed by the
diffusion,” and that the observed coefficients will not perfectly agree if they are
deduced from observations made with unequal ratios of mixture.
