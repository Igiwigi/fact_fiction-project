¢ Outbreak emergence =

— EVD is a zoonotic infection—outbreaks begin in humans following a spillover event from an animal to human.
— The animal reservoir for Ebola remains uncertain, but current evidence suggests that bat species may be a natural reservoir,
with other species acting as intermediate hosts, particularly non-human primates [10]. The evidence to support this includes:
(i) Experimental inoculation of animals epidemiologically linked with outbreaks of Ebola virus demonstrated viral

replication in fruit and insectivorous bats without fatalities [11] =

(ii) Trapping studies have found wild bats with evidence of Ebola infection and immunity (RNA fragments and $s
Ebola-specific antibodies) in areas which have had human and non-human primate Ebola outbreaks [12]. However, s
