This equation can be used to find £,, since F, and F,’ are obtained by calculation.
£y by experiment, and @F/@z either by calculation or by experiment.
Putting £ equal to £, in 15 and 16, and adding, we obtain

oe , pny One
F,+ F/ = Fy + Fu si (Gee"ys) az”
and substituting for &, from (20),
Fy + Fu == Beets — (Ep— bu + apes) ie ogee eeRes (21)

The differential coefficients of F can be calculated, but they can also be deter-
mined experimentally without difficulty. In fact, the measurements necessary to
determine &y also yield @F/@z?, and the measurements by which £p is determined
also yield @F/6z.

In practice, with coils so nearly alike as those of the current balance, ~p is so
nearly equal to &, and F, so nearly equal to F,’, that the difference between
Fy + Fy’ and F, + FY is hardly detectable. The possibility of determining it
experimentally is nevertheless interesting.

The computed value of Fy, + Fy’ at 18° C. for a current of 1 ampere is 1891-2903
dynes for the right-hand system of coils, and 1890-9817 dynes for the left-hand
system. The working current is in the neighbourhood of 1-018 ampere, and
thus the total balancing load required in the normal use of the balance is about
