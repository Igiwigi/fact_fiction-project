Radiation
depends upon the higher approximations, and this is verified clearly in the theory here
developed by the fact that the first power of « disappears in the expressions for the
scattered wave. Case II. « in the neighbourhood of 3.—When « is large but not much greater than 3,
some very interesting results can be obtained from the theory so far developed. In
fact, when « =x the diameter of the disc is equal to a wave-length, and the develop-
ment of an approximate theory is fully justified if it can be applied to this problem. In the first place let p be small and consider the motion close to the disc. In this

case
