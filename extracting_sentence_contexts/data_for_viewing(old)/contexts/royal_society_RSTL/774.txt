By comparing the experiments made with mercury and
platina with those made- with silver and platina, a striking
resemblance will be found. This induced me to pursue the
analogy, and-to examine whether, independently of the action
of platina, mercury had not the same property of being preci-
pitated by green sulphate of iron as silver. Nitrate of silver is
precipitated by green sulphate of iron, but muriate of silver is
not sensibly acted upon by the same reagent. The insolubility
of muriate of silver 'might be alleged as the cause of this, if I
had not tried the experiment by pouring nitrate of silver into
green muriate of iron, in which case all the substances were
presented to each other in solution. The result was not re-
duction, but muriate of .silver and nitrate of iron. This fact
rests upon a much more extensive basis than mere mechanical
circumstances ; and, if pursued with the attention it deserves,
it would lead us into the wide expanse of complicated affinities

and their relations. From reasoning alone we should be dis-
posed to think that an acid, s0 easily decomposed as the nitric,
would be sufficient to prevent the reduction of a metal which
it can dissolve. But on the one hand it can spend its oxygen


Platina and Mercury upon each other. 121
