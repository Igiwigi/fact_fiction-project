origin is at the centre of the stream. Now if P is finite but unknown, we have an
additional parameter to be varied in deriving solutions by our process of trial and error.
It will be appreciated that this additional complication would increase the labour of
calculation to an intolerable extent, having regard to the fact that, as just stated, we
are already near the practical limits of our method. It is thus essential, if further
progress is to be made, to develop alternative lines of attack. A subsequent paper
will deseribe our attempts in this direction.
