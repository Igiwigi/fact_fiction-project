IMF3-5, then we would get the result
shown in figure 4d. This sum covers the strong AM modulation for the turbulence frequency range
over one decade, from nearly 2 to 5 Hz and a phase distribution showing an enhancement from
crest to trough. Curiously, though the shallowness of the water made the turbulence structure
anisotropic, spectral shape in this range still agrees with the Kolmogorov, a fact worthy of further
investigations. Next, we consider Data section 2, which was collected when the effect of typhoon Rammasun
was near, and just before the instruments were damaged by the strong forces. The sea state
has increased drastically.
