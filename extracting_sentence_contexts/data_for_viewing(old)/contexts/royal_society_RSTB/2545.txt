by the breaking up and modification of a stelar tube. The writer has suggested
already (opera citata) that the stelar system of the so-called polystelic ferns should
on that account be designated siphonostelic. The term gamostelic is scarcely applic-
able, because it implies the fusion of strands originally separate, whereas the real
condition of affairs is actually the reverse. Quite recently GwyNNE VAUGHAN
(“ Observations on the Anatomy of Solenostelie Ferns.—J. Loxsoma.” ‘ Ann, Bot.,’
vol, 14) has reached a similar conclusion in regard to the so-called polystelic type
of central cylinder, adopting for it the term solenostelic, which corresponds to the
writer’s siphonostelic with internal phloem. The designation adelosiphonie may
conveniently be used in the cases where the central cylinder of the adult no longer
presents the more primitive tubular condition,

The facts described in an earlier part of this memoir in the case of the Osmundace
and Polypodiaceze seem to leave little room for doubt, that the siphonostelic type
of central cylinder with internal phloem may give rise by reduction to a modi-
fication not distinguishable in any way from the medullated monostelie type of
Van TizcuEM. It seems reasonable on that account to derive the siphonostelic central
cylinder without internal phloem (.e., the medullated monostelic type of Van TrecHEM
and SrrAsBuRGER) from the condition with internal phloem, until some definite
evidence from development, anatomy, or phylogeny, is forthcoming to show that it
is originated in some other way. This hypothesis appears further to have the
advantage of affording a single explanation for a large number of facts, e.g., the
peculiar anatomical structure of Lyginodendron, as well as that of the lower
Gymnosperms, and also the peculiarities of sporelings and seedlings of the Marat-
tiaceze, Ophioglossacexe, Equisetaceze, Dicotyledons, and Monocotyledons.
