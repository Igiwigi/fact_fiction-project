It might seem that I have wandered far from this opening theme in
focusing on guidelines for science advice in policy making by Government and
other organizations, and the many, varied and as yet unsolved difficulties in
implementing them. But I believe these difficulties lie at the heart of our failure
to confront the problems of tomorrow’s world with sufficient urgency. Clarity
of fact-based understanding is increasingly important for effective action to
address this range of environmental and social problems. But such clarity of basic
understanding has to be matched by broad public engagement with the issues
and consequent motivation to endorse necessary actions. It is for this reason that
the tensions between the organized scepticism of the scientific process and the
comforting certitudes of dogma and belief are particularly unfortunate.
