They are then placed under a bell-jar, the internal air of which is kept
saturated with moisture by means of blotting-paper soaked in water. The flasks are
allowed to incubate at a temperature of about 22° C. for a period of 4-5 days. The
development of the colonies takes place rather more slowly than in Hexssr’s tubes,
which is, doubtless, due to the fact that the organisms, not being quite on the surface
of the gelatine, must first grow up to the surface before a colony of any considerable
dimensions can be formed. The accompanying photographs * illustrate the appear-
ance of these flasks after proper incubation. The counting of the colonies is effected
with great ease by dividing the flask with ink into segments, and holding them up
against the light.
