Therefore, defining the coherence
tensor in terms of either electric or magnetic fields allows one to create a model of the source
based on laboratory measurements. Combining electric and magnetic fields, it is also possible,
in principle, to form hybrid magneto-electric CFs. In fact, any combination for which there is an
explicit relation between the resulting coherence tensor and the Poynting vector, which describes
the local direction of the energy flow [44], allows propagation of emissions from the source. We
illustrate this explicitly later in this section, by showing how the coherence tensor can be used
to devise a wave-dynamical phase-space representation from which both the energy flow vector :
and the local energy density can be extracted self-consistently. [=

The averaging in (2.1) produces a function that is independent of the time reference in the case of 24
