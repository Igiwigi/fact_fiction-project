But which exact scaling numbers are we to use? Is it acceptable for us to use
‘metrological constants’, combinations of physical constants such as e and h tha
are not precisely known in SI units? In fact, the developing consensus is to move
to making the physics numbers be the adopted values, and calculate out wha
our mass, energy and temperature units will be. The thoughtful utilization o
this large amount of data poses a very interesting task, deciding how best to
provide low uncertainty in the base units. This work is somewhat similar to the
task involved in the periodic analyses undertaken by CODATA (for the benefi
of readers from other fields, a list of abbreviations used in this article is given
in table 1), where the objective is to provide the best values of the physical
constants, especially including the effort needed to make the results consistent
to within the assigned errors—with the known physics relationships.
