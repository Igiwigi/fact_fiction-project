lens is necessary before any reliable deductions can be made from its application.

Apart from the speculations of NAcrExi and his contemporaries, based chiefly on
swelling phenomena, it was not until comparatively recent times that any evidence
was put forward as to the existence of still smaller units of structure. The idea of a
crystalline “‘ micelle” as put forward by NAGeEttr has been generalized to cover all
lyophilic (gelatine) gels and has aroused much controversy in the field of colloid
chemistry. On the cellulose side, evidence accumulated by X-ray, polarization,
and other methods has placed the existence of some such smaller unit beyond all
reasonable doubt, but there still remains the question of its precise form. By
entirely independent methods Frey (1926, 1930), using the theory of Mixed Bodies
as developed by WreNER (1912), and Meyer and Mark (1928, 1929), came to the
conclusion that the wall did, in fact, consist of long, thin, rod-like aggregates whose
diameter was small compared with the wavelength of light, i.e., ‘“‘ micelles” almost
in the sense of NAcext. It is, however, highly probable that the cellulose micelle
is not a definitely discrete unit separate from its immediate neighbours. The term

is now used merely as an expression for vaguely defined regions wherein the cellulose
is more perfectly crystalline than that outside them. It necessarily follows that the
term “ fibril” is used in a similarly non-committal way.
