and phenole; but, nevertheless, his results, on the whole, are rather in favour of the view
that the Torbane-hill mineral is not a true coal in the sense generally understood by
chemists. TI do not enter here upon the much-disputed and litigated question of the.
nature of the mineral itself, my object being solely to study the chemical relations of
the bodies produced by its decomposition under the influence of heat.

The ordinary Boghead naphtha appears in commerce in the form of a nearly colour-
less fluid of a very characteristic odour, quite different to that obtained from ordinary
coal. Its specific gravity is only 0750 at 159, and is therefore greatly lower than that
from the latter source, for even thoroughly purified benzole has a density of 0-850.
Notwithstanding its s8mall density the boiling-point was high, the lowest fraction that
could be obtained in the first rectification being between 143% and 148% That the fluid
was a mixture of many bodies of yery different boiling-points, was shown by the fact that
during the first distillation the mercury in the thermometer steadily rose to the highest
range it was safe to allow. This complexity was still better seen by the sudden depres-
sion of the boiling-point of the first fraction in the second distillation, for there was then
obtained a considerable quantity of fluid between 121* and 1269, the second rectification
thus causing a fall of no less than 22%; swbsequent to this, the lowering of the initial frac-
tion with the advance in the number of rectifications was less marked, but still decided,
and after six distillations I was able to procure a portion boiling as low as 98*5.

It appearing evident that, previous to attempting any examination, it would be es8en-
tial to obtain the crude hydrocarbons of nearly constant boiling-point, they were sub-
mitted to a tolerably complete fractionation, during which there were made, altogether,
no less than one thousand distillations.
