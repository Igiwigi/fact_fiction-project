D. STEELE ON THE MEASUREMENT OF IONIC VELOCITIES

It is only with the weaker ions that this tendency to the formation of stable
complexes is manifested, and according to the theory put forward by ABEGG and
BopiAnber, this tendency isa measure of the electro-aftinity or the ability of an atom
to combine with unit charge of electricity to form an ion. ‘ The weaker an ion is,
the more it seeks to form complexes by the addition of a neutral part.” The nature
of the complex that will be formed, whether cation or anion, depends on the question
whether the simple anion or cation has the greater electro-aftinity.

“The weaker of the two ions will combine with the neutral molecule to form the
complex.”

Thus the complexes that are formed in solutions of the chlorides of the alkaline
earth group are anions, the comparatively strong cations showing less tendency to
combine with the neutral salt than does the chlorine. On the other hand, in solu-
tions of silver nitrate, where the cation is a very weak one, and the anion one of the
strongest known, complexes, if formed at all, should be cations, and, as a matter of
fact, Hrrrorr’s measurements show that for this salt p changes in the opposite
direction to that for the other salts considered. With the very strong ions K and Na there is shown no tendency towards the
formation of such complex bodies, and consequently no change in transport number
with increasing concentration, whereas with the weaker ions of the second group, a
very marked change in p occurs, and for the still weaker ions, such as Cu and Zn,
the change in p is still more marked. If now we apply this explanation to our three difficulties, we shall find that it is
able to afford at least a qualitative explanation without involving any improbable
conclusions.
