However, these two instantaneous frequencies actually give an equivalent degree of nonlinearity,
as shown in appendix A. The reason for this is that in the definition of the degree of nonlinearity,
(5.9), the inter-wave modulation is actually factored out. This fact also shows that the nonlinearity
is encoded in the shape function, while the amplitude and instantaneous frequency have no
contribution to the nonlinearity if the definition of the degree of nonlinearity given by Huang
et al. is adopted. In figure 62,b, we give the instantaneous frequencies recovered from the shape function for the
solution without and with noise in one wave cycle. As we can see, they both have very strong
intra-wave modulation.
