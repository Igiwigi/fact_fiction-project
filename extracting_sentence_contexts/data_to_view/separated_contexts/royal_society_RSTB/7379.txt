Malinowski (1922, pp. 39-41) says that
& the Dobuans who inhabit the flat lands on both sides of the strait are pleasant honest
3B folk and are allies of the natives of Dobu island. The Dobu islanders were fierce and
s daring cannibals and head-hunters and were the dread of the neighbouring tribes. g The fact that MacGregor found tobacco smoking among the Dobuans probably was
& due to the trading expeditions of the kula system or ring (Seligman 1910, pp. 526-40;
Malinowski 1922; Fortune 1932, pp. 200-34).
