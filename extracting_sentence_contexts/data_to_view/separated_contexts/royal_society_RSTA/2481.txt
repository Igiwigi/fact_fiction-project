Further investigation of
the level of representation of the stimuli would benefit future LATs in this research area. In reality,
the NGP residents may value the greenspace provided by the NGP SuDS without acknowledging
that they are sustainable drainage features. The fact that preferences for public greenspace were not influenced primarily by residential
location in our sample may be inherently linked to how the respondents value different
benefits provided by blue and green infrastructure, e.g. amenity, biodiversity, flood and water
management, or recreation, and represents an avenue of further research. Other attributes of
SuDS and greenspace that were not covered in the explicit tests may also influence overarching
perceptions, e.g. knowledge of SuDS functionality, the respondent’s environmental attitudes more
generally, e.g. around climate change or presence of nature in cities, or past experience with
flooding, as implicit attitudes, as well as explicit, can also be altered as a result of a powerful
affective experience [35].

(c) Directions for future research

Behaviour has been shown to be best predicted by a combination of implicit and explicit
attitudes [36]. Determining what drives people’s behaviours around greenspace and SuDS, and
the roles that both conscious (explicit) and unconscious (implicit) awareness play, were beyond
the scope of our study but present an interesting focus for future research.
