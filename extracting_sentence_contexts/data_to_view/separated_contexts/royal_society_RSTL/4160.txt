DuTrocner indeed attributes to the influence of light the turning over of leaves,
but he considers the flat part of the leaf as passive, and the footstalk as the only
agent in its motion. He quotes besides no other experiment in proof of the influence
of light but those of Boxxer, and especially the one in which some leaves of a cherry-
tree, placed under the shadow of a table 80 as to receive light laterally, put them-
selves in a vertical position with the end downwards. He gives for the chief ground of his opinion respecting the action of light in this
phenomenon, the fact that having placed a Convolvulus in the circumference of a
wheel rapidly reyolving, the leaves after eighteen hours presented their upper surface
to the centre of rotation and their under one to the circumference. He concludes
from this experiment that leaves present naturally their upper surface to the light ;
but, as DecanpoLLE justly observes, it would have been more natural to conclude
from it that they present it to gravitation. He recapitulates his opinion in these
words:—©I have attempted without snccess to discover how light acts in deter-
mining the torsion of the footstalk when the leaf is turned over.
