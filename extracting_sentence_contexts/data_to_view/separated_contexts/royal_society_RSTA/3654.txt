Further, since in all cases the fluidity of a solution decreases with
addition of salt, it is not probable that the ionic mobility will be greater in the more
viscous solution. *

Assuming, then, that no increase in 1 or v, takes place, for a variation in p w,
must decrease very much more rapidly than 7, To take the case of barium chloride,
the anion transport number changes between n= 0°01 and n= 2°0 from 0°56
to 0:66.

For ‘calcium chloride a similar calculation gives the relation ¢

Such a large difference in the influence of concentration change on the actual velocities
of the two ions seems hardly to be expected. It is also difficult to explain by any change in u and v the fact that if we consider
solutions up to 0°1 N of potassium nitrate and chloride and barium nitrate and
chloride, in the case of the three former no change in p occurs; whilst for the latter

* The conclusions of JAHN (‘ Zeitschrift fiir Phys. Chem.,’ 33, 545, 1900; 35, 1, 1900) point to the
