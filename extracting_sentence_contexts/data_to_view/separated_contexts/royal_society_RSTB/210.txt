Since we have
obtained this movement of opening the eyes at almost every point in which turning of the
head is represented, we are inclined to believe that this movement constantly occurs in
association with that of the head ; but, owing to the error of observation above referred
to, we do not wish to speak more positively on this point. From two special experi-
ments made to answer this question, we find that the movement was most represented
at centre 32; from this point it diminished upwards and downwards, and especially
in the former direction, With one doubtful exceptional case, the movement of
opening the eyes is not represented along the middle line of the hemisphere or along
the vertical line of centres immediately behind the sulcus y. We are fortified in our opinion stated above by the fact that Professor Ferrier, in
his work ‘On the Functions of the Brain,’ 2nd edit., p. 242, states that he obtained
by stimulating his centre 12, which mainly corresponds to the region now under
discussion, the following associated movements :—“ the eyes open widely, the pupils
dilate, and head and eyes turn to the opposite side.”

(b) Both eyes turn horizontally to the opposite side. The eyes rarely turn to the
opposite side as a primary movement; this action is best represented in the convolu-
tions situated in front of the preecentral sulcus, and to a less degree behind the sulcus y. Just as the movement of opening the eyes is associated with that for rotation of the
head, so in like manner the turning of the eyes is found in connection with the same
movement of the head.
