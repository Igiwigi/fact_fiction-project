may prove more useful in the art of dycing than has hitherto
been imagined, since neither the alkalies nor the acids (with
the exception of the nitric) have much tendency to alter its
hue. The readiness too with which its stains are removed from
substances to which no mordant has been applied, seem to
render it peculiarly fit for the purposes of the calico-printer,
T have not extended these experiments, nor have I had them
repeated on a sufficient scale to enable me to draw more ge-
neral conclusions respecting the possibility of applying them
with advantage in the arts: this would have led me into too
wide a field, and one not immediately connected with the ob-
Jects of this Society : the subject, however, appears important. It is not a little remarkable that blood is used by the Arme-
nian dyers, together with madder, in the preparations of their
finest and most durable reds,* and that it has even been found
a necessary addition to insure the permanency of the colour,
This fact alone may be regarded as demonstrating the non-
existence of iron as the colouring principle of the blood, for
the compounds of that metal convert the red madder to gray
and black. Whilst engaged in examining the colouring matter of the
blood, I received from Mr. WiLL1am Money, house Surgeon
