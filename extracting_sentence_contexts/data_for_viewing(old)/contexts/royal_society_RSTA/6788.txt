&, and if the unit is calibrated from momentum measurements as described in § 5 (c), then
the observed value of the separation, D, of the plates of the unit will be in error.

To estimate this error and its effect on the measured values of the pressure, consider the
particular case of the first set of readings shown in table 5-1. Assuming first that the bar is
distortionless, and that, as shown in the table, £ = 2:28 x 10-5cm., V = 0-0525 V, E, = 193 V,
equation (5-16a) then gives D = 5-60 x 10-?cm. Assuming next that dispersion modifies _
the (é/£5, 2t'/T,) curves as shown in figure 33 and that the duration of the pulse due to the
impact of the ball is such that 27”/7, = 0-04, this diagram shows that the mean value of E/E,
at the end of the pulse is about 1-03. This does not affect the value of é used in equation
(5-16a) since this value is deduced from the momentum communicated to the bar by the
impact of the ball; on the other hand, it does affect the total change in capacity, 7, of
the bar condenser and the maximum p.d., V, across R, and C, of figure 4. 7 is, in fact,
proportional to the average value of ¢ at the end of the pulse in figure 33 (see equation
(5-8) and V, in turn, is proportional to 7 (see equation (5-5a)). Thus the value of P appro-
priate to the present case is 0-0525 x 1-03 = 0-05408 V, and substituting this value of v,
together with the values of £ and E, already given, in equation (5-16a), it is found that
D = 5-51 x10-*cm., compared with its previous value of 5-60 x 10-?cm. Thus curve (a)
of figure 33 leads to a value of D which is about 2%, less than the value corresponding to
the case of a distortionless bar, and since displacement and pressure are proportional to D?
(see equation (5-106)), other quantities remaining unchanged, it follows that the values
of € and p deduced from the lower value of D will be about 4%, too small. The average value
of the pressure deduced from the slope of curve (a) of figure 33 is about 10 °%, higher than the
value deduced from the slope of the curve for a distortionless bar; thus, when a pressure
measurement is combined with a calibration experiment, the net result, on our present
