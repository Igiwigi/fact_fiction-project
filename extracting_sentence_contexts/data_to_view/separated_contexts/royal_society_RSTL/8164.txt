four and five respectively. But the equations are not homogeneous; in fact only the
ratios and not the absolute values of the quantities @ were determined by the fixing of
the point A, and they may be regarded as involving an arbitrary factor whose square
affects the left-hand side of the equations. It is, however, at once eliminated, and we
obtain the homogeneous result,
(B*)- 95=(B) - Pe

This is a curve of order 7 having two branches in each of the chief directions at A. Of
its 21 intersections with the cubic (4), then, 12 coincide with A, and there remain nine
poxitions of B which give sextactic conics through the fixed axis ; or we may Say, of the
8extactic conics at the point A, there are nine whose planes pass through an arbitrary
point C.
