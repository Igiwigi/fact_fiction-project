ness, the distillate possesses a port-wine colour, and it is only by frequent rectifications
over 8odium that the canary-yellow colour of the pure oxychloride is obtained. This
coloration, though ascribed by Scnaparik to the presence of traces of vanadic acid, is
really due, as I have formerly pointed out, to the presence of a dark-coloured vanadium
chloride produced in the reaction and decomposed on rectification over sodium. This
observation, coupled with the fact already made use of to demonstrate the existence of
oxygen in the oxytrichloride, viz. that this substance yields up oxygen to red-hot char-
coal, points the way to the second method for the preparation of the tetrachloride.
This consists in passing the vapour of the oxytrichloride, together with an excess of
dry chlorine, slowly over a long column of pure swgar-charcoal heated to dull redness.
X'This operation has to be repeated four or five times before the last traces of oxygen are
Swithdrawn. Even after one distillation the product attains a dark reddish-brown tint,
Sand boils at 152”; but it till contains 1 per cent. of oxygen, and needs three or four very
>8low repetitions of the process in order to obtain it perfectly pure. The soJid trichlo-
=ride is always found in the bulb from which the tetrachloride is distilled ; but this, if
Cearefully heated, slowly burns away in the excess of chlorine.
5 The portions of substance used for analyses 1, 2, and 3 were prepared from nitride,
Zthose in Nos. 4, 5, and 6 were obtained directly from the oxytrichloride. The chloride
