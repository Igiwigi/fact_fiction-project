which is specially well suited for the characterization with TN. Then, we will present the ground
state search with loop-free TN for LGT simulation and we will show how can be used to study
the confinement properties of a three-dimensional compact quantum electrodynamics (QED). We
will close the review with conclusions and perspectives.

2. Tensor network methods: a flexible tool for classical computations

From an information theory standpoint, TN are complex, scalable data structures, whose
information is stored within a collection of tensors: multi-indexed arrays Tj, j,,,;, of real or
complex floating-point numbers (in single-or more often double-precision). TN represent a
convenient way to store huge amount of data in a compressed, manageable, and approximate
format. In fact, while the rank r of a single tensor does not scale with the size of the problem,
tensors connect to each other via the contraction operation, generalizing the matrix-matrix row by
column multiplication operation, as

MW _ u .

represented in the network as a link connecting two tensors T and T’, which sit at the nodes of
the network graph. Then, the size of the network itself scales with the size of the problem, and
quickly the TN conveniently describes data structures which could not otherwise be stored in
their exact, ‘fully contracted’ form.
