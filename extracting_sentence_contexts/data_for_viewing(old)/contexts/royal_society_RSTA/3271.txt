disrupting the near-criticality shown in figure 2. This can happen even if the BSM physics is much
heavier that the instability scale, provided the effect it has on the potential is to make it more
unstable (pushing down the stability line in figure 2). A well-motivated example of this effect
is heavy right-handed seesaw neutrinos with sizeable Yukawa couplings [7]; a less motivated
example that has been widely discussed in the literature [40-43] is that Planckian physics might
introduce additional sources of potential destabilization. (For a more detailed discussion of this;
see [44].) In this respect, the hint of near-criticality might be compared with the hint of gauge
coupling unification: both are easy to disrupt by new physics thresholds (in which case they are
simply coincidences) but might be real hints pointing to some deeper and more fundamental
theory.

This intriguing near-criticality has led to many theoretical speculations about its significance
[5,10,45-54]. Is somehow A(Mp}) ~ 0 connected to the fact that we also are very close to the phase

“In [10], this number is reduced to approximately 1.3.0. However, comparison between the NNLO stability line of [4,5] and
the refined result of [10] shows nearly perfect agreement. The discrepancy is simply due to the different choice of mass
parameters in [10], namely M, = 173.21 + 0.87 GeV and, especially, My, = 125.7 + 0.4 GeV (figure 3b).
