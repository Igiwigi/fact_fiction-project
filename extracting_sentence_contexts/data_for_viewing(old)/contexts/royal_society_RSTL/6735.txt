A It may be mentioned that, in the case of the purely Graminaceous crops, there has
been but Yery little gain in the annual yield of Nitrogen per acre by the use of mineral
or non-nitrogenous manures. But in the case of the Leguminous crops, as in that of the
root-crops just referred to, there has been much more Nitrogen harvested over a given
- within a _ time, when mineral manures were employed, than when no manure

Was use
It has thus far been seen, then, that the Leguminous crops yield much more Nitrogen
over a given area than the Graminaceous ones, and, further, that the amount of Nitro-
gen harvested in the former is increased considerably by the use of © mineral ” manures,
Vhilst that in the latter is 80 in a very limited degree. It is, nevertheless, a well-known
- Agricultural fact, that the growth of the LTequminous crops, which carry off 8uch a com-

of wheat. On the other hand, it is equally true that fallow—one important effect of
which is to accumulate within the soil the available Nitrogen of two or more years for
