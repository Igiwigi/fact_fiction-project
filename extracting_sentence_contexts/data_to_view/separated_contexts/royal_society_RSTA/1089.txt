Finally, regardless of conditions, the dramatically lower gas flow using a waveguide
geometry obviates any need for gas recycling, which otherwise has proven an economic necessity
in most cases other than HHG using (inexpensive) argon. Late in the 2000s, the ability to generate tuneable ultrashort mid-IR pulses at high enough
power for HHG led to the further realization that it is possible to phase-match the process into

the soft X-ray region of the spectrum to generate useful flux. The basic high-harmonic cut-off i
relationship makes this clear: hv cut—ost = Ip + 3.17 Up ~x 142, which reflects the fact that a longer : S
trajectory returns the electron to the parent ion with higher energy. However, although the cut- : 2
off scaling is very favourable, the first efforts at HHG with mid-IR lasers also made clear the =

trade-off—that the re-collision interaction quickly diminishes [99]. Thus, under constant pressure
conditions, the conversion efficiency was observed to decrease dramatically with increasing laser
wavelength [100].
