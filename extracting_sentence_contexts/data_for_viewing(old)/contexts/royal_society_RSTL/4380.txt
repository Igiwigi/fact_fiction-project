flattening is presented by some of these apicial filaments of nerves, and nerves not
coincident in their course with the arterial branches are also shown in the prepara-
tion which have neither been described nor delineated by previous anatomists.

In the dissection of the sound heart of the adult, depicted in the drawing No. 2,
entitled © The ganglia and nerves at the apex of the left ventricle of the sound
human heart,” the additional neryes at the apex of the left ventricle are more clearly
shown, in which three slender fusiform enlargements are shown on nerves accompa-
nying the apicial branch of the posterior coronary artery: there is also a well-marked
angular enlargement at the point of junction of four nerves near a neighbouring
branch of the artery.

The preparation which most distinctly establishes the fact of fusiform enlarge-
ments of the cardiac nerves, is that represented in the drawing No. 3, entitled © The
ganglia and nerves of the left ventricle of a Heifer's heart and cardiac fascia :” in
