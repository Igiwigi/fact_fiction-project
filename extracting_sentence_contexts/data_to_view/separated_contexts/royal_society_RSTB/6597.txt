The cause is to be looked for in the condition of the transverse
temporal convolutions of Heschl, and also of the arching convolutions which
connect the supramarginal and angular gyri with the upper two convolution-
tiers of the temporal lobe. . . . â€˜* The greater relative-length of the fissure in the ape is partly due to the fact
that in man we have not included in the measurements the ramus posterior
ascendens. But this is not the sole cause. The decrease in the length of the
Sylvian fissure in man is largely brought about by an increase in the size of the
arching convolutions which connect the supramarginal and angular gyri of the
parietal lobe with the upper convolutions of the temporal lobe.
