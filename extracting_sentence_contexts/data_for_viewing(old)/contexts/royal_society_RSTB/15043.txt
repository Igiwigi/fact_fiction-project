ameters for our fixed effects. Instead, we opted to construct
models based on ecological principles and knowledge of the
variables that are likely to be important for determining species’
responses to climate change.

In the majority of species, our models estimated reasonable
dissolved oxygen responses—that is, positive oxygen slopes, a
breakpoint that fell within the range of observed oxygen con-
ditions (i.e. less than 10 ml 171), and proper model convergence.
However, for some of the species, the breakpoint model esti-
mated a negative slope above the breakpoint. We assume that
this was not a real response to increasing oxygen but was due
to the fact that depth and oxygen are correlated and so the
model is erroneously attributing the fact that the species is not
found in shallower waters (where oxygen tends to be higher)
to oxygen. For species that did not meet this criteria, we elected
to drop the oxygen response and model their occurrence based
on temperature, depth and survey.

(iii) Assessing forecasting accuracy

We assessed the forecasting accuracy of the SDM by comparing
how well a model fitted to only data from 2000 to 2010 could
forecast species’ occurrences in trawls within our focal region
for the period of 2011-2019. This assessment approximates the
