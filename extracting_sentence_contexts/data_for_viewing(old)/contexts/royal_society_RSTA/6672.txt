but it will here suffice to remark that, if a given mass be enclosed in an envelope of
given radius, there is a minimum temperature (or energy of agitation) at which
isothermal equilibrium is possible. The minimum energy of agitation is found
to be such that the mean square of velocity of the meteorites is almost exactly $
(viz. 11917) of the square of the velocity of a satellite grazing the surface of the
sphere in a circular orbit.

As indicated above, it is supposed that in the meteor-swarm the rigid envelope
bounding the isothermal sphere is replaced by a layer of meteorites in convective
equilibrium. The law of density in the adiabatic layer is determined in § 5, and it
appears that, when the isothermal sphere has minimum temperature, the mass of the
adiabatic atmosphere is a minimum relatively to that of the isothermal sphere.
Numerical calculation shows, in fact, that the isothermal sphere cannot amount in
mass to more than 46 per cent. of the mass of the whole isothermal-adiabatic sphere,
and that the limit of the adiabatic atmosphere is at a distance equal to 2°786 times
the radius of the isothermal sphere.* A table of various quantities in such a system,
at various distances from the centre, is given in Table IIL., § 6.

It is next proved, in § 7, that the total energy, existing in the form of energy of
agitation in an isothermal-adiabatic sphere, is exactly one-half of the potential energy
lost in the concentration of the matter from a condition of infinite dispersion. This
result is brought about by a continual transfer of energy from a molar to a molecular
form, for a portion of the kinetic energy of a meteorite is constantly being transferred
into the form of thermal energy in the volatilised gases generated on collision, The
thermal energy is then lost by radiation.
