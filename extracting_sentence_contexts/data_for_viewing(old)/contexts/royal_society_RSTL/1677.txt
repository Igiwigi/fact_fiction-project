inconſiderable, a blue colour may be always obſerved; and
from this appearance, amongſt others, it may, I think, be
Fafely concluded, that the blue rays are ſome'of thoſe which
eſcape-from combuſtibles in an early period of their decompo-
fition; and that if the decompoſition could be examined in a
period {till more early, the colour of their flame would be
violet. By an a priori deduCtion of. this kind, I was led to
watch the appearances of a candle more attentively ; whence T
found that to the external boundary of a common . candle
i3 annexed a filament of light, which, if proper care be
taken to prevent the eſcape of too much ſmoke, will appear
moſt beautifully coloured with the violet and indigo rays.” 'To
the preceding inſtance of a common candle: many faCts may
be added, which ſpeak a fimilar language. - If ſulphur: or
ther is burned, or ' any of thoſe combuſtibles whoſe
vapour is kindled in a ſmall degree of heat, a blue/flame
will appear, which, if examined by the priſm, will be found
to conſiſt of the violet, the indigo, the blue, and ſometimes a
ſmall quantity of the green rays. 'The beſt mode, however,
of ſhewing the eſcape of ſome rays by” that degree of heat
which will not ſeparate others till increaſed, is the following.
