More generally,
scale-aware convection schemes that correctly handover between resolved updrafts and sub-
grid convective plumes may help to address this issue (see below), although we note that in
some cases running without a convection scheme can perform better than using scale aware
schemes [69,70]. The challenge for climate change studies is to understand to what extent the
inherent deficiency of CPMs to overestimate heavy rainfall intensity impacts on the reliability
of future changes. Does the fact that heavy rainfall tends to be too intense in the present day
make the model likely to overestimate or underestimate future changes? The likelihood is that
model updrafts will be too strong in future storms as they are in present-day storms, but changes
may still be reasonably captured. Looking at how extreme rainfall values increase with the rarity
of event (i.e. return period) provides some support for this.
