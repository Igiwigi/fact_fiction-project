view of the approximate character of the formule, the accordance of the two calculated
limits provisionally serves to justify the assumption that the series constant for these
triplets is 9R.

Taking 2p, = 96070, and assuming the usual Rypperc relations, the formule lead
to 21340 as the approximate position of the leading triplet of the first diffuse series.
The earlier photographs with the vacuum spectrograph, taken through a fluorite window,
showed no such triplet in the region less refrangible than 2 1220, but later photographs
of the vacuum are, taken without window, revealed it at 21113. This triplet is more
strongly shown in Stmeon’s photograph and has also been recorded by MiuuiKkan.

The triplet of the first sharp series has only been partially recorded. Its position
with respect to the first diffuse triplet is accurately known from the fact that the interval
separating the two is identical with that separating the triplets at 4 4552 and 4 3086.
The triplet lies beyond the region photographed by the author, but the first two members
appear near the limit of sensitivity on Smmon’s plate.


AT SUCCESSIVE STAGES OF IONISATION. 31

With the term 2d roughly determined from the above formule, and by assuming
a value for the first f term, which is nearly the same for most series, it seemed probable
that the first member of the fundamental series must be the complex line about 4 1500.
Tt then became clear that a narrow triplet beginning at 4 4829 must belong to the fy,
or super-fundamental, series and that a fainter triplet having its first line at % 3040
