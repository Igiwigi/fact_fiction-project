We have not so far mentioned one rather important fact, namely that each quadric
transformation given here can be made to yield several transformations for three
dimensions. In the present case, for example, any ®-quadric corresponds to a prime,
Il’ say, of © ; and if we project the quadric from any point of itself unto a [3], Il, then
it is easy to see that Il and II’ are in bi-rational correspondence. In fact to planes of Il
there will correspond cubic scrolls in 1’, which have a double line, two generators,
and two other points in common ; and the reverse transformation will be of a similar
nature.

{2, 8, 4}. In this, the last quadric transformation in our list, quadrics of © have a plane o and
four other points P, Q, R, 8 in common. The associated net of the curves A’ consists of
cubic curves which pass through four fixed points of o, P’, Q’, R’, 8’ and which have a
node at A.
