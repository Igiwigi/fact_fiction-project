which tracheids of precisely the same nature occur. All these facts lead up to the
inevitable conclusion that Rhevoxylon and Antarcticoxylon are generically the same,
and this leads to a consideration of the contrast in the relative sizes and developments
of their medullary and perimedullary regions. In Antarcticoxylon, with its small
pith, it is difficult to credit the existence of a series of well-developed centripetal
secondary wood masses such as occurs in the other specimens of Ihexowcylon. On the
other hand, it may represent a young axis in which the perimedullary growth has not
started.
