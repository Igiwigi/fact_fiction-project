polymer, This is manifestly incorrect in a crystalline polymeric structure as sharp phase
boundaries are impossible, and it is likely that the individual crystallites will have occluded
in them considerable imperfections, and the amorphous regions in between the crystallites
will largely comprise of polymer chains under strain arising from the fact that their ends
are in different adjacent crystallites or are only being released slowly from long range
amorphous entanglements.

It is, however, reasonable to suppose that there is present in a crystallized polymer
a pattern or arrangement of crystalline and amorphous regions and that the particular
arrangement is specific to the conditions holding during the crystallization. As a first
approximation we may, therefore, take it that the density of this specific crystalline
amorphous structure as it is being formed is equal to the density of the polymer at the end
of the primary crystallization. In other words, under any given set of crystallization
conditions we may regard the transformation of the random polymer molecular arrange-
ment to the ordered structure of higher density as a pure phase change and analyze this
