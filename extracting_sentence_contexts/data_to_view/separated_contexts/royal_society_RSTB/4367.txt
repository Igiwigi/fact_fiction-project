By an analysis of the curves of fig. 5, taking the deflections of I and II at every 1 sec. and then
adding them together algebraically with an interval (‘‘ phase difference ”) of (@) 1 sec., (}) 2 secs., and
(c) 4 sees., it is found that as regards the initial shape of the curve—i.¢., wp to 5 or 6 secs.—there is
good agreement between the results so calculated and the observed Curves III, IV, and V respectively. Afterwards, however, in all the later stages, much less heat is actually given out than would be
calculated from the addition of I and II with the appropriate “ phase difference”: in fact—as would
be expected—the irreversible processes leading to a loss of potential energy and the production of
heat, are much less in extent when the load is left on for a shorter time. The same thing is shown
by the fact that the total heat production in the complete cycle of loading and unloading, given very
nearly by the areas of the Curves III, IV, and V, obviously increases as the interval between loading
and unloading increases.

determined in the case of the experiments on muscles by means of a direct calibra-
tion, as described in another paper (3). It was about the same in the various
experiments on muscles and may be taken to be approximately (in the original
records)

1 mm. = 6X 10~* C, or 0:00006 calories per grm. One is, of course, working to a high sensitivity in these thermal measurements, as
the records are reliable to about 0°1 or 0°2 mm., which means that one is reading to
about 10 millionths of a degree.
