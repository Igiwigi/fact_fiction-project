Another reason could be that when
bubbles are released as large streams, they might interact with each other creating acoustical
coupling; this could potentially decrease the sonar return signal (backscatter) [32]. A number of
uncertainties exist in the quantitative assessment of bubble-transported CH, fluxes, because the
gas exchange between bubbles and water depends on bubble size, shape, bubble rise velocity as
well as on varying properties of seawater [33]. One such uncertainty springs from the fact that the
ability of single-beam sonar to capture seeps outside the area covered by the beam is limited. To
minimize this uncertainty, coverage of 13-40% was achieved during in-depth studies of chosen
seep fields (electronic supplementary material, figure 54). Another uncertainty is related to the
sporadic nature of seeps and flares, which causes high temporal variability of CHg fluxes [23,24].
