confidence intervals of true species richness for a given
time interval by estimating a sampling rate (observations
per species per Myr). This sampling rate can be transformed
into a time interval specific sampling probability (probability
of fossil detection per species) and thereby appropriately
taking the duration of the time interval into account. In
other words, we do not need to conform the data to equal
durations as is commonly done [22,34]. The sampling rates
estimated from TRiPS are thus directly comparable across
geological intervals of unequal durations. Note that while
we have described TRiPS using species observations it can
also be directly applied to genera or groups of taxa defined
in other ways. In fact, any grouping of taxa thought to exhibit
similar sampling rates might be combined, whether or not
they actually are taxonomic clades.

(c) Simulations using a birth—-death—fossilize process
To evaluate our method’s applicability and power, we per-
formed a large number of continuous time birth-death (BD)
simulations, coupled with a fossilization scheme, which we
interpret as sampling. In a classic BD process a lineage either
gives rise to a new species or goes extinct at a certain rate;
our fossilization scheme adds a third potential event: that of
a lineage leaving a fossil. We are thus simulating a ‘fossil
record’ given a set of parameters controlling the dynamics
