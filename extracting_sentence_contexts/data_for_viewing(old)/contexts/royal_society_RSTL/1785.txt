fore, the circulation through the heart be not obstructed, there will be no
painful sensation. Now it is precisely the peculiar property of hybernation,
that the circulation through the heart is not interrupted, although the respira-
tion be snspended. This topic is reseryed, however, for a subsequent part of
this paper. It is simply stated in this place as a fact, to show that the painful
feelings supposed to arise from suspended respiration in hybernation, do not
exist,; and that the difficulty of supposing a suspended state of the respiration
with an unimpaired sensibility, is, in this manner, entirely remoyed.

The sensorial functions, on the other hand, are nearly suspended. This is
proved by the suspension of respiration, which is immediately renewed, for a
time, on exciting the animal. It is further proved by the fact, that although the
animal coils itself up when touched, it immediately relaxes into the former po-
sition ; whereas when it is awake, the impression of an external object induces
a state of contraction and immobility which is continued for some time,â€”pro-
bably as long as the sense of fear continues. When the hedgehog, coiled up in
its state of activity, is thrown into water, it immediately relaxes itself, from fear,
