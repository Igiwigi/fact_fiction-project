Let us first note that strong correlations are ubiquitous in our models [20]. For example,
in our ‘neutrino’ model, §3, the dynamical variables take the form of flat sheets, which show
strong space-like correlations even though their dynamical equations of motion are local, as was
explained at the end of that section. And then, given the fact that we have these correlations, what
exactly is the mathematical definition of disgusting?

More to the point, the correlation function (7.2) is still not quite in line with our theory
of the Cellular Automaton Interpretation (CAI) of quantum mechanics. The correlation has to be
complete! According to the principles of our ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics [6],
the universe is always in a state where all beables 6;(t) at all times t, take precisely defined values.
Therefore, the photons emitted by the source « must have well-defined polarizations in exactly
the same basis that is later employed by Alice and Bob, already when they are emitted, at time
t=fp in figure 1. This feature is an evident fact of all explicit models that we can produce, and
is the central assumption of the CAI, but now it is also clear that it is exactly here that we have


to face our ‘conspiracy’ problem. Did the photons commit ‘conspiracy’ by knowing in advance
which basis to pick, the very same basis that Alice and Bob would decide to choose, by consulting
the distant quasars, or the mice in their cages?

Quantitatively: we must explain how the photons could ‘pick’ the basis a for photon w and
basis b for photon 8, already at time t = t. Here, a and b are described by the angles chosen by
Alice and Bob, at time t =t3! As they both have the same polarization c, the atom ¢ gives them
the same signs +1 with probability cos*(a — b) and opposite signs, +1 and +1 with probability
sin?(a — b). One then obtains the quantum result (7.1), but how could this have happened?
