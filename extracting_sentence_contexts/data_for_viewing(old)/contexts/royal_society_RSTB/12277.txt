Cite this article: Lindstedt C, Murphy L Antipredator strategies of the pupal stage in insects have received little

attention in comparison to larval or adult stages. This is despite the fact that
predation risk can be high during the pupal stage, making it a critical stage
for subsequent fitness. The immobile pupae are not, however, defenceless; a

encounters with predators’ by actively hiding in vegetation and soil or via
cryptic coloration and masquerade. Pupae have also evolved behavioural
and secondary defences such as defensive toxins, physical defences or deimatic
movements and sounds. Interestingly, warning coloration used to advertise

pupae gain protection from conspecifics or mimic chemical and auditory
signals and thereby manipulate other species to protect them. Our literature
