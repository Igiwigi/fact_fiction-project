Another aspect was the
development time of only four years to set-up a lander for such a harsh environment. Unit tests
sped up developing processes, but still an overall system test was needed in vacuum and thermal
environment to make sure that EMC, thermal and power conditions are within the expected
range. Due to the fact that the installed instruments are very sensitive, calibration and reference
measurements need to take place. Partly this was conducted during cruise phase because the
launch window was fixed.

3, Present and future works towards planetary exploration: ARCHES and Martian
Moon exploration

In this section, we describe our current ongoing and future efforts in order to build up scientific
robotic systems for lunar missions. The first part illustrates the ARCHES mission, which has the
task to develop and demonstrate key technologies for a heterogeneous robotic team.
