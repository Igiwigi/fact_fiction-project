Primary and secondary stabilization solutions are designed on the basis of conventional
design approaches, incorporating industry guidelines such as DNV-RP-F109 [3] and industry best
practices (e.g. [4]). However, it is widely accepted that these design approaches are simplified and : =
may be overly conservative on a sandy seabed, because they do not account for any variation 3
in pipeline embedment due to scour following the initial placement of the pipeline. This is
despite the fact that the same wave and current velocities that are evaluated to assess pipeline nee)
stability will almost always have the potential to mobilize sediment on a sandy seabed well before :
they can mobilize the pipeline [5]. A more correct stability analysis must therefore account for [4
scour of sediment from beneath the pipeline and the potential for pipeline lowering, which will DN
alter pipeline embedment and have a direct impact on hydrodynamic loading and lateral soil =
resistance. It is noted that previous work has incorporated changes to pipeline embedment into Ss
stability analysis (e.g. [6,7]), but this work has focused on changes in embedment due to cyclic .
loading of the pipeline as opposed to changes in embedment due to scour.
