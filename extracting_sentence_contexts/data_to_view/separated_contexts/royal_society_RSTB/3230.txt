Can we, on the other hand, bring the Araucarian cone
into closer touch with the strobili of recent or extinct Lycopods? With recent
species of Lycopodium the Araucarie agree in having strobili consisting of spirally-
disposed sporophylls, each with a single megasporangium,* but in shape the
Lycopodium sporangium differs from that of the Araucariez, a matter of secondary
importance. A more fundamental distinction is the fact that in one case we have
a naked sporangium and in the other a true seed. One of the many advances of
first-rate importance which we owe to Dr. Scorr,t is the demonstration of the
production of seed-like organs by an extinct Lycopodiaceous genus.
