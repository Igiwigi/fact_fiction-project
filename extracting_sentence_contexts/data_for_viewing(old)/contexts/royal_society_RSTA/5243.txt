could be applied to mitigate, or even avert, certain regional consequences of warming, which are
being observed now, or which are predicted to occur in coming decades. On the other hand, MCB
could be found to have deleterious consequences.

The regional application which constitutes the primary focus of this paper is the maintenance
and restoration of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice. As part of that effort, we also present a new
idea outlining how a focused application of MCB in warm southern oceans might help avert the
collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. In addition to the above-mentioned primary work, we
also present modest extensions of our published work on MCB-induced reduction of the strength
of developing hurricanes and the preservation of coral reefs.

The studies outlined above have in common the MCB-induced reduction of sea surface : =
temperatures (SSTs) in selected regions. The fact that all three above-mentioned applications of yy
MCB involve reductions in SST does not indicate that other parameters do not play a significant 2
role. They unquestionably do—but they lay beyond the scope of this preliminary study. aes

The seeding areas covered in this earlier work ranged considerably from 100% of all suitable 72
maritime cloud regions [9-11] to the three areas containing the most extensive concentrations of : S
such clouds—off the West coasts of North and South America, and Africa [7,8,11]. These three aw
areas (combined) cover approximately 5% of the total oceanic area and were used in most of : =
the current computations outlined herein. Marine stratocumulus clouds cover about 20% of the : fee

Earth’s surface, with the oceans covering 71% of the globe. The cloud location is variable.
