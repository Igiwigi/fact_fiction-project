She tube is rapidly charging-up with positive electricity. Rapid, however, as this
<eharging-up is, it is not of a sufficiently impulsive type to give rise to a relief-discharge
p from the tinfoil sufficient to produce luminous effects. If, however, we hold a wire
Qeonnected to earth at snch a distance from the tinfoil that the accumulated effects of
- this charging-up are able at intervals (either once, twice, or even more frequently in
- each interval of the main air-spark) to draw a spark from the earth wire, we have
- corregponding to each such spark an impulsive relief-discharge of negative electricity
» from under the tinfoil which produces the phosphorescence observed.

This Leyden-jar effect is found with all lengths of air-spark and in all kinds of tubes.

reasoning would not apply without great modifications. Tt is true that there is
sIimilar contrast between discharges which give strong shocks and those which do
do 80, but that may arise from wholly different considerations, which will be noticed
due time (se Section XXVII.). It is partly on account of the great importance
distinguishing between this latter phenomenon, which is peculiar to high-vacuuy
tubes, and the phenomenon to which this section has chiefly been dedicated, which 3
common to all tubes, that has made us examine the latter.
