recent work has also shown that the properties of the inward 3

became more inward/less outward with time. As the magni-
sodium current are different from what was known at the Ds

tude of the hyperpolarization was increased, the time-

dependent change of current reversed. These results were time of the paper. In particular, following the inactivation of 8

DiFrancesco and Noble modelled one component of this cur-
rent, the so-called ‘window’ current which results from the
fact that over a narrow voltage range, the activation and inacti-
vation curves overlap [24]. It is now known, however, that
there is a further persistent Na‘ current which is increased
by hypoxia [25] and is a target for therapeutic intervention [26].

would be expected to reverse at a potential given by the
Nernst potential of K*. However, as shown by DiFrancesco
et al. [6,7] and modelled in fig. 17 of [1], a similar apparent
reversal potential can result from the combination of (i) an
increasing inward current and (ii) potassium entering
the cell leading to a decrease in extracellular potassium
concentration which would increase the outward current.
Subsequent work has led to the realization that pace-
