integral of (+D/—),’?)¢ = 0, which satisties the same boundary-conditions asf,
\,’ being a positive constant, the sign before D’ being the same as that of yy in
Du. The proof of this fact and of various other properties of the (P)’s will be
deferred to the Appendix. The (P)’s may be called the principal or normal modes
of vibration of the system. Vis analogous to potential energy.
