All the experiments, except a few
dating later than January 22, 1916, were done in conjunction with Mr. Harriry. As both these gentlemen have left the laboratory and are not within reach, the
other author should be held responsible for all mistakes in presentation of fact or
theory. PART, ier
Tue Compressisiiities, (BERKELEY and Burton.)

In a previous communication we have given the results of our measurements on the
compressibilities of calcium ferrocyanide solutions. These results were not very
satisfactory because the experiments had to be carried out as rapidly as possible,
otherwise the prolonged strain on the outer glass tubet (through which the readings
on the piezometer stem were taken) soon caused it to collapse.
