Specifically, we expected at that time that
downstream DWEC variability was a measure of AMOC variability [17] and that convection
variability in the Labrador Sea was driving that AMOC variability. Observations showed
otherwise. Specifically, measurements of the boundary currents east of the Grand Banks at 43° N
during 1993 to 1995 and then again from 1999 to 2001 showed that transport in the LSW density
range was remarkably steady despite the fact that LSW production was considerably weaker
during the latter time period [17-20]. Similarly, a strengthening of the Deep Labrador Current
at 53°N was recorded over the time period of a well-documented decrease in convection [21]. Finally, transport measurements of the DWBC equatorward of the Grand Banks appeared weaker
when it advected a larger fraction of LSW [22].
