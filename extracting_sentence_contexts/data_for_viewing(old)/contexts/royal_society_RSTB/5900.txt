Of the fifty-eight strains isolated only six were found to occur in more than one
sample of stone, one occurred in five of the fifteen or sixteen{ samples, but this was
the only one common to more than two stones so that it is evident that the hetero-
trophic flora of stone is not closely restricted to a few species. It must, like the soil
flora, be considered as a complex population in which groups flourish locally and for
a period when the food supply or other conditions favour them. No outstanding
features characterize the stone bacteria as a group. They seem to be referable to known

t The uncertainty as to numbers is due to the fact that no record was kept of the number of
samples from which cultures S, to 8,. were obtained.


THE RELATIONSHIP OF MICRO-ORGANISMS TO THE DECAY OF STONE. 107

soil, water or air types; e.g. the organism from Beer stone (BS,), found almost pure
at a depth of 24 inches, is a slender motile rod agreeing in character with Pseudomonas
jluorescens. Assuming the origin of the stone flora to have been the soil, a certain
selective influence of the stone habitat is noticeable in the fewness of sporing organisms
and the complete absence of large sporers like Bacillus mycoides, B. megatherium, and
B. mesentericus. In order to determine whether this selection could be related to
shortness of the food supply in the stone, a fairly exhaustive series of experiments
