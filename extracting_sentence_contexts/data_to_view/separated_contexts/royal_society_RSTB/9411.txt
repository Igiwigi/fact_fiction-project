on average for all terrestrial mammal species, in comparison species in the top 25% of range-size distribution were the

this PA expansion plan could even have negative effects were estimated to benefit from the achievement of ecoregion
for species conservation. In fact, 58.4% of the terrestrial targets (figure 4p,s).

mammal species were projected to incur a relative loss in
suitable habitat with respect to the counterfactual outcome. The number of species with negative impacts increased
to 59.7% when considering threatened mammals only
(figure 3a). By minimizing human population density within
additional PAs subject to the constraint of achieving
ecoregion and country targets, this PA expansion plan inci-
dentally avoided protecting the areas richest in threatened
species.
