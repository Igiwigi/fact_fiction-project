is exerted. Thus, an unwise watering after partial drought is said to cause the bolls
which were near opening to fall off; as a matter of fact, the shedding of a boll which
is more than 25 days old is a relatively rare occurrence ; what actually happens is
that the new leafy shoots hide the bolls already formed. Similarly, the use of
manures is said to make the plant “run to wood” and lessen the yield ; it is probable
that the greater part of such decrease in yield is simply due to shedding, resulting
from insufficient water-supply to cope with those demands which the increased leaf
surface would make upon the root system on hot days.
