Of course, the ideal
method would have been to obtain data from a number of permanent Observation
Stations, so scattered over the country as to provide a fair sample of the whole, and
preferably subjected to the ordinary cultivation and irrigation régime of the site
and season. It should also be remembered that for our present critical purpose no
data of non-analysed yield are of any use. It might be thought that such an analysis as we propose to make would be
hampered by “ seasonal factors,” so it is perhaps worth while at the outset to call
the reader’s attention to the fact that there is no seasonal factor left, as such, on
the completion of our analysis. Certain peculiarities of any one season may leave an
impress on the crop; of such are a late or early flood, or a hot day in the spring,
but these are not “seasonal” in any vague sense. It remains to outline the method of treatment given to the data in this present-
ment.
