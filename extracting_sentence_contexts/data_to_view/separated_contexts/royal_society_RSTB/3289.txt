must have been formed in situ; had they originated elsewhere such an arrangement of
the bedding would be impossible, The fact that the floor and the roof nodules are
formed in situ lends support, were it needed, to the argument that the seam nodules
were also formed where they are found. In these roof nodules isolated plants are also to be found in which the tissues are
partly excellently preserved. The plant tissues are generally completely surrounded,
and may even be partly penetrated by the fine Goniatite-containing mud which forms
the matrix of the nodule.
