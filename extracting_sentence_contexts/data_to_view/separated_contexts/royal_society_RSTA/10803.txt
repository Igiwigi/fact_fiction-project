proportional to 7, not to 7°. In fact, the taller the component curves are, the
narrower they are. This consideration is overlooked if we allow ourselves to substitute
the maxima of the curves for the curves themselves when these become narrow.

§ 53. This latter source of error, by which 7* is substituted for 7, will not affect the
shape of the resultant energy-curve if the average length of train is taken to be
independent of the velocity.
