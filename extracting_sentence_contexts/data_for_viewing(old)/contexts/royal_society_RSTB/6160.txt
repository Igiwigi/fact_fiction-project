vessel (DE Brrr, 1924, b), is of interest because of the difference in relations which
it shows in Selachii and in Teleostomi. In the latter group the efferent pseudo-
branchial artery runs dorsally and inwards beneath the pterygo-quadrate, and then
runs underneath (ventrally to) the trabecule to join the internal carotid artery just
as it enters the cranial cavity through the hyophysial fenestra. In the Selachii, on
the other hand, the efferent pseudobranchial artery again passes ventromedially to
the pterygo-quadrate, but it then runs above (dorsally to) the trabecula and thus
enters the cranial cavity independently and from the side, before joining the internal
' carotid (ALus, 1923, a; Dr BrEr, 1924, 5).

It is therefore of interest to find that in Callorhynchus the relations of the efferent
pseudobranchial artery are similar to those shown by Selachians. The only
differences are matters of detail, and concerned with the facts that in Callorhynchus,
(i) there is no pseudobranch (doubtless connected with the early closure of the
spiracle), (ii) the internal carotid arteries are completely aborted and do not even
enter the skull (presumably consequent on (i), since there is now no interruption to
the flow of blood in the efferent “ pseudobranchial ” artery, which in Holocephali
thus furnishes the sole supply of blood to the brain) ; and (iii) the arteria ophthalmica
magna is absent.

In the Holocephali therefore, owing to the extensive fusion of the pterygo-quadrate
with the brain-case, the efferent pseudobranchial artery as it runs upwards finds
itself caught in between the pterygo-quadrate and the trabecular plate, and passes
through a canal. On the median side of this canal there is a small opening through
which a branch of the efferent pseudobranchial artery runs inwards, ventrally to
