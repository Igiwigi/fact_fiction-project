I devised another rather striking mode of making the same experiment. In one
of my trials, I had been surprised to observe that the leaves of Camellia japonice
did not, when exposed to the sun in spring-water, disengage oxygen gas by their
stomata, but that bubbles of this gas went off through the footstalks. I ascertained
afterwards that this fact had already been mentioned by DuTRocaxer. It afforded me
the means of showing the difference of the action of light on the two surfaces of the
same leaf. To make this experiment, I place in two large tubes filled with spring-water, two
Camellia leaves having an equal surface, and their footstalk directed upwards.
