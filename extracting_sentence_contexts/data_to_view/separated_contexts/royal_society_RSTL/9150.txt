Fig. 1. Thus, if A B C D be the ray undergoing minimum deviation, for a ray such as
PBQR, I made P B the incident ray, Q R the emergent; while for a ray like
SBTU, I reversed the prism, 80 that U T became the incident, BS the emergent ray. The cause of the increased distinetness lies in the fact that as the angle of incidence
increases from that giving minimum deviation, the breadth of the image of the slib
decreases, and vice vers. MR. R.
