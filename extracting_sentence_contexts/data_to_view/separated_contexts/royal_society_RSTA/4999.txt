This paper concentrates on three
size-scales, although one of these embeds a fourth:

— Fracture at the ‘test-piece’ scale, in both notched-bars and fracture toughness test-pieces
and the use of data from such tests to make large-scale structural integrity assessments.

— Fracture at the ‘microstructural’ scale, relating values of local fracture stress or fracture
toughness in test-pieces to the sizes and distributions of microstructural features. This
leads to a treatment of how the microstructural understanding helps to address events at
the ‘meso’-scale in ‘heterogeneous’ or ‘mixed’ microstructures.

— Fracture at the ‘nano’ or ‘atomistic’ scale, considering how fracture might occur at the tip
of an atomically sharp crack.

In recognition of the fact that a stress-concentrator is necessary for (engineering-scale) brittle
fracture to occur, measurement of the resistance to fracture of structural steels employs notched or : x
pre-cracked test-pieces. Up to some 40 years ago, material quality was assessed, using notched- 1
bar impact testing. A common example is the Charpy test, which subjects a bar of 10 x 10mm [fg
cross section, containing a 45° V-notch of depth 2mm and root radius 0.25 mm, to impact loading aoe
in a simple pendulum machine.
