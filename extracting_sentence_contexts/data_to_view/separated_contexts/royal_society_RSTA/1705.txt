For more information on the Stokes equation, we refer e.g. to [6-9]. An important tool in
order to rewrite the Stokes equation as an evolution equation and to handle the incompressibility
condition div u=0 is the Helmholtz projection P, allowing us to decompose the function space
LP(Q) := L?(2;R") for 1 < p < on into the solenoidal space LP (Q) and gradient fields for a large
class of domains 2 CR". It is a well known fact that the Helmholtz decomposition exists for p = 2 for arbitrary open sets : =
2 CR". Also, the Stokes operator A2, defined in this context via form methods, is a self-adjoint : =
operator on oa (@), and hence the generator of an analytic semigroup (e!42).59 on L2(Q). 3

For the analysis of strong solutions to the originally given nonlinear systems, as well as for 2
their stability properties and the existence of periodic solutions, it is very helpful to know under [8
which conditions well-posedness and stability results for the Stokes equation transfer from the : o

semigroups, e.g. [10-12]. Note, however, that due to the results by Maslennikova & Bogovoskii : 3
[13], the Helmholtz decomposition for L?(@) does not exist in general, even for domains with : &

Starting from this situation, we discuss in the following the first results on the Stokes
semigroup on L.(Q) for so-called standard domains with smooth boundaries as well as the
Stokes semigroup on bounded graph Lipschitz domains.
