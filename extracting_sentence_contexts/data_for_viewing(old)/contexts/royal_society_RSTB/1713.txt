Another point of great interest is shown by the same series ; the innermost of the
“traces shown is, at the bottom of the series, deeply imbedded in the secondary
In the next section it has passed a little way out, and its position and
tructure are almost exactly similar to those of the bundle (from another stem)
shown in Plate 22, fig. 5. As we trace it further up, we find that its secondary wood
radually disappears. At the top of the series the strand, which now consists of
primary tissues only, has become a double bundle, similar to that shown in fig. 6.
Hence we may infer that, roughly speaking, the change of structure shown by the
‘comparison of figs. 5 and 6 is gone through in about one internode. ‘This is confirmed
by the fact that the bundles shown in those two figures, both of which belong to the
same transverse section,* are separated by a divergence of 2.

In the series C.N. 1198-1191 only four cortical traces are present in each transverse
section of the internode, because one trace has passed out at the bottom of the series
and is not replaced until the next node is reached, More usually five such traces
are seen in any transverse section of an internode, as shown in photograph 1 and

The following conclusions may be drawn from the facts brought forward, which are
supported by confirmatory evidence from numerous specimens :

1. The phyllotaxis is spiral, and the divergence (except in very small stems) 2.
