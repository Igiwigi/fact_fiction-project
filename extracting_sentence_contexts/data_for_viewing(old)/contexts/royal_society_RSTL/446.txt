were already formed.

There are also, in the same collection, two perfect hexaedral
prisms of corundum from the Carnatic, in which this modi-
fication shows itself by small isosceles triangular planes, si-
tuated upon three of the alternate solid angles of each extre-
mity. (Fig. 29.) These planes may easily be distinguished

* After having, in this substance, met with a secondary rhomboid that exactly agrees
with one of those belonging to calcareous spar, (although the planes which pro-
duce it are differently situated upon the primitive crystal,) it appeared to me yery
extraordinary to meet with a second, which had‚Äù exactly the same proportions as
another of the obtuse rhomboids of the abovementioned substance, In fact, there
exists in calcareous spar, a rhomboid much more obtuse than that which Rowe
pz LisLz named lenticular, (called equiaze by the Abbe Havy,) of which the
measures are exactly the same as those which have just been assigned to the rhomboid
of corundum ; but there is the following difference between them, viz. in calcareous
spar, this rhomboid is the result of a decrease along the edges of the pyramid
belonging to the primitive rhomboid; whereas, in corundum, it is the result of a
decrease at the angles which contribute to the formation of the solid angle of the
summit. This modification of calcareous spar has not yet been described ; but, indeed,
the same thing may be said of many other modifications of that substance.
