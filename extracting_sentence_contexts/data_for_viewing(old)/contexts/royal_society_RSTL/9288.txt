passing notice here.* Their flora is essentially Fuegian, with an admixture of Cape
genera, but with none of those characteristics of Kerguelen Tsland. Of Cape types,
it contains a Pelargonium and an abundance of both the Phylica and Spartina of
Amsterdam TIsland, together with species of Ozalis and Hydrocotyle. The Fuegian
and Falkland Island plants of Tristan d'Acunha and its islets, which haye not hitherto
been found in the islands south and east of them, are howeyer more numerous than
are the Cape genera even, and include Cardamine hirsuta, Nertera depressa, Empe-
trum nigrum, var. rubrum, Lagenophora Commersoniana, and Apium australe ; and
it contains Ã¾esides the strictly American genus Chevrenlia. Two land birds, both
peculiar, are common in the Tristan group, and they possess a water hen, which has
a representative in Africa and $. America. T am not aware whether land birds
are found in Amsterdam TIsland ; if 80, they may help to account for the wonderful
fact of the Tristan 1'Acunha Phylica and Sparting being found also in it, though
separated by 3,000 miles of ocean.

In conclusion, T have to state that no trace of the mountain flora of S. Africa
has been found in any of the southern groups of islands.
