structure, and situated in the same part of the yelk as in the Frog. It has also'a
canal passing from the middle of the surface of the darker-coloured portion of the
yelk, throngh its substance to the vesicle, as in the Frog.

In the lesser Newts, Lissotriton punctatus and L. palmipes, the yelk is of a brown
or liver colour on the future dorsal surface, with a white central spot, and of a white
or pale straw colour on the yentral. In ripe ovarian ova of these species also I have
found the germinal vesicle of the same white colour, and having the same structure
as in the larger Triton and the Frog.

In each of these instances, not merely when the ovum is immature, but even when
nearly ready to leave' the ovisac; the germinal vesicle is situated in the interior-of the
yelk (fig. 6), and not immediately at'the surface, and thus far the fact is in accord-
ance with the observation of Dr. Barry, that in the Mammalia the germinal vesicle
is in the interior of the ovarian ovum, and'does not disappear on the surface. Bat,
nevertheless, it is not'in' the centre of the yelk, its/place, as-I have 8tated, is excentric.

Time of disappearance of 'the Vesicle.â€”=lt is well known that in frogs and toads
the ovum'is never impregnated until after it has left the body, and consequently not.
until long after it has left the ovary, and the germinal vesicle has entirely disappeared.
