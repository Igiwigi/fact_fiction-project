later stage shows the grains to have a much less distinct outline, though they retain
their almost spherical shape. They are now studded with sparse granules, and
appear to be dissolving from within outwards. When the radicle has attained a
length of about 1°5 inch the disintegration of the grains is very marked, and the
protoplasm contains empty spaces in which they formerly lay. In the actively
growing seed, the radicle being 2 to 3 inches long, there is little left except the mesh-
work of protoplasm which, now relieved from tension, is seen to be very loose, and to
contain large vacuoles,

AMYLOLYTIC FERMENTS.

The manner in which the stored-up cellulose is made use of in the plant has not
been hitherto shown. Beyond the fact that in some seeds there is a large accumula-
tion of it, and that then no starch appears in the reserve materials, but little is
known. Judging from analogy with both starch and proteids, there seems some
likelihood of the action being a ferment action.

Some seeds of the Date (Phanix dactylifera) were germinated for me by Mr. Lynou
at the Botanical Gardens, Cambridge. When the young plants had attained a height
of about six inches they were removed, and the now partially softened seed submitted
