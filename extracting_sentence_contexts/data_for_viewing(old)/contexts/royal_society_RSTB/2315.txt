ing the cuneus through the calcarine fissure to the lingual lobule, and that therefore
the cuneus could not possibly be included in the visuo-sensory area.

Viaxer (15), in a later paper, disputed Brissaup’s statement, and attempted to
show that fibres of projection, belonging to the optic radiations, pass upwards through
the “lame festonnée” of BrissAup and ascend into the cuneus.

The important work of Monaxow (17) and of many other observers might well be
referred to in this connection, were it not that the foregoing selection gives a sutli-
ciently full account of the subject for the purposes of the present paper.

Finally, from the embryological standpoint, the invaluable researches of Fiecu-
s1G (18) have added many facts of great importance to the elucidation of the question
under consideration. He separates from the radiations of GraTIoLer a bundle,
“optic radiations in the narrower sense,” which is medullated in the new-born infant,
and passes directly from the external geniculate body to the part of the occipital
cortex immediately adjacent to the calcarine fissure, and especially to that portion
possessing the line of Vicq p’Azyr; and he considers that the remaining fibres of
“ the optic radiations in the wider sense” of GRATIOLET may be in large part not
corticipetal but corticifugal in nature. He provisionally includes in the visuo-
sensory area the whole inner surface of the occipital lobe, and a narrow zone at the
inner border of the convex surface of the hemisphere, and expresses uncertainty as to
where exactly in this region the visual sense area is located.

The view of Fixcusie is practically that adopted by Barker (19) in his recent
