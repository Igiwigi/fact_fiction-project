supplementary material, figure $4, and [5]). For the sake of simplicity, we use the linear relation
in Hansen et al. [5] and electronic supplementary material, figure $4; thus, 5 Wm~? between the
LGM and ice-free conditions and 3.4W m~? between the LGM and Holocene. This scale factor
was based on simulations with an early climate model [3,92]; comparable forcings are found in
other models (e.g. see discussion in [93]), but results depend on cloud representations, assumed
ice albedo and other factors; so the uncertainty is difficult to quantify. We subjectively estimate an
uncertainty of approximately 20%.

Global temperature change obtained by multiplying the sum of the two climate forcings in
figure 5c by a sensitivity of 3/4°C per Wm~? yields a remarkably good fit to ‘observations’
(figure 6), where the observed temperature is 2 x AT go, with 2 being the scale factor required to
yield the estimated 4.5°C LGM-—Holocene surface temperature change. The close match is partly
a result of the fact that sea-level and temperature data are derived from the same deep ocean
record, but use of other sea-level reconstructions still yields a good fit between the calculated and
observed temperature [5]. However, exactly the same match as in figure 6 is achieved with a fast-
feedback sensitivity of 1°C per W m7 if the LGM cooling is 6°C or with a sensitivity of 0.5°C per
Wm * if the LGM cooling is 3°C.

Accurate data defining LGM-Holocene warming would aid empirical evaluation of fast-
feedback climate sensitivity. Remarkably, the range of recent estimates of LGM-Holocene
warming, from approximately 3°C [94] to approximately 6°C [95], is about the same as at the time
of the CLIMAP [96] project. Given today’s much improved analytic capabilities, a new project to
