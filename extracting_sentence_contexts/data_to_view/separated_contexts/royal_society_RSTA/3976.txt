The percolating
waters, it is held, tend to dissolve material at those points where the pressure is
greatest, and to redeposit it where the pressure is wholly or partially relieved ; tke
movements thus being accompanied by a more or less complete recrystallisation of the
whole rock. Moisture would thus be a necessary factor in all rock folding or
contortion, and recrystallisation the essential feature of the phenomenon. The
deformation of a body of dry rock would be impossible: The opinion that water is a
very important, if not an absolutely essential, factor in the folding of rocks was held
by MacCuntocr, Dr La Brcue, and a number of the earlier geologists; who based
their opinions on the fact that rocks are often much softer while they still contain
their quarry water than after they are thoroughly dry, a fact which has been
emphasised by tests of the relative strength of wet and dry rocks recently carried out
at the arsenal at Watertown, Mass.* It is a matter of great difficulty, and, in fact,
in most cases it is quite impossible to decide with certainty upon the relative merits
of these conflicting views from a study of the deformed rocks themselves. Had this
been possible, the controversy would long since have been brought to a close.
