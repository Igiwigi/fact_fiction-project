Therefore the deviation effect would still be accounted for in the case of WEBSTER’s
experiments, if the plate is of any other form than the circular.

(2) Next, the effect vanishes completely theoretically, if A = B, 7.e., in the circular
plate. But actually it is present as WEBsTER’s experiments show. Hence we have
had to give up the simple-doublet conception, and adopt that of an electronic orbit.
‘Then naturally retention of the next non-vanishing terms in the energy-function explains
the experimental facts. PART III. CHAPTER 5.
