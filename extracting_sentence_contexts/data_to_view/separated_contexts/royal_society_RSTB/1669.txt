At the periphery of the pith
there are several distinct strands of primary xylem. Two of these, from the same
specimen as photograph 1, are shown on a larger scale in Plate 21, figs. 2 and 8. —
Beyond the primary strands of xylem, we come to a broad zone of secondary wood, the
elements of which are arranged with great regularity in radial rows. This secondary
wood is divided up by numerous medullary rays, both primary and secondary.

[f any doubt could be entertained as to the mode of development of the woody zone,
it is removed by the fact that at its outer limit the cambium itself is often preserved
in great perfection (see Plate 22, fig. 7). On its outer side the cambiumn is continuous with a zone of thin-walled tissue,
which is made up of phloém-groups, separated from one another by the phloém-rays. —
The greater part of this layer is secondary, as is shown by the radial seriation of its
elements. On its external border, however, the primary phloém-groups can still some~
times be recognized (see Plate 21, fig. 1, and Plate 22, fig. 7, ph.).
