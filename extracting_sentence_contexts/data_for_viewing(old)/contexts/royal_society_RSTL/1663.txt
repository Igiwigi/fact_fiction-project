in execution those parts of the plan which were most difficult
and most decisive.

The results of the first measurements made of different
arcs on the meridian of different parts of the world, were
found to be perfectly conformable to the expectations of
Hvuycnens and of NEwrTon, and also with experiments made

S on the vibration of the pendulum in different latitudes; and they

E These results, however, did not correspond with sufficient
