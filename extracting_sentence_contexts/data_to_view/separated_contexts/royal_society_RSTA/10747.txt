Of course, in a real experiment, for which
infinitely slow cooling is not possible, there will be a chance that the earlier crystals
may never be wholly transformed, but may remain as cores richer in A than the solid
outside them. In this case the temperature of complete solidification will be lower
than the theoretical one given by the point g. The fact, taught us by the phase-rule, that in a binary mixture in which only
concentration and temperature are variable a particular liquid can in general only be
in equilibrium with one solid phase makes it certain that the solidus as defined above
is theoretically the same curve as the melting-point curve. We can now proceed to consider the special form taken by the solidus in the
copper-tin alloys. As determined by us through the study of chilled alloys, and
drawn in Plate 11, the solidus consists of the broken line AblemdefE,E,H’H’K’.
