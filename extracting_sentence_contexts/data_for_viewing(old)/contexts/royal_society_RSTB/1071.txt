waves of constriction before the protoplasm and yolk have separated, NussBAUM
describes two nuclei found in the ovum as the separation of the protoplasm and
yolk progressed, and observing these, in some instances, to be in contact and in others
remote from one another, regards them as the male and female pronuclei before and
during union. The nuclei were at first not visible even on pressure ; in other cases
Nusspaum apparently only observed one nucleus, for he says “ Kinen Kern kann man

nicht leicht itbersehen ; eine kleine Spindel entzieht sich fast immer an frischen, durch
Einlagerungen complicirten Eiinhalt der Beobachtung.” It is evident then, that
the facts are capable of another interpretation, namely, that the small segmentation-
nucleus gradually enlarges and divides in two in a longitudinal direction as described
above in Lepas anatifera, and I would apply the remarks made on page 127 also to
the case of Pollicipes.
_ As in the species examined by myself, the basal plane may be transverse or oblique,
and Nusssaum’s theory that rotation of the plane takes place, has been already
Sidiscussed on page 135. I. may arise by a longitudinal septum. The emergence of
Sthe second merocyte has evidently been seen by Nussbaum, but regarded, apparently,
-esimply as indicating the nucleus of the large cell.

SChthamalus stellatus.
S Tn this species the egg is ovate, the colouring matter orange, the yolk granules
small (0:0025 millim.), and the oil globules about as large as in Lepas anatifera. It
