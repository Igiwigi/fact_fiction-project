= The bending up which may be seen at the ends of the curves on Sheet V.
“&, (Plate 11), as well as at the ends of many of the curves on the preceding sheets, is
“ probably due to a slight tilting of the needle at high potentials. Such a tilting brings
= the ends of the needle near the quadrants, and much increases the sensibility. (See
