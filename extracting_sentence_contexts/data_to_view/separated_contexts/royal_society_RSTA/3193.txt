The two-body cusp ratios were determined using [32,33]

The exact value of the nucleus-electron cusp v31 is —Z for the infinite nuclear mass systems, and
the exact value of the electron-electron cusp vj is 0.5, but for HF calculations vj is zero [34]. The
data presented in table 5 demonstrate that the HF Laguerre-based wave function is capable of
producing accurate nucleus-electron cusps.

(e) Behaviour near critical Z

For Z < ZHF, the ground state becomes unstable against electron detachment. The convergence
of the variational atomic energy as a function of the number of terms degrades only slowly as
the nuclear charge approaches ZHF, In fact, at Z = 0.85 the HF energy is still converged to seven
or eight significant figures, but as Z decreases further the convergence deteriorates rapidly as
shown in table 6. Furthermore, the convergence of the bound state properties deteriorates much
more rapidly than the energy, to the extent that for Z = 0.80 the expectation values are erratic and
basis-size-dependent. However, for Z > 0.85 the data appear to converge.
