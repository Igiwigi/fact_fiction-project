let the thong be placed in hot water, while it remains extended for want of spring, and
the heat will immediately make it contract briskly.‚Äù

102 PR. JOULE ON SOME THERMO-DYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS.

34. In addition to the above, my own experience has led me to the curious fact that a
piece of india-rubber, softened by warmth, may be exposed to the zero of FAuRENAEIT
for an hour or more without losing its pliability ; but that a few days roat at a tempera-
ture considerably above the freezing-point will cause it to become rigid.

35. The ends of a piece of elastic india-rubber, about ths of an inch. square, were
attached to an apparatus by means of which it could be stretched by various weights.
A thermo-electric junction of thin copper and iron wires was placed in an orifice pierced
through the centre of the slip; and at either side, at ths of an inch distance from one
another, pins were stuck which afforded the means of knowing the exact length to which
the rubber was stretched. With small tensile forces no thermal effects were observed,
but when the rubber was stretched by a weight of 6 1bs., a sensible deflection of the
needle took place, indicating heat; the needle returning wo zero, and thus indicating
