von Neumann equation possesses time-reversal invariance (for autonomous isolated systems),
more general master equations may violate such symmetry. For example, the Lindblad equation
repeatedly mentioned above describes dissipative dynamics. Then, the auxiliary field formalism
comes to play a prominent role: the action can be constructed for dissipative kinetics through
the extension of the space of variables. It is also mentioned that this formalism offers a powerful
tool for obtaining approximate solutions in analytic forms if combined with the Rayleigh-Ritz
method [27,28].


Recently, the auxiliary field formalism has been applied to classical fractional kinetic equations
[28,29] as well as a general quantum master equation [30]. It has been found that the auxiliary field
introduced in the action may actually be a weak invariant of the corresponding master equation.
This fact indicates the existence of a certain deeper structure that must be related to the symmetry
principle behind kinetic theory. Understanding such a principle may, in turn, cast fresh light on
non-equilibrium thermodynamics even at the classical level.

In this paper, the action principle and weak invariants are studied in the context of classical
kinetic theory. Although a specific form of a kinetic equation is not needed as long as it is
linear, the Fokker—Planck equation [31,32] is employed as an important example for the sake of
clarity. The Fokker-Planck equation is derived from the Langevin equation that describes the
irreversible relaxation processes [33], and therefore it is of direct relevance to non-equilibrium
thermodynamics. In addition, the weak invariant of the Fokker—Planck equation has already been
discussed in [34]. Now, the primary purpose of the present work is to show how the auxiliary field
as the weak invariant in the action principle plays a role of the Noether charge and accordingly
the action I satisfies
