No organic remains were found in it, nor did any thing resembling it occur elsewhere in
the cavern. The Third Bed, s8ometimes called the Loam Bed and the Bone Bed, consisted of
a reddish-brown, tenacious, clayey loam, and contained a large number of angular and
subangular fragments of limestone, which varied in size from very small bits to masses
weighing even a ton. The large blocks were found only in the West and South Cham-
bers, and in the gallery connecting them, where the angular character of the roof, unlike
that which obtained elsewhere, as well as the fact that the blocks were confined to the
upper portion and surface of the deposit beneath, showed that they had fallen from aboye
at a comparatively recent period. Pebbles of quartz, trap, and limestone were of frequent
occurrence, especially in the Flint-knife Gallery and in the West Chamber. Nodules of
iron-ore, well rounded, as if by travel, were occasionally met with in both the principal
galleries.
