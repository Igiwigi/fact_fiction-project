them, an origin from maternal tissue has been suggested.
Only the trophamnion is believed to trace from the zygote
and thus would qualify as extraembryonic tissue. However,
its alleged derivation from polar body cells and its position
between two maternally derived membranes, casts serious
doubt on its extraembryonic nature; it is probably of maternal
derivation as well. In scorpions with yolky eggs, the germ
band is surrounded by two membranes of undoubtedly
extraembryonic tissue. These membranes resemble EEMs in
insects so closely, that they have even received the
same names: serosa and amnion. However, the origin and
development of the scorpion membranes is unclear.
Therefore, in fact, no comparison with the origin and devel-
opment of the insect membranes can be made yet. In
addition, the insect amnion and serosa are required to protect
the developing embryo against desiccation [5], whereas the
scorpion membranes are unlikely to have a similar function,
because the embryos develop within the body of the
mother and therefore are not at risk of desiccation.

Given the recent trends in chelicerate phylogeny recon-
struction [85], it is also interesting to ask whether the
investigation of extraembryonic tissue in chelicerates can con-
tribute to this discussion. The early development of the
Xiphosura with its apparent lack of contra-orbital cells and
