total background reference uncertainty for integrated samples of 0.9% and for flask samples of
1.0%o. The uncertainty of the background CO reference concentration curve is negligible for the
overall AffCO2 uncertainty, even if an assumed upper-limit CO2 background representativeness
uncertainty of 5 ppm is added.


(iii) Uncertainty of the nuclear and respiration masking corrections a |

In order to estimate the error contributions of the two correction terms in equation (2.3) (masking
by nuclear 14CO) emissions, second term, and contribution from respiration of M4C-enriched CO, R=}
third term), we made the following assumptions: we assume 100% uncertainty for the nuclear 18
contamination estimates; this is justified with a significant transport model error to correctly eB
simulate the dispersion and location of power plant plumes and by the fact that the significant Ss
temporal variability of the nuclear emissions (e.g. [30]) is totally ignored when using the currently :
reported annual mean emissions from RADD for estimating Al‘. (see appendix A.1). The AffCO2
masking contribution from CO) respiration, Cresp, has also a significant uncertainty because for 16
daytime situations it has to be estimated using, e.g. a vegetation model that is coupled to an iS
atmospheric transport model. For night-time situations when photosynthetic uptake of CO is :§
negligible, Cresp or Cresp / Cer, the latter being the relevant parameter that determines the masking a
(cf. figure 5), could be estimated in an iterative way as the difference between Cmeas, Cog and :

Cr. Finally, we estimate the uncertainty of resp to be 50% of the difference between Aresp and
Al4
