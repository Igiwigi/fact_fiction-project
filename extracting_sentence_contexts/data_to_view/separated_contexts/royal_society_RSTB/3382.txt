H. W. PEARSON: FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON WELWITSCHIA.

however, this is not of general occurrence, it is probably not connected with the
tendency to establish polarity seen in the earlier stage, but is rather due to
the fact that growth of the sac is not uniform. The exceptional occurrence
of a sac in which all the nuclei retain their sexuality and no endosperm is formed
rather indicates that Welwitschia is descended from forms in which all the nuclei were
potential gametes at the time of fertilisation, and the conditions were such that any
one of them, wherever situated, might be fertilised. Theoretically these conditions
are realised in the species of Gnetum studied by Karsten.
