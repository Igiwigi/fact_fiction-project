However, these costs
are outweighed by gains in indirect fitness, principally through
the increased recruitment of related offspring from helped
broods. Therefore, helping behaviour in this species is consist-
ent with Hamilton’s rule. This is despite the fact that
relatedness between helpers and the recipients of their care is,
on average, low relative to many other cooperatively breeding
species. Indeed, the relatively high benefits and low costs of
helping in long-tailed tits have selected for decision rules that
result in a substantial proportion of helpers caring for non-kin
even though they gain neither direct nor indirect fitness benefits
from doing so. Thus, we conclude that even though, on average,
Hamilton’s rule is satisfied, apparently maladaptive help for
non-kin occurs in long-tailed tits and would be expected to
occur in other kin-selected cooperative breeding systems.

counted as an explanation for cooperative breeding.
