From the charges of powder placed in bags at the innermost
extremities of these headings, which were stopped up by several feet of © tamping” of
stone, rubbish, and clay, conducting-wires were led out to a suitable and safe distance;
80 that on making by these the circuit complete between the poles of a powerful Sun's
galvanic battery, a small piece of thin platinum wire adjusted within the charge of guns
powder became heated, and ignited the powder. The explosion thus followed instan-
taneously the making contact between the poles of the battery. Experience has enabled the engineers charged with the work so exactly to proportion
the charge of powder to the work it is intended to perform in each case, that no rock is
thrown to any distance; the whole force is consumed in dislocating and dropping down
to its base as a vast sloping talus of disrupted rock and stone the portion of the cliff
operated on ; in fact, at the moment of explosion the mass of previously solid rock seems
to fall to pieces like a lump of snddenly slacked quicklime. The shock or impulse,
however, delivered by the explosion upon the remaining solid rock, behind and around
the focus, and propagated through it in all directions outwards, as an elastic wave of
impulse, was at an early stage of the operations remarked to be 80 powerful, that it
could be felt distinctly in the quaking of the ground at distances of several hundred
yards, and was sufficient even to shake down articles of delf ware from the shelves of
cottages a long way off from the quarries. Early in 1853 I visited those quarries, and examined generally the adjacent locality
and rock formations, and having satisfied myself that these operations could be made
available, I applied to my distinguished friend, the late lamented Mr. RENDELL, C.E.,
the engineer in chief of the Asylum Harbour, and readily obtained from him permission
to make such experiments as should not interfere with the progress of the works.
