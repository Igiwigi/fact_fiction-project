At first, it
seemed probable that the last nuclear division had been omitted in their case, and
that they were simply zoospores of twice the normal size. But in three cases the
nuclei were double structures—which, however, were not the daughter nuclei of
a delayed final mitosis. They were, in fact, ordinary zoospore nuclei in the process of
fusion. The sporangium was unusually large, and it may be that some accident
prevented the cleavage walls from forming. That, however, does not alter the fact
that intra-sporangial fusion of gametes took place in these few instances, an occurrence
which serves to strengthen the belief in the normality of fusion between gametes of the
same sorus. ‘The wide question arises as to whether, in the particular case mentioned,
the organism under the stimulating effect of the presence of toxic substances may
not have had recourse to an earlier (? more primitive) method of sexual reproduction.
