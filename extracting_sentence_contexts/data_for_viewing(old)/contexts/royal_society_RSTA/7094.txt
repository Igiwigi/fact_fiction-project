Similar considerations would apply to the influence of the catalytic properties of the surface
of some solids on the kinetics of chemical reactions between adsorbed substances, in the cases
when the catalytic activity is restricted to ‘active’ points on the surface. Frenkel (1945)
suggested that these ‘active’ points should be identified with the presence of jumps on the
surface, assuming that the adsorption of the reacting molecules in the edge of the steps
decreases the activation energy for their chemical reaction.

On the other hand, the existence of a transition temperature will not have any influence
on the kinetics of growth of the crystal surface. It would if the crystal were perfect. Below
the transition temperature the only mechanism of growth would be a two-dimensional
nucleation, which we know (part III) is always a very slow process at low supersaturations.
Above the transition temperature the growth will be proportional to the supersaturation.
Actually the fact that real crystals are imperfect guarantees the presence of the steps required
to explain the observed growth at low supersaturations and below the transition temperature;
Frank (1949) has shown that, during growth, a dislocation or group of dislocations termi-
nating in the surface sends out closed loops of step in such a way that at any instant the
surface is covered by a very high density of steps, practically independently of the number of
dislocations present (provided there is at least one). Therefore, even if we observe the growth
of a surface for which the critical temperature is below the melting-point, there would hardly
be any difference between the rate of growth below and above the critical temperature.

20. Many-level model: Bethe’s approximation

The two-level model of a crystal surface is clearly an over-simplification. We expect that
with a many-level model, which corresponds to the actual crystal surface, the transition
