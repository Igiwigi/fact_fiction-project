In the case of magnesium-ion,
distortion of the stable calcite lattice was observed. Analytical evidence of absorption of
impurities and X-ray evidence of lattice distortion was obtained in the case of some of the
other solid phases also. A consideration of these facts added to general arguments makes
it possible to evolve a hypothesis to account for the observations which were made. The
hypothesis is concerned primarily with nucleus formation. Although the formation of metastable phases in the way quoted in the experimental
section is probably not unusual, it is common practice, and often indeed most useful, to
forecast the outcome of a proposed reaction in terms of solubility data obtained at equili-
brium.
