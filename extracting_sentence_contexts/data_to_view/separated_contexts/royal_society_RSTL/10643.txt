The melting pressure lies, therefore, between 2'2 and 5'5 millims. Here, again, no
relation between temperature and pressure is observable.

$27. It was noticed that the vapour-pressure of the methyl alcoholate in the
barometer-tube was lower than that of the hydrate at the same temperatures, in spite
of the fact that methyl alcohol is more volatile than water ; and 1t appeared likely
that the substance would be more stable than the hydrate. This was found to be
the case by the following determinations of vapour-density, It will be noticed that
while the vapour-pressure at 785% is 160 millims., the density was determined at

1314 millims. VAPOUR-DENSITIES of Chloral methyl-alcoholate.
