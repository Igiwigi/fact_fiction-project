It has further to be stated that when the poisoned half is again restored to normal
sea-water, the effects of curare pass off with the same astonishing rapidity as is obsery-
able in the case of the other poisons which I have tried. Thus, although an exposure
of half an hour to the influence of curare of the strength named is requisite to destroy
the motor power in the case of Staurophora laciniata, half a minute is sufficient to
ensure its incipient return when the animal is again immersed in unpoisoned water. It is also to be observed that a very slight degree of over-poisoning paralyzes the
transmitting system as well as the responding one; 80 that if any one should repeat my
observation, I must warn him against drawing erroneous conclusions from this fact. Let
him use weak solutions with prolonged soaking, and by watching when the yoluntary
motions in the poisoned half first cease, he need experience no difficulty in obtaining
results as decided as it is possible for him to desire. I think it would be difficult to overrate the importance of these results: to my mind
they are perhaps the most interesting which are contained in this paper.
