The probability distribution is characterized by the family of expectations it yields for bounded
measurable functions f of F :

In fact, the exponential functions are sufficient for this characterization, hence the characteristic

is well named.

One can imagine that, if Kolmogorov had been familiar with another book [2] published
slightly earlier, he might have wished to have written a different book. But we must assume that
he was unaware of the existence of quantum probability.

Quantum probability is, in the first place, a non-commutative extension of classical probability,
in which random variables are represented as self-adjoint operators S acting in a complex Hilbert
space H, and the underlying probability measure by a unit vector y € H. The pair (H, W) is
