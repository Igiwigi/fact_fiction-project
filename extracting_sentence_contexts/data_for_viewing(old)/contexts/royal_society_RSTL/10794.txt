photometer, and gave results which do not quite agree with ours. A great many
measures of the solar spectram were made by this plan, but it was felt to be
not as uniformly accurate as could be desired, and to be very fatiguing to the
observer. In fact, though feasible in making experiments with our own eyes, it was
a plan which we could hardly expect others, whose eyes we might wish to test, to
try, seeing that their interesb in the results might hardly be even personal and not
general, One cause of inaccuracy in this method is the liability of the eyes to
astigmatiemâ€”a difficulty which one of us had to encounter, and found yery hard to
overcome, the slightest difference in the inclination of the axis of the eyes rendering
readings discordant, By this method it would be necessary, therefore, that any
casual observer who might be called in should firs have undergone an examina-
tion for this defect hefore any idea could be formed of the value of his readings.
Another drawback to it is the fact that from the blue to the violet the accom-
modation of the eyes is insufficient to permit of the lines being seen sharply, the _
black lines invariably appearing to both of us hazy and covered with a blue mist.
This latter difficulty was, however, partially avoided by the use of a small obserying
telescope, the focus being altered to suit each ray. But the trouble and uncertainty
of this plan caused us to seek for 80me other method which would be more generally
useful, and more easily applicable to others as well as to ourselves.

Our next plan was to cut an aperture in a mask of black paper fastened to ground
glass, which was made of snch a 8ize that the image of it at a fixed distance when
thrown on the screen should be of the same size and shape as the coloured patch of

- light. Behind this ground glass was placed a candle or incandescence lamp, which
