Neptune’s atmospheric carbon monoxide has implications for both external sources and internal
bulk composition. As a result, CO has received much observational attention, and has been
determined from sub-mm ground-based and space-based telescope observations by many studies
[25,40,42-44,79,80]. In sub-mm spectra, CO emission cores are sensitive to the stratospheric
abundance, whereas wide absorption wings are sensitive to tropospheric abundance, allowing
some details of the CO vertical profile to be determined. Nominal abundances of approximately
1ppm (parts per million) CO in the stratosphere and approximately 0.1 ppm in the troposphere
are required to fit the observed spectra. However, there is significant variation between the
different studies (figure 2) and a consensus on tropospheric abundance has not yet been achieved.

The least controversial aspect of Neptune’s CO profile is that there is a significant amount,
approximately 1-2 ppm, in the stratosphere at millibar pressures. The fact that the stratospheric
abundance is greater than the tropospheric abundance implies that Neptune’s stratospheric CO
must have an external origin [79]. Neptune’s stratospheric H2O abundance of approximately
1.5-3.5 ppb (parts per billion) [81] must also have an external origin as water condenses deep
in Neptune’s interior at approximately 100-1000 bar, depending on the deep temperature profile.
