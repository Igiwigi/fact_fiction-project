With other
oxides, at least such as would bear an intense heat, the difficulties were still more
insnperable. PrigsTLEY has shown that water will corrode glass, and if I mistake
not, others have shown the same effect produced on silica. Although, as applied to the facts detailed, I attached no further meaning to the
title of my paper than that which I have above stated, yet in one or two theoretical
inferences I have certainly gone further ; for instance, when I suppose the possibility
or probability of mechanical rarefaction producing the same effects as heat, here
(although I do not, indeed I cannot conceive the existence of heat without matter)
I certainly abstract from the proposition any consideration of solid matter. In order
to ascertain how far this view might be founded on truth, I had thought of making
a few experiments on the effect of mechanical rarefaction on the tendency of gases
to combine, but (in addition to the interference of necessary occupations) I find that
M. ps Grorrnvs has already experimented on the point ; his experiments,. as far as
they go, corroborate the views I have put forth. He finds* that mixed gases, such as chlorine and hydrogen, or oxygen and hydro-
gen, when rarefied either by slow increments of heat or by the air-pump, do not take
fire (© ne Senflamment pas”) by the electric spark.
