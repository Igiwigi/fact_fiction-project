granted that 100 measures of nitrous gas, according to your
analysis, hold in combination a quantity of oxygen equal to
575 measures of oxygen gas, and of nitrogen equal to 48+
measures, and assuming the proportions of 'the nitrogen and
hydrogen in ammonia, to be those establisghed by your ex-
periments and my own. It will appear from an easy calcula-
tion, that the proportion of nitrogen, in the above residua, a
little exceeds, and that of the hydrogen rather falls short-of
what might have been expected. I have not-yet been able to
reconcile these differences, by the numerous trials required iin
a process of 80 much delicacy; and I reserve the enquiry
for a s8eason of more leisure. The foregoing statement; 1
wish to be considered as merely announcing/the general fact
of the combustibility of a mixture of 'ammonia and nitrous
gas, a property which chiefly derives importance, from its
being capable of application to a new method of analysing the
latter,

Before concluding this letter, I shall briefly state the re-
sults of some experiments, which I have lately made in con-
Junction with Mr. DaLtox, on a subject that formerly occu-
pied much of my attention ; viz. the effect of electricity on the
azriform compounds of carbon and hydrogen, Subsequent
