physiology. That in the main facts I have not erred seems probable, from the re-
peated opportunities afforded for their confirmation. The number of Rabbits ex-
amined considerably exceeds a hundred, and I have recorded in my notes the particular
results regarding eighty-nine. Besides ova that were till present in the ovary and
apparently destined to escape, ninety-three have been found in the Fallopian tube, and
two hundred and thirty-six in the uterns. I have kept a separate record of the
measurements and other particulars of most of these. Tables will be given (par. 319.),
showing the diameter, general condition, and locality, of two hundred and fifty-six
of the minuter of these oya, yery few of which exceeded in diameter half a Paris line,
and by far the greater number were considerably below this size, some indeed not ex-
ceeding th and even -;th of a Paris line. Of these ova I have preserved sixty-six.
The foregoing will serve to show that my conclusions have not been drawn from 80-
litary facts or isolated obseryations4þ. ;

|} The following testimony to the importance of the history of development, is from the pen of an eminent
observer, (E. Huscnxs, in Mzcxzr's Archiy, yol. vi. p. 1.) © Systematic physiology rests especially on it, and
can never rapidly advance unless it becomes more perfect, for this it is which gives to the philosopher the
material wherewith to rear a solid fabric of organic life. Hence in anatomy and physiology, our endeayours
ought more than is now the case to have reference to it; in other words, we should constantly examine not
only every organ, but every material, and also every action, with the inquiry, how did they originate 2”
