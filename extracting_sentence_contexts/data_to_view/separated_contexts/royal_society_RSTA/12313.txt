The interpolation of ¢ and f’ follows the same plan, but it must be borne in mind
that these functions change sign in opposite months, and this consideration is important
when we come to interpolate for © = August + 10°, and + 20°. When there is an evanescent tide (as in the case of March, 18") the corrections
M, N, R become infinite. As a practical solution this is absurd, and the fact is that
there may or may not be a H. W. according to the values of 8 and I. Again,
in other parts of this and other lunations there may be no H.
