When two pieces of
the same polished copper, connected with the platinum wires
of the multiplier, were introduced at the same time into the
same solution of hydro-sulphuret of potassa, there was no
action ; but if they were introduced in succession, there was

- a distinct and often, if the interval of time was considerable,
a violent electrical effect—the piece of metal first plunged in
being negative, and the other positive. This result depends upon the circumstance of the produc-
tion of a new combination, which is negative with respect to
the metal; for after the formation of the sulphuret of copper,
the plate of copper that has been first plunged into the solu-
tion exhibits the same negative state with respect to polished
copper, whether introduced into saline solutions, or alkaline
or acid menstrua. "The electrical effect therefore does not
depend on so simple a condition as would at first appear,
and it may be in fact referred to the combinations containing
two metallic substances and one fluid. The grey sulphuret of copper is negative, in solutions of
hydro-sulphuret, to clean copper, and the superficial coating
has apparently similar electrical powers to this substance. 394 Sir Humenky Davy on the relations of
