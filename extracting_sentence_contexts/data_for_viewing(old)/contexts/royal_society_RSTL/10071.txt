Obgervations on the level were made by Dr. ScxusTER on June 1, by myself on
August 30, and by Mrs. Sipawiox on October 13, and on November 11 and 23. The
August observations gave Þ='26'; the October observations gave Þ='30'; and the
November observations gave Þ='25%. The position of the axis is necessarily to a
slight, extent indefinite, and the differences are probably accidental. The same level
was nsed throughout, and the value of its graduations was tested, We may take

B=+'27'= +:000079 cireular measure
and
1+ tan I &=1:00019

* A further small correction is called for by the fact that at actual temperature of the room (about
14”) the resistances given by the boxes were not exactly multiples of the B.A. unit, The difference in
the case of the principal box, which is marked as correct ab 14%2, may be neglected, but the resistances
taken from the auxiliary box (marked 18*3) mnst have been smaller than their nominal valne, to the
extent of a little over one part in a thonsand. By the same fraction &Q, and consequently L, must be
greater than is 8npposed in the aboye calculation. The corrected value of L will be

L=2:4052 x 105

1t is about {100 parts in a thousand greater than that found from the measured dimensions, and is, in my
opinion, quite as likely to he correct.
