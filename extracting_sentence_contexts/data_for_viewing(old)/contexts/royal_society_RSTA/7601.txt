of the tables were given for simple fractions of 1 kg./sq.cm. and thus no value was given
for latm., the nearest figure being for 1kg./sq.cm. The specific volume value for
1 atm. was obtained from the curve through the tables’ values of pressure x volume and
was 1675-7 c.c./g., which does not agree with the values given inthe preceding paragraph.

Maass and Mennie (1926) published values of the pressure due to various masses of
water enclosed in a measured volume and heated to various temperatures. It was found
possible to plot their results and interpolate values to 100°C. The values obtained in
this way covered the range 316-700 mm. and, when plotted upon the diagram men-
tioned above, they were found to be in substantial agreement with the curve obtained
by use of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology formula, particularly in view of
the fact that Maass and Mennie’s claim to accuracy was not greater than I in 1000 to
1 in 2000.

From this survey of the literature, it appears permissible to assume that the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology formula will give substantially reliable values at
pressures below atmospheric. The formula, when computed for 100° CG, is as follows:

V =RT/P+B,

where V = specific volume of steam in c.c./g.,
R = gas constant = 4-55504,
P = pressure in international atmospheres,
T = 273-16 +0°C,
