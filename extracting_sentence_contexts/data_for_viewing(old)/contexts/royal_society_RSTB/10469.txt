ation to allow compensatory nuclear coadaptation in the face of
mitochondrial mutation accumulation [67]. Sex, because of
the need for rapid coadaptation of (originally separate) organ-
isms, smacks of the Red Queen hypothesis, as has indeed
been pointed out [98]. The importance of mitochondria for
eukaryotic cell functioning can hardly be overstated and
appreciation for its ever extending roster of metabolic functions
is still growing [99-102]. Though there are of course indi-
cations for mito-nuclear coevolution [103,104], this in itself
does not mean it has been instrumental in the origin of
sexual recombination. The direct influence of internal ROS
formation I consider more dominant, as already illustrated by
the fact that the most important group of nuclear genes that
have to coevolve are the ones encoding proteins that form a
direct part of the mitochondrial multi-protein complexes or
perform other essential organellar functions, which migrated
to the nucleus, probably under ‘ROS pressure’, in the first
place. Again, the two simple basic values defining Muller’s
ratchet—total information content and mutation levels [18]—
both increased upon the merger at the basis of the ‘eukaryotic
revolution’. I would conclude that this constellation of driving
forces seems sufficient to explain the advent of sex.

However, recent research into mito-nuclear interactions,
using mice and fruit flies as model systems, has come up
