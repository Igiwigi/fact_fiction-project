STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. 129

arrangement of bone. It is proposed to restrict the term primary bone to tissue 80
formed, as it will be subsequently shown that the development of Haversian systems
in the spaces formed in primary bone, is effected hy processes similar to those which
are concerned in the growth of bone generally, and in the extension of the flat cranial
bones. Age and situation no doubt modify the conditions of growth, or development
of secondary bone, as it may be called, but the processes in either case are alike.

Hence, in describing the manner in which a long bone increases in diameter, we
shall in fact be describing the process by which a flat cranial bone is extended.
Before however going to this point the authors will state the results of their observa-
tions on the subject of the absorption of bone, on that interesting and important pro-
cess by which the Haversian spaces are formed out of the solid tissne of bone.

During the present winter it became necessary to remove a portion of the femur
which protruded from a stump six weeks after the removal of the limb. From the
medullary cavity a granulating mass projected and covered the surface of the bone left
by the saw, and as the bone was rapidly wasting from the inner or medullary surface,
we had in this specimen a favourable opportunity of examining the tissue which lay
in immediate contact with the surface of the wasting bone. On cutting through this
piece of femur in its length with a very fine jeweller's saw, it was found that a dense
pale pink tissue lay in contact with the inner surface of the bone, which was hollowed
