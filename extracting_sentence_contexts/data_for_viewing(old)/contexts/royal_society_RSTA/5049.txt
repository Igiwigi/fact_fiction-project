Motivated by these reasons, we undertook both a gemological and mathematical analysis to
attempt to describe the process by which the diamonds were wrought into their present forms.

In shape, the diamonds are roughly ovaloid having major and minor axes of ca 25mm and
21mm (left spectacle lens according to the wearer), respectively, and ca 24mm and 23 mm (right)
with both plates displaying a high degree of parallelism. The plates are thus not lenses in the
optical sense; rather they are filters. The right plate is approximately 1.59 mm thick while the left
is 1.71 mm thick. This gives both diamonds a high aspect ratio of ~15:1. Both plates have been
faceted at a low angle to the upper face around the perimeter in an irregular fashion.

From a gemological perspective, the stones appear flawless when examined with a loupe and
appear colourless and transparent when viewed through the stone. The colour evident around
the faceted edges suggests that they are in fact pale yellow.

A decision not to perform a study of the cathodoluminescence of the diamond was made
because the possibility of damage could not be eliminated. However, viewing the diamonds
in intense ultraviolet light reveals a spectacular growth history as shown in figure 2 which
is unparalleled in terms of size and form. These fluorescence topographs were made using
DiamondViewâ„¢, an instrument in which intense <230nm ultraviolet radiation illuminates the
surface of a diamond so that images of the resulting surface fluorescence can be recorded [2].
This instrument was originally developed to aid identification of synthetic diamond material
using differences in characteristic growth structures relative to those of natural diamonds.
For type IaAB diamonds, the fluorescence patterns are produced by variations in the nitrogen
