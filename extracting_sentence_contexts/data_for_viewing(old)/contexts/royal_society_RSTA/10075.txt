After the construction of the furnace was completed it was tested to 450 atmos-
pheres, and has since been used frequently up to 200 atmospheres gaseous pressure.

At first it was anticipated that so large a joint as that of the main cover would
show some leakage at the higher pressures, the total stress on the bolts retaining the
cover amounting under ordinary working conditions to over 100 tons. These fears
were, however, not realised, the only precautions necessary being to keep the joint
perfectly clean and, of course, to tighten up the nuts evenly all round. Occasionally,
as the pressure rose, a slight escape of gas was noticed, but this was stopped without
any difficulty by tightening up the corresponding stufting box or joint.

In fact, it may be said that throughout the work no difficulty has been experienced
in keeping the apparatus gas-tight.

The furnace is, of course, equally suitable for work 7m vacuo, and has occasionally
been used in this way—in connection, for instance, with spectroscopical investigations.

In the course of the present research the electrical conditions have varied widely,
in some cases as much as 1000 ampéres, in others 500 volts, having been employed
without difficulty. The power used in most experiments was between 10 and
15 kilowatts. When it is desired to use high-tension currents (1000. 25,000 volts)
with this furnace the carbon feeding mechanism of the small apparatus can be used
to replace that described above, with which it is interchangeable.
