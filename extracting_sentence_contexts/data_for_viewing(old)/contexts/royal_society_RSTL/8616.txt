It does not seem necessary to give the constants A, O, &c. ; but instead the secon-
dary constants of the formula u=IK+K sin (r +0) +K sin (1 +20)+&c., deduced from

their corrected values, are given as more convenient for computation in Table VIIL.
(p. 427).

1 have given the constants for the horary coefficients A, O, &c. to the 6th order for
symmetry ; but in fact I do not think any of them less than 0:05 need be attended
to. Even this limit is beyond what can be expected to be available when they are only
determined by the observations of seven years, as is evident from what I have already
$aid as to the PE of the quantities from which they are determined. Whether the
diurnal variation of the coordinates follows the same law in different septennial periods

remains to be determined; probably it does. The constants belonging to K and K' are
o 8

larger than the others, and, as derived from larger coefficients, merit more confidence.

'The effect of the texms of the first and second orders, which are the chief, are similar ;
but the others present opposite phases, and would probably be modified by more
