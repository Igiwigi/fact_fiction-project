At this stage an exact measurement of the total quantity of hydrogen absorbed
was made, and it was found that 94:50 cub. centims., or 851 volumes, had been taken
up by the palladium foil. That the absorption at 100° was complete was shown by the fact that on raising
the temperature to 100° C. about 100 volumes of gas were expelled, and of this about
three-quarters was reabsorbed on cooling down to the ordinary temperature, whilst
the remainder, along with seven additional volumes, was occluded on standing for
eighteen hours. The final measurement showed that 95°18 cub. centims., or 858
volumes, of hydrogen had been absorbed.
