not only discouraged people to look for the electroweak monopole but also prevented them from
appreciating the existence of the electroweak monopole [10-12].

Moreover, it has been claimed that the Georgi-Glashow model has the ‘t Hooft-Polyakov
monopole because the Higgs triplet breaks the symmetry, but the standard model of the Higgs
doublet forbids us having a monopole.

This assertion, however, is wrong [13-15]. First, with the separation of the overall U(1) phase,
(2.11) shows that € becomes a CP! field which has the S? topology. Moreover, ii defined by € has
the S? topology. And C,, and C,, derived from & describes the monopole. This demonstrates that
the standard model does have the 72(S”) monopole topology.

In fact, the Abelian decomposition of the standard model tells that the standard model and the
George-Glashow model has the same SU(2) monopole topology. This is evident from (2.26) and
(2.32), where exactly the same magnetic potential C,, represents the monopole topology. The only
difference is that the standard model has an extra U(1)y interaction which can have the Abelian
monopole topology. This assures that, as far as the SU(2) part is concerned, the electroweak
monopole and ’t Hooft-Polyakov monopole have the same monopole topology. This is why the
electroweak monopole becomes a hybrid between the ’t Hooft-Polyakov monopole and Dirac
monopole [13,16].

There are other arguments which support the existence of the electroweak monopole.
Obviously, the electroweak unification of the electrodynamics and weak interaction retains the
unbroken U(1)(em), except that here U(1)(em) becomes non-trivial. This is because U(1)(em) in the
standard model comes from the Abelian subgroup of SU(2) which is non-trivial. So it must have
