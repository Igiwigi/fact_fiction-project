(1931 a), p. 488, Pl. 39, figs. 16-18.*——Strenuella pustulata (CoBBOLD), LAKE
(1932), p. 196, Pl. 21, figs. 16-18.

Fragments of this species are plentiful in a band of limestone lying immediately above
the Callavia Beds ; a stratigraphical position identical with that at the type locality at
Comley, and it has not been found outside this limestone band.

Locality and Horizon.—Rushton, loc. 3.—Lower Cambrian; the FH. bellimarginatus
Limestone.

Since this notice was written, we have had the advantage of seeing LAKr’s part vii
of his Monograph (see reference above), in which he gives reasons for referring this species
to Strenuella. He does not, however, notice the fact that the anterior branch of the
facial suture is very short and diverges from the palpebral lobe to the marginal rim,
which it cuts on a short forward curve, not on a long one, as is suggested by his fig. 16
of Pl. 21, and also by that of Coppoxp (1910 a, Pl. 6, fig. 1) ; the marginal rim in those
figured specimens had not been entirely cleared of matrix. In the two specimens of the
same species figured by Copsoxp (1931 a, Pl. 39, fig. 10) it has been cleared almost to
the end and the course of the suture is closely indicated. On the same plate, fig. 19, of a
cranidium of Protolenus latouchei, Coppotp, shows a rim not cleared, while fig. 20
represents a cranidium of P. paradoxoides, MarrHEw, in which the rim has been almost
entirely cleared.

P. pustulatus has the eye and suture of Protolenus and a front which is characteristic of
Strenuella.
