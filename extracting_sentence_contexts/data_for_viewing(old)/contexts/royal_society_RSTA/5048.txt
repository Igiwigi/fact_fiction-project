are propagated. In 1865, he published his great paper entitled ‘A dynamical theory of the a
electromagnetic field’ [1]. To quote Whittaker [25, vol. 1, p. 255]: 12

In this, the architecture of his system was displayed, stripped of the scaffolding by aid of :
which it had been first erected. [=

Interestingly, there is only one, somewhat apologetic, reference in a footnote to his papers ‘On : 3
physical lines of force’ of 1861-1862 in this paper. 1s

As Siegel has pointed out [6,26, pp. 187-188], from the beginning of his researches into ara
electromagnetism, he had three goals: aires

1. ‘first, to develop a theory that would encompass all the known facts of electricity and : 8
magnetism; aes)
2. second, to accomplish this unification by using Michael Faraday’s approach to electricity
and magnetism — the lines of force or field approach;
3. and third, to have the new theory go beyond what was known from experiment .. .”

In this third goal, he envisaged predictions of the theory which could be confronted by future
experiments, reflecting his deep interest in innovative experiment.

Maxwell’s own view of the significance of this paper is revealed in what C.W.F. Everitt calls
‘a rare moment of unveiled exuberance’ in a letter to his cousin Charles Cay:

I have also a paper afloat, containing an electromagnetic theory of light, which, till 1 am
