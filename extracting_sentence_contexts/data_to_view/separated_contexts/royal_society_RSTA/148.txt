et al. 2003; Meehl et al. 2007). This collection of currents has traditionally been referred to as the
thermohaline circulation, a term which is problematic because it emphasizes
density gradients while implicitly downplaying the importance of mechanical
forcing by the winds and interior turbulent mixing. In fact, ocean density
gradients are largely set up by the winds via Ekman currents and surface
buoyancy fluxes. Furthermore, mechanical forcing provides the energy source for
