These views were held by many to be mutually exclusive ; the antithesis
was heightened by the names given to them, for they were sometimes alluded to as
the “acidosis” and “alkalosis” theories. The more thorough investigation which we
have been able to give indicates that, so far from being mutually exclusive, they are
complementary. The blood at rest is, if anything, more alkaline at high altitudes
than at low ones—a change which would lead to apnoea but for the fact that the
respiratory centre is rendered more sensitive by reason of deficient oxygen supply. The effect of change in reaction is, if it exists, more than balanced by that of the
change in sensitivity, hence a somewhat increased total ventilation at rest. When
exercise is taken a given increment in hydrogen-ion concentration is caused by a much
less amount of exercise at the high altitudes than at the sea-level.
