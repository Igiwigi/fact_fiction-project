rocks of this region as the “ Lubur Series”, but these rocks have previously been re-
ferred to as the “Turkana Grit’? (Murray-Hughes 1933), a more descriptive name
both in respect of their composition and their occurrence. It is therefore proposed to
continue the use of the earlier term.

Arambourg (1935) correctly describes the series as composed of conglomerates,
arkoses and grits, the material having been exclusively derived from the crystalline
complex. On the other hand, his correlation with the Adigrat Sandstone (Blanford
1870) of Abyssinia, said to be of Triassic age (Aubry 1886), cannot stand, for the ex-
posure of the Turkana Grits in the Lokitaung Gorge has, since his visit, yielded massive
fossil trees that have proved to be dicotyledonous types.* It would therefore appear
that the grits are not earlier than Cretaceous. A further argument against the sug-
gestion that these grits are of Triassic, or even Cretaceous, age is found in the fact that
they are composed entirely of material derived from the Basement Complex. If the
grits were formed before the fracture that gave rise to the Uganda escarpment, where
are the deposits which must have accumulated as the result of erosion of that escarp-
ment? There is in fact only one sedimentary series, the Turkana Grits, and I am
therefore forced to the conclusion that they are the product of erosion acting on the
Uganda escarpment. Further, it is unlikely that the escarpment itself is of such an
early age, for it would hardly have remained so clear cut for such a great length of
time. It has usually been thought that the Central African Peneplain was first dis-
turbed in late Cretaceous times, but that rifting proper did not begin until the late
Oligocene (Gregory 1921, p. 204; Wayland 1929). It is probable, therefore, that the
Uganda escarpment was not formed during the Cretaceous but during the second and
true rifting period of the late Oligocene. In that case the Turkana Grits would be of
