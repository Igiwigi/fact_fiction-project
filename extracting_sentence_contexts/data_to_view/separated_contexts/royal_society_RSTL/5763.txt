A third result we may draw is, that while the expected difference was found between
he wind at the top and bottom of the mountain, viz. S.W. above and N.E. below, the
tratum of cloud was not found in the space between the two, but in or below the
aiddle of the N.E. current of air. This was certainly only the mountain cloud, which
«limited in horizontal extent to a few miles; but even the sea- or the true N.E.-cloud,
Dich was far more extensive,—stretching, in fact, as far as the eye could observe, when
Buy thousand feet above it, —only reached to between 4000 and 5000 feet of elevation,

ile the N.E. wind extended in height from the very sea itself to about 9000 fect. is was the general state of things for over two months at Guajara, when the weather
wy Settled in its N.E. trade; and it may be perhaps only when a storm comes to break

\Buntain in South Africa, between two opposite currents of air, and made to spin round
