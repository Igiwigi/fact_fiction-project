where TT is the second Piola—Kirchhoff stress with superscripts ‘ve’ and ‘e’ referring to the
viscoelastic and elastic stresses, respectively, and G is a fourth-order reduced relaxation tensor,
where reduced refers to the fact that it is non-dimensional, unlike the relaxation tensor in linear
viscoelasticity, which has dimensions of stress, see e.g. (2.3). The stress T° is the (instantaneous)
elastic stress, derived from a strain energy W as is standard in nonlinear elasticity. The form
prescribed in (4.1) preserves objectivity and provides a balance between realistic modelling and
ease of implementation in computational simulations. Of specific note and of importance in what
is to follow in this article, for isotropic, incompressible QLV materials, relaxation is independent of
strain. Recall that the Cauchy stress T is related to TT by

TW=JF 'TET (4.2)

where F is the deformation gradient while the superscript ‘T’ denotes its transpose and J = detF.
Restricting attention now to the scenario of interest in the present paper, isotropic incompressible
media, equation (4.1) takes the form [40]
