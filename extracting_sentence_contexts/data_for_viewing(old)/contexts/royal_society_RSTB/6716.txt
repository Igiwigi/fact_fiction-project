sulcus frontalis inferior has no relations to either the cortical or vascular areas, and
cannot have been derived from the sulcus rectus. The vascular relations in
Q.1487.R. and Q.1905.R. reveal the identity of the sulcus rectus in man. KApPERS

(1929, a, p. 309) discusses the homology of the sulcus rectus, and reaches a conclusion
in harmony with the above.

Two facts so far stand out : firstly, the areas 6 and 8 remain in relation to area 4 ;
secondly, area 10 retains its relation to the frontal pole. The fundamental sulci
of the frontal lobe in the Cercopithecidae become separated from one another in a
way analogous to the separation of the sulcus lunatus from the sylvian and parallel
sulci in man.

One other area remains fixed in position and gives the key to the solution of the
problem of the position of the expansion of the frontal cortex. The orbital surface
of the frontal lobe, with its included sulci orbitales, retains its identity, and is limited
laterally by the line of vascular demarcation between the anterior and middle cerebral
arteries. The expansion has taken place within the area of the middle cerebral artery.

The central point between these fixed areas is the upper end of the sulcus fronto-
