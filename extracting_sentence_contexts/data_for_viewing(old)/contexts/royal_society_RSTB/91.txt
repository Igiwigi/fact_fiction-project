Having thus shown most of the details of the organisation of this strobilus from
actual specimens, we run little risk of error in representing its morphology as seen in
a vertical section by the restored diagram, fig. 20 (Plate 9). The letters of reference
are used in the same way as in the previous figures. The sections at m’, m’, show

the inner and outer verticils of the sporangia only, having passed between two sporan-
giophores whilst at J, 7, these sporangiophores are intersected vertically. The cortical
lacunee introduced at 7, 7, are omitted elsewhere for the same reasons.

The fact that so many specimens of these fruits, otherwise so rare, were aggregated
in one small nodule probably indicates that they were borne singly upon the
extremities of several small branches clustered round the extremity of one stem.
