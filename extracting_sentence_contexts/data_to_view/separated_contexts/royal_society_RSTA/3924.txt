We can only attribute this to the transformation of the residual y into a
mixture of Cu,Sn and liquid, a reaction that becomes much more marked in the
succeeding alloys. If this be the right explanation of the singularity, then the
reaction occurs at a slightly higher temperature than in the case of alloys
with more tin. This, again, may be due to the fact that when the change,
y = Cu,Sn + liquid, takes place in Sn 26, there are already crystals of Cu,Sn in the
alloy which may serve as nuclei and precipitate the reaction. In order to verify this
cooling curve we repeated it with a different pyrometer and a fresh sample of alloy,
and found the same phenomenon.

Sn 27. 40Â°8 per cent. of tin.
