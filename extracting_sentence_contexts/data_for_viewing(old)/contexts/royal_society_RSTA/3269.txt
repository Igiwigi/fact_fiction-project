the collective of growing particles on the degree of metastability (ie. on the magnitude
of supercooling or supersaturation) of the surrounding matrix phase (mushy layer)
becomes significant.

Another possible mechanism of the solid-phase evolution in a mushy layer occurs in DN
directional solidification processes when the planar solid/liquid interface becomes unstable [4-7]. a
So, a small perturbation of the phase interface will lead to favourable growth conditions for a D8
small bump whose tip evolves faster than neighbouring interfacial regions [8]. This eventually .
will lead to the formation of dendritic structures evolving in a mushy layer and compensating
the thermal or constitutional supercooling [9-11]. In those parts of the mushy layer where the
metastability level is small enough so that nucleation does not happen, the processes of particle
coalescence (Ostwald ripening) and agglomeration may occur [12-16]. In view of the fact that
it is difficult to study all possible crystal growth processes simultaneously, the mushy layer can
conditionally be divided into different regions with a predominant role of one or another of the
aforementioned growth mechanisms. A schematic representation of the mushy layer structure is
given in figure 1. Note that throughout this paper, we theoretically study the metastable region
III (the phase transition process at its intermediate stage) where nucleation and growth of crystals
are of primary importance.

The available theoretical results on the evolution of the polydisperse phase in pure systems
(i.e. without heterogeneous nuclei) refer either to the intermediate or to the most final stage of
the phase transition [17-22]. In studies of the first stage, the assumption of the independence
of individual particles is usually used. The analysis of the second stage (coalescence and
coagulation) is usually based on neglecting the appearance of new nuclei [23-28]. Note that the
