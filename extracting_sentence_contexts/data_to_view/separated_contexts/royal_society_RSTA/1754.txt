It then uses Bayesian inference
to simultaneously estimate both the parameters of interest, as well as the ‘nuisance’ parameters
that describe the possible unknown systematics. Markov chain Monte Carlo is used to first draw
samples from the resulting posterior, and then marginalize over all the nuisance parameters, to
get a final conservative posterior for the parameters of interest, that accounts for the fact that there
are likely unknown systematics. In particular, this approach is able to give realistic long thick tail
probabilities, to account in a systematic way for the fact that there may be ‘unknown unknowns’. We show in figure 3 a simple implementation of the methodology, in the context of
estimating how energetic a laser system must be to achieve ignition. Suppose (i) three different
independent estimates give E; =5.0+0.5MJ, Ez =5.5+0.2MJ and £3 = 8.0 + 0.2 MJ (arbitrary
numbers chosen to illustrate methodology) and (ii) one is agnostic as to which method is better.
