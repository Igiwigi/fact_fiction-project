The value of
this forward E.M.F. was 6°5, 6°4 and 5:3 volts respectively, again practically inde-
pendent of the position of the search carbon. These experiments show that there is in this are at or near the positive electrode
a back E.M.F. having a mean value of 16°7 volts, and at or near the negative
electrode a forward E.M.F. of 671 volts. The fact that the algebraic sum of these
two voltages is not equal to the observed mean back E.M.F. 12°3 volts of the arc, as
a whole, is probably caused by the distortion of the lines of flow of the current

through the are, produced by the introduction of the search carbon, which renders
the sum of the resistances measured between each of the main electrodes and the
search carbon greater than their total as measured between the main electrodes. The back E.M.F. of the are as a whole consists, therefore, of two H.M.E.’s located
at or near the electrodes, the larger E.M.F. situated at or near the positive electrode
opposing the flow of the current, the smaller E.M.F, situated at or near the negative
electrode helping the flow of the current. The approximate values of the resistance E.M.F. of each part of the are, and the
drop of volts due to each of these causes, corrections for the self-induction and
resistance of the holders and carbons being omitted as before, are given in Table VI.
