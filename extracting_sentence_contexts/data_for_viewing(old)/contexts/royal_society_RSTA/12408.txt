* As the investigation in this Appendix has some pretensions to generality, we should try to settle
the amount it is fairly entitled to. No objection is likely to be raised to the use of the circuital equations
(212), (213), with the restriction of strict proportionality between E and H and the fluxes D and B, or
C and K entirely removed; nor to the estimation of J, and G, as the “true” currents; nor to the use of
the same form of flux of electromagnetic energy when the medium is stationary. For these things are”
obviously suggested by the preceding investigations, and their justification is in their being found to
continue to work, which is the case. But the use in the text of language appropriate to linear functions,
which arose from the notation, &e., being the same as before, is unjustifiable. We may, however, remove
this misuse of language, and make the equation (226), showing the flux of energy, rest entirely upon
the two cireuital equations. In fact, if we substitute in (226) the relations (217a), (217b), it becomes
merely a particular way of writing (214).

It is, therefore, to (217a), (217b) that we should look for limitations. As regards (217a), there does
not seem to be any limitation necessary. That is, there is no kind of relation imposed between E and @,
and Hand K. This seems to arise merely from Q meaning energy wasted for good, and haying no
further entry into the system. But as regards (217b), the case is different. For it seems necessary, *
