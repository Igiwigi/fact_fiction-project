He
explains this as follows: ‘‘ The origin of these discs must be referred, therefore, simply
to the habit of resting on the bottom, and the necessary condition of their development
appears to be the suitable position of either the ventral or pectoral fins. The sucker
is only developed on the anterior half of the belly, that is, when the ventral fins are
anterior. The absence of suckers in the freshwater fishes is thus accounted for by the
fact that in most of them the ventrals are posterior.” Except that the suckers have
developed in response to bottom life in strong currents none of KyLr’s other conclusions
is borne out by the facts adduced here. In my previous papers (19236, 1925, 1927),
I have indicated the main reasons for the absence of suckers in the majority of the
torrential fauna, but it is necessary to summarize here the main points. The currents of the sea and the breakers of the sea-shore are different from the flow
of a torrential stream in two respects.
