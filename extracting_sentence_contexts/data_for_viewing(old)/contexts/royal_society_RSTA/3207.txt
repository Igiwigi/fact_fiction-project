From the previous action, the equations of motion of the massive particle can be obtained. Note 8
that the coefficients in front of the gravitational potentials ¢ and y are universal. Hence, in the :
correct coordinates, one can locally cancel the gravitational field for all particles (and hence the areal
fact that constant gravitational potentials are unobservable in General Relativity). fo

The action (3.1) is valid for particles and antiparticles. One can easily modify it in both cases 24
in an arbitrary way. For instance, one can consider that antiparticles have the action ae

Here I have changed the coupling to the metric fields and included new possible force carriers
x and x" coupled with arbitrary couplings. Note that a coordinate transformation will not get
rid of these new forces (the equivalence principle is violated). It is tempting to try to constrain
the previous action. However, it is not clear what one is really testing, and if these analyses make
sense at all since, and here I go back to the previous section, the modifications in (3.3) may be
