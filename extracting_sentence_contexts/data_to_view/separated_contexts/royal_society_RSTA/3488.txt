A natural extension of this work is to consider the case of multivariate
samples. In its full generality, this is far from trivial, because a number of convenient properties
that accompany working on the real line no longer apply. In particular, the total ordering of real
numbers, the convenient cumulative form of the Dirichlet process and the fact that upper and
lower bounds of p-boxes are each valid cumulative distribution functions. The definition and properties of multivariate p-boxes are a topic of ongoing research [13]. A general account of the bivariate case has recently been given by Pelessoni et al. [14].
