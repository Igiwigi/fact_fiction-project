The respect which I entertain towards the names of Epixnus, Cavexpisn,
Pors80N, and other most eminent men, all of whose theories I believe consider induc-
tion as an action at a distance and in straight lines, long indisposed me to the view
I have just stated; and though I always watched for opportunities to prove the op-
posite opinion, and made such experiments occasionally as seemed to bear directly on
the point, as, for instance, the examination of electrolytes, solid and fluid, whilst under
induction by polarized light (951. 955.), it is only of late, and by degrees, that the
extreme generality of the subject has urged me till farther to extend my experi-
ments and publish my view. At present I believe ordinary induction in all cases to be
an action of contiguous particles, consisting in a species of polarity, instead of being
an action of either particles or masses at sensi√æle distances ; and if this be true, the
distinction and establishment of such a trath must be of the greatest consequence to
our further progress in the investigation of the nature of electric forces. The linked
condition of electrical induction with chemical decomposition ; of voltaic excitement
with chemical action ; the transfer of elements in an electrolyte; the original cause
of excitement in all cases; the nature and relation of conduction and insulation ; of
the direct and lateral or transverse action constituting electricity and magnetism; with
many other things more or less incomprehensible at present, would all be affected by
it, and perhaps receive a full explication in their reduction under one general law.

cordance of known facts with it, but in the consequences which would flow from it
if true; especially in those which would not be consistent with the theory of action

at a distance. Such a consequence seemed to me to present itself in the direction in
which inductive action could be exerted. If in straight lines only, though not perhaps
decisive, it would be against my view; if in euryed lines also, that would be a natural
result of the action of contiguous particles, but T think utterly incompatible with ac-
tion at a distance, as assumed by the received theories, which, according to every fact
and analogy we are acquainted with, is always in straight lines.
