Angiosperms are described in which the endosperm is apparently formed
without antecedent nuclear fusion ; these seem to be exceptional and rare. The sac of Peperomia exhibits certain peculiarities, on account of which a comparison
between it and that of Gnetum has already been suggested.* In the four-nucleate
stage of P. pellucida the sae shows no polarity, but the nuclei are arranged
peripherally, “like the spores of a tetrad”+—in fact, precisely as in Welwitschia
in the corresponding stage (fig. 16). When the mitoses are completed there are
sixteen nuclei in the sac belonging to the fifth generation from the macrospore. These are “rather evenly distributed through the sac”; one of them increases
in size and becomes the nucleus of the oosphere ; of the rest, eight fuse to form the
primary endosperm-nucleus.
