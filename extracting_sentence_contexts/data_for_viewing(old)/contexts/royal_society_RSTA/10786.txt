With two pieces of the same solid carbon, about 2 millims. apart, no foreign bodies
being introduced in any way, the highest P.D. obtained was about 0°5 volt on the
‘higher resistance voltmeter, and the resistance of the flame between the carbons was
deduced as about 4000 ohms, so that the E.M.F. between these solid carbons
was only about 0°62 volt. After soaking this same pair of carbons in potassium
carbonate the P.D. obtained was 1:0 volt., the resistance of the vapour being only a
few hundred ohms, so that the effect of introducing this potassium salt was to
greatly increase the E.M.F. between the carbons. If these E.M.F.’s are due to
Peltier effects, then it would seem as if the introduction of the potassium greatly
increased the thermo-electric power of the junction.

The above experiment is in agreement with the fact that the back E.M.F. of the
cored are has been generally found larger than that of the solid are, as the cored are
undoubtedly contains more impurities.

By varying the proportions in which the oxygen and coal gas were mixed before
burning, it was found that the highest P.D.’s appeared to correspond with the gases
being burnt in their combining proportions, so as to produce the hottest flame ;
if either gas was considerably in excess, a much lower P.D. was obtained. It is to be
noted, however, that by suppressing the coal gas altogether and allowing the carbon
to burn in the oxygen, P.D.’s up to 1°5 volt could be obtained, as before the hotter
electrode always being positive to the voltmeter. These latter experiments, though
not conclusive, are not in favour of the P.D. being due directly to a combination of
the carbon and either of the gases.
