These results have been contingent on two factors: the high-quality infrared (IR)
results provided by the Spitzer telescope infrared spectrograph instrument [7] and the knowledge
gained by theoretical and experimental studies on the IR signatures of these fullerenes [8-12]. In
addition to detection in their neutral state, fullerenes have been found to be prevalent in space in
charged states. In fact, owing to their low ionization potential, it was foreseen in the late 1980s
[13] that Ceo could easily be stripped of an electron to become C{,, at least in the gas phase. This
charged fullerene has recently been confirmed to be the origin of two diffuse interstellar bands
[14] and was evaluated to represent up to 0.9% of interstellar carbon [15]. Cationic fullerenes may
also exist in space, notably via charge transfer from endohedral metal atoms trapped within the
fullerene cage [16].
