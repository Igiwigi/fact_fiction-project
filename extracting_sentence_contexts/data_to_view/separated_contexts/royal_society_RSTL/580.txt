D In the application of the differential calculus to curve lines,
5 after making certain arbitrary assumptions, it appears that hy-
S perbolic areas, and arcs of circles, may be computed from the
Z integrals of the expressions =, Ez; the integrals of which
5 are in fact afforded by the several methods that relate to the
S quadratures of the circle and hyperbola; and mathematicians,
E either for the sake of embodying in some degree their specula-
= tions, or from a notion of a necessary x hay subsisting be-
E: tween circles, hyperbolas, and the integrals 72 Te =—, have
EZ expressed the integrals by the arcs and areas of those figures. = Although the computation of the integrals, is totally inde-

= pendent of the existence of the figures, and of their properties,

E yet it is curious, that the simplest transcendental expressions

= of analysis, should express parts of the simplest figures in

geometry,
