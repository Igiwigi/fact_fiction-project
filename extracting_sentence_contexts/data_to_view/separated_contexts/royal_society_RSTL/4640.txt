Proceeding from the sea-level to considerable altitudes, we find that the mean
temperature at Poona, in 1830, at 1823 feet above the sea-level, was 8028, differing
only six-tenths from the mean temperature of Bombay for 1844, and less than one
degree of Farr. from the mean temperature of 1843 at Bombay. A difference of
level of 1823 feet therefore gave a difference of less than one degree of temperature. The comparison of the temperatures of the three stations of Mahabuleshwur, Mer-
cara in Coorg, and Uttray Mullay in Travancore, all at the height of 4500 feet above
the sea-level, and differing little in longitude, but several degrees in latitude, affords
some interesting facts. The latitude of Uttray Mallay is about 8? 00' N., long. 76* 00' F.,
Mereara, lat. 12 30, long. 73* 30', Mahabuleshwar, lat. 17* 58', long. 732 29'. The mean
temperature of Uttray Mullay, situated nearest to the equator, is /ower by 3*35 than
the mean temperature of Mercara, and 266 lower than that of Mababuleshwaur, while
the mean temperatures of Mercara and Mahabuleshwur are almost identical.
