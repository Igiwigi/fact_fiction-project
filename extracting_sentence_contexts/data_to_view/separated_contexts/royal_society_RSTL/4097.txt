In other cases they
will be contrary to that of the sun, and the apparent effect will be that which is due
to the difference of two real motions. In general the directions of the true and paral-
lactic motions will be inclined to each other ; but in all cases the difference given by
the comparison of the catalogues will be compounded of the effect of the real motion
of the star and the effect of the sun's displacement. Hence it is manifest that the
fact of proper motions being observed to take place in all directions, is in no way in-
consistent or incompatible with an apparent general drifting of the stars towards
one particular region ; and the problem to be solved is to separate, if possible, the
general effect produced by the sun's displacement from the complicated effects caused
by the motions of stars in every direction with which it is entangled and mixed up. Now it is easy to see that a question of this kind cannot be solved by taking account
of only a small number of proper motions. A very considerable number must be
employed ; and, indeed, in order that the solution may be satisfactory, regard must
be bad to every star without exception of which the proper motion has been deter-
mined with sufficient certainty.
