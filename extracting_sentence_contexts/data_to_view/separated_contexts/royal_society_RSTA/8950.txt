For long-range work the superiority of the motor-driven
siren operating at about 25 pounds air-pressure was definitely established ; in weather
conditions associated with a smooth sea, a pitch of 182 complete vibrations per second
was found to be most suitable, while a high pitch note of 295 vibrations per second
was heard to better advantage during ‘high wind and a rough, noisy sea. The scientific aspect of the preceding tests is discussed at some length by Lord
RAYLEIGH in a later paper,* it is there pointed out that the increase of power required
to operate the sirens so as to generate more powerful sound-waves is entirely out of
proportion to the gain in range of audibility. This point is well illustrated by the
fact that when the high note of the Scotch siren was sounded, energy was consumed
at the rate of about 600 horse-power. The experiments just referred to constitute
a final practical test of particular forms of sirens, in that the signals are judged under
the same conditions and by the same means as when they are issued as signals to
navigators. While there is no difficulty in thus estimating the relative merits of
various forms of sound-generating apparatus it is evident that very little information
is to be derived in this way as to the proportion of power actually converted into
sound or as to the causes of the very large waste of energy which is known to occur
in all sound-producing instruments.
