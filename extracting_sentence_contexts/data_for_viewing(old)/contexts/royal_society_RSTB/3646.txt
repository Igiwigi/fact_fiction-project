dissociated into small particles, have in many cases disappeared—that is, have been
dissolved, so that the chlorogogen cells present the same appearance as those of
specimens kept in alcohol for two years.

The yellow colour of the chlorogogen granules of Halla, and the presence in them
of fat, at first suggested that their pigment is a lipochrome, especially as MacMunn
(1889, p. 75) found a colouring matter of this nature in the chlorogogenous tissue on
the “stomach” of Arenicola. But the pigment of these granules in Halla does not
turn blue or green on treatment with concentrated nitrie or sulphuric acids, and is
only very slowly dissolved by the usual lipochrome solvents; moreover, the fat may
be totally removed so that the granules no longer react to Scharlach and yet a
considerable amount of the yellow colour still remains in the granules. These
facts seem to indicate that the pigment is not an ordinary lipochrome.* The
colouring matter has a great stability and a degree of resistance to solution almost
as high as that of the substance which it impregnates. Erste (1887, p. 729) remarked
upon the similarly resistant character of the colouring matter found in the nephridial
and chlorogogen concretions of Clistomastus, and considered that it was probably derived
from hemoglobin, although the tests for blood and bile pigments which he applied
to these and to similar concretions in the blood corpuscles were negative; the
pigment did not show any absorption bands. According to W1LLEM (1899, p. 563)
the pigment in the chlorogogen granules of Avenicola owes its origin rather to the
substances on which the animal feeds than to hemoglobin. In their resistance to
reagents these pigments resemble some of the iron-free pigments found in man.+ I
have been unable to ascertain the presence of iron in the chlorogogen granules of
Halla, but, owing to the difficulties of obtaining definite evidence of the presence of
