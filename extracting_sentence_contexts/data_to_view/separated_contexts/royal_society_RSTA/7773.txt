Variations of a few degrees
could safely be neglected. Dissolved lead salts were proved to have no effect, for a
solution containing 1 gm of dextrine and 1-5 gm lead nitrate in 100 cc, or one
containing 0-5 gm dextrine and 20 gm of lead acetate, had the rotation to be ex-
pected if no lead salt were present. Preliminary trials had shown that crystalline lead azide or chloride could, in fact,
adsorb optically active material from a dextrine solution, but ordinary dextrine is a
complex mixture, and there was no certainty that the small fraction adsorbed in this
way was of the same nature as the much larger quantity taken up when the crystals
are formed and grow in a dextrine solution. Two precipitations were therefore made
