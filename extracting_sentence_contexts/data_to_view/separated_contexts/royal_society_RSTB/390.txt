In all cases there are certain colours which produce no effects. In the
Vanessidee the brilliant metallic tints of the pup can be greatly influenced by the
presence of gilded surfaces in the environment of the larva before pupation. This
fact appears to prove that the metallic tints are essentially protective, and probably
subserve concealment by their resemblance to glittering minerals, such as mica. This
theory is confirmed by observations upon the habits of certain species with gilded
pupe. At the same time the gilded appearance has acquired another and opposite
significance in other species, being of use in rendering the pups conspicuous, and
thus acting as a signal of an unpleasant taste or smell.
