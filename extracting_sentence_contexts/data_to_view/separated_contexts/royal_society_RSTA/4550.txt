When Fr < 1, corresponding to deep water waves (U < c), equation (2.2) yields [51]:

i.e. the surface water displacement is equivalent to the stationary case of the inverted barometric
factor (1hPa~+1cm). For Fr >1, (U>Â¢c), a relatively higher speed of the atmospheric
disturbance yields n ~0 [20]. This is due to the fact that the time interval for energy transfer
from the propagating pressure disturbance is insufficient for an ocean response [60]. However,
in the case where Fr > 1, defined as a supercritical storm, a wake similar to that behind a
high-speed marine vessel is generated, resulting in meteotsunamis [62]. Another feature of the
Proudman resonance is that when Fr <1 atmospheric pressure and water displacement are out
of phase with an elevation above mean level, while when Fr < 1 they are in phase when the wave
is a depression.
