In the particular case of a flat plate aerofoil g(x, z) becomes
the constant ¢ over the plane of the aerofoil, where ¢ is the angle of incidence. OPERATIONAL TRANSFORM OF PROBLEM
With axes as defined previously we introduce the Laplace transform, with respect to z,

of the fundamental equation

ae) ig 0p wo? Ox? * Oy? 027°
Thus, if d(x, y) = ) e-'=4(x,y, Z) dz is the Laplace transform of ¢, then, using the fact that

with our choice of axes ¢, 04/0z are zero over the plane z = 0

The method can only be used effectively if a boundary condition for the transform equation
can be found, corresponding to the condition for 0¢/dy over the surface of the aerofoil.
