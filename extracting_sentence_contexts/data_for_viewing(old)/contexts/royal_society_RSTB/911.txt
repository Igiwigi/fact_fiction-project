absence of movement is the only justification for supposing that life is extinct
not in abeyance. Similarly in Astacus we find that the eosinophile cell is very my
more stable than the hyaline cell. Correlated with this fact we find that the chan
of environment due to the presence of bacterial poisons. will call forth the most a
manifestation of the special functions of the eosinophile cell, while the hyaline Â¢
may be paralysed or destroyed. It is possible, however, that the poisons of all micr
organisms do not possess this discriminating value. It may be that if a sufficient
large number of micro-organisms were taken, they could be placed in a series
mencing with those which acted towards the cells like indifferent particles,
ingested by the hyaline cells and unnoticed by the eosinophile cells, and ending w
those like B. anthracis or filamentosus, which provokes the most profound activity (
the eosinophile cell while the hyaline cell is incapable of attacking them. Bearing i
mind the complex conditions of the conflict, we are forced to conclude that th
organisms against which the Frog is not immune may be found either at one end
at the other end of the series, or at both.
