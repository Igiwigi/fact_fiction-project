Uranus’ stratospheric CO is approximately 8 + 1 ppb [105], which is much lower abundance than
Neptune’s approximately 1 ppm. CO has not been detected at all in Uranus’ troposphere, with a
30 upper limit of less than 2.1 ppb [31], again much lower than Neptune’s approximately 0.1 ppm. Therefore, the case for a rock giant is in fact simpler for Uranus as there is no requirement to
dredge up CO from a strongly oxygen enriched interior to explain the tropospheric composition. The lack of tropospheric CO could then be explained by either: lack of a large cometary impact
in the rock giant case; or by reduced tropospheric convection in the ice giant case, as inferred from
the low emitted infrared flux [78]. The D/H ratio is again the strongest argument in favour of the
rock giant scenario, although as for Neptune, for this to have relevance to the interior requires a
well-mixed fluid envelope [9,24].
