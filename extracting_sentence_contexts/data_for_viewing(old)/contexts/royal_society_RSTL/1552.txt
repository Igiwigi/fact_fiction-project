cation. This -occurs particularly in the passerine tribe, and
amongst the accipitres. In the nightingale the duct is so short,
that it is scarcely visible ; but the yolk bag remains during
life about the size of a small pea, adhering to the intestine
with which it communicates.

The preceding facts furnish a curious example of the ceco-
nomy of nature, in adapting an organ of foetal life to the
exercise of a particular function in the full grown bird.

They likewise afford a proof that the yolk bag and intes-
tine not only have communicated, but that they were originally
continuous structures, a fact which has been lately denied by
LEVEILLE'.

At a future period, I hope to lay before the Society, some
observations upon the functions of the different parts of the
egg during incubation, from which it will be found, that a
communication between the yolk bag and intestines exists as
a matter of necessity.
