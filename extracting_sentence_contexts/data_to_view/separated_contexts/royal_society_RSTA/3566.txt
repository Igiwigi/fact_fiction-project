According to the literature, flow characteristics are one of the most important factors of VC
obstruction [6-9]. To illustrate this point, let us mention that, in standard VCs, between 50% and
75% of the CSF volume flows through proximal holes, i.e. holes located on the segment closest to
the valve (or furthest from the tip of the VC), therefore, downstream of the other segments. This
fact increases the shear stress at the proximal segment (hence, the likelihood of obstruction there
[10]) and, moreover, makes critical any obstruction at its interior. Designing VCs less prone to obstruction (thus, with a longer expected lifetime) is crucial for
the treatment of hydrocephalus. A first step towards the numerical study of the CSF flow in VCs
was done in [6] using CFD in two dimensions.
