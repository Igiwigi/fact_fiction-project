The basidorsals of the axis, equal in size and proportions to those of other cervicals,
and its dorsal-interdorsals represent a development similar to the rest of the cervicals
(fig. 22, aw.bd., d.id.). Like the latter, the atlas and axis vertebre bear rudiments

of prechondral ribs, developed from the intermuscular portions of the caudal sclero-
tomites. The groove separating in 4-day Larus the anterior (interventral) and posterior
(basiventral) divisions of the atlas and axis intercentra has disappeared. ‘The same may
be stated with regard to the histological difference expressed in 4-day Larus and 8-day
Struthio. These facts suggest that both components (inter- and basi-ventral) of the atlas
and axis intercentra have undergone complete fusion. The same can be stated with
regard to 12-day Struthio.
Extracervical Regions.

The moniliform differentiation of the notochord of the thoracic region is of special
interest, revealing a transitional stage in the localisation of the dilatations and constric-
tions with respect to the vertebral rings and sclerotomes. The conditions exhibited by
the anterior portion of the thoracic region resemble those of the cervical region, the
dilatations being inter- and the constrictions intra-sclerotomically disposed. ‘Che hinder
portion of the thoracic and of the lumbar regions, on the contrary, show more or less
distinctly expressed intrasclerotomic dilatations and intersclerotomic constrictions (as
the cervical region in 3- and 4-day Larus). The caudal region still remains unaffected
