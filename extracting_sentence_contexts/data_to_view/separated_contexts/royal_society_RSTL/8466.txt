Hefte 2 & 3, p. 77) has arrived at from a few similar experiments on the motor centres of the brain of
dogs. He concludes that because dogs ultimately recover completely from such disturbances of motor func-
tions as are a firs caused by the ablation of cortical centres, these centres cannot be motor in the true sense
of the term. Experiments on dogs, however, are not strictly comparable with experiments on monkeys ; and
the relative subordination and association of lower centres in different animals is a fact which ought to be
carefully considered. The explanation I have elsewhere given (* West Riding Reports,‚Äù yol. iti.) of how as80-
ciated movements, such as those of the limbs of dogs, can still be carried out through the associated action of
lower centres 80 long as the cortical centres of the other hemisphere are intact, is quite in harmony with the
facts Henaaxx gives, and is further demonstrated by the complete paralysis of voluntary motion which follows
the destruction of corresponding regions in both hemispheres in these animals. DR.
