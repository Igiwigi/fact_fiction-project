tinuity with similar elements in the subsporangial tissue. In every example investi-
gated tracheides were found in proximity to the groups of sporangia.

In connection with the projections of tissue bearing sporangia, the occurrence of
archegonia in close proximity must be considered : it appears that in some cases the
former stand in a similar relation to archegonia as the archegonial projections referred
to above. From figs. 15-17 it will be readily seen that archegonia occur at no great

listance from the sporangia. Further, when separate masses of subsporangial tissue
Gare close together, giving on external examination the effect of a single group of
Bporangia, archegonia are found on the intervening areas of prothallus tissue. In
uch cases they are usually unopened, but with the canal and venter of a brown
Holour. A number of facts appear to indicate that the projections bearing sporangia
Qyre of a similar nature. That this is so in some cases does not at all exclude the
Sprobability that sporangia are also developed from tissue, the origin of which has
‘shad no connection with the site of an archegonium.
E Some of the archegonia present no differences from those found in an unopened
state elsewhere. But the cells around the ovum in others have, by division, given
Hise to a small-celled tissue, which closely resembles that found beneath sporangia,
fund may, in fact, be continuous with it. This may occur in connection with arche-
“@ronia, the central series of cells of which has not become discoloured. Further, in
ome of the sporangium-bearing projections, the arrangement and appearance of the
Seells suggest that the projection is a modification of such an archegonium (fig. 22).
In this example, what appears to be the central series of cells can be recognised.
SSuch a case leads naturally to elevations in which all indications of archegonial origin
