In the reciprocal figure, the
reciprocal of the close-plane is on the cuspidal curve, and is a close-point; the reciprocal

of the point P is the cuspidal tangent plane; that of the line w the tangent of the cus-
pidal curve; that of the tangent of the residual curve the cotriple tangent ; that of the
torsal line the cotangent. 39. The torsal line of a close-plane is not a mere torsal line ; in fact by what precedes
it appears that the surface and the Hessian intersect in this line, counting not twice
but three times, and it is thus that the reduction in the order of the spinode curve

caused by the close-plane is =.
