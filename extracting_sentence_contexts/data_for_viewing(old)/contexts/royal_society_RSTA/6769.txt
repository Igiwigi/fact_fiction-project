As shown in § 10, two depths of parallel stream can consist with given values of the total
flow and of the depth below ‘stagnation level’ of the rigid horizontal bed: in theory either
is conceivable far downstream of the sluice. Thus one must expect that a symmetrical solution
exists in which the free surface regains its original level after passing the sluice. But flow
of this kind would entail high or infinite velocity at A in figure 1 (according as the sluice has
small or zero thickness), therefore (in practice) negative pressure or ‘cavitation’ close to A.
The one solution having practical interest is that which is indicated in figure 1, unless a
regime is possible in which waves are generated in the issuing stream. We shall return to this
question in § 42.

39. In the membrane analogue, according to § 10, unstable conditions exist upstream,
where the circumstances correspond with A in figure 2, but stable conditions downstream,
where the circumstances correspond with B. Neither region in fact gave trouble, except
that very fine grading had to be employed, as indicated in figure 25, to determine S with
precision. The assumed conditions upstream were those of §36, and a multiplying factor
24 /3 x 100 was employed. On the finest net (part of which is reproduced in a supplementary
diagram) ¥-values were computed to one more significant figure.

The accuracy of the accepted solution is shown by the close agreement of the recorded
boundary values of /y (above) and of d%/dv (below).* Downstream the free surface falls
continuously, the ‘asymptotic depth’ (which is calculable for the assumed conditions)
being 0-66 of the computed opening 8.
