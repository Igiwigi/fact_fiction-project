CHARLES E. BEEVOR ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE

differentiation so definite that it has been possible in coronal sections to show, in the
case where five arteries were injected, that the Corpus subthalamieum (Luy’s body)
has sometimes a double supply, its superior external part being injected by the
posterior communicating artery, while its internal inferior part is injected by the
posterior cerebral artery (p. 55). The fact that so small a body as the corpus
subthalamicum can receive its blood supply from two different arteries is against the
theory that the arrangement of the blood supply can have any functional signifi-
cance, as it appears to be purely anatomical and not distributed according to the
physiological action of the part. Another instance of the same condition is the
middle segment of the Lenticular nucleus, which is supplied in some brains by three
separate arteries (pp. 22 and 23). It will be advisable to take first the parts of the interior of the brain supplied by
the different arteries—basal branches, and then the distribution on the external
surface—the cortical branches.
