this study, the training of the pavement texture recognition model was performed with a limited
dataset of only five images per category. This constraint was motivated by the fact that collecting
diverse and extensive samples of pavement texture images is a challenging and laborious process
in road detection work. The main objective of this study was to propose a reliable model capable
of achieving high accuracy in recognizing pavement textures despite the limited availability of
training data, ultimately contributing to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of road surface
analysis and maintenance. The number of images used for model training is presented in table 2.
The proposed few-shot learning models were evaluated using a four-way five-shot classification
task, which is typical in the field of few-shot learning [42-45].

To reduce the storage volume and training time of the Siamese network and investigate how this
affects the accuracy of the network in classifying pavement texture, a comparative experiment
