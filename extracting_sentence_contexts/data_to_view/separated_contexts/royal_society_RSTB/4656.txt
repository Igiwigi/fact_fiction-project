This beetle is not iridescent, but presumably iridescent cuticles would be formed
in the same way. It is difficult to see how a periodic structure can arise in
a homogeneous medium after it has been excreted, except perhaps by a process
analogous to crystallisation. I was myself strongly opposed to the surface colour
theory, but the force of evidence has made me accept the fact that in the case
of scaleless beetles it is a more probable solution than the only other alternative,
a single film. IV.â€”Descriprion or Sections MADE FROM CERTAIN IRIDESCENT STRUCTURES,
(a) Material and Methods. Many methods have been described for cutting chitinous structures, but no
details could be found of a procedure specially devised for cutting scales.
