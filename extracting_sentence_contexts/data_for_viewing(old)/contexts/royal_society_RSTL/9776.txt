increase in the size of the cells, 1.e., a similar growth of protoplasm in the first one or
two hours of digestion ; we might then adopt a course of reasoning like that adopted |
in considering the formation of granules, and conclude that the protoplasm is growing |
also in the first stage of digestion when the cells are diminishing in 8ize. We have, '
however, more direct evidence to show that this is the case. j

Tt is true that the cells diminish in 8ize during this stage of digestion, but they do
not diminish sufficiently in size to warrant us in supposing that there is no growth of

= protoplasm ; further, since the cells are during this period till losing substances to the |

protoplasm. The mere extraction of the granules which have disappeared would leave
the cells very much smaller; this fact becomes the more striking when we reflect that
in the meantime more protoplasm has been used up to form granules. The changes
which take place in the cesophageal glands of the Frog after the animal has been fed
with sponge will serve as an instance. When the granules have entirely disappeared
from the cell, is it to be supposed that the cell is simply as it was at the beginning of
8ecretion, except that it has lost all its granules and a part of its protoplasm, viz. : that

which has been converted into granules. Clearly were this the case the cell would be
very much smaller than ib is.
