Since he attempted
to obtain a formula for each type of surge, the number of surges available for study in the
period used did not facilitate sufficiently accurate determinations. The number of stations
was therefore reduced to three (figure 7), the gradients at two of these being averaged.

(b) The damping ratio of 1/6, which had been derived from a lengthy investigation for
the North Sea, suggested that only the first peak (or trough) of the surge was of importance.

(c) Maximum simplification of the calculations was needed for application of the
formula.

(d) Failure of the original method in certain cases. We shall now consider these items in the light of the facts deduced in this paper. S (a) The most effective winds were mainly concentrated in the western half of the North
pea, and averaging the pressure gradients at points C and D is an obvious source of error.
‘sGeneral reasoning shows that if more weight were given to the gradients at point C the
sprediction of the initial surge peak would have been more accurate. This weighting would
“also have the effect of increasing the subsequent excessively high prediction, but it has
“been shown that the outflow through the Straits of Dover is a probable neutralizing factor.
< Meteorological conditions are conceivable, however, whereby a raising of level at
SSouthend due to the North Sea winds could co-exist with winds in the English Channel
Buch as to prevent an outflow.
‘2 Sufficient data should now be available for a return to the integration method over the
"Swhole of the North Sea, together with the addition of a station in the English Channel and
ne or more stations off the coast of Norway.
