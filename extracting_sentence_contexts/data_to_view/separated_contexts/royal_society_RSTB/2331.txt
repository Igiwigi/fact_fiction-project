210 DR. A. D. WALLER ON THE “BLAZE CURRENTS”

excited to its maximal blaze current, I have always found this latter to be accom-
panied by a marked increase of conductivity. This alteration was shown by the fact
that a standard deflection by yg'55 volt was found to be increased sometimes by as
much as 50 per 100. In such case, however, since the total resistance in circuit was
unknown, it was not possible to translate this obvious increase into its value in ohms. But this much it was possible to see with certainty, Ist, that the altered conductivity
was similar to both directions of testing current, and 2nd, that it subsided with
subsidence of blaze.
