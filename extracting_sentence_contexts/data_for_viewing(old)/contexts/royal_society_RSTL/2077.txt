275. The instantaneous charge of a Leyden battery by the poles of a voltaic
apparatus is another proof of the tension, and also the quantity, of electricity
evolved by the latter. Sir H. Davy says +, © When the two conductors from
the ends of the combination were connected with a Leyden battery, one with
the internal, the other with the external coating, the battery instantly became
charged, and on removing the wires and making the proper connexions, either
a shock or a spark could be perceived: and the least possible time of contact
was sufficient to renew the charge to its full intensity.”

276. In motion ; i. Evolution of Heat, —The eyolution of heat in wires and
fluids by the voltaic current is matter of general notoriety.

277. ii. Magnetism.—No fact is better known to philosophers than the power
of the yoltaic current to deflect the magnetic needle, and to make magnets
according to certain laws ; and no effect can be more distinctive of an elec-
trical current.

278. iii. Chemical decomposition.—The chemical powers of the voltaic cur-
rent, and their subjection to certain laws, are also perfectly well known.

279. iv. Physiotogical effects. —The power of the voltaic current, when strong,
to shock and conyulse the whole animal system, and when weak to affect, the
tongue and the eyes, is very characteristic.

280. v. Spark.—The brilliant star of light produced by the discharge of a
