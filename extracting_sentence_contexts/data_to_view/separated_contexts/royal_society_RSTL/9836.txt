A similar
feature pertains to the subjacent layer, the apex process of which may be traced often
into the outer cortical zone ere primary division occurs. Tt therefore appears probable
thab whilsb the greater bulk of nerve-fibre element of the lower four or five layers is
formed by the numerous secondary processes of the nerve-cell,* the outer cortical zone
derives its nervous element chiefly from the apex process of cells of underlying strata. The fact that the bifurcate or horned cell is met with at the commencement of this
layer in sparse detached clumps has been alluded to above as significant probably of a
rudimentary form of the second layer of higher animals. Now it has been shown that
this latter stratum is also extremely defective and in great part entirely absent in
the cortex of the Sheep ; in the Pig it is also but a shallow belt averaging '093 mm.
deep, increasing in. certain regions to '139 mm., or even *186 mm., whilst in Man its
greatest development is fully '279 mm. in depth. It appears clear, therefore, that the
development of this belt bears an important relation to the position of the animal in
the scale of organisation.
