This is a quantum type of constructive interference that can be accommodated in
a Hilbert space and a state reconstruction with the Born rule can be performed (see reference
[19]). In comparison with Khrennikova’s [19] data analysis, the magnitude of interference for the
statistical information considered here is moderate, i.e. less than cos 6 = 1. This could be attributed
to the fact that the frequencies for the whole population of voters were analysed and this can
entail a smaller size effect. From a psychology point of view, we can interpret the interference
of beliefs about the Presidential election outcomes with the beliefs about the voting for the
Democratic Congress in the situation of uncertainty, corresponding to quantum superposition of
states. Moreover, the interference of beliefs (the interference of probability ‘waves’ corresponding
to the degree of belief) can exhibit features of entanglement, especially, when the voter performs
the psychological ‘measurement’ of her beliefs simultaneously.

(b) The assumptions of applicability

In order to apply any model to existing data or to make predictions, one needs to develop
assumptions that can justify the structural and conceptual suitability of a proposed model.
