The plates vary a little in the
extent to which they overlap, some overlapping one another nearly up to the central
depression, others to a much less extent (see fig. 6). A study of the surface view
alone would lead one to believe that the coccoliths of C. pelagica have a simple plate-
like structure with a single central hollow, but an examination of separate coccoliths
from various aspects proves that they have a complicated structure built up on the
same type as that of the coccolith of C. leptopora. Huxitey, Watiicu, Harcket, &c., have all studied in detail from the deep sea
deposits objects which they called coccoliths; these are, in point of fact, the con-
stituent plates of C. pelagica. Huxury, as is well known, compared the form of the
plates, to which he gave the special name of cyatholiths,* to two shallow watch-
glasses, placed one inside the other, with a pad of some substance, such as paraffin,
between. Watticu also compared them to a shirt-stud, but the first satisfactory
explanation of the structure of the plates (of C. pelagica) is that given by
Messrs.
