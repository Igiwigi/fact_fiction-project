Each of these changes is supposed to take place according to the same law as a
monomolecular change in chemistry, 7.¢., the number N of particles unchanged after a
time ¢ is given by N = Nye~, where N, is the initial number and \ the constant of
the change. Since dN/dt = — XN, the rate of change at any time is always proportional to the
amount of matter unchanged. It has previously been pointed out that this law ot
decay of the activity of the radioactive products is an expression of the fact that the
change is of the same type as a monomolecular chemical change. Suppose that P, Q, R represent the number of particles of the matter A, B, and C
respectively at any time ¢#. Let ,, As, As be the constants of change of the matter
A, B, and C respectively.
