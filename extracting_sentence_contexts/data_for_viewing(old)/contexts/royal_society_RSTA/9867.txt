Thus k, i, /, are in this case, as in the preceding case of § 13, numerical constants.
The calculation of )’ and X” for various values of n from the definite integrals already
indicated would afford an interesting theoretical investigation, but as actual molecules
do not conform very closely to our hypothesis, the practical importance of the matter
would hardly justify the labour. Maxwetr calculated their values, however, by
quadrature, in the special case n = 5 (the forces being repulsive), and found that*

(49) P (5) = 2°6595, (5) = 1°3682.

15. Rigid Elastic Spheres which Attract One Another.

It is an undoubted fact that molecules attract one another at small distances (as is
manifest from the force of cohesion, to take but a single example). By considering
the effect of such forces in bringing about collisions between molecules (regarded as
rigid elastic spheres) which would otherwise pass by one another, SurHERLANDt had
great success in explaining the variation of viscosity with temperature. His
treatment of the problem, while very suggestive, and forming an important
contribution to the kinetic theory, laid no claim to rigour.

Tn applying the present methods to the study of the same problem, we shall use the
notation ¢, o”, dy», $12 of §§ 138 and 14; ¢,,(7) will now represent the mutual potential
due to the forces of cohesion. As before, we consider the path of the centre of the
second molecule relative to that of the first. When the apsidal distance exceeds
o+o’, no collision takes place, and the deflection 2y is given by the same equation as
