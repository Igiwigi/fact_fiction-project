to a- satisfactory- conclusion, I proceeded to note down all the

the method which the explanation might point out. I shall
leave it to the. Society to. determine, whether I have been
successful-in my attempt.

The firs fact to. be noticed, in regard to the preparation of
the mummy,-is the chestnut brown tint of all. the bandages,
