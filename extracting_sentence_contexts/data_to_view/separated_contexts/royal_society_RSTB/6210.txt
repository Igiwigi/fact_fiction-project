In Diplosoma the bud masses are able to
develop without physical isolation from the parent, though with the result that
the presence of the original zooid limits the extent of reorganization. In Distaplia
the buds are removed from any parental influence by the complete degeneration
of the original zooid. It is a striking fact that the autolysis of the zooid as a whole
does not involve the epicardial cell masses. Similarly in Pycnoclavella the masses
of trophocytes survive the general autolysis following degeneration. In Perophora
and Ecteinascidia the ventral stolonic vessel is long and branched, and buds are
formed by it while yet physically united to the parent zooid.
