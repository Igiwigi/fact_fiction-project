This ‘overshoot’ pattern of diver-
sity through time has been observed in spiders on the
Hawaiian islands by performing space for time substitutions
[43]. It has also been recorded in simulation models of diver-
sification [44]. In our model, the observed overshoot is caused
by the fact that after the continents split apart, species rich-
ness shoots up because of the relatively fast pace of the
biological system and the increased net diversification rates. After this, continents drifting further apart result in less dis-
persal between them and hence fewer opportunities for
speciation and declining equilibrium species richness. There is significant potential for further work extending
these models.
