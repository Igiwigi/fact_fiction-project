The changes in
circulation required to account for the observed differences in the distribution of

~ temperature and salinity have already been suggested, but it seems desirable to state
Sthem in a more general form before attempting to discuss their causes.
5 The principal point to be considered in the early part of 1897 is the weakness of
‘athe drift circulation compared to 1896. The south-easterly drift from the north-
Swestern area is weaker, and the surface waters generally are therefore warmer and
Asalter. Again, the easterly drift towards Europe is weaker, there is less “ banking
up” of water on the European coast, and the outflow to the north-east and to the
<Trminger current is weaker; the main easterly drift appears, in fact, to be further
ssouth than last year, it consists more exclusively of Gulf Stream water, and its
course is more towards the African coast.
a The differences are of the same general type until August, when the large
delivery southward in the Azores region becomes most strongly marked. The effect
f the decreased strength of the northward streams during spring and early summer
‘appears in the diminution in the supply of Polar water; the melting of ice has
obviously gone on more slowly, and the increase in the fresh-water streams is smaller
Sand occurs later. The difference is least marked in the case of the Labrador current,
‘which depends least on the warm streams for its supply.
= In theautunin the movement becomes more easterly and northerly, and the direction
of the easterly drift is more towards the land in the south-west of Europe, causing
= more “banking-up ” and consequently stronger northerly streams than at the corre-
"gsponding period of 1896.
