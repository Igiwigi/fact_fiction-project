43. Instead of writing down and discussing the equations of the circumscribing
developable and of its cuspidal edge of the quadrics (169), which are in fact of the
same form as (166) and (167), except that f= /,~!f, is not self-conjugate, we shall
devote a few remarks to the family of curves

and their developables, m being a scalar, a a constant quaternion, ¢ a scalar variable,
and f an arbitrary linear quaternion function, This family includes the right line, the
conic, the twisted cubic, the quartic intersection of two quadrics, the quartic which is
not the intersection of two quadrics, and the cuspidal edge of the developable
circumscribed to two quadrics ; the corresponding values of m being m = 1, 2, —1
or 8, 4 and 4.
