only of twigs with some remains of foliage attached. Of these several species have
been described from the Upper Cretaceous of various parts of Europe. What
relation these fossils bear to the cone just deseribed it is difficult to say, for not only
is there the natural uncertainty of connection between a fossil cone known by its
anatomical structure and foliage impressions found in another continent, but there
is added to it the unsatisfactory nature of the foliage impressions themselves, which
seem in most cases to lack the reliable characters of the leaves of the living form.
While all the leaf and stem impressions are of such a fragmentary and rather
uncertain nature, Cunninghamiostrobus offers really reliable evidence in the detailed
structure of its fructification that plants related to Cunninghamia were living in
the Cretaceous period.

The fact that the living genus Cunninghamia was only known to have one species
for so long and now has but two, both growing in restricted areas, is in itself
highly suggestive of either the antiquity or the extreme youth of the genus. The
discovery of the fossil cone in the Cretaceous, so closely resembling that of the living
species in its anatomical structure, rather favours the view of the antiquity of its origin.
