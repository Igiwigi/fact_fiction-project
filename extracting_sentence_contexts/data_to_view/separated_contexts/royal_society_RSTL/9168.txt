One of the referees, however, pointed out that it was desirable to make the attempt,

-and indicated several hypothetical forms of surfaces which might be tried. I have
Stherefore added the following calculations, which are carried to the same degree of
approximation as those for the interior of the gas. = It will be seen that the equations I have arrived at express both the fact that

the gas may slide over the surtace with a finite velocity, the previous investigations
Â© of which have been already mentioned;* and the fact that this velocity and the corres-
Zponding tangential stress are affected by inequalities of temperature at the surface of
Sthe solid, which give rise to a force tending to make the gas slide along the surface
from colder to hotter places. 2 This phenomenon, to which Professor OsBorxE ReyNoLDs has given the name of
SThermal Transpiration, was discovered entirely by him.
