The one, which has recently been ably supported by Morr (loc. cit.), is that the
cells are connected with afferent fibres, fibres of the posterior root. The other (GaskeLt, Hit.) is that
Cranrker’s column is connected with the efferent fibres of anterior roots. Of these views, the former, I
think, derives support from the facts observed with regard to out-lying cells in the posterior root-zone
of the cord; but it is difficult to believe that these out-lying cells, although they appear equivalent to
members of Crarke’s column, can be at all closely connected with any fibres in the anterior root. Indeed,
it appears more likely that not only the vesicular group of CLarke, and the out-lying cells of the external
posterior column, but also the cells described above (p, 43) as occurring in and near the gelatinosa, all
belong to the afferent system entering by the posterior root.—June 12, 1890.]
