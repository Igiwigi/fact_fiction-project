These numbers are in analogy with the values
for Ca and Sr, viz., 133 and 83, are in the usual ratio 5:3, and stand to the
observed values for BaD (3) given in Table IL in a similar relation to those in Sr. Now F;() must be VD,, (2), and if the genera] rule found above that the mantissa
of VD,; (2) is a multiple of A, holds, it is possible to obtain a very accurate value. As
a fact, with F, (0) = 25906 the mantissa of F,() is very nearly the multiple of
87A,. If it is made so exactly, taking A, = 11960, then F,() becomes about 25922. This value, with the D satellite differences of 153, 93, give

F, () = 25922
26017

F, (0) = 26182°17
157-95

F, (©) = 26340°12

and it is seen how close the separations come to those observed.
