The pale chesnut-coloured MSS., covered partially
with white ashes, were generally of a texture s0 loose, and
had their layers 80 destroyed, that there was considerable

each line was made up of letters from several different folds
of the MS. When the process of unrolling these papyri
was performed in the common way, the result obtained ap=-

was in fact made up of the letters of different words. I en-
deavoured to obtain the fragments of a single leaf attached
to a layer of membrane by applying a solution of caoutchouc
in ether to the surface of a MS., so as to supply the parts of
the leaf destroyed; but operating in this way, I obtained
only a few characters, and never an entire word; so that
after various unsuccessful trials, I was obliged to give up
the MSS. of this description as hopeless ; more than £ of
their contents probably being always destroyed, and that in
80 irregular a way as to leave no entire sentences, or even
words.
