High pressure experiments lead to denser materials (even after unloading), to an extent that
was found to scale with Poisson’s ratio of the glass [38] because of the intimate relationship
existing between v and the atomic packing density [18,43]. Hence, there is less room for further
indentation densification after a high pressure treatment. Both experiments [7] and molecular
dynamic simulation [44] pointed to a shift to more pile-up of matter at the vicinity of the imprint
and thus shear flow after high pressure treatments and, as a matter of fact, v is mostly larger
in the treated glass than in the pristine sample [7]. For instance, in the case of a-SiO,, V+/V—
increases from approximately 0.17 to 0.77 after a treatment at 25GPa for 1h and subsequent
Vickers indentation under 250mN (figure 12) and v increases from 0.15 to approximately 0.252,
