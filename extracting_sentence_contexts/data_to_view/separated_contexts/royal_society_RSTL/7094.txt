and exhibited therefore no material augmentation in the proportion of oxygen. It may be inferred, from the familiar fact that air dissolved in water contains s0 high
a proportion as 30 per cent. of oxygen, that if carbonic acid gas were divided from
atmospheric air by a film of water, the former gas would come to be charged through
the film with air bearing the same high proportion of 30 per cent. of oxygen.
