Sions, either secondary or primary, in man, one is greatly struck by the irregularities
@f the anterior pyramidal tract; in some cases it is present, in others absent; in
“tome cases the degenerate tract is small, in others large, and passing insensibly into
she antero-lateral column.

‘heir descriptions of the simple and combined “system” scleroses of the cord, signal
umerous irregularities, indeed, the first-named observer appears to divide the sclerose
Auto systematic, asystematic, and mixed. In these cases the pyramids above the
decussation may be normal, whilst below, a lateral crossed tract or a lateral and
anterior pyramidal tract, or both crossed tracts, or both lateral and one anterior
tract may be degenerate.

When the above facts are taken into consideration, it will be understood that the
direct pyramidal tract in man still wants considerable explanation. It might be
thought that the degenerate fibres in the anterior columns, close up to the pyramids
(fig. 3, Plate 3), and derived from the posterior longitudinal bundle and raphé, might
furnish some explanation, but this cannot be the solution, as we have seen that the
fibres in question do not come from the cerebral hemispheres. MUuRATOFF has made
the suggestion at a recent meeting of the Moscow Neurological Society, that the
