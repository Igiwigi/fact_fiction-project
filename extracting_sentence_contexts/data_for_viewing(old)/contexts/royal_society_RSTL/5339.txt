S of the tail, which, while the spermatozoa are still within the seminal ducts is very in-
& distinet, and perhaps can scarcely be said to occurâ€”is immediately set up, and the
<= motion of the body of the spermatozoon is changed from the undulatory action before
S observed, to the jerking or watch-spring movement pointed out by observers, and
z thought to be the motion peculiar to the spermatozoon of this class of animals.
S Thus then, the fact of only a slight wavy motion of the spermatozoon being per-
= ceived in some cases, ceases to be of importance, as an argument against the view
5 that motion is closely connected with the function, since it is evident that the true
- Spermatic force is not set up until the spermatozoa have become more or less separated
from each other, through their residence in some fluid vehicle. The movements of
the spermatozoon in insects are very similar to those of the spermatozoon of the
Triton, and the cirenmstances which affect both are in full accordance with the
fact of the existence of, and the necessity for, a distinct liquor seminis, as part of
the normal composition of the seminal fluid, in the Mammalia ; while this portion of
the fluid is not needed, and consequently is almost entirely absent in the Amphibia,
Fishes and most Invertebrata. A comparison of the facts in the two divisions of
animals seems to point to the true nature and use of the liquor seminis, as being that

of a mere vehicle for the ready transmission of the spermatozoon to the ova, and as
allowing greater freedom of motion to these bodies.

It is true, as WacxeR and LEUCKaRDT have 8tated, that but little motion can be
