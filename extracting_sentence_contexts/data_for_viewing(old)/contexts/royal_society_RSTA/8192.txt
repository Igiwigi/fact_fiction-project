Two papers, published in 1921, contain accounts of detailed investigations of the
damping of vibrations of thin rods, the results being examined in the light of the visco-
elastic hypothesis. In the first, Honpa and Konno* found that for the various metals
which they examined (1) the “ coefficient of normal viscosity ’’} is of the same order of
magnitude (10°) as the “coefficient of tangential viscosity,” (2) the coefficients of
viscosity of a metal having a low melting point are large.

The second paper, by loxrBE and SaKkat§ gives the results of an experimental investiga-
tion of the variation with temperature of the elastic and viscous coefficients, and contains
a full account of previous work on this subject. The experiments were made on the
damping of the vibrations of torsional pendulums. The slight discrepancies between
the observed damping and that predicted by the viseo-elastic hypothesis were supposed
to be due to dissipation of energy at the point of fixation, and to the fact that the
amplitude of the twist was excessively great. The “real” logarithmic decrement was
obtained by a method of interpolation. The tangential viscosity of a solid was found
to increase with increase of temperature, in general; but in the case of iron (which
has a high melting point) it was found to decrease to a minimum before starting
to increase.

Hrrrwer|| has calculated the coefficient of tangential viscosity from observations
on slow forced torsional vibrations of wires, and obtained values of the order of 1015 for
various metals, in contrast to the values of the order of 108 obtained by investigators
from experiments on the damping of vibrations of torsional pendulums.
