needing an in-depth understanding of the underlying statistical methods.

This problem additionally presents a significant computational challenge, as it requires
generating samples and collating the results of a potentially large number of high-performance
computer simulations. Researchers may need to carry out simulations on a number of different
computational resources at different resolutions, which poses a problem for reproducibility.
To manage this problem, we use FabSim3 [10] to generate templates for the various pieces
of this work, from drawing samples and carrying out the simulations to analysing the
results.

In this paper, we implement a comprehensive UQ calibration workflow and manage an
ensemble of simulations of a dynamic earthquake rupture. Dynamic earthquake rupture is a
challenging, multi-scale simulation problem, and due to the fact that earthquakes typically occur
at around 10 km depth, seismologists can usually only rely on seismic waves at the surface to
constrain the rupture process. Because of this, we do not completely understand the relevant
physics for modelling frictional failure [11]. However, while simulations have increasingly been
used to understand ground motions and seismic hazard [12,13], a full calibration approach like
the one described in this paper has not to our knowledge been previously conducted.


In the following sections, we describe the UQ approach, provide details on the earthquake
simulation model, and finally discuss our approach for automating the workflow. We then show
the results of the experimental design, surrogate modelling and calibration of an earthquake
model. The work presented here was originally conceived as a tutorial for participants at the
