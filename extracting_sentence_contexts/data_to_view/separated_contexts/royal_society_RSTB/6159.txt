The flowers were,
however, small like those of O. biennis. It is proposed to call this species O.
paralamarckiana, not only on account of its resemblance to O. Lamarckiana, but also
because it produces numerous trisomic mutations, in fact, in a much higher propor-
tion than they have ever appeared in O. Lamarckiana itself. A full technical
description of this new species will be published elsewhere.
