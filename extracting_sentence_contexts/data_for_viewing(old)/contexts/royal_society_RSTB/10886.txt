surrounding gender roles within the family, and in gendered
patterns of employment that persist to this day [17]. Present-
day women living in historically male-biased areas work
fewer hours in the labour market and enjoy more free time.
Both women and men living in these areas also hold more
traditional attitudes regarding men’s and women’s work out-
side the home that men and women who live in historically
even sex ratio areas [17].

In the present paper we further test the long-term impact
of historic population sex ratios on contemporary descen-
dants, in particular on relationship satisfaction and overall
life satisfaction. Our research is motivated by the fact that
mating market conditions [18-22] and cultural norms
[23,24] have been shown to associate with both marital satis-
faction and overall feelings of well-being in modern societies.
The reasons for these associations remain open to a number
of non-exclusive possible explanations. First, the well-being
and happiness of both sexes rises with marriage and drops
with divorce [18-21], and poor prospects of marriage are
associated with adverse mental health and happiness [21,25].
The more traditional gender norms that persist in historically
male-biased parts of Australia might, we predict, promote
marriage and therefore relationship and life satisfaction for
both women and men.
