The close resemblance to the results for the epoch 1890 to 1900 in 8.M. will
be readily recognised on consulting fig. 1. I-5,

= Itis unlikely that my personal standard for disturbance when assigning “‘character”
Seures to the days of 1890 to 1900 agreed with that of the international list, which
fepresents a compromise of most diverse standards from some forty observatories.
hus the fact that the mean “character” figure for the selected disturbed days of
3906 to 1911 was only 87 per cent. of that for the selected disturbed days of 1890 to
~~ does not necessarily imply that the second epoch was the quieter of the two.
z uch, however, was actually the case on the whole, though no year of the later period
Avas as quiet as 1900. The two curves of fig. 1 agree in showing no decided trace of any period shorter
than 27 days. Other points of resemblance are that the fall subsequent to the
maximum during days n+28 to n+30 is decidedly slower than the rise during days
n+25 to n+27, and that the pulse centering about day n+27 is spread over more
days than the primary pulse centering at day x.
