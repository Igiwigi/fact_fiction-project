in fig. 25, p. 357, shows that the wave has still a long way to fall when the next wave
arrives. Reasoning on the basis of the lines sketched in fig. 41, p. 372, it seems quite
conservative to assume that the true thickness of the water-layer is about 10 cm. instead
of 3 cm., and the volume of such a layer is 100,000 cub. m. per sq. km.

The two canals discharge together 1,500,000 cub. m. per day, commanding about
250 sq. km. of cultivated land at its usual water-duty of 25 cub. m. per acre per day,
which is 6,000 cub. m. per sq. km. per day. The canals are running about 330 days
yearly, making a total supply of 2,000,000 cub. m. per sq. km. Out of this amount we
have found 100,000 cub. m., or 5 per cent., of the total in the underground water of our
farm. Since the conventional allowance of irrigation design is 10 per cent., as already
stated, it is clear that our estimate of the amount is not excessive. More important from
a general irrigation point of view is the fact that although these canal waves are most
striking phenomena on our farm, and contribute notably to its water-table phenomena,
yet their importance—as here assessed—is actually less on the Giza farm than in Egypt
as a whole. Our inferences from our farm cannot therefore be regarded as exaggerations
based on the accident of possessing abnormally leaky canals ; on the contrary, our canals
seem rather better than usual.

The east-west gradient reversal already mentioned is brought out more clearly
in fig. 37, p. 370, by joining wave-crests and wave-troughs as in fig. 36. The canals are
seen to act as a source of water to Pit III when full, and even when empty until June.
After June the minimum “ canal-wave effect ” curve shows that drainage is proceeding
from east to west (Pit ITI to Pit XVI), flowing away from the river, presumably to the
drainage line half-way to the Pyramids, formerly mentioned. This is somewhat un-
