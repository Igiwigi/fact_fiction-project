with which the angles have been measured.

In nearly all the hitherto published works on mineralogy the faces of crystals have, for
the convenience of writing and printing, been distinguished by letters. But it appears
to the writer that the use of WrewgLL's symbols for this purpose instead of letters, is 80
much to be preferred, on account of its presenting at once to the eye the geometrical
relations of the several faces, as to more than counterbalance the inconvenience of having
three or more figures to write instead of one letter; and particularly as these letters are
frequently accompanied by one or more conventional marks of distinction which are
troublesome both to write and to remember.

Construction of Tables â€”We have now to explain the construction of the accompany-
ing Tables, to consider the facts they present, and their results.

These Tables do not contain all the observed angles of the crystals belonging to the
different minerals, but only such as have been, or might have been used in each case as
elementary angles, these being sufficient for the purposes of this paper.

No table is given of the cudic 8ystem, as that system consists of only a single strictly
isomorphous group.
