E Many misconceptions have prevailed concerning the nature of the integument in the
Fematoids, as I have already pointed out in the paper © On the Structure and Nature
& the Dracunculus”F. It has been described by Von SizpoLDf, DuJaRDINg, OWEN ||,
#4 most other anatomists, as divisible into two main portions—a structureless epi-
Frmis composed of chitine, and a corium made up of layers of longitudinal and oblique
decussating fibres. And, although in this communication I pointed out the fact that
these s0-called fibrous layers, or membranes, were not such in reality, but that, in
common with the external more homogeneous layer, they were essentially epidermic'in
nature, consisting of chitinous lamelle presenting various kinds of markings, and, in all
probability, were excreted from some deep cellular layer, still, T had not at that time
been able actually to recognize the existence of such a layer in the Nematoids. Since
then I have fully satisfied myself of the existence of a distinct, deep, cellulo-granular
