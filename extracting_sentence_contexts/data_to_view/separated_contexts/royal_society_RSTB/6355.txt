After fixation in Duboscq-Brasil and Susa’s fluids, however, the chitin
appears relatively homogeneous, and the zonation described above is not so clear. It may be argued, in view of the above, that the zonation is due to bands of pre-
cipitate (Liesegang effect), being formed by the action of a particular fixative. That
this is not so, is shown by the fact that the zonation always runs parallel to the free
surface of the epithelium, and never parallel to the vertical fissures, or in any other
plane. ;

The intracellular canaliculi are particularly clearly demonstrated by fixatives such
as Duboscq-Brasil and Susa, which tend to dissolve the cell contents and cause shrink-
age. Though the canaliculi may be seen after fixation in Flemming without acetic,
their course is more difficult to follow than when fixed in the former fluids. Discusston—Vrrzou (1882) has expressed the view that the chitin of the integument
of decapod Crustacea arises by gradual transformation of the outer layers of the cells of
the chitogenous epithelium.
