113. The coincidence found by M. Povitter (Art. 22.) between the logarithms of
the intensities and the thicknesses, may be ascribed to his having used a formula

Q which gives the greater thicknesses sensibly too small, and thus makes an accidental
© Ccompensation. Perhaps another accidental compensation may be found in the con-
tinuity of the Curye XV. I have mentioned (Art. 82.) that I expected to find a
SZ different law for extinction in the higher and lower regions of the atmosphere. It
5 may be that the greater purity of the air in the higher regions, and its great dryness,
'D counterbalance the greater absorptive power which we have attributed (Art. 85.) to
S the first portions of an absorbing medium traversed by light or heat.
'S 114. We further conclude, —
r= 4. That the tendency to absorption through increasing thicknesses of air is a di-
minishing one. That in fact the absorption almost certainly reaches a limit, beyond
-2 which no further loss will take place þy an increased thickness of similar atmospheric
Z ingredients. That the residual heat (tested by the absorption into a blue liquor) may
5 amount to from a half to a third of that which reaches the surface of the globe after
= a vertical transmission through a clear atmosphere.
2 5, That the law of absorption in a clear and dry atmosphere, equivalent to between
= one and four times the mass of air traversed vertically, may be represented (within
Z those limits) by an intensity diminisbing in a geometrical progression, plus a constant
= quantity, which is the limiting value already mentioned. Hence the amount of
Ss vertical transmission has always hitherto been greatly overrated, or the value of extra
£ atmospheric solar radiation greatly underrated.
S 6. The value of extra atmospheric solar radiation upon the hypothesis of the above
law being generally true, is 73? of the actinometer marked B. 2. The limiting value
