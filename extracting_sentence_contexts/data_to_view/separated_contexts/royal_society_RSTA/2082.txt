The variational principle gives us (in our first-order approximation) the
differential equation

, (2.16)

L=[Vii+ = (Via-vi)|
where L; is the initial piston position at t = 0 and Lz the end position at f = t. Interestingly, also for the adiabatic work, the variational principle yields the same result for
L(t). This is a direct consequence of that fact that in the adiabatic processes dW(t) = dU(t) and
v,(t) = /2U()/fNm. The variation of the ensuing work 5Wgas involves terms
5Weas(t)
fNmiv-(t)’

Since we require 5Wgas(t) =0 for all f it then also implies that 5vz(t) =0. As a consequence, the
adiabatic variational principle yields the same solution as the isothermal case, as already stated
above.
