For both greyscale and coloured images, we can set up the regularizers (3.2) and (3.3) using the
TotalVariation function in CIL. The optimization problem that we solve for the colour denoising
is similar to (3.1) but using the VTV regularizer, i.e.

1
u* =argmin 5llb- uli} +aVTV(u), (3.4)
wu


where b is shown in figure 1b. One can observe that (3.4) is in fact the proximal operator (2.2) with
t =1.0 evaluated at b. We solve (3.4), using the fast gradient projection (FGP) algorithm that is
contained in the proximal method of the TotalVariation function.

Proximal TV Denoising

VIV = 0.15*TotalVariation (max_iteration=500)
proximalVTV = VIV.proximal (noisy_data, tau=1.0)

It is clear from figure 1 that noise is reduced, while preserving the edges of the image. However,
TV is known for promoting piecewise constant reconstructions leading to images with blocky
structures. This is called the staircasing effect and becomes apparent in smooth regions, see for
instance the area around the rainbow in figure 1c.
