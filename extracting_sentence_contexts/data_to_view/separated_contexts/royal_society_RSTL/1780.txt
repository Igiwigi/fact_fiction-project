62. The attraction of the pellicle to a metallic rod plunged
into the mercury, is also a direct consequence of the alloy of
potassium present in the mercury, as is also the disengage-
ment of gas from the wire. - It is, in fact, precisely the expe-
riment described in Art. 25, and has nothing whatever to: do
either with the floating fragments, or' with any hydrogen
they may be discharging at the time, farther than that their
contact serves to furnish potassium to the mercury,

63: It is needless, therefore, to push this examination farther,
as all the phznomena observed by Mr. S. are only particular
cases of those I have described. With regard to the radiant
hydrogen producing currents by its impulse, I would ask how
it happens that currents are produced (when the positive pole
is placed in contact), while a thick and tough coat of oxide
covers the whole surface; and, one would think, must
effectually defend it from the action of the hydrogen. Yet
we have seen, in Art.
