It is, moreover, necessary to encounter the difficulty referred to above of
Smaintaining the light source constant during a series of measurements. © Inarecent paper,t we have discussed the application of a method, involving the
“Zuse of a neutral-tinted wedge, to the determination of the distribution of intensity in
“Bbroadened spectrum lines. In this case, the problem is reduced to its simplest form
Bowing to the fact that over the short range of wave-length covered in a single
‘Sbroadened line, we may consider that both the extinction-coefficient of the wedge
"Zand the sensibility of the photographic plate remain constant. Sucha method cannot
Bbe applied directly to the present problem without important modifications and
additions, for in the measurement of the relative intensities of lines of widely
different wave-length neither of these essential conditions is even approximately
§ fulfilled, and, in addition, the loss of light in the spectroscope must be considered.
& The problem dealt with in the present communication is therefore of an essentially
g different nature, but it has been found possible to evade these difficulties without
8 altering the character of the method employed. E
