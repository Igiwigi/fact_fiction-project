all available information [2]. This property was duly proved by Samuelson [3]. It is known that

Cajueiro & Tabak [4] studied the Chinese stock market and found that liquidity plays a role
in explaining the evolution of the long-term memory; Bariviera [5] argued that informational
efficiency in the Thai stock market is influenced by liquidity constraints, whereas Bariviera
et al. [6] detailed the influence of the 2008 financial crisis on the memory endowment of the
European fixed income market. However, changes in informational efficiency are essentially
unpredictable, under the EMH framework.

[7] published a disruptive article in the Wall Street Journal: they suggested that the Libor rate
did not reflect what was expected, i.e. the cost of funding of prime banks. The British Bankers
