Notwithstanding the constancy of boiling-point of this liquid, numerous analyses
showed it to be a mixture, and the numbers obtained were consistent with the assump-
tion that it was composed of two bodies having respectively the formulz

C, Hj,O, and C,H,,O.,.

Tn fact it was evident that the liquid with which we had now to do was the exact
counterpart of the one obtained in the corresponding reaction with ethyl iodide
described above, and that it consisted of the homologues produced in the ethylic reac-
tion, viz. ethylic methacetone carbonate and ethylic dimethacetone carbonate. To sepa-
rate these compounds, whose boiling-points were evidently nearly if not absolutely
identical, we availed ourselyes of their different behaviour with boiling aqueous potash ;
ethylic dimethacetone carbonate, like ethylic diethacetone carbonate, being scarcely
affected by this treatment, whilst ethylic methacetone carbonate, like its ethylic homo-
logue, is rapidly decomposed.
