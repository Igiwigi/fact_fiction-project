0-10, —0-20, 0:16, 0:20 (n= 70)
for the four quarters of the year, over South Ireland, and
—0-09, 0-08, 0:33, —0-10 (n= 72)

for the four quarters of the year, over North-West England, whereas the correspond-
ing coefficients for sea-water temperature at Port Erin Bay and Morecambe Bay

are respectively
0:73 (n = 156), 0-59 (n = 95)

for the whole year (§ 11).

The fact just mentioned suggests the examination of the correlation of increments
of sea-water temperature with duration of sunshine, but the concept of monthly
mean values does not easily lend itself to this. However, when the increment in
monthly mean value, of sea-water temperatures at Port Erin Bay, from one month
to the next but one, is correlated with the sunshine duration at Douglas in the inter-
mediate month, the coefficients are

—0-23, 0-19, 0-20,—0-19 (n= 87)

for the four quarters of the year. Owing to the smallness of these coefficients, they
are of no greater utility than those of Table XII.
