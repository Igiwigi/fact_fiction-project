aqueous cells with a thick cuticle ; sunk stomata, 150-300 per square millimetre, are
present, and beneath the epidermis a distinct attempt at palisade elongation is
observable. Among these cells massive, thick-walled sclerites ramify, and extend as
an irregular layer underneath the epidermis. Beneath these a network of mucilage-
cysts intervenes between the bundle terminations with their beautifully frondose
fringes of tranfusion-tracheides. (A tangential section of this region, treated with
phloroglucin HCl, affords the most effective demonstration possible of what is meant
by such “transfusion tracheides.”) On the inner (upper) surface of the member, the
cuticle is less thick, but the cellulose walls of the epidermis more massive, and the
zone of fibres consists of finely woven slender elements. About } mm, from the edge
sclerosis ceases, and these special features are lost as the leaf thins to the margin.

The special interest of the histology lies in the fact that between the two regions
all transitional stages are present ; and it is possible to trace the sliding growth, wavy
course and thickening deposits of the sclerites within the limits of a single longitudinal
section.

In the axils of these members arise singly, in the accurate median line, what are
regarded as the ovuliferous or carpellary flowers, as definite stalked axillary formations :
the whole cone being a bi-axial structure. Few will object to this obvious inter-
pretation. Suggestions for a monaxial view have been put forward (Sykes, 1910) ;
but a median section of the cone-apex shows that if this is not to be termed axillary
ramification, there is no significance in the term as applied to the ordinary appearances
seen in bud-sections of floral development in higher plants. All stages in development
are to be traced at the apex of a “flowering” cone; and it is interesting to note
