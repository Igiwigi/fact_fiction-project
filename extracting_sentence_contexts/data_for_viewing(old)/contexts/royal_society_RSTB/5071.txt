extremity of the dorsal aorta as the arteria mawillaris, the dorsal vestige of the
1st aortic arch as the arteria palatina (arteria palatino-nasalis, Versuuys, 1898),
while the dorsal root of the 2nd aortic arch gives off the arteria stapedialis
(a. facialis, auctorum).*

TANDLER (1902) has demonstrated a similar blood supply in a Bat embryo.

GRossER (1901) states that in a Bat embryo the arteria infra-orbitalis, instead
of being a branch of the arteria stapedialis, and therefore belonging to the 2nd
aortic arch—as in the Human embryo—arises as a separate branch of the arteria
carotis interna (dorsal aorta). He found also that it “accompanied medially the
vidian nerve.” It is obviously equivalent to the arteria palatina of Sphenodon,
both as regards its origin and distribution, . These facts suggest that the

portion of the 2nd aortic arch,

condition obtaining in Sphenodon embryos is primitive, while that found in Man
is a secondary development. It will be seen below (vide arteria stapedialis) that
in considering the fate of the 2nd aortic arch this inference receives additional
support.
