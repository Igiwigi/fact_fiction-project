For the noise-free signal, the EMD method could also capture the
intra-wave frequency modulation, as shown in figure 6c. The instantaneous frequency obtained
from the shape function is not the same as that obtained by the EMD method. The difference
between the instantaneous frequencies obtained by the two methods is due to the fact that the
inter-wave modulation is not included in the shape function; see appendix A for a detailed
explanation. When the signal is polluted by noise, the EMD/EEMD methods seem to have difficulty
in capturing the intra-wave frequency modulation. In figure 7, the IMFs obtained by the
EMD/EEMD for the noise-free signal and the noisy signal are shown.
