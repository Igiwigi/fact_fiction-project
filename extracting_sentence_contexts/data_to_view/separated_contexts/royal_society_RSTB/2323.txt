If the chamber into which they pass is a perfectly absorbent one, and is
sufficiently large, we shall have formed on the inner side of the diaphragm a system
of “shells” of equal density exactly similar to those of the outside; but with the
gradient of density in the opposite direction, the density decreasing from the dia-
phragm inwards (fig. 2). This system of internal “ shells,” which we may designate as
negative, will of course be shielded from the direct action of currents in the outer
air, if the aperture is not large, and they will manifestly be as effective in regulating
the inflow according to the linear dimensions of the aperture as the outer or positive
shells, whilst they are quite independent of the latter, which may be completely
swept away, without interfering with the “diameter law.” *

This view is prefectly in accord with the facts, and it also explains why in Experi-
ments 2 and 3, Table TIL, p. 244, the amount of diffusion was found to be inter-
mediate between the diameter and area ratios of the apertures, the rim or margin of
the aperture in these cases not being sufficiently wide to allow a complete system of
internal shells to be formed. * It must be understood that we are only speaking here of the relative rates of diffusion through
apertures of different sizes and under similar conditions.
