These
granular cells are attached to the blood vessels, and to the trabeculze. He found giant
cells in the medulla, and stated that the concentric corpuscles are concerned in the
formation of vessels and trabecule ; and that in fresh preparations colourless cells are
seen, which contain granules aud spherules of haemoglobin. Kris (70), 1879, confirmed the fact of the existence of a cortical and medullary
portion in the follicle. He said that in the medulla there are large endothelial cells,
each of which fills up a mesh of reticulum ; and there are transition forms between
these and the granular cells, and between these last and giant cells. KL (71), 1881, found that the thymus does not much vary in the young and in
the adult Guinea Pig.
