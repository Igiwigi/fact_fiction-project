This circumstance appears to me as perhaps calculated to throw some light upon
a question of great interest to geologists, viz. the origin of the coal-beds. Whether
therefore have the coal-beds been formed by the snbmersion of whole forrests and
the floating of uprooted timber into estuaries and lakes, or whether are they due to
the submersion of beds of peat ? Now irrespective of all other considerations which
might be urged in favour of the latter opinion, I would remark that the amount of
nitrogen in coal, and consequently the quantity of ammonia and other bases which it
yields when destructively distilled, are very considerable, constituting in fact an ex-
tensive branch of chemical manufacture. Wood, however, as we have just seen,
appears to be quite incapable of furnishing the amount of nitrogen which we find
existing in coal. Peat, on the other hand, from the quantity of ammonia and other
bases which it yields when destructively distilled, is capable of furnishing more than
the required amount of ammonia.
