The Stieltjes integrals occurring in the present chapter reduce to infinite series when the
spectrum is discrete (so that p(x), ... reduce to step-functions). The resulting expressions for
S(t), g(t) will be derived independently in chapter III, without using the general results
of the present chapter.
