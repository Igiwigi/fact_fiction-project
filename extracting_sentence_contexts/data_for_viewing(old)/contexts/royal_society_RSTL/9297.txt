Let « (fig. 9) be the negative pole, b the idle pole, whose shadow falls at e; and let
b be at first 8upposed to be insulated. Molecular rays impelled from & in a lightly
divergent direction,f on passing the poxitively electrified idle pole b, are rendered
much less divergent, and bending inwards take the directions of the lines @ d d',

+ I am aware that the theory which makes these effects of deflection depend on electrostatic attractions
and repulsions is open to 8ome grave objections; still ib was that which in a great measure guided mo in
my experiments, and it could not well be omitted without reducing the description of them to a dry record

of apparently unconnected facts.
t The divergence in the figure is purposely exaggerated in order to better illustrate the argument.

suppose the idle pole b to be joined to earth : its positive charge is now very small,
and its attraction on the negatively electrified molecular streams correspondingly less;
they are, therefore, scarcely at all converged from the direction originally impressed
on them by the pole a, and they follow the directions a ff”, @ g 9”, &c., the shadow-
forming rays af and @ g now proceeding to #” and g”, forming a wider shadow. The
effect of the umbra and penumbra is caused by the idle pole not being permanently at
