The bands of the less abundant isotope, although showing fairly well-marked
heads under low dispersion, are somewhat difficult to trace on the grating plates. It was

only possible to identify the Q branches of the v’ = 1 progression with any degree of
completeness ; and even these could seldom be followed close up to the origin. It was
verified that the isotope displacements followed the usual laws* ; in fact, their calculated
values were employed as a rule to assist in the identification. Beyond this it did not
appear possible to derive any useful results from these data ; in particular, it was not
possible to determine the mass ratio} Cl” : Cl°* any more accurately than it is known
already. In view of the accuracy with which the constants had been evaluated it seemed to
be opportune to test various relationships between them which have been proposed from
time to time.
