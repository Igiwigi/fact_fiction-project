These equations would give the secular changes of J and I, when the solar influence
is very 8mall compared with that of the moon. Of course if G be replaced by 8,
they are applicable to the case of small viscosity.

It is remarkable that the changes of I are independent of the viscosity ; they depend
in fact solely on the secular change in the permanent ellipticity of the earth.

INTEGRATION OF THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS FOR CHANGES IN THE
INCLINATION OF THE ORBIT AND THE OBLIQUITY OF THE ECLIPTICO.

$18. Integration in the eas of small viscosity, where the nodes revolve uniformly.

It is not, even ab the present time, rigorously true that the nodes of the lunar orbib
revolve uniformly on the ecliptic and that the inclination of the orbit is constant ; bub
it is very nearly true, and the integration may be carried backwards in time for a lo!
way without, an important departure from accuracy.
