associated with K-shells (cf. figure 11a, 6). A natural generalization to propose is that the
Born approximation yields essentially the same form of ionization function for all such
systems and that, on proceeding from light to heavy systems, the true form tends towards
this.

In order to provide further evidence on the hypothesis, the observed ionization functions
of sodium (Tate & Smith 1934) and of argon (Smith 1930; Bleakney 1930) are plotted in
figure 10a,c respectively, arbitrary units being used. The agreement between the former

+ We are indebted to Dr L. H. Aller for this information and for sending us the results of the calculations
on O* and N* (see table 10a, footnote) before publication.

t The fact that the most serious failure occurs with neon (which occupies a central position in the group
studied) is of course in no way contradictory since s- and p-shell systems are not strictly comparable; and
furthermore the difference in the representation of the ejected electron (see above) may introduce com-
plications.
