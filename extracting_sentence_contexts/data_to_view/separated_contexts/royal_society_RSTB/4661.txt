RIDEWOOD ON THE CALCIFICATION OF THE

to such an excessive degree that the base of the wedge comes to lie external to some
of the tesserze. As regards the growth of the intermedialia in the radial direction, it is important
to bear in mind that the growth is centrifugal, the latest increments being those that
are most external and superficial. A casual glance at the sections might perhaps
suggest that the intermedialia push their way inward, and in this way produce the
curvature of the membrana elastica externa in the horizontal and vertical planes ; and
it-is not quite clear that ScHavurNsLAND did not intend to convey such a meaning
when he wrote* that they “ dringen erst nachtriiglich in sie [the membrana] hinein.”
As an actual fact, the distance between the inner portions of the two lateral inter-
medialia is slightly greater in the adult than in the late embryo examined. Fic. 8.—A, Mustelus vulgaris, adult, post-cloacal vertebra, x5. B, Sphyrna blochii, young, 510 mm, long,
pre-cloacal vertebra, x 7. (For explanation of the lettering, see p. 404.)

Another rather dubious remark of ScHAUINSLAND’s is that the diagonal calcified
lamelle “ entstehen von der Mittelzone aus” (30, p. 405).
