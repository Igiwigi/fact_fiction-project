likely to be much in error.

The value of 22 at the hole may most conveniently be found by evaluating 77+ 00 +-22
and then by using (6-3-1) and the fact that 77 is zero at the hole. This gives
- = {—0-1689 — 0-1211 cos 7€ + 0-0293 cos 21€ — 00105 cos 3m

Some check on the accuracy of the work is provided by the fact that at the surfaces of the
plate ¢ = +1 the stress 22 should vanish. The formula (6-3-2) for 22 gives only a very small
residual stress 0-0005 T cos 20 when ¢ = +1.

6-4. From (6-3-1) it is seen that the average value 00 of 60 at a hole whose diameter is
equal to the thickness of the plate changes from a compression 1-028T at 0 = 0° to a tension
3028 T at 6 = 90°. The corresponding average values according to the theory of generalized
plane stress are 1 and 3 respectively so that the approximate theory gives a good estimate
of the average values of the circumferential stress at the hole in this case. The average value
22 of 22 at the hole changes from a compression 0-169 T at @ = 0° to a tension 0-169 T at 0 = 90°
so that the neglection of ZZ compared with 0 at the same points would hardly seem to be
justified, especially at @ = 0°.
