(3) Inner cuticle of the integument, which is continuous with the cuticle of the
nucellus below. (4) Cuticle of the nucellus (only present round the free part of the nucellus)..

(5) The megaspore membrane, a sac of cuticle extending from within the nucellus
to near the base of the seed. It is a fact readily demonstrated in the seeds of recent gymnosperms that not only
is the outside of the integument cutinized but also the micropylar canal, the inside of
the integument and the outside of the free part of the nucellus. The nucellus cuticle,
however, only extends down to the level where the nucellus unites to the integument,
for there its cutinized epidermis bends outwards and becomes the inner lining of the
integument.
