In the hori-
zontal laminz, already described, fig. 157, we find a very curious form of lacuna. They are very much elongated, being about 45th of an inch in length, and some-
times almost linear, giving off numerous rectangular canaliculi, Not unfrequently
these spring from the lacuna diagonally; those on different sides verging to the
opposite extremities of the lacuna, as is seen in fig. 196, which sketch represents
the appearance of these lacuna as seen under a magnifier of 300 diameters linear. Those of each layer exhibit a considerable tendency to parallelism of arrangement,
but owing to the extreme thinness of the laminz, the lacunz belonging to two
or three layers may be seen at once, even under a magnifying power of 300, as
shown in fig. 19: and it is a curious fact, that those constituting one layer exhibit a
very considerable tendency to run in the direction of the canaliculi of an adjoining
layer. In fig. 19, a, b and c represent individual lacunz belonging to three of these
parallel series. In addition to the above, each lacuna gives off small vertical cana-
liculi, which penetrate the lamellz, and thus connect the different layers together,
