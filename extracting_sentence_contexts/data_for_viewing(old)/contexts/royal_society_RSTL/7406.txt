of retaining their power of germination, is greatly influenced by the method of t
preservationâ€”by variations in their bygrometrical condition, and degree of expogure

It was first observed by SPALLANZANI that one of the essential conditions for the reviva
of the Rotifers and Anguillules found in tufts of moss was, that their period of desiccation
should either be passed in these tufts, or else that during the same time their bodimy
should be more or less covered with sand*. His explanation of this fact was that t
access of air exercised a prejudicial influence upon the delicate structures of these anim:
The fact is quite in accordance with my own observations, and as regards its explanatio
I am able to offer nothing more satisfactory than that advanced by SPALLANZANL.
alternately dried and moistened the same animalcules twelve times with 8imilar resul
except that the number of the revivers was successively smaller each time, but aft
the sixteenth moistening he failed to restore any of them to lifef. '

Since SPALLANZANI'S time the most interesting experiments concerning the power
reviviscence in the Anguillulide have been made by M. Davainef and by MM. Dovs
and GavarRETh. IT $hall briefly notice some of the principal results arrived at by thi
experimenters before detailing my own obseryations on this subject,

DAvYAINE ascertained that the time of saturation in water necessary for the recovery
the young of Tylenchus tritici, was not directly proportional either to the length of thei
