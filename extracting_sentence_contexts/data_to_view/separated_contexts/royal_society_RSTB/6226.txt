(3) The replacement of alternate teeth at different stages seems to have been
present in the most primitive of the mammal-like reptiles (the Pelycosaurs)
as is shown by three pieces of jaws of Dimetrodon. That this “ distichical ” condition is typical of the non-mammal-like reptiles has

replaced by the latter, the teeth of the two rows being functional at the same time,
each being replaced by further members of its own “ family *’.
