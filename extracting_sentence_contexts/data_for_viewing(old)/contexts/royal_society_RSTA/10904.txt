the cooling, a continuous re-solution or transformation of the solid phase will go on,
while at the same time it grows in amount, Finally, when the temperature q is
reached, defined by the intersection of the vertical through x with the solidus, the
system will, in the ideal case of perfect equilibrium adjustments, be a uniform
crystalline solid solution, the crystals being surrounded by a vanishingly small amount
of mother-liquid of the composition p, where p is defined as the intersection with the
liquidus of the horizontal through g. Of course, in a real experiment, for which
infinitely slow cooling is not possible, there will be a chance that the earlier crystals
may never be wholly transformed, but may remain as cores richer in A than the solid
outside them. In this case the temperature of complete solidification will be lower
than the theoretical one given by the point g.

The fact, taught us by the phase-rule, that in a binary mixture in which only
concentration and temperature are variable a particular liquid can in general only be
in equilibrium with one solid phase makes it certain that the solidus as defined above
is theoretically the same curve as the melting-point curve.

We can now proceed to consider the special form taken by the solidus in the
copper-tin alloys. As determined by us through the study of chilled alloys, and
drawn in Plate 11, the solidus consists of the broken line AblemdefE,E,H’H’K’. The
angular points on this broken line, with the exception of m, are pretty accurately
determined, but the exact shape of the branch Ab has been rendered uncertain by the
impossibility of obtaining true equilibrium transformations during the cooling of the
corresponding alloys, and the branches Jc and mdef may, from the same cause, be a
few degrees too low. Again, we have drawn E,E; as a vertical straight line, while it
