Since the 0 weight does not enter in the additive decomposition
of a number, its effect is that of a duplication label. This implies that the representation is
split in two identical halves. This fact has profound consequences in the description of the
associated degeneracy and led us to a biological hypothesis on the origin of degeneracy in protein
coding [18]. Similarly to the mathematical model, the biological hypothesis is based on symmetry
properties. Symmetry is the key feature for connecting the mathematical model with the chemical
and biological features of the genetic code.
