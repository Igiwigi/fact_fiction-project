modulus is a completely monotonic function. Similarly, the energy estimate involving the creep
compliance is based on the fact that the creep compliance is the Bernstein function.

(a) Materials having finite glass modulus

The energy estimate for the fractional wave equation expressed in terms of relaxation modulus
(2.14) corresponds to materials that have finite glass modulus and thus finite wave speed as
well, i.e. materials described by the power-type distributed-order model (1.14), Case I (A 1), and
Case III (A 3) of the linear constitutive model (1.13), as well as materials described by the fractional
Burgers models VI-VIII (B 6), (B 7), (B8).

Namely, by multiplying the fractional wave equation (2.14) by 3u and by subsequent
integration with respect to the spatial coordinate along the whole domain R and with respect
to time over interval [0, t], where t > 0 is the arbitrary time-instant, one has
