Let us first note that strong correlations are ubiquitous in our models [20]. For example,
in our ‘neutrino’ model, §3, the dynamical variables take the form of flat sheets, which show
strong space-like correlations even though their dynamical equations of motion are local, as was
explained at the end of that section. And then, given the fact that we have these correlations, what
exactly is the mathematical definition of disgusting? More to the point, the correlation function (7.2) is still not quite in line with our theory
of the Cellular Automaton Interpretation (CAI) of quantum mechanics. The correlation has to be
complete!
