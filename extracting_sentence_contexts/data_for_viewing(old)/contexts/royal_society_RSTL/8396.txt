avoid the conclusion that the existence of a central heat is not sufficient in itself to
account for all the phenomena which terrestrial temperatures present to us” (p. 835) ;
that is to say, that a cooling globe, together with such effects as his experiments on
conductivity of its materials warrant, are still insufficient to account for the observed
discrepancies in hypogeal increment of heat.

42. One great source (if not, the only one) for the unknown residual phenomena thus
distinctly indicated by Horxixs we hope presently to point out, and to prove its inti-
mate connexion with existing volcanic phenomena.

45. Our present knowledge of hypogeal temperature, while thus and s0 far insufficient
to snstain any very minute conclusions based upon annual absolute loss of heat by
our earth, seems surely to support the fact that our earth is a cooling globe ; while
astronomical analogies and considerations of its figure seem equally to warrant
the presumption that it has been a cooling globe at all times from a state of fusion ;
and if 80, that from that period and up to the present it has been on the whole
a contracting globe.

These are all the conditions we require to admit for the conclusions to be obtained
by considering the sequence of the phenomena that have followed on refrigeration.

44. It may be remarked, in passing, that the general credence of geologists in the
cooling at, all of our globe has been more or less disturbed by the celebrated memoir
of LaeLace (Mecanique Celeste, tom. y. cap. iv. p. 72 &.) © On the Cooling of the
Earth as affecting the length of the Day,” in which it has been taken for granted, by
