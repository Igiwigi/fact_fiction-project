Higher actinic light
intensities induced the decline in qPg followed by a further
increase in ql, which at this stage is composite and contains
contributions from true photodamage as well as slowly
reversible pNPQ. In many cases, if the treatment with
1500 pmol m™~*s~! actinic light lasted for two or more
hours, qPq started to recover (figure 3, large open triangle),
as did the PSII quantum yield (figure 3 inset, open triangle),
reaching a value close to the predicted theoretical yield (solid
line, figure 3) when photodamage is absent. In fact, the value
of qI close to 3 in this case should be a dominant component
of sustained protective pNPQ (because the amount of photo-
damage under these conditions is relatively low, qPa approx.
0.9)—revealing its paramount importance in photoprotection. This remarkable trend is likely due to the effect of the D1
recovery system [30], which normally functions on a slow
time scale, and pNPQ diminishes the photoinhibitory effect
of high light by strongly dissipating a large proportion of
its energy. Figure 4a represents a proof that the parameter
qPq recovers fairly slowly in the dark and is associated with
the activity of PSII repair, because it is totally lincomycin-
sensitive.
