By collecting together all the terms in each particular cos 2n0 or
P,,,(cos@), the equations (3) and (4) yield three infinities of equations. These equations
would, in principle, be solved successively, beginning with the gravest harmonic and
moving to each higher harmonic in turn. Ifsuch a procedure were in fact possible, we would
hope to have established a convergent process, and to obtain a reasonable approximation
to the motion with the first few terms. Unfortunately, however, this procedure is too
complicated to give satisfactory results. The high powers of R which appear in the
velocity potentials give rise to very high order equations in the S$ coefficients, when
the expansions (8) or (9) are used in (3) and (4).
