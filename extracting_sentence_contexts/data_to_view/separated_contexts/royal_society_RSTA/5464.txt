These
quantities are defined as local ¢? norms of wavelet coefficients in a narrow temporal
neighbourhood over all finer scales:

with Aj x = [k2/, (k + 1)2/) and Sai k= Umt-1,0,1) Ajk+m [24-26]. Multifractality can be quantified by
considering that wavelet p-leaders moments of positive and negative orders q (in contrast with
the second-order moments only as in equation (2.1)) behave as power laws with respect to:

The collection of scaling exponents ¢(q) for positive and negative q can be associated with the
multifractal spectrum D(h) of the signal X, and thus describes fine details of its temporal dynamics. A first limitation in the use of these scaling exponents ¢(q) lies in the fact that
they mix-up linear and nonlinear temporal dynamics. To disentangle nonlinear dynamics

from linear dynamics, it has been proposed to rewrite S$, (j,q) = (1/1) Ya ei, O17 as
x

Sen (i,q) = (1/n;) Yea exp(qlog PG, k)|) thus motivating the use of the cumulants of log-leaders

Indeed, for scale-free dynamics, these cumulants behave as c?(j) =), + cm log(2/), and it can
further be shown that Cj(j) and c, are associated with the location of the maximum of multifractal
spectrum, while C2(j), C3(/) and C4(/) can be associated with its width, asymmetry and flatness
