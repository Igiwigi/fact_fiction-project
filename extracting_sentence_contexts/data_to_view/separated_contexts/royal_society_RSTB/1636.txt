By many authors, e.g., Busow,§ the fact that fluid fat sometimes oozed from the
wound was taken to mean that it was melted by the heat of the bullet. This is put
forward without recognition that fluid fat always escapes from adipose tissue if this
latter be cut, lacerated, or contused. Against the view that any part of the bullet is
fused, is the incontrovertible and finally decisive fact, that fired bullets often show the
marks of the rifling of the barrel, and scratches on their surfaces as perfectly sharp. In one case we noted, as von Beck had previously, that the bullet had enclosed a
hair in its course, which hair was quite uninjured. Finally, no part of the wound is in
the slightest degree charred, even superficially.
