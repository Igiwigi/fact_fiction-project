This is not to be done by com-
paring the value of a degree on the meridian, as deduced from
these observations, with the results of other measurements in
distant parts of the globe. For if we find that these degrees
80 taken do not agree in giving the same ellipsoid, we are not
to attribute all the differences to irregularities of the earth,
without supposing any error on the part of the observer, of
his instrument, or of other means employed in his survey. But this, in fact, is what has generally been done. It must,
however, be acknowledged, that the majority of observers
have not been in fault, as they could do nothing better ; but
too much reliance has been placed on the goodness of their
instruments; their means, and other circumstances. It is true
that irregularities of the earth and local attractions may occa-
sion considerable discrepancies which are even inevitable ; but
before we decide that these are the real source of disagree-
ment, we ought carefully to ascertain that there are no others.
