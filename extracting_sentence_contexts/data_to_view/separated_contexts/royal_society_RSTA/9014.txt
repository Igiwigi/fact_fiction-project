The similarity between the primary radiation
and the secondary radiation of this type, while perhaps tending rather to mask the
full importance of the phenomenon in reality enhances the value of the results
obtained. The simplicity of necessity permits of less ambiguity in the interpretation
of the experimental results. The established facts which have an obvious bearing on the theory of radiation may
be briefly stated.

1. Slight polarization of the primary radiationâ€”as shown by the variation in
intensity of radiation scattered around such a primary beam,f

2, Polarization of the scattered X-radiation, proceeding in a direction perpendicular
to that of propagation of the primary radiation{ (such as is shown in light
scattered from the sky), and

3. The close agreement between wide limits, of the theoretical and experimental
distribution of radiation scattered in a plane containing the direction of pro-
pagation of the primary beam,$

are inexplicable except on the transverse wave theory.
