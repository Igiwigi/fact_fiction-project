constant is no longer relevant. In other words, that is why it has to be the criterion for whether
the quantum reversibility properties are in the Lyapunov regime, equation (2.13), which is the
only regime where they match the classical reversibility properties. In the final analysis, it is the
structural stability of chaotic systems that enables the predictability and reversibility of quantum
and classical dynamics to differ.

5. Discussion

The quantum and classical dynamical worlds are very different, and some of their intimate
connections are not always fully appreciated. That semiclassical methods relying exclusively on
classical information can be used to construct more and more accurate quantum propagation
over algebraic time scales in the i > 0 limit has additional implications that do not derive from
the idea that classical dynamics must emerge from quantum dynamics in the same limit. In fact,
classical dynamics emerges only logarithmically slowly from quantum dynamics. This is not an
equivalent two-way street in that it is easier to bootstrap quantum dynamics from classical than
classical dynamics from quantum.

The term ‘paradox’ is used here, because although it may seem odd to have the situation
that information from an unpredictable dynamics fully reconstructs a predictable one, there is no
contradiction. The quantum dynamics has less information in it, and interference is responsible
for much of its destruction. This is reflected in entropies. Given that the orbits themselves are
unpredictable, one might expect that the semiclassical term associated with a particular orbit
cannot be so important. However, all the terms in a semiclassical sum must be there and be
