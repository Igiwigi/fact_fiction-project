May is intermediate, and June and July may be grouped together,
for the rainfall and cloudiness were considerable. During. these two months the
soil maximum only exceeded 45° C on one day in six, but that is sufficient to kill
the puparia whose life extends to many days. In the course of tabulating the facts,
it was also observed that in the dry season the soil maximum at one inch was
invariably above the shade maximum, frequently by many degrees, but during the
rainy season it was frequently below the shade maximum. TasLteE XXVI—Showing number of days per month on which soil maximum (° C)
