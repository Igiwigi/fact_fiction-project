A similar turn in a crew forming one foot of the pedestal of the brake is enongh to adjust or regulate tho
Sitric and a slight pressure of the finger on the centre of the mahogany stand, apparently rigid, or eyen
Son the table on which the contact-breaker stands, will often control their movements.

* The discharges described above are usnally (althongh not always) those prodnced by breaking contact ;
but it often happens, and that most frequently when the strident noise is heard, that the current produced
by making contact is strong enongh to canse a visible discharge. This happens with the ordinary as with
the high break ; but in the latter case the double enrrent presents the yery remarkable peculiarity that

the strim of one current are 80 arranged as to fit exactly into the intervals of the other; and, further, that
any disturbance affecting the column of striw due to one current affects similarly, with reference to
absolute space, that due to the other, s0 that the donble column moves, if at all, as a solid or elastic mass.
And this fact is the more remarkable if we consider, as is easily observed in a reyolving mirror, thab these
currents are alternate, not only in direction, but also in time, and that no one of them is produced until
after the complete extinction of its predecessor. And it is also worthy of note that this association of
striw is not destroyed even when the two currents are separated more or less towards oppoxite sides of the
tube by the presence of a magnetic pole. There seems, however, to be a tendency in that case for the
