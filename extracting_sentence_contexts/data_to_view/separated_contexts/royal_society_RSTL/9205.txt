axes, there is considerable difference between Fresxer's theory and experiment : that
the differences between the two are most marked in the neighbourhood of the optic
axes, and amount there to 0005 about. For the outer sheet of the surface (except
Jjust in the neighbourhood of the principal axes), the theoretical values of the radius
vector are uniformly greater than the experimental, while for the inner sheet the
reverse is the case. In fact, the curves of section of the surface, as given by experiment, approach more
nearly to one another than those of the surface of wave slowness on FResNEr's theory. Vis

In the above figure, fig. 8, the dotted line gives the result of experiments, while the
S 8trong line gives the form of the section on FRESNEL's theory. To compare the results with those given by Lord RavLeGn's theory, we have the
equation to the surface, «, b, c being the principal velocities,
EF m?
