deficient lattice now under consideration is «*L,; hence, if the part magnitude be
unrestricted, the generating function is

1+97L, +0 L,+...+07*D, |

and if the part magnitude be restricted not to exceed 1,

((+1)...([4-mn—1) + #7 (I)... (U-+mn—2) L,+...+0™ ([—+1)... (I—4-++mn—1) L,
(1) ... (mn—1) :

A simple example, that may be at once verified, is found by taking m =n = 2 and
the defective lattice

Here L, = L, = 2 and the generating functions are

Now consider the partitions at the nodes of the complete lattice such that one part
at least is equal to 7+1 and no part exceeds 1+1. We obtain all such by placing the
part 7+1 at the node situated at the left-hand top corner and connecting with it all
of the partitions at the nodes of the incomplete lattice, which are such that the part

magnitude is restricted not to exceed /+1 in magnitude. We thus derive a generating function

and thence the generating function, which enumerates all partitions at the nodes of
the complete lattice, which are such that each has one or more parts at least as great
as /+1, is

+a7(L—e+2)..(I=ye-tann)

and it is easy to verify that this expression added to the expression already found for
GF (J, m, n) is, in fact, equal-to

that is, to GF («, m, 7). Art. 15. This main proposition involves the whole theory of the partitions at the
nodes of an incomplete lattice; it gives the true generating function without
redundant terms, and this only needs examination and, where possible, simplification.
