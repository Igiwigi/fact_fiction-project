investigation. But whatever the results on these and numerous other points may
be, I do not believe that the facts which I have advanced, or eyen the general laws
deduced from them, will suffer any serious change ; and they are of sufficient impor-
tance to justify their publication, even though much may remain imperfect or undone. Indeed, it is the great beauty of our science, CHEMISTRY, that advancement in it,

opens the doors to further and more abundant knowledge, overflowing with beauty
and utility to those who will be at the easy personal pains of undertaking its experi-
mental investigation.

action proves, I think, that the current of electricity in the voltaic pile is sustained
by chemical decomposition, or rather by chemical action, and not by contact only.
