Ey actually much greater with the condensed discharge than in the bulb, although it is
; not so strikingly apparent owing to the broadening of the Diffuse series, which are
= the most affected.

The fundamental importance of a phenomenon of this type is perhaps a sufficient
justification for exhibiting the results derived from a third plate—in which all the
three spectra are present together. The height of the wedge in the enlargement
is 34 mm. for the condensed discharge and 33 for the others.

The first two columns of ratios are again in general agreement with the phenomenon
already established, and more especially when the breadths of the lines on the plate
are taken into account. ‘There is, in fact, no case of exception. But other important
facts are brought out in this table. In the first place, the stage of energy transfer in
this experiment is not quite the same as before, and it therefore depends on the
circumstances of the experiment—perhaps on the pressure of gas and so on, and
further work is required in order to test the possibility of transferring the energy
further down the series. For one very interesting question which is raised is the
possibility of transferring all the energy into the final members, so that the series
would ultimately behave like a band so far as it is visible. But if this be possible,
