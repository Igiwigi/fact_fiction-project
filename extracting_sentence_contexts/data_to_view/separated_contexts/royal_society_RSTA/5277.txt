In a moving ether, wave-normal and ray enclose an angle, and line of visi
depends upon motion of observer. If the observer is stationary his line of vision
the ray ; if he moves at the same rate as the ether his line of vision is the wa
norinal (§ 13). The line of vision, in fact, always depends on the motion of the observer, not at
on the motion of the ether so long as it has a velocity-potential. Hence nothing
be simpler than the theory of aberration if this condition is satisfied. A similar but more general condition (to be obtained in the next section) sufli
to secure the straightness of a ray whatever happens, or more generally that whate
the path of a ray may be by reason of reflexion or refraction in a stationary e
the same it shall be ina moving one; and readily accounts for the absence of
effect on direction due to the general relative drift of the medium, whether in
