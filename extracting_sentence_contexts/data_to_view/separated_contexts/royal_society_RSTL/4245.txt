The absence of all organs for the sustentation of life by food leads to the belief
that it is created for a single purpose, and that its duration or term of existence is
yery short. In this respect it somewhat resembles the drone or male bee, whose
utility seems confined to the impregnation of the perfect female or queen. The short
existence of this male is further proved by the fact that it is impossible to keep these
animals alive for any extended space, and the observer who has not frequent access to
the natural pools in which they exist, is dependent for subjects of experiment on
their occasional production by the females in the water wherein they are confined. That a single impregnation is sufficient for the production of many young, is proved
by the female continuing to breed in water in which no male can be discovered ; but
young females 80 produced will not go on to deyelope others unless a male he born
amongst them. In what light then are we to look upon an animal wanting those organs, that in the
most elementary beings appear to constitute the almost entire structure having a single
function to discharge, that of continuing the species, which once effected, it perishes ?
