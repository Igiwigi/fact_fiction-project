Hence we have the
theorem :—

At an end point of (0, 7) the limits of indeterminacy of all canonical Sturm-
Liouville series corresponding to an assigned function, save those whose normal
functions satisfy the boundary condition u = 0 there, depend only wpon the values
assumed by the function in an arbitrarily small neighbourhood to the right, or left, of
the point, as the case may be. Again, from theorem IV, it appears that, if one of the Fourier’s series, say the
cosine series, corresponding to f(s) converges uniformly in an interval (y, 8) contained
within (0, 7), then all canonical Sturm-Liouville series corresponding to f(s) converge
uniformly in (y, 8). It was shown in § 13 that

sin 3 (2n—1
(3) at [LAG—t) + Alor] Ae = Mt aes
converges uniformly to zero for values of s in (y, 8), as n increases indefinitely, Since
both the integrals

converge uniformly to zero, for these values of s,f and since

it is thus clear that the canonical Sturm-Liouville series will all converge uniformly
to f(s) in (y, ), when

[LA G94 fF (o+)-27 (EERE ae

converges uniformly to zero in this interval.
