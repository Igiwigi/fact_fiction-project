This is converted into force from a knowledge of the temperature coefficient, and the
result is applied with appropriate sign as a correction to the inequality already
obtained. There would be a great increase of labour, and no gain in accuracy, so
far as the inequality is concerned, if each hourly value of the magnetic curve were
corrected for temperature. A second and conclusive reason for not correcting
individual hourly values was the fact that continuous records of temperature were
not taken in the magnetograph room until 1895. This being so, a course was
followed which at least reduced labour to a minimum. During the 11 years no
change had been made in the magnetograph room, or in the programme of work done
in it or adjacent parts of the building.
