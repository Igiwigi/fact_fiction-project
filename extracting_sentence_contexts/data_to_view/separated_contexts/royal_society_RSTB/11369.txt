Also, new ESCs can be derived by the isolation of
the ICM in this condition. So far, however, the culture con-
ditions for human naive PSCs contain factors typical for the
primed state such as Rock inhibitor, FGF2, ACTIVIN A or
they require the transient and simultaneous overexpression
of KLF2 or NANOG [127-132]. In the light of these very
diverse culture conditions and the inclusion of factors that
are required in the primed state, it seems as if the claimed
human naive state is in fact still not fully dedifferentiated. Therefore, key questions remain unanswered: what are the
authentic differences between the murine and the human
blastocysts in terms of developmental timing? What happens
to human ICM in contrast with the murine ICM upon iso-
lation?
