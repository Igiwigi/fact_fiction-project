Zr**, in agreement with thermodynamic predictions [53,54]. Non-stoichiometry of 19 mol% Zr-
doped CeO) is shown to be larger than CeO? (figure 132) although the reoxidation is somewhat
difficult [54,55].

(a) Perovskites

The large degree of reduction capability at elevated temperatures and reversible reoxidation are
among the basic criteria needed for a material to be used for the solar-thermal reduction of
H20 and CO. Large numbers of perovskite oxides of ABO3_; class are known to create oxygen
non-stoichiometry. Nalbandian et al. [57] have investigated La,_,SryMO3 (M = Mn, Fe; x = 0-1)
perovskites for thermochemical syngas production using CH4 and H20 as reactants at 1273 K.
Notably, the addition of 5% NiO on Laj_,SryFeO3 is reported to produce maximum Hy [58].
Beside the fact of lowering the reaction temperature, use of CH4 and H2O as reactants suffers from
significant coke formation. The Laj_,Sr;MnQO3 (LSM) family of perovskites has been successfully
applied for reduction of CO2 and H2O by using the two-step process.

In LSM, replacement of trivalent La by divalent Sr creates holes located at the Mn sites,
creating Mn>+ /Mnâ€˜** pairs. A detailed thermodynamic investigation by Scheffe et al. [56] reveals
the greater oxygen non-stoichiometry of LSM perovskites compared with ceria. Experimental
investigations show LSM35 (Lag.65Sro.35MnO3) reduces to a greater extent than CeO (Trep =
1773K, figure 13b). Despite having less favourable oxidation thermodynamics, LSM35 produces
more CO than CeO (figure 13b). Thermochemical HO splitting was studied using LSM (x = 0-
0.5) by Yang et al. [59] showing higher fuel production capability than CeO. For higher Sr content
stoichiometric reoxidation needs high concentration of H2O as dictated by thermodynamic and
kinetic assessments. A similar observation has been reported by Demont et al. [60] for CO
