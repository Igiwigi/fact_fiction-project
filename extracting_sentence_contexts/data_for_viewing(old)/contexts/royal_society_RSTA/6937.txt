An examination of table 3 shows a marked discrepancy between the values of the
disturbed levels at Hartlepool and at the River Tees Entrance. Both sets of original data
were from automatic tide gauges, and both gauges appeared to be in good working order.
The tidal station at Hartlepool is situated at the North Entrance to Hartlepool Docks,
and is sheltered from northerly winds by a promontory, the Heugh, whereas the gauge at
the Tees Entrance is in a position exposed to the full force of north winds. These local
topographical features probably account for most of the differences between the recorded
disturbances at two closely adjacent ports. The values for Hartlepool fit in with the general
trend along the coast much better than those for the Tees Entrance, and when positioning
the co-disturbance lines more reliance has been placed on the former set of values.

The levels at Kingâ€™s Lynn are abnormal at various times throughout the period under
consideration, a fact which had been remarked by Corkan (1950) on another occasion
and which is no doubt attributable to a combination of large stretches of shallow water in
the Wash and the geographical shape and orientation of the Wash.

6. THE TRANSMISSION OF THE SURGE UP THE RIVER THAMES

While the purpose of this investigation is not particularly concerned with the propaga-
tion of the disturbance up various rivers and estuaries, the case of the River Thames is
thought to be of some interest, though more information along its length would be required
for a comprehensive survey.
