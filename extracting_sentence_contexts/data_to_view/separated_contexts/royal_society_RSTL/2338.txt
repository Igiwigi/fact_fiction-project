Having determined in these needles the points of greatest intensity, which
we may consider as the poles, and likewise the centres of their magnetism, I
made observations with them precisely similar to those detailed in the paper
already cited. In the first instance, I proposed to determine the several
values of a particular constant, by applying the hypothesis of a central action
of the iron to the observations with the needle whose magnetism had been un-
disturbed, and to employ the mean value in calculating the effects which would
arise, according to this hypothesis, from the disturbance of the magnetism in
the other needles : but as these values, though not differing greatly from each
other, had a pretty regular increase and decrease according to the azimuth of
the shell, I considered that the length of the needle might, in this case, bear
too great a proportion to the distance of the shell for the proposed law to be
strictly applicable, although it might give results approximating to the experi-
ments. The fact however, which is stated to have been ascertained -by experi-
ment, that the length of a needle has no sensible influence on the extent of its
deviations, was opposed to this view ; and I therefore compared with each
other the values of the constant which would result from these observations, by
applying to-them a law considered to have been established by experiment :
viz. © the tangent of the deviation is proportional to the rectangle of the cosine
of the longitude, and the sine of the double latitude” of the needle's centre
with reference to that of the shellh. The values of the constant, thus deduced, differed so widely from each other,
that I could haye no expectation of obtaining from the mean value, results that
should at all approximate to the experiments; and indeed, could entertain no

* These terms, marked end and unmarked end, I employ instead of north end and south end, or
south pole and north pole, merely to ayoid the ambiguity that might arise in some of the experiments
if the name of the end of the magnet or necdle had any reference to poxition,
