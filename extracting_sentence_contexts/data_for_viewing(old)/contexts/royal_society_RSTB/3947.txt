asexual generations, in which case if vegetative segregation were taking place they
would probably all have become homozygous before the experiment began.



446 MR. W. E. AGAR: EXPERIMENTS ON INHERITANCE IN PARTHENOGENESIS.

These results then are in accord with the direct evidence of the absence of segrega-
tion in asexual reproduction in plants obtained by MENDEL, OsTENFELD and RosENBERG
for Hieracium. The apparent segregation in a single parthenogenetic brood of a
Phasmid bred by Fryer may prove explicable on quite other grounds or may be
established as an exceptional case, but the evidence at present is very strong that
segregation does not normally take place in parthenogenesis. This fact is also indirect
evidence that it normally takes place in the reduction division, as appears so probable

on purely cytological grounds.

EXPERIMENTS WitH Simocephalus vetulus,
Selection Experiment.

The experiments with this species were carried out in a different manner, inheritance Â°
within a monoclonal population being tested by a selection experiment carried oyer
15 generations. The character selected was birth measurement, the results being
summarised in Table XI. ;
