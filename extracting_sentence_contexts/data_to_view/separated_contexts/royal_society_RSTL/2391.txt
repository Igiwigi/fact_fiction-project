That combustible gases should lose their elastic state, and become
concrete, assuming the form of exceedingly attenuated but solid strata, is considered
as proved by facts, some of which are quoted in the Giornale di Fisica for 18244; and
though the theory requires that they should assume this state at high temperatures,
and though the similay films of aqueous and other matter are dissipated by the action
of heat, still the facts are considered as justifying the conclusion against all oppo-
Sition of reasoning.

614. The power or force which makes combustible gas or vapour abandon its
elastic state in contact with a solid, that it may cover the latter with a thin stratum
of its own proper substance, is considered as being neither attraction nor affinity, It

is able also to extend liquids and solids in concrete laminz over the surface of the
acting solid body, and consists in a repulsion, which is deyeloped from the parts of the
solid body by the simple fact of attenuation, and is highest when the attenuation is
most complete. The force has a progressive deyelopment, and acts most powerfully,
or at first, in the direction in which the dimensions of the attenuated mass decrease,
and then in the direction of the angles or corners which from any cause may exist on
the surface. This force not only causes spontaneous diffusion of gases and other
substances over the surface, but is considered as very elementary in its nature, and
competent to account for all the phenomena of capillarity, chemical affinity, attraction
of aggregation, rarefaction, ebullition, volatilization, explosion, and other thermome-
tric effects, as well as inflammation, detonation, &c. &c.
