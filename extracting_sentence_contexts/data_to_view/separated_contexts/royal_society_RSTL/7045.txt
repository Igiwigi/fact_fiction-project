In determining the different spectra both of the firs; and the second order, the
dispersing prisms occupied inyariably the same position, corresponding to the minimum
deviation of the green hydrogen-line HP, 4. e. of FRauxNHopgR's F. All spectra repre-
8ented in the Plates are referred to the three hydrogen-lines He, HB, Hy, and the
double sodium-line Na. Generally two prisms of about 60? and 45* were employed,

* This fact has been noticed by M. A. Mrrscurrrcn with regard to the chloride and the iodide, and attri-
