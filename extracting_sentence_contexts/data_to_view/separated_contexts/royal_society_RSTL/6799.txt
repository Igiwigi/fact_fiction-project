the late receſs of the Society, at a place called Star-
borough-caſtle, which lies nearly b:#wwveen the two
churches of Lingfield and Edenbridge (ſcarce four
miles diſtant from each other), he has had an oppor-
tunity of being more particularly and circumſtan-
tially informed of the fact, as far as relates to thoſe
two pariſhes : and he is now aſſured, that it was cer-
tainly and undoubtedly felt and obſerved by ſome
perſons in each of thoſe two. parithes ; tho' (as it
happened in the dead of the night, when moſt peo-
ple were faſt aſleep) it was not generally perceived :
nor was it much ſpoken of, even by thoſe, who
were ſure they felt it. 'The perſons, from whoſe own mouths he can
authenticate the fact, are James Martin, Adam Kil-
lick, Mrs. Jewell, and Mr. Chapman : and he has
no leſs doubt as to. Mr. Orgles and Mrs. Pigott (who
was waked and much frighted by it), tho' he did not
indeed perſonally converſe with cither of the two laſt. Thele two, and Mrs. Jewell, all inhabit quite cloſe
to Lingfield church-yard, on different fides of it :

and Chapman lives within a quarter of a mile of it,
to the ſouth-weſt,

James Martin lives within a bow-ſhot of Star-
borough-caſtle, at the caſtery edge of the pariſh of
