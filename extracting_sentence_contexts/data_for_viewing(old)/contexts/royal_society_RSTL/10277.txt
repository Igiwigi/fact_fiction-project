are entitled to state positively that changes of temperature directly influence the
rhythm of the heart of the warm-blooded animal, we musb have data based on
experiments made with the hearts of snch animals eut off from all possible control
through extrinsic nerve centres, and supplied with nutriment of constant composition.
The only experiments known to me which approach the fulfilment of such conditions
are those made by several observers (SouexK (7), WerxIOKE (8), CLELAND (9)) on the
influence of temperature changes upon the rate of pulsation of the hearts of embryo
Chicks during the first three days of incubation. Such experiments afford, however,
even a less 8afe ground for conclusions as to the adult Mammalian heart than do the
experiments upon Frogs' hearts above referred to. The heart of three-day Chick
embryos is but a protoplasmic mass, little differentiated, presenting neither definite
musenlar or nervous tissue, and without any developed controlling extrinsic nerves.
From the fact that such a mass of hardly-differentiated embryonic cells contracts more
frequently when warm than when cold, we cannot safely conclude that the adult heart,
vith its fully deyeloped muscular and nervous tissues, and placed under the

governance of nerve centres located outside it in the body, would, if isolated, respond
in like manner to similar temperature changes.

While experiment upon the isolated hearts of Frogs, Fishes, and Bird embryos,
combined with the changes in the pulse-rate observed when Mammals are heated or
