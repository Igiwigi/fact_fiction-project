anthocyanins. The colour reactions employed in their identification are in agreement
with our own experience of these substances, and they are included in Table IX.
In the case of Fuchsia berries we do not know what method of identification was
employed, but the author states that the pigment was analogous to that of Beta and
of Cactus flowers.

The list is based on Hutchinsonâ€™s classification (1926) and it is interesting to note
that these pigments are limited to five orders. Of these orders, Hutchinson considers
that the Caryophyllales, Chenopodiales, Lythrales and Thymeleales are related, but
while admitting that there are grounds for associating the Cactales with the Ficoidaceae
(Caryophyllales) he places them far apart.

The fact that the nitrogenous anthocyanins are found only in these five orders
would in itself have little phylogenetic significance. However, many systematists

differ from Hutchinson on morphological grounds in his placing of the Cactales, and
taken in conjunction with this the distribution of the nitrogenous anthocyanins indi-
cates that the Cactales are closely related to the Caryophyllales, Chenopodiales,
Lythrales and Thymeleales.
