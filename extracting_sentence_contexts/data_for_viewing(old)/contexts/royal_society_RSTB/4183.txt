of Wielandiella at the lower end. These structures are shown diagrammatically in
the figures (text-fig. 6). The reduced nature of the Williamsoniella microsporophylls
is further emphasised by the*fact that not only are their synangia smaller in size
than those of W. whitbiensis, but also we only get four to six synangia in each of
our sporophylls as against, perhaps, 12 per sporophyll in NarHorst’s species.

With regard to the structure of the sporophyll, we may notice that in W. specta-
bilis, and, in fact, in all the species described by Narnorst, the middle line of the
