434 MR. S. CHAPMAN ON THE KINETIC THEORY OF A GAS

The other hypothesis referred to seems to be much more in agreement with fact,
but its consequences have been worked out less accurately. The method which
has almost always been used is the one originally devised by Crnausrus and
MAxweEt.L; MAxweE tt abandoned it later, however, as it had “led him at times into
grave error.” In spite of its apparent simplicity, numerical errors of large amount
may undoubtedly creep in in a very subtle way. Hence the theory of a gas whose
molecules are elastic spheres remains in a rather unsatisfactory state. As a
“descriptive” theory (to use Mryer’s apt term) it has, however, served a useful
purpose ; the general laws of gaseous phenomena have been developed by its aid in
an elementary way, which has conduced to a wider diffusion of knowledge of the
kinetic theory than would have been possible if the sole line of development had been
by the more mathematical and accurate methods used by MAXWELL and BorrzmMAnn.
