3p On the whole, then, we think it most likely that the changes observed at the

‘gmaller thickness are in part at all events due to the direct action of the surface

‘Forces, but that their action is complicated by some cause which at greater thicknesses

a pellicle and also affects the interior of the film.

‘2 There is indeed a great deal of evidence for the fact that if the surface of a solution
f soap in water has been long exposed a pellicle is formed upon it. The surface

Zension of such a solution is about one-third of that of pure water, but Lord Rayieren

has shown that there is no measurable difference if the surface of the solution has

ly been formed for a very small portion of a second, It is obvious, therefore, that

e surface of a solution of soap in water is modified when exposed to the air.

& We, on the other hand, have proved (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 177, Part 2, 1886, p. 659) that
