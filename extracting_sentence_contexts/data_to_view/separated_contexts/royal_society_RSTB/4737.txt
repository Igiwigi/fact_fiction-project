The ccelom sac that grows downwards to surround the genital rudiment is earlier in
connection with the ventral mesoderm, from which develop the muscles of the first pair
of trunk limbs. The second ccelom pouch must clearly belong to the first trunk segment.
and hence, since there is only one pair of pouches between this and the mandibular
muscles, either the maxillulary or the maxillary pouches are absent or else they are
fused together. That the first dorsal pouch represents at least the maxillary pouch is
clearly established by the fact that the maxillary gland develops in connection with it. Whether it also represents the maxillulary pouch cannot be stated for certain. It is a
very long pouch, being prolonged to end just inside the dorsal attachments of the mandi-
bular dorso-ventral muscles.
