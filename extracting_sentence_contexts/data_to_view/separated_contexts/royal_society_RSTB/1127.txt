of the effect. As the experimental details accumulate, this steady
quantitative relation will be found to vary wonderfully little, considering the nature
of the structure investigated and the difficulties connected with the method. The experiment just alluded to also indicates a very important fact which will be
referred to in detail in the concluding section of this work, namely, that when the
stimulus is minimal the nerve impulses are almost entirely confined to the direct
path ; in other words, this path is that of least resistance. It is necessary for the
stimulus to be of a certain intensity before nerve impulses can be started of sufficient
volume to break through corpuscular structures and so enter on indirect paths. This
is indicated by the fact that no change in the deflection could be observed in the case
of the weak initial stimulus to follow the section of the grey matter ; presumably,
therefore, the cord effect was due, in this case, to afferent impulses passing up the
direct path.
