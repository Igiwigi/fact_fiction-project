T, E. THORPE AND J. W. RODGER ON THE RELATIONS But at the boiling-poiot the vapour pressures of different substances are the same,
and hence if the boiling-point be approximately a corresponding temperature, the
urivical pressures of substauces ought to be approximately the same. This conclusion,
however, is not supported by facts, and henes, having regard to the doctrine of corre-
epouding pressures, Gunpexne’s view, that the boiling-point may be regarded ns a
correspunding temperature, réceives no support from VAN bes WaAAts’ theory. Hitherto the boiling-point has been mainly of value as 4 comparable temperatura
in dealing with properties which, like density or surface energy, vary bub slowly with
the temperature. Th was w mablor of Uilorest, (ierefire, fo determine if if led Lo good results in Vin
case of a property like viscosity, which alters rapidly with the temperature.
