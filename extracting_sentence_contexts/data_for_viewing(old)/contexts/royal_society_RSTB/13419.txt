is caused by the less efficient repair of thymine compared to
uracil, respectively, produced by the spontaneous deamina-
tion of methylated cytosines and unmethylated cytosines
[98,99]. In eukaryotes, CpG dinucleotides are the main targets
of C methylation and the higher mutability of 5 mC results in
a general depletion of CpG dinucleotides relative to the local
density of Cs and Gs in the genomes of any organism subject
to DNA methylation in the germ line, as reviewed by Yi &
Goodisman [100]. However, as alluded to by the authors,
beyond this direct and striking effect of DNA methylation
on the mutation rate, there are also indirect effects mediated
by chromatin, stemming from the fact that it modulates the
exposure of DNA to insults, as well its accessibility to
repair activities.

The study of epigenetic mechanisms and sex chromosome
evolution and regulation have a rich shared history. In
mammals, inactivation of the X chromosome via heterochro-
matinization is necessary to achieve appropriate gene dosage
between the sex chromosomes. Less known is how epigenetics
affects the evolution of sex chromosomes, which has been
mainly viewed as the succession of mutational events that
enable autosomes to differentiate each other. As reviewed by
Muyle et al. [101], findings from a wide range of plant and
