In the past 20 years
and also during the ITER EDA, it was argued that the bootstrap current fraction is higher at
higher aspect ratio; therefore, many reactor designs are at aspect ratio 3.5 or even 4. The problem
is that at such high aspect ratio the energy confinement at high density would certainly be in
the stiff regime and one would not achieve the full H-mode confinement and certainly not an
improved electron confinement regime. This is due to the fact that even if one could achieve the
