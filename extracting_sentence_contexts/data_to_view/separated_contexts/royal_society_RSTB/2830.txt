‘Flora,’ 1895). It is evident that the same method of segmentation is found in the leaves of Eusporangiate
Ferns as in those of Selaginella or Equisetum. Similarly (.c., p. 339), notwithstanding the regularity of
segmentation of the two-sided initial cell at the apex of the leaves of the Leptosporangiate Ferns, in the
Osmundacem there is a single three-sided initial cell, and in the Marattiacee there may be a plurality of
initials, The conclusion to be drawn from these facts will then be that the regularity of segmentation of
apex and wings seen in the Leptosporangiate Ferns is not an essential character of the Fern-leaf at large ;
it has probably been acquired in the course of the specialisation of these Ferns, and is not represented in
those types which the fossil evidence points out as the most primitive forms. + See Scorr, ‘Studies in Fossil Botany,’ pp. 513-520,

{ It was a common position, some twenty-five years ago, to regard the Leptosporangiate Ferns as the
most primitive Pteridophytes, and to look upon all the rest as the results of reduction, not only of the
sporangia and sori, but also of the sporophylls (see SrraspurRGER, ‘ Bot.
