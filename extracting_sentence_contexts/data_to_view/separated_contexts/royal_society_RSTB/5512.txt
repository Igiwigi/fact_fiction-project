This motion appears to be due to the up-and-down stroke of the
last segment, which repeatedly strikes the water, as the tail of a crayfish does when
swimming.” It is obvious that with a continuous flow of water to bathe the branchial
filaments, no sucker can be formed on the ventral surface of the animal. The sucker
theory of the attachment of these larve has, therefore, to be abandoned. Attention may here be directed to the fact that the larvae of the Dryopidx show a
progressive series of adaptations for life in swift currents. It has been pointed out
by Neepuam and Luoyn (‘ Life of Inland Waters,’ p. 371) that in the larvee of Elmis,
Dryops and Psephenus there is a “ close correlation between the degree of flattening
of the body and the rate of flow of the water inhabited.” This series could be made

more imposing by including the larva of Helichus before Psephenus and that of
Psephenoides after it.
