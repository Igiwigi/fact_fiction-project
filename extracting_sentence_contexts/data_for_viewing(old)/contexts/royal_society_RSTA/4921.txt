lines that can be used to deduce temperature, density or even elemental abundances, as noted
in textbooks, e.g. [55]. To follow larger regions in time, one can also use imaging instruments


such as AIA [56] or XRT [57]. If the filtergrams span a large enough range of peak contribution
temperatures, one can make a good guess at the thermal structure [58,59]. However, even when
many spectral lines (or bands) are used, the digital elevation model (DEM) inversion might
fail [60]. Still, these inversions are often convenient, because they are relatively quick, and they
always give a result (as long as they converge). However, this latter feature is dangerous, because
structures along the line of sight make a reliable interpretation difficult: if there is a compact
dense and a more extended less dense structure along the line of sight, the resulting density will
be somewhere in the middle, not necessarily reflecting the properties of any of the structures
along the line of sight [61]. This simply reflects the fact that these inversions often are an ill-posed
problem [62].

The inversions make implicit assumptions that are often forgotten when using an inversion
code as sort of a black box, e.g. for the emission measure inversion or density analysis with
tools such as CHIANTI [63]. Examples for the implicit assumptions are ionization equilibrium =
or absence of deviations from the line formation temperature due to flows and fast temporal :
changes. This is not to say that the forward models discussed in the next section do not apply
simplifying assumptions, but there they are more obvious and can be better controlled. nee)

Still, inversions provide very valuable information to get estimates for, for example, density :
and temperature, in particular in structures that are (still) too complicated to be sensibly described [4
by a reliable forward model. One example is the high densities found at transition region DNS
