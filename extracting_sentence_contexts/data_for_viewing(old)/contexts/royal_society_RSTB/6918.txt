The absence of a seasonal sex cycle

The present series of specimens gives no indication of the occurrence of any seasonal
sexual cycle. Animals in different stages of sexual activity occur together at the same
time, and in the same place. Sexual maturity is reached before physical maturity. All
physically mature animals show some degree of sexual activity, and, in the majority of
instances, are fully active. It would appear, then, that the male spotted hyaena, at
least in the district of Tanganyika Territory where the present series was collected, is
capable of breeding at any time. Breeding would thus be limited only by the occurrence
of oestrus in the female: as is shown below, oestrus in that sex is not a seasonal pheno-
menon, but may occur at any time. The male is thus not only capable of breeding at all
times, but in fact actually does so.

Physical and sexual maturity

The criteria of amount of suture-closure, and of tooth-wear, used in considering the
onset of maturity in the male, are now applied to the female. Table VII shows the
correlation between suture-closure and tooth-wear in this sex. The sutures do not start
closing until the teeth are one-quarter worn, and closure, of both the fronto-parietal and
