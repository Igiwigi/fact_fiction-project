(1) High-resolution observations of the corona have been carried out on the pioneering HiC
rocket flight which has provided much preliminary information of how the TR and
corona looks on scales of 0.2 [26]. For example, Testa et al. [70] noted that brightenings
in the Fe XIII moss suggested nanoflare energies perhaps as low as a few 1075 ergs.


(2) Efforts to characterize the ‘hot’ coronal component need to be continued in conjunction
with modelling efforts to understand how coronal plasmas at such temperatures behave.
Key to this are non-equilibrium ionization and the treatment of non-classical thermal
conduction. It seems likely that the emission at these temperatures is a very sensitive
diagnostic of nanoflare energies.

(3) Despite the fact that the magnetic reconnection process has long been believed to be
an effective particle accelerator, the results of Testa et al. [69] represent an important
breakthrough. However, the inference of these particles is through a proxy, namely
characteristic mass motions. Radiation signatures associated directly with the particles
would be desirable. All of these goals require major new projects to observe the Sun from
space either from existing instruments, such as Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array
for energetic particles, or future projects with high resolution and advanced spectroscopy
such as the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrograph and the JAXA-led Solar-C.

(4) Theoretical modelling of plasma processes needs to be continued and, as computational
abilities are enhanced, remove many of the existing commonly used assumptions. Of
particular interest would be an assessment of the reality of sandpile models within the
formal MHD framework. It is perhaps too much to expect small-scale models of magnetic
