cular structure of the heart which grows out and ultimately developes itself into a com-
plete septum, im the primitive aorta it is the yascular wall, having more the structure of
connective tissue, that effects the separation. Therefore the division of the truncus arte-

riosus cannot be described as if it were formed by an inward growth of the ventricular
septum, as also comes out in the clearest manner from the fact that in certain creatures
the aorta divides at a time when the ventricle is till single. This is the case in the
Viper, according to RaTHKE, in which, at the time when the truncus arteriosus divides
into three vessels, the ventricle still possesses no trace of a septum. Therefore, as RarukE
correctly observes, the cause of the division of the primitive aorta into two canals cannot
with Von Barr be sought in certain peculiarities of the circulation, in a particular direc-
tion of the current of blood, but it depends solely and alone on particular developmental
phenomena of the arterial wall. Now, concerning the peculiarities in man, I have in the
fourth week found the truncus arteriosus still completely single, and with round lumen ®*.
Transverse sections examined under the microscope already show clearly three tunics,—
a thin tough adventitia, a strong clear media, and an inner cellular layer as intima. In
the fifth week likewise the artery was till single, but its Hmen was now flattened out
transversely and slit-Shaped. In the seventh and eighth week I found the vessel already
