He
discredits the association of gonapophyses with the formation of the aedeagus of
insects for lack of positive ontogenetic evidence. According to him, the aedeagus
is an independent median outgrowth of the body wall; but the formation of the
aedeagus by fusion of the penis lobes, as mentioned above in the flea, has been
observed by various other workers, e.g., Dew1tz (1875), ZANDER (1900, 1901, 1903),
Stncu-Prurut (1924, 6, 1925), and Menta (1933), in other insects. The idea that
the subgenital plates are coxites and that the phallic lobes represent the endopodites
of the gonopods of the ninth abdominal segment (Stvcu-Prurut, 1924, b, p. 71) does
not harmonize with facts observed during the post-embryonic development of some
insects. If these two pairs of genital appendages represent the biramous condition
of the Crustacean limbs, why should two parts of the same limb have independent
origin one after the other? The independent origin of the subgenital plates, as
observed by me in the flea and by Menta in Lepidoptera, occurs also in Coleoptera,
as is clear from SincH-Pruturâ€™s description and drawings (1924, a, p. 861, text-figs.
1, 2).
