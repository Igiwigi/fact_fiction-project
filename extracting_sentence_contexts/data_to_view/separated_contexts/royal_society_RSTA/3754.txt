We create the mode by performing an inner product a
between the inverse Fourier transformed POD coefficients (a)(m;x,f)) and the azimuthally :=
Fourier transformed flow field. That is,

This procedure generates a conditional structure where the condition is applied at é =0, Dw
and where the upstream and downstream structure is allowed to evolve without any radial :
restrictions. In fact, at € =0 the cross-sectional profile of the conditional mode becomes the a
snapshot POD modes. 1

3. Discussion

The POD modes are insensitive to the streamwise mode number, and we will therefore present
the energy as integrated over all k. The POD analysis is truncated due to the large amount of data
and is resolved up to [+k,m,n] = [2 x 128, 64,256], corresponding to azimuthal and streamwise
wavelengths A49/R=0.098 and A,/R=0.234.
