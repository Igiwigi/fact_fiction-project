magnetizing forces as the residual magnetism is increased. That there is a partic
value of the residual magnetism, which gives greatest steepness of the reversal of
magnetization curve, is possible, but it is not here considered established. The int
pretation of the results, with reference to this point, is somewhat complicated by
fact that Foucault currents no doubt produce considerable shifting of the position
the point of maximum, as indicated by the apparent magnetizing current.
currents may also modify the value of the maximum coefficient. This point wi
more readily understood in connection with the effect of a secondary coil refe’
below.

In fig. 11, a set of curves are shown which illustrate the rise of current when
previous residual magnetism is in the same and in the opposite direction, togeth
with a continuation of the curve showing the rate of diminution of current wh
the battery is suddenly cut out, the magnet circuit being left closed. The dott
line curves show the rise and fall of the magnetic induction for the two cases, ’
curve of fall of current being, of course, the same for both. It will be obsery
from the total induction or magnetization curves here shown, that the residi
