In the context of microwave cavities, the validity of model (2.1)
for real x; has been established in previous works [33,34]. More general models of non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian operators may be used to study open quantum systems (e.g. the topical review [25]). This formalism has been successfully applied to wave billiards for which antennas and absorption
are respectively described by physical and fictitious coupling channels [34-36]. In figure 2, the eigenvalue dynamics measured in microwave cavities are shown for three types
of perturbation, where the perturbation strength is indicate by 4. In figure 2a, the perturbation is
introduced by the shift of a wall in a stadium billiard (for details see [18,37]) corresponding to
a full perturbation matrix V.
