equation, suitable for our purpose, was ultimately found. In the original equation

oy) —JMiVT=— |) owe KC y) do

where

P(%)=f(a)//e, = 29 =Ce/a,

the latter substitution being very convenient, we write

x) — (2\'_Q@)
r= (2) 2 cosh ga
so that Q (2), like ¢ (x), is an even function. Using the fact that 4 (y) — J, (y)/\/y
satisfies the homogeneous equation with coeflicient x, we obtain

which reduces at once to
