in this country has, within the last fifty years, increased from
14,000 to above 100,000 pounds annually. And the same
cause has probably contributed, from a mistaken mode of rea-
soning, to prepossess people with the idea of the wholesome-
ness of a hard frost. But it has in another place* been very
ably demonstrated that a long frost is eventually productive
of the worst putrid fevers that are at this time known in Lon-
don; and that heat does in fact prove a real preventive against
that disease. And although this may be said to be a very re-
mote effect of the cold, it is not therefore the less real in its
influence upon the mortality of London. Accordingly a com-
parison of the numbers in the foregoing table will shew that
very nearly twice as many persons died of fevers in January
1795, as did in the corresponding month of this year.
