From (46) we see that the electric force varies inversely as the square of the
distance for any given direction, but that for any given distance it gradually increases
as 0 increases from 0 to }a. As the speed increases the electric force tends to become
more and more concentrated about the plane through the origin at right angles to the
axis of x, When u = , there is no electric force except in that plane ; we have, in
fact, a plane electric wave moving forward at the speed of light. The expression for H shows that at low speeds, where 1/v® may be neglected in
& comparison with unity, the magnetic force is the same as that attributed.by AmpiRn’s
8 formula to a current element of “moment” ug. By the moment of an element is
§ meant the product of its length by the strength of the current in it.
