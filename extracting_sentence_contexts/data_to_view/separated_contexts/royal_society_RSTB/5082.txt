The reversion.
of either area 3 or area 2 (Holaster) results in corresponding columns being next the
anterior ambulacrum, and these areas are therefore symmetrical about the antero-
posterior axis (fig. 5). Where either area 1 or area 4 is also reversed, the plates are
symmetrical about the same axis, and the slight difference between the two areas is
confined to the plates nearest the peristome (see Lovin, 1874, Plates XXII and XXIII). This slight difference is possibly due to the fact already mentioned, namely, that one
area is bounded by two similar ambulacral columns and the other by two dissimilar ones. Kiimauarpr (1911) found that the plating of areas 1 and 4 in fossils of Micraster
glyphus was not in agreement with Lovén’s analysis. He also found that the arrange-
ment varied somewhat from specimen to specimen.
