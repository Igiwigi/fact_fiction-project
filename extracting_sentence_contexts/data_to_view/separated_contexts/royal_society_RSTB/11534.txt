This has led to consensus on some
aspects of how, when and where brains do or do not produce consciousness. But strong controversy remains, in particular on what aspects of consciousness
are the explanandum. Does the real mystery of consciousness lie in the fact that
we experience the world that surrounds us, or in the ability to reflect on it and
cognitively manipulate what we perceive; is consciousness about seeing or
about knowing what we see? In the first part of this paper I will review the cur-
rent state of that debate, starting with a brief overview of what we know about
visual processing, and then delving into the question about where, when and
how the transition from unconscious to conscious visual processing occurs. In the second part, I will address a more recent issue about how theories of
consciousness deal with the problem of panpsychism: the notion that all ani-
mals, or even all living beings and possibly even non-living items possess
some form of consciousness.
