Received January 13,—Read January 14, 1841. SOME time since, I laid before the Royal Society a few facts, which had inciden-
tally fallen under my notice, connected with the red particles or corpuscles of the
blood. Those facts were of a character which led me to expect that the farther
prosecution of the subject might be rewarded by the discovery of others; although,
in a field of physiological research s0 often traversed from the days of Mayericnr and
LEEUwENnoEK down to the present time, I could hardly expect to succeed in making
any addition to the exact description given by some able writers of the present day,
regarding the appearance of these corpuscles. But some ideas suggested during the
examination of objects figured in the memoir just referred to, induced me to make
the blood-corpuscles the subject of direct inquiry with reference to their mode of
origin, and certain changes which they undergo.
