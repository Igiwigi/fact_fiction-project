In a less memorable but nonetheless erudite analysis, the historian and philosopher
Amos Funkenstein argued that the transition from a ‘contemplative’ to an ‘ergetic’ (from the
Greek ergein, to do) mode of knowledge lies at the heart of the transition from medieval to modern
science [1]. The feedback loop made possible by the marriage of ‘knowing’ with ‘doing’ is what
gives us today’s high technology, with its breath-taking speed of change. However, all this does
not alter the fact that technology is, first and foremost, about getting things done without having
to first understand everything. Thus, for example, the appearance of Dolly the sheep in 1996 was generally hailed as a
‘scientific’ breakthrough, but strictly speaking it was not one. Few, if any, of the hundred
or so steps involved in bringing Dolly to birth were understood at the time; many are
still not understood today.
