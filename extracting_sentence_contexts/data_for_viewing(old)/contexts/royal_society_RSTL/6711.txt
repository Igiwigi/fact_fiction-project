digestive surface against the incursions of minute annelids and other predaceous
creatures. They are admirably fitted to retain and make prey of any such intruders.
No small animal could become entangled in the sinnosities of the interstitial cavities of
sponges thus armed without extreme injury from the numerous points of these spicula,
and every contortion arising from its struggles to escape from its painful and
dangerous entanglement would contribute to its destruction, and it may then, by its
death and decomposition, eventually become as instrumental to the sustentation of the
sponge as if actually 8wallowed by the animal. How far this mode of nutrimentation
may obtain in the physiology of these creatures it is impossible, in the present imperfect
state of our knowledge of their habits to say ; but, from the complex, yaried, and elaborate
structure of these organs, and from their evident adaptation to retain such intruders, as
well as to defend the internal surfaces from injury, it is not improbable that their office
extends beyond that of the mere defensive function, and that they are, in fact, auxiliary
organs for securing nutriment for the use of the sponge. If this supposition, that the
elaborately formed and ingeniously disposed recurvo-quaternate spicula combine the
office of securing prey with that of defending the interstitial organs of the sponge, be
correct, it may afford a clue to the organic purpose of the recuryo-ternate spicula with the
exceedingly long and attenuated shafts that 80 frequently accompany the stout patento-
ternate ones in (eodia Barretti. The apices of these spicula (Plate XXII1. fig. 45,
Phil. Trans. for 1858) rarely attain the height of the plane of the true connecting spicula,
and their recuryed radii are most frequently projected into the large interstitial spaces
immediately beneath the plane of the proximal ends of the cells of the intermarginal
