may apply the process used in the solution of that equation. We thus get

8 one el i 6y't
u,=(8m 0)-"(5in 053 8in 0) (Cc, (tan z) +C,(cot 7 ). # ten 20}
Now, although this expression appears to contain two arbitrary constants, it will be
shown presently, that when 7 is an integer and not greater than 7, it really contains only
one. This is seen immediately to be the case when #=0, and may be easily verified in
other simple cases, such as 4=1, n=2, &c.

9. In fact, the process of art. 2 gives

U,=Til =O co OD Ty m4 ms

where ,_,, satisfies the equation
(w,_u7_, wy +(1—mY—P)n,-u= 0;
and in general we can only arrive at an integrable form by taking m==n. But when +7
is an integer not greater than 2, we shall get an integrable form by taking m 8 as to
satisfy the condition (4—m)*=7?. Suppose 7 poxitive and less than n, and take m=1u—7 ;
we then have for the solution of (19.),
U,=ZRP 1 T1 Us

where u; satisfies the equation @_ay=0, or
