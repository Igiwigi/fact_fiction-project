Each hypothesis on its own seems elegant and
yet unable to explain the data. Altogether, these hypotheses
may be sufficient, as described by Nick Lane, a fellow of the
Royal Society, in his book Life Ascending [129]. In fact, this
book received an award from the Royal Society, which is
sponsoring this issue. Similarly, in metabolic scaling, the 3/4-power law of
metabolism has become the proposed universal law and, as
Douglas Glazier discusses [130], many hypotheses have been
generated over the past 80 years or more to explain this scaling. Nevertheless, there remains no consensus as to which model is
most valid.
