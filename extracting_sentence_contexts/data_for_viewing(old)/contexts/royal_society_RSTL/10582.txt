- others which were in comparatively insignificant quantity on plob 14 characterised

e herbage of plot 16. Thus, those which were the more prominent on plot 14 were
$f more rapid and freer growth than those which were 80 on plot 16 ; whilst, on the
Etter, a number of species of relatively meagre luxuriance maintained a fair position,
Belding, upon the whole, with the less active struggle, a much more mixed gramineous

rbage. Similar remarks, mutatis mutand:is, apply als in some degree to the Legu-
fie but to the Miscellaneze in a greater degree than to them.

S We have throughout spoken of the manurial conditions provided on plot 14 as being,
Smpared with those on plot 16, such as to greatly increase luxuriance relatively ts
Aaturing tendeney of growth. Yet, as a matter of fact, the herbage on plot 14 was

ays much more forward and riper than that on 16. This result, apparently 80
Fomalous, i is in reality by no means 80. The excessive amount of nitrate forced into
Ereat prominence a few very free-growing grasses, and these were characterized by

rly maturity ; whilst the smaller quantity of nibrate favoured a number of grasses

much more sluggish development, and later growth. It thus necessarily happened
at, with the conditions of greater luxuriance, we had at the same time, owing
Ãž the very characteristically different flora encouraged, greater maturation also than
Sith the conditions of less luxuriant growth, and, relatively to these, a greater supply
the constituents known to promote maturation.
