medicated and unmedicated patients are not available in the literature. This makes it difficult to
assess the effectiveness of medication and the effect of central activity in schizophrenia patients.
It was shown in many studies on medicated and non-medicated patients that the y response is
lower in SZ patients when compared with healthy subjects [51,53]. Nevertheless, it is strongly
justified, based on available literature, to conclude that the 5 excess (and to a lesser extent the
6 excess) is a strong and bona fide biological marker for schizophrenia, as well as the fact that
changes in EEG patterns are not medication-induced [54].

(d) Cardiovascular coupling

Cardiovascular coupling results based on NSTPDC analysis revealed a reduced bidirectional
coupling and a reduced coupling strength from SYS — BBI in SZ, supporting the decreased
BRS results. Due to the fact that SYS were not significantly changed in SZ, independent of
medication usage when compared with CO, it can be assumed that the primary BRS changes
in SZ were a result of impaired heart rate regulation. It was shown that during stressful
conditions such as mental stress (supposedly present in SZ), the arterial baroreflex was generally
inhibited. From the point of view that central mechanisms are involved in BRS regulation,
central sites proven to elicit the facilitation are the medial prefrontal cortex, the preoptic/anterior
hypothalamus, the ventrolateral part of the periaqueductal grey matter and the nucleus raphe
magnus [55].

(e) Central—vascular coupling

Central-vascular coupling analyses demonstrated that the coupling strength was highly
significantly reduced in SZ for the direction SYS towards central activity (Asys—.p,,,). For the
