Waker suggested that the anomalies might be due to the greater
number and amplitude of the air pulses in high winds.*

To reduce this source of trouble as much as possible the air current was altered so
that there were no pulses of any kind either from the atmosphere or from the Fleuss
pump, and the two experiments of June 24 and July 13, 1916, were carried out on the
most dilute solution. The results show a satisfactory agreement and differ but little
from previous experiments. One interesting fact requires mention. Tt was noticed

* We were unable to test this hypothesis as the only suitable records of air pulses, those of Mr. Dives,
are kept at the Meteorological Office and Sir N, SHaw would not let us have them for reference.
