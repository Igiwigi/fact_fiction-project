by Bronenrart for three distinct leaf-traces, and which, so far as the points g, g are
concerned, have been so long without having much light thrown upon their morphology
and histology. This obscurity, however, exists no longer. M. RENAULT some time
ago expressed an opinion that a difference in the form of the sections of these organs
constituted a generic distinction between Sigillaria and Lepidodendron. I long since
rejected this conclusion, and we now have proof that the form is a variable element.
The same author regarded them as gum-canals, and was of opinion that they passed
through the entire cortex—an opinion which Count Sorts is unable to accept on such
evidence as M. Renautr had then furnished (‘Fossil Botany,’ English translation,
p- 258). My specimens, now described, certainly support the Count Sorms’ conclu-
sions on each of these points. So far from the parichnoid organs supplying any
evidence of generic, much less of class, differences between Sigillaria and Lepidoden-
dron, the fact that the two genera alike possess these very remarkable and unique
structures affords a strong additional proof of their close relationship.

In fig. 87 we find that the vertical section has passed through the curious adenoid
organ at h, Had the section been made nearer to the base of the leaf, this would not
have been the case. Both the central mass and the walls of the cavity in which that
mass is lodged present the charred aspect so characteristic of this structure. We
find this organ commencing near the centre of the leaf at h of the vertical section
(fig. 33), at which point of origin its diameter is the greatest. As it proceeds out-
