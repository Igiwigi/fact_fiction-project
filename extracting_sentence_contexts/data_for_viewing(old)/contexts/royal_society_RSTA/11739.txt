netization is an affair of orientation of the molecules in space without change of
internal conformation, so that alteration of the mean state of translational motion is
involved in it, and we should expect a temperature effect. A striking and probably
just analogy is drawn by Curte between (i) the simple law of expansion of a gaseous
substance at high temperature, and the sudden change which it undergoes on lowering
the temperature beyond a critical point so that the mutual attractions of the mole-
cules come into play and produce the liquid state, and (ii) the simple law of
magnetization of a substance like iron or nickel at high temperatures, and the sudden
change which it undergoes when the temperature is lowered beyond the point at
which the material passes into its strongly magnetic or ferromagnetic condition. The
relation between paramagnetization and temperature in the former state proves to be
so simple and universal that it must be the expression of a theoretical principle. The
following considerations in fact derive it from Carnorâ€™s principle: the argument is

precise so long as the induced magnetization is so slight that the exciting magnetic

force on the separate molecules is practically that of the inducing field, but it loses

exactness as soon as, owing to diminution of energy of agitation with falling tem-

perature, the molecules begin to exercise sensible magnetic control over each other,

and thus introduce the phenomena of grouping and consequent hysteresis that are

associated with the ferromagnetic state.
