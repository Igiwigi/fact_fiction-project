FURNACE REACTIONS UNDER HIGH GASEOUS PRESSURES. 449

By referring again to Table VIIL. it will be found that this view is substantiated
by a comparison between the are and resistance experiments. In the latter the yield is always extremely low. This may be explained by the
fact that as the inner layer of mixture approaches its fusing point it flows away by
gravity, and, ceasing to transmit the current, is not maintained at the requisite
temperature for marked reduction to occur. We come now to that curious apparent contradiction of facts which has for so long
puzzled investigators in this field; namely, that though aluminium bronze and ferro-
aluminium can be so readily produced, no process exists by which the metal itself can
be obtained from the oxide, except by indirect means. What is, then, the function of
the auxiliary metal?
