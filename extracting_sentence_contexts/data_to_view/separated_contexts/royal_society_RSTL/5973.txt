quence of this difference of action upon the two branches, is that the side of the glacier

which is subjected to the augmented tension does not yield to the strain as a viscous body
| F do, but breaks. In the words of Professor ForBes, the glacier at this place
| becomes © excessively crevassed.” This fact, therefore, as far as it goes, is opposed to the
idea of viscosity as above defined. 2. The fact that the centre of a glacier moves more quickly than the sides, is that, on
which the viscous theory is chiefly based: let us examine the cireumstances connected
with this motion, availing ourselves while doing 80 both of the figure and the reasoning
of Mr. Hoykxins.
