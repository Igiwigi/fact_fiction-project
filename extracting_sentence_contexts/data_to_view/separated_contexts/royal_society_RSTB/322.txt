Such attempts to trace back variations to
g some environmental cause have often been made, and have, in general, been unsuc-
S cessful. In the case of species which have varied in isolated situations not apparently
differing from each other, the failure to find points of environmental difference has
been held to be evidence that the variations in question did not arise from such causes
at all. This appears likely, and is probably true of the variations in question ; but it
must be borne in mind that the fact that no palpable difference can be found between
the conditions in the several localities is no proof that they do not exist. While
these differences in condition are usually evasive and hard to detect, it is best to begin
to investigate their relation to variations in animals by selecting cases in which the
change in conditions is unequivocal, and proceed from this starting point to seek for
correlated variation in the forms of life subjected to them. It appears that a particularly favourable opportunity for investigating this question
