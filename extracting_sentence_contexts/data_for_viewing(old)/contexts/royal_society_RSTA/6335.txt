In order for this mechanism to hold, however, there are two minimum requirements. The first is
that LSW is consistently exported from its formation regions, i.e. that variability in LSW formation
makes it out of the Labrador Sea. The second is that spreading in the DWBC is coherent enough
that LSW property anomalies are preserved as they move southward. Both of these steps continue
to be debated in the scientific literature, and both are fundamental to our understanding of LSW
spreading, regardless of the links with AMOC variability.

In this paper, I present the current state of observational evidence for the southward spreading
of LSW anomalies in the DWBC structured around these two requirements. First, I review recent
advances in our understanding of how LSW is exported into the DWBC from its formation regions
(§2). In this section, I also reconcile the fact that decadal variability in LSW formation is reflected in
the Labrador Sea’s DWBC with the fact that LSW formation does not impact subpolar overturning
strength. I then synthesize the literature on LSW spreading into the subtropical North Atlantic
and suggest that water mass anomaly tracking, anthropogenic tracers and Lagrangian studies
generally agree on LSW transit times in the DWBC (§3). Finally, I discuss the connections between
LSW spreading and the AMOC, which remain uncertain (§4), and end with a final synthesis and
outlook (§5).

2. Labrador Sea Water export from formation regions

LSW forms from the Labrador Sea to the Irminger Sea [21-24]. LSW formed by convection in the
basin interiors is sometimes referred to as ‘deep’ LSW (dLSW) to distinguish it from ‘upper’ LSW
(uLSW), which forms within or near the western boundary current of the Labrador Sea [25]. Some
papers argue that uLSW can be formed in the central Labrador Sea under weak forcing [26-29],
