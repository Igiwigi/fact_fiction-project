pair of wedges when otherwise combined, which fully eg-
tablishes the identity of the method here proposed with his.
If the two wedges be placed with their edges together, so as
to form by their union a wedge of 4o*, the consequence is, that
though a pencil of light is in fact divided into two parts by
the first wedge, both parts in the end emerge together; the
refraction of one being o + e, and of the other e + 0: they
both deviate from their original direction by exactly the same
quantity, and present only a single image of the luminous
object ; but it is coloured, as usual, in proportion to the amount
of deviation occasioned by the sum of the wedges.” This,
without doubt, is the first of two opposite directions mentioned
by M. Rocuon, in which he says the double refraction was
not perceptible.
