reduced. They showed by analysis of the alveolar air and various control experiments
that the onset of each period of breathing is due, not simply to rise of the alveolar
CO, pressure, but to diminished alveolar oxygen pressure in addition; and that the
cessation of each period depends similarly on rise in the alyeolar oxygen pressure. Henperson has further shown that there are variations in the gas content of the
arterial blood which correspond with this conclusion.* Want of oxygen is thus a
necessary condition to the production of the periodic breathing, which is essentially
due to the fact that the excitation, in so far as produced by the want of oxygen,
occurs very rapidly and ceases very rapidly. The centre thus responds like an engine
provided with a very sensitive governor but no fly-wheel, and thus acts periodically. The normal stimulus of CO, pez se, on the other hand, acts and ceases much more
gradually, with the consequence that normal breathing is quite regular, like the
working of an engine with a heavy fly-wheel.
