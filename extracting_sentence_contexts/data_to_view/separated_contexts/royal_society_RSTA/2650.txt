Civil engineering applications include the monitoring of the inside of blast furnaces [21],
the monitoring of historical buildings [22], large structures like bridges and wind turbines and
potentially also structures at oil rigs. Civil engineering is by far the largest potential market for
commercial muography, but it is so far also the least explored field. This may have to do with the
fact that this is typically a field that is more used to industry-led innovation, while the applications
in nuclear safety and security and in volcanology are typically publicly funded. Most research in
muography is still being carried out in the context of university research and national laboratories,
and these are more likely to look for applications for which public funding is available. Probably the best-known application of muography concerns the Pyramids in Egypt.
