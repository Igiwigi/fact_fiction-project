Transiently, during Edge Localized Modes, the
heat loads can reach levels of a few GW m~? during pulses of typically 0.5-1 ms. Plasma-facing
components need to withstand these heat loads for a sufficiently long time to avoid too frequent
shutdowns to replace them. DEMO will feature much longer pulses, while it has much thinner
walls than ITER (which comes from the fact that the neutrons should not lose their energy in
the wall, but in the breeding blanket behind it) and therefore it is necessary to develop highly
radiative plasmas for DEMO in which most of the outgoing energy is uniformly radiated from
the plasma edge. Mission 2 of the European Roadmap is based on three pillars:

(1) Develop routine and robust control systems for plasma detachment in a conventional
divertor geometry;

(2) Develop, improve and test new divertor materials and plasma facing components;

(3) Test alternative magnetic geometries to spread the plasma heat load over a larger surface
of the divertor. JET and the three medium-sized tokamaks ASDEX Upgrade, TCV and MAST-Upgerade are being
used to test divertor detachment as well as alternative divertor geometries.
