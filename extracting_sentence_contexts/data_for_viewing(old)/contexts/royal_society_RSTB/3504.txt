Paleura, and Bohemura may be quoted. They are further characterised by the
large number of ambulacral ossicles which bound the oral angles and by the absence
of fusion with one another in a longitudinal series of these ossicles. For the forms
with alternating ambulacral ossicles Grecory (9) proposed the order Lysophiuree.
We were at first inclined to retain it as a division of the Protophiuroidea, referring
the remaining members of the sub-order to a division Synophiure characterised by
opposite ambulacral ossicles. But the state of knowledge at the present time hardly
permits of this. For while it is certainly clear from JarKet’s work (11, see, for
instance, his figs. 1 and 6) that in some of the simplest genera the ambulacral
ossicles were not opposite, it is also certain that free opposite ambulacral ossicles
are easily displaced either during life or after death, and it is difficult in some
cases to be sure whether alternation is natural or due to displacement, We
therefore think it wisest for the time merely to recognise the fact that there
has been a progression within the Protophiuroidea from forms with free,
partly alternating, ambulacral ossicles, on the one hand to forms with completely
alternate ambulacral ossicles, and on the other to those in which these ossicles
are opposite, at first free, afterwards having slight connections, and increasing
in vertical extent, and that in both groups the buccal armature has advanced in
complexity.

Through the kindness of Prof. T. McKenny Huaues we have had an opportunity
of examining Fores’ Protaster sedgwicki, the type specimens of which are in the
Sedgwick Museum. This ‘species, together with a new species found by Dr. Groom
in the Middle Ordovician beds of Shropshire, for which we propose the name Protaster
groomi, and the little P. leptosoma which we rename Rhodostoma leptosoma, form
