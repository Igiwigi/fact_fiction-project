Y =k. The ring system also has an equilibrium, stable or unstable, with each X, equal to h
and each Y, equal to k. Assuming that the system is not very far from this equilibrium it is
convenient to put X, =+x,, Y,=k+y,. One may also write ax+by for f(h-+x,y +k) and
cx+-dy for g(h+x,y+k). Since f(h,k) = g(h,k) = 0 no constant terms are required, and
since x and y are supposed small the terms in higher powers of x and y will have relatively
little effect and one is justisfied in ignoring them. The four quantities a, b, c, dmay be called
the ‘marginal reaction rates’. Collectively they may be described as the ‘marginal reaction

rate matrix’. When there are M morphogens this matrix consists of M? numbers. A marginal

* reaction rate has the dimensions of the reciprocal of a time, like a radioactive decay rate,

which is in fact an example of a marginal (nuclear) reaction rate.

With these assumptions the equations can be rewritten as
dx,
ry > ax, + by, + K(X 41 —2x,+%,_1),
