'= 0°18317e,°
so that his value of 4° as deduced from my calculations ought to be
k? = 0'8441 (14+0°15777e,’). In point of fact the value actually given by Darwin was
Kk? = 0'°8441 (14 0°157786e,.). It appears, then, that DArw1n’s moment of momentum agrees exactly with mine,
as it ought, except for the difference introduced by the different values we have taken
for vn”.
