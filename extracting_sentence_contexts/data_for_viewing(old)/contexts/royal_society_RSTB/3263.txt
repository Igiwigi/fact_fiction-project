longer shown when active transpiration begins and air appears in the vessels.
Horvarut observed that of two branches of a vine 70 centims, apart, one showed
a pressure of +46 centims. of mercury, the other one of —20 centims. In this case
the stem between the two branches must have been blocked, for a pressure of
20 centims. will drive water through 70 centims. of a freshly-cut vine stem at
a sufficiently rapid rate to prevent the production and maintenance of any such
differences of pressure as recorded by Horvaru. In any case, as HormEister§ was
the first to show, the root-pressure alone yields less sap than is needed for active
transpiration, and a positive pressure is in the latter case always absent.

VeEsQuz| was the first to observe the waxing and waning of the air-bubbles in the
vessels according to the relative gain or loss of water by the stem, and he concluded,
in fact, that the main function of the vessels is to act as reservoirs for water, and
that they conduct only under special conditions. He also erroneously concluded
that the resistance to a given velocity of flow is proportional, ceteris paribus, to the
fourth power of the radius, whereas it is proportional to the square of the radius and
the volume passing to the fourth power. In any case, the bubbles in the vessels
always appear under a pressure of less than an atmosphere, and hence arises the fact,
as shown by Von Hounet, that, when actively transpiring branches are cut under
mercury, the latter is usually drawn up into the vessels in spite of its capillary
depression. The latter is given by Von H6uNEL' as— '
