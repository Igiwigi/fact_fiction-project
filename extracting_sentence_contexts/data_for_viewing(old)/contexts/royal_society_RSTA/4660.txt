can be investigated when it attempts a turn at a given steering angle.

Figure 7 shows a one-parameter bifurcation diagram in 6 and corresponding aircraft ground
tracks that illustrate the overall complexity of possible ground dynamics of a single-aisle aircraft;
this diagram is far from the normal operating envelope of the aircraft, but does provide interesting
insights into the possible observed behaviours and transitions between them due to a high
thrust setting. In the one-parameter bifurcation diagram, there are four separate stable parts of
equilibrium branches, as well as a branch of oscillations that is bounded by two points of Hopf
bifurcation (indicated by circles in the figure).

The stable section (a) of the equilibrium branch represents circular trajectories of the aircraft,
where the radius of the circle decreases as the steering angle is increased. The saddle-node
bifurcation at 5 * 28Â° marks the loss of stability of the turn. In fact, as indicated by (b), for
a steering angle 6 past this point, the aircraft loses control without warning. Analysis of the
state variables reveals that the tyres of the inner main gear saturate and the load is shifted
to the outer main gear. The tyres of the outer main gear then saturate with an accompanying
load redistribution to the nose and inner gears. The trajectory of the steering angle versus the
forward velocity, past the saddle-node bifurcation point, also determines the final behaviour.
For sufficiently large forward velocity, the aircraft may settle into a forward equilibrium (after
a momentary LOC), but otherwise it may actually end up performing more complex motion, as
depicted in figure 7b.

The stable branch (c) also represents circular trajectories of the aircraft but, compared with
solutions on branch (a), the radius is much smaller. In other words, for the same steering angle
and thrust settings, there are two different simultaneously stable turns with a hysteresis loop
