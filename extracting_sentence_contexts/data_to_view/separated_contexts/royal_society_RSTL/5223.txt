In the six months referred
to, in which the aurora was recorded at 1079 hours, only 272 of the contemporaneous
observations were, in this sense, © disturbed,” and 807 were not 80; 7. e. 272 out of 1079,
only about, one-fourth of the observations made during the recorded presence of the
Aurora, differed as much as 2286 from the normal at the same hour and in the same
nth. & Of the fact, that the aggregate amount of disturbance at Point Barrow, when compared
Sth Toronto, greatly exceeds the calculation founded on the inverse proportion of the
IÞrizontal force at the two stations, there can be no reasonable doubt. To what is this
Gsproportion owing? Is it, as 80me may suppose, that Point Barrow is situated nearer
Zan Toronto to the locality where the greatest intensity of disturbance is manifested !
