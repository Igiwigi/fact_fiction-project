Ao values, ranging between 0.05 and 0.25 and between 0 and 0.6, respectively, depending on
Aprobe: As the anisotropy value does not depend of the probe step, the variation of the 62, B4
and B56 parameters indicates a CH3 photofragment polarization effect-alignment, because linear
polarized light has been used.

Figures 5 and 6 prove that fragment polarization effects can be observed using NRMPI
detection. In REMPI transitions, a virtual intermediate state is degenerate with a real atomic or
molecular level, increasing the probability of absorption of another photon, because real states are
much longer-lived than virtual states. Except for that, virtual states do not differ essentially from
resonant real states. In fact, non-resonant detection constitutes a generalization of the exceptions
excluded by Mo and Suzuki in their treatment. For a non-resonant two-photon dipole transition as
a previous step in an ionization process, the virtual states accessed by both photons are not unique
and the intensity must be calculated taking into account all possible paths with different magnetic
quantum numbers. The mathematical approach for the photofragment polarization analysis
should be based, therefore, on the work of KSZ. To be able to extract useful information from
the 6; parameters, however, any treatment which considers the multiple pathways with different
magnetic numbers that can take the neutral photofragment above the ionization continuum, is
needed.
