497-549) Mr. Rictarpson suggests
that the effect of hydrogen on the negative leak which I have observed can be
explained on his theory by supposing that the hydrogen diminishes Q while A
remains constant. But, as we have just seen, the fact that the leak is proportional to
p shows that Q is constant and A proportional to p. When p is greater than about
02 millim. it is found that Q does diminish as p increases, but A does not remain
â€œtonstant.
