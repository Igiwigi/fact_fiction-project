Uranium, as well as radium, gives off two types of radiation, one much more
penetrating than the other. (See Rurserrorp, ‘Phil. Mag., January, 1899.)
BecquerEt has shown (‘Comptes Rendus,’ vol. 130, p. 1583) that some at least of
the uranium rays are deflected by the magnet, but he does not seem to have made
any experiments to decide whether both types are so, or only ‘one. In fact, the
radiation is so feeble as to make such experiments very difficult. But it seems
probable that, as in the case of radium, the penetrating type of rays are deflected,
while the others are not so.

My experiments were exclusively concerned with the rays from the bare compound,
which consist for the most part of the easily absorbed type. Only a small fraction of
the total conductivity is due to the other kind, so small, in fact, as to make any
determination of the conductivities difficult, unless some more powerful preparation
than mine were available. The experiments were accordingly confined to the easily
absorbed type of radiation.

§ 3. Method of Experimenting.

The gas of which the conductivity was to be determined occupied the space
between two parallel plate electrodes. One of these was maintained at a high
potential, the other connected to the one pair of quadrants of an electrometer, the
other pair being to earth. The rate of movement of the needle then gave a measure
of the current through the gas.
