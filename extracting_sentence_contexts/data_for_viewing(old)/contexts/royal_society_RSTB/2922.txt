element, which may cause intravascular clotting in the portal system and in small
animals throughout the body. This primary fall of pressure is similar to those always
produced by Viperine poisons, and may be greatly lessened by heating the venom
to 90° C. for a short time. In the case of Cobra and Krait venoms also slight primary
falls of blood pressure are met with, which may possibly also be due to very minute
amounts of the Viperine element in these venoms. It is only in the case of Bungarus
fasciatus that this primary fall of pressure is of much importance.

The Relative Antidotal powers of Antivenin (Catmerte’s), prepared mainly by the
injection of Cobra Venom, against the Poisons of the Hydrophide and Indian
Colubrine Snakes.

The facts recorded in the first part of this paper, and in a previous one (1), show
that the physiological action of the Hydrophide, the Hamadriad and the Krait, as
well as the most important element in the venom of the Banded Krait (Bungarus
fasciatus), are all similar to that of the Cobra. Further, we have in CaLmerre’s
antivenin an efficient antidote to the venom of the Cobra when it is given in
sufficient doses, this serum being obtained from horses which have been actively
immunised to a very high degree by frequent injections of a mixture of venoms
which is mainly composed of Cobra poison. It becomes, then, a matter of great
practical importance to ascertain whether CauMErtr’s antivenin is efficient against the
other venoms mentioned, and if so, in what doses it must be used for curative
purposes. Through the kindness of M. Catmerre in placing at my disposal the
necessary serum, I have been able to make a series of experiments on this point with
results of some interest. The method adopted was that recommended by
