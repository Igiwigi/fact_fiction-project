If the
insolation-vessel be removed from the apparatus for merely a few moments, a saturation
lasting from two to six days is necessary before the maximum degree of sensibility is
again reached. The amount of foreign gas which is sufficient to render the indications
of the instrument incorrect, cannot approach to a billionth part of the total yolume of
gas. We hall have occasion to return to this remarkable fact in a later part of the
research ; but we may here remark, that when the maximum action has been reached,
the explosive nature of the gas is 80 great, that a thin glass bulb of the size of a pigeon's
egg filled with the gas, immediately explodes on exposure to the diffuse light of an over-
clouded sky at an open window. On taking the apparatus to pieces, portions of the gas
have several times exploded on exposure to evening light, even after the 8un had disap-
peared below the horizon. Having thus determined the conditions which must be fulfilled in order to obtain
comparative results, we proceed to the examination of the influence which the heat
radiated from the source of light, and the heat of combustion evolved by the combina-
tion of the gases, exert upon the indications of the instrument.
