Group size estimates
were not plotted because they were estimated differently for different species (see the electronic supplementary material, table S1 and main text). Time period estimates
are reported relative to the evening time period. MSG stands for mixed-species groups and SSG stands for single-species groups; these variables refer to measures of the
social environment, i.e. the number of groups of different types observed in each timesite. ‘Other’ for conspecific groups refers to the fact that the focal group was not
counted when quantifying the social environment (see main text). n = 499-15 884 groups per species. Least-squares means were computed in the package ‘emmeans’ About 70% (30016 out of 43 457) of groups were in timesites
[88]. We report Bonferroni-corrected p-values. that contained at least one other group; about 42% (18 245
out of 43457) were in timesites that contained at least one
lone individual.
