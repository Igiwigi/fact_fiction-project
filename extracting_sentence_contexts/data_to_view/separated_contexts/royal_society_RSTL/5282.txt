By com-
bining the mean of the three days' observations of next greater and three days of less
pressure with that nearest to the mean pressure for the whole period, we find the
resu]t corresponds nearly with the mean pressure, and the ratio between the ex-
tremes almost equal; thus, on December 11, the mean pressure was 29-879, differing
very little from the mean of the whole period ; and the three days' observations above
and below combined with it, give a mean of 29867, the corresponding mean level
of the seven days being 21 ft. 0:16 in., which 80 closely approaches that of the whole
period, that they may be deemed identical, and would tend to show that the effect
from the greatest to the mean pressure, and from the mean to the least pressure, is in
strict progression. It is not possible, however, from 80 limited a number of obser-
vations, to determine this point with certainty, or to attempt any intermediate infer-
ences. We have, from these observarions, been able to deduce results which plainly
point to the law which governs the effect of the pressure of the atmosphere on the

mean leyel of the ocean, and may be encouraged to pursue the investigation through
a more extended series of observations, in order that we may at length arrive at the
most accurate conclusion that the observed facts may justify. For all practical purposes, it may in the mean time be well to assume, what the
preceding obseryations seem to indicate, that the ocean is a water barometer on a
vast scale of magnificence, and that the level of its surface is disturbed by every
variation of atmospheric pressnre, inversely as the mercury in the barometer, and
exactly in the ratio of the relative specific gravities of the water and the mercury. And as all obserrations of the tides, before they can be safely employed to investigate
the laws by which they are governed, should in the first place be corrected for the
large and hitherto mysterious irregularities which the variations in the pressure of
the atmosphere produce, the following formula may be used to determine the correc-
tion z to be applied to all observations of the height of the tide, or the mean level of
the ocean deduced from them, to reduce them to the mean pressure of the atmosphere.
