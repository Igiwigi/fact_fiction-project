current through the interior one, I heard a remarkably intense sound. In the
reyerse case, the sound existed, but was much weaker. This fact is evidently con-
nected with the known property of helices trayersed by electric currents exercising
scarcely any magnetic influence exteriorly, whilst in the interior this action is yery
energetic. Metals and solid bodies are not the only substances which produce the phenomena
I have just described ; all conducting bodies, whatever may be their state or their
nature, appear to be capable of producing them. Thus, I have observed them with
pieces of charcoal of all kinds and shape.
