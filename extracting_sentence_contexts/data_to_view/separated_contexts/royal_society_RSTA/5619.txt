Thus, in Denmark, the data reliably describe travel behaviour, revealing that,
during lockdown, people would travel mostly for leisure (e.g. walks, jogs and trips to weekend
travel destinations). This observation is in line with the fact that, in Denmark, visits to parks
increased during periods of lockdown according to mobility data made available by the Google
Mobility Reports [31]. Denmark, in fact, experienced less stringent travel restrictions compared to
the other European countries under study: ‘stay-at-home’ orders were never applied, and travel
between different cities and regions remained always allowed [14]. Despite the surge in visits to
parks and the increase of weekend-like mobility patterns during the first Danish lockdown, the
containment strategies were effective. This results suggest that the correlations between mobility
and social behaviour are non-trivial, implying that containment strategies aiming at reducing
mobility do not necessarily target social behaviour.
