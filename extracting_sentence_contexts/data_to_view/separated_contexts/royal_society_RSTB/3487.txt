They remain like this all night,
except that a certain number of them undergo division. The time at which this
takes place varies, but it is generally in full swing at about 10 P.M., and is usually
over by one or two the next morning. It may here be remarked as an interesting fact
that if a portion of this non-motile scum is placed at any time during the night in
a good light, such as that from an incandescent gas mantle concentrated by a
condenser, the organisms in a very short time become motile again, and any divisions
which have begun are finished whilst the organism is in this motile condition. So
also, under these conditions, motile cells may start dividing and go through the
whole process of division in the motile stage. AGGREGATION OF EUGLENA VIRIDIS, EHRB., AND OTHER MICRO-ORGANISMS. 337

As soon as it becomes sufficiently light the next morning, the Euglenze begin to
pass into the motile condition again, and are seen moving towards the source of light
and begin to accumulate in a dense green mass on that side of the saucer nearest
the light. :

Sometimes from this dense mass a number of streams will be observed to pass
downwards into the deeper shaded regions below, from which they ascend again to
the surface and once more move towards the light.
