The computations become more and more laborious as n# increases. It was decided
therefore to make a limited use of extrapolation. This might at first appear a somewhat
dubious operation, but in fact it is fully justifiable. Thus in the relevant region, at the
extreme right of the tables, .¥ (nt, n*,/) varies remarkably slowly along a row. In addition,
it was possible to lock the extrapolated columns at a number of points by evaluating the
function at integral values of both n#., and n¥ using a formula due to Gordon (1929), who
showed that for such values of n#_, and n#
