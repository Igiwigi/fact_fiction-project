greater rise in temperature between the thermometers in the small than in the large
flow. The effect of this dip in temperature is to cause the mean temperature of the
gas between the heating coil and the thermometer H to be below that of the jacket
by an amount which is greater in the small than in the large flow. The distance
from the centre of the thermometer K to the centre of the heating coil was 5 em.,
and the distance fiom the centre of the heating coil to the centre of the thermometer
H was 8 em., so that the alteration in the rise in temperature between the heating
coil and this thermometer in the two flows was 0째034x8/13째 C. approximately.
Thus, if we assume that by the time the gas had reached H it had reattained the
temperature of the jacket, we see that the excess of the temperature of the jacket
over the mean temperature of the gas between the heating coil and H was approxi-
mately 4 (0째084) (8/13), or 001째 C. greater in the small than in the large flow. This
fact would tend to minimise the heat loss which took place when the gas became
heated by the electric current, the effect: being greater in the small than in the large

* This correction is given more accurately on p. 229.

+ The corrections thus affect the specific heat to a larger extent than that to which they affect the
linear relationship between CE/8@ and the flow. The explanation of this is, that whether we take account
of the corrections under consideration or not, a straight line fairly accurately represents the relation
between CE/80 and the flow. The slope of the straight line is, however, different in the two cases.
