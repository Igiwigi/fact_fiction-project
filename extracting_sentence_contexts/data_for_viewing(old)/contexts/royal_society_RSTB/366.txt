Introductory.

THE present investigation grew out of the enquiry into the colour-relation between
Lepidopterous larve and their food-plants. In the search for the larval sense-organ
which is affected by the light reflected from surrounding surfaces, great difficulty was
experienced from the fact that the influences work slowly through the whole of larval
life. Thus the ocelli must be eliminated by blinding five times in the life of each
caterpillar, and there is always the chance of the skin being thrown off a little earlier
than usual, in which case the success of the whole experiment might be endangered,
for the coverings of the eyes are changed with the rest of the skin, It seemed
probable that in the pupal colour-relation the influence must act during a short and
rigidly limited time, in which experiments could be conducted with much hope of a
successful isolation of the effective sense-organs.
