Since the days when Harvey first demonstrated the function of valves in blood
vessels, anatomists have taken the existence of a valve in a blood vessel as proof that blood
moves through the valve in one direction, that direction being determined by the arrange-
ment of the flap or flaps of the valve. The paired flaps of the rostral valve of Lithotrya are
so arranged that the blood can pass between them down into the peduncle, but not in the
reverse direction. I therefore take it from this fact alone that the blood, squeezed out of
the blood pump, does pass down the peduncle. However, from the anatomy I have described, it is clear that there is no structural
hindrance to the blood passing out of the blood pump into the prosoma (figures 4 and 12,
and see also later, p. 121). There is no valve such as described by Nussbaum (1890, p. 44).
