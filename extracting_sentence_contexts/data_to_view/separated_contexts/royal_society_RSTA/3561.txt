Table 1 provides a list of 28 molecules
(other than H20) identified in comets and the range of measured abundances relative to water
(see figure 2 for the number of comets in which each molecule has been detected). The wavelength
domains, where the molecular signatures are observed, are indicated in table 1. This list includes
CS, SO and NS, which are in fact radicals. CS and SO are photo-dissociation products of CS
and SOy, respectively. However, direct release of SO from the nuclear ices is suggested from the
ROSINA data [16].
