An increase of the mesh density may be achieved by node (or cell) movement or
by increasing (and decreasing) the number of cells in time and space. The former is
fairly restrictive because one has to know a priori the requirements of the flow, so
it is better suited for steady-state flows. In fact, one of the first attempts for mesh
adaptation was by mesh stretching (effectively a node movement to produce static
refinement) to cover the boundary layer of a wing. For most applications, this is
a very inefficient way to increase resolution, because the stretching generates
very high aspect ratio cells away from the part of the domain that needs to be
better resolved. Research in mesh adaptation has gone a long way since the days of
mesh stretching and sophisticated approaches exist for both structured and
unstructured cell shapes; a very good representation of the various approaches
may, of course, be found in this issue.
