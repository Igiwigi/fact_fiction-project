It was seen that the strata could be divided into four main lithological types, sandstones,
shales, fireclays and ironstones, though the limits of the groups were somewhat arbitrarily
defined. Table 4 gives for each locality the average value of the susceptibilities of samples of
the different rock types, and figure 1 gives frequency diagrams of values of susceptibilities for
two rock types. There is reasonably good agreement between the averages for corresponding

rock types at all localities. This fact suggests that a representative sample of the strata has
been taken, and that these averages can be used in computing the magnetic effects of the
whole Coal Measure succession in the various localities without introducing serious errors.
No systematic lateral or vertical distribution of susceptibility was observed in any area.
