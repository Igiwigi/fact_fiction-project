When we consider the remainder, considerable difficulty arises owing to the
number of ill-defined lines so close together. In some cases K.H. and 8. give very
discordant readings for doublets, which yet are so close that they look as if the
measurements might refer to the same lines, whilst in other cases the same observers
agree much more closely. It is to be remembered that apparently the method of
illumination has a great deal to do with the development of some of these lines in
the spectraâ€”in fact, they appear to come from different sheaths of the flame or are, as
if it were a question of temperature. The doublet at 5675 was observed by K.R.,
and was the only observation of theirs which did not fit in with the ordinary series. It is peculiar in being diffuse towards the violet.
