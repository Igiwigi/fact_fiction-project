C. Section of the Posterior Column of the Opposite Side to the Nerve Excited. In these experiments we are for the first time confronted with the remarkable fact
that in consequence of an intervening section the stimulation of the nerve is some-
times followed by an increased effect. (See also Chapter VITL, Section 9, B., p. 395.)
Since the section has cut off at least some channels of communication between the
lower and upper parts of the cord, and presumably, therefore, has blocked the paths
of some, even though few, nerve impulses, such a rise must be attributed to the
greater intensity of the effect evoked in the remaining channels, whether nerve fibres
or nerve cells, and the cord must therefore be considered to be hyperexcitable. This alteration in excitability is probably associated with the phenomenon of hyper-
sthesia observed by Foprra and Scuirr to follow operative interfence with the

posterior columns. That it affects the cord on the side of the lesion is probable from
the results just given, but the direct proof is wanting since the increased intensity of
the effect is masked by the large diminution caused by the severance of the direct
tract in the posterior column of the same side.
