2. Duality of Diamagnetic Excitement. Having thus safely established the fact, that diamagnetic bodies are repelled, in
virtue of a certain state into which they are cast by the influencing magnet, the
next step of our inquiry is ;â€”Will the state evoked by one magnetic pole facilitate,
or prevent, the repulsion of the diamagnetic body by a second pole of an opposite
quality? If the force of repulsion were an action on the mass, considered as ordinary
matter, this mass, being repelled by both the north and the south pole of a magnet,
when they operate upon it separately, ought to be repelled by the sum of the forces
of the two poles where they act upon it together. But if the excitation of diamag-
netic bodies be of a dual nature, as is the case with magnetic bodies, then it may be
expected, that the state excited by one pole will not facilitate, but on the contrary
prevent, the repulsion of the mass by a second opposite pole.
