While intrinsic postzygotic barriers were an initial
focus of speciation research [1-4], recent work has highlighted the importance
of ecology in reproductive isolation, namely prezygotic and extrinsic postzygo-
tic barriers [5-8]. This wave of ecology-focused speciation work, paired with the
observation that prezygotic barriers tend to reach completion before intrinsic
postzygotic barriers (e.g. [9,10]), has led to the prevalent opinion that prezygo-
tic barriers play a more important role in speciation than intrinsic postzygotic
barriers, particularly early on [11-15]. Yet, the fact that intrinsic postzygotic bar-
riers are common across all kingdoms of life, and are a hallmark of most ‘good’
species [16] suggests that their role in speciation may also be essential. Here, we highlight the contribution of intrinsic postzygotic barriers to spe-
ciation and explore how this contribution may change as speciation proceeds. While speciation is a continuous process, we refer to early and late stages
based on the degree of reproductive isolation between species, while acknowl-
edging that reproductive isolation is not unidirectional and can be accumulated
or lost (figure 1).
