1. The cytology of certain genera of the Aloine—Aloé, Gasteria, Haworthia and
Apicra—torms the subject of this communication. The plants are xerophytic, occurring
mainly in South Africa. All the genera are examples of a very uniform “ growth form.”

2. The occurrence of constrictions is a constant feature of the chromosomes of the
Aloinw. ‘These constrictions are generally obscured during heterotypic metaphase,
but they have been observed in late prophase, in anaphase and telophase, of the hetero-
typic division, and during the homotypic division, as well as in the chromosomes of
somatic nuclei.

It is suggested that the obscuring of the constriction at heterotypic metaphase is
due to the fact that the chromosomes reach their maximum condensation at this stage.
The point of attachment of the spindle fibres is at the constricted portion of the
chromosomes. The constrictions are subterminal, but the distance from the end of the
chromosome is not constant for all the chromosomes in a nucleus; the length of the
arm beyond the constriction is always greater in at least one of the large chromosomes
of a set than in the other three.

It is suggested that a detailed study of the prophase of meiosis in a species with
well-marked constrictions would give further evidence concerning the orientation of
the bivalent chromosomes in the spireme. From the present research a telosynaptic
arrangement of the univalents is strongly suggested.

3. The haploid number of chromosomes in all genera of the Aloine is seven—with
