While there are several other main constraints on the evo-
lution of behaviour (see §4), this particular one is central to understanding
behavioural adaptations. Its importance derives from the fact that animals
typically first respond behaviourally to changes and challenges in their environ-
ment, whereas adaptations of their morphology, physiology and life history
take much longer [5]; indeed, tests of an influential concept in behavioural ecol-
ogy demonstrated that mobile animals respond quickly, often in an ideal-free
manner, to variation in resources, predators and competitors [6]. In fact, maxi-
mal behavioural flexibility might be generally advantageous in various natural
situations [7,8], including adaptations to climate change [9]. Thus, as has long
