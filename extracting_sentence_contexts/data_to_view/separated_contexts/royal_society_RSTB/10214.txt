Surprisingly, activation of P2X7R upregulation of P2Y4Rs one week after SCI, suggesting that
in NPCs causes cell death in the absence of pore formation the panel of expression of P2YRs may play a critical role in
[35]. These observations might have opposite outcomes fol- the modulation of neural progenitor cell expansion [39]. Acti-
lowing pathological events: in fact, high levels of vated ECs generate a high number of neurospheres and give
extracellular ATP in inflammatory CNS lesions may delay rise to astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and, under some con-

the successful graft of newborn NPCs and therefore impair ditions, motoneurons when exposed to differentiating agents


in vitro [42]. However, fate-mapping analysis of ECs following
SCI in vivo revealed generation of astrocytes and oligodendro-
cytes only [43] (see also ยง3). Although no generation of new
neurons has been observed, acute transplantation of undiffer-
entiated ECs fully reverted the pathological increase in
P2X4Rs and P2X7Rs observed after SCI and led to a partial
recovery of locomotor activity [39], thus suggesting a possible
bystander role played by ECs.
