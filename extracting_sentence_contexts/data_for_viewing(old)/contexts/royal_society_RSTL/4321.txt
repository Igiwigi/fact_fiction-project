Phil. Trans. 1833, p. 224. Tonquin.—One tide in twenty-four hours.

Phil. Trans. 1837, Part I. p. 78. Sincapore.—A very large diurnal inequality,
high water heights, diurnal inequaiity = 14 ft. Low water heights, diurnal inequa-
lity = 6 ft.

The age of the diurnal inequality is a day and a quarter.

This very large diurnal inequality in the low water heights of Sincapore was, 80
far as I know, a new fact, when it was thus extracted from the observations, and was
probably looked upon by most persons as a singular case. There is however good
reason to believe that the same fact extends oyer the whole of the sea in that region.
At least I have the means of showing that it prevails on the north coast of Australia,
namely, at Port Essington.

51. Pore Es81ncrox.—I am supplied with a considerable series of observations,
somewhat interrupted, made by Sir Gorpon Bremer, of which I have thrown five
8emilunations into curves. The observations indicate a diurnal inequality in the
bigh water heights, but not very regularly. But at low water there is a diurnal in-
equality, of which the magnitude is not less than four feet, and this appears to be
regular. The observations however are not exact enongh to determine the age of
this diurnal inequality.

I will add, as apparently connected with this, a reference to the peculiarities of the
