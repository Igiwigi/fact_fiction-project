I now proceed to treat of the development of electricity in muscles during
contraction. Before entering more fully on this subject, I think it advisable to describe 8ome new
researches on muscular electricity. Two methods have been hitherto followed in order
to arrive at a rigorous demonstration of the principal facts and laws of muscular electri-
city. In one of these methods the muscular elements are united in form of a pile, and
the intensity of the muscular current increases with the number of muscular elements
of the pile: this fact 8uffices to exclude any doubt of the existence of electromotive power
which might be generated by the platinum plates of the galvanometer, or by the liquid,
in which the pieces of muscle forming the outer elements of the pile are plunged. This
doubt is also excluded by employing the nerve of the galvanoscopic frog instead of a
galyanometer.
