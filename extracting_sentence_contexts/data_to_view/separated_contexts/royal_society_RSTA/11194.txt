that solids in general conduct heat better than liquids, and liquids better than gases,
we are led to conjecture that a given substance will, as its temperature is increased,
decrease in conductivity, and that the decrease will continue during any change of
state which the substance may undergo, owing to the increase in temperature. ‘The
