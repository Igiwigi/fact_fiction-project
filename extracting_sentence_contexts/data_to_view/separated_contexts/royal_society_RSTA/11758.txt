Pesents itself as an alternative to a differential equation, In such a case the integral equation will, of
mrse, relate to the second singular solution, for it contains no arbitrary constant. Considered geometrically, the second singular solution thus arising will be enveloped by the complete

E = 0), although it may not be a singular solution of the differential equations (V1.). A proper change in the forms of the arbitrary constants would reduce this case to the ordinary one.
