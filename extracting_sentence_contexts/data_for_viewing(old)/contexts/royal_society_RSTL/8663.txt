wx reaction on the right side (almost complete).
S As regards the loss of tactile sensibility, we have again the apparent connexion of
S this with destruction of the hippocampal region.
= On both sides the subiculum cornu ammonis was broken down, and on both sides
= there was absence of any reaction indicating olfactory sensation.
= A peculiarity, however, existed in the comparative reaction of each nostril to the
S effect, of acetic acid. In the left nostril, 7. e. the side on which tactile sensibility
2 remained, acetic acid caused a copious flow of tears fron the left eye, while in the right
Z nostril no effect of any kind was produced. This is evidently to be ascribed to the
S abolition of common sensibility as well as of true 8mell from the right nostril. The
Zlacrymation was the indication of the reflex excitation of the lacrymal gland through
> the medium of tactile sensibility, which till continued unimpaired on the left side.
Z The absence of motor reaction, however, was an interesting fact, and serves to show how
Â£2 much of the reaction caused by a pungent vapour applied to the nostril is dependent
HZ on the integrity of true olfactory sensibility.
E As regards taste, the results indicated its entire abolition. But not only taste, as
E 8uch, but also the tactile sensibility of the tongue seemed to have been destroyed.
= This was noted as a remarkable phenomenon, and the tests were frequently repeated in
SZ order that no fallacy might be allowed to remain. Not only on the right side of the
< tongue, but also on the left, was this absence of reaction noted. The centres for the
Z tactile sensibility of the tongue on the left side seemed to have been destroyed along
Q with those of special sense, a fact apparently indicating their close anatomical relation
in the hemisphere. The following experiments serve to narrow the boundaries of the
lesions causing these various results as regards hearing and tactile sensation.
