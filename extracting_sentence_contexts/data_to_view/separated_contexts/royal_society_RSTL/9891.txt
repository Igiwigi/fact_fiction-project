This condensation he found to depend on the condition of
surface, being greater when it was tarnished or coated than when it was polish
He saturated air with moisture at a temperature of 16* C., and then raised both i
and his pile to a temperature of 38%, When such air was blown against the dry face
of the pile heat was generated. Condensation therefore occurred upon a snrfacs
22 C. higher than the dew point of the vapour. Againsb this T have nothing to urge,
But the fact by no means justifies the inference drawn from it, which was, that the
vapours in my experimental tuhe were converted by © yapour-hesion ” into liquid
layers of high opacity to radiant heat. These layers, acting upon the calorific rays
impinging on the interior s8urface of my tube, produced the absorption which T had
erroneously ascribed to the vaponrs. More than this, the liquid layers were supposed
to be broken up into discontinuous patches which not only absorbed the heat but
scattered it, © Vapour-hesion,” it may be added, was found to vary with the liquid
which produced the vapour, being particularly strong in the case of alcohol.
