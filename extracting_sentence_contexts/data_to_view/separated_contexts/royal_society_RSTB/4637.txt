In those Whales in which the cervical vertebrae remain separate, it is evident,
from the accessory articulation that exists between the atlas and the axis vertebra
above the spinal cord, that any rotary movement about the odontoid, or about the
epistropheal centrum that sometimes takes the place of the odontoid (see Smers, 29,
p. 189), is of the slightest extent (Dwicur, 8, Plate 6, fig. 5, c). Owing to the
fact, however, that the two occipital condyles, taken together, present the form of
a hemisphere, fitting into a basin-shaped atlas vertebra*, the looseness of the marginal
part of the synovial capsule permits of slight movements in all directions, up-and-
down, side-to-side, and rotary. That the coalescence of the two condyles in Whales is secondary is the view already
taken by Gaurr (1908,} p. 522) and pe Buruer (6, III, pp. 124-5, and V, p. 3) upon
embryological grounds, and it is supported by paleontological considerations.
