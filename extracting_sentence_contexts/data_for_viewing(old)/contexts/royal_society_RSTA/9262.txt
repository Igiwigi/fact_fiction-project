150 J. QUILD ON THE COLORIMETRIC PROPERTIES OF THE SPECTRUM.

Maxwetw’s results indicate that the spectrum he employed was very impure, particu-
larly in the blue-green part of the spectrum. This gave an entirely fictitious approxi-
mation of the spectrum locus to two sides of the colour triangle and led MaxwE Lt to
conclude that “... all the colours of the spectrum may be compounded of those
which lie at the angles of this triangle,” and that there was “ strong reason to believe
that these are the three primary colours corresponding to those modes of sensation
in the organ of vision.”

These conclusions have long been known to be quite untenable, there being no spectral

colours which are in any sense Primary colours or from which all other colours can be

compounded.
