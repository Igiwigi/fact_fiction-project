In general, both density
estimation and clustering may be of interest. Thus, we consider Bayesian model-based clustering
via mixtures, to retain optimal properties for density estimation, and focus on the comparison
of different estimates for the number of clusters and clustering solution. In fact, we find that the
number of clusters can change drastically depending on the estimator used. The literature discussed above estimates the number of clusters via the marginal posterior on
the number of non-empty components. Alternatively, the full clustering solution can be estimated,
without conditioning on the number of clusters, thus also implicitly providing an estimate of this
number.
