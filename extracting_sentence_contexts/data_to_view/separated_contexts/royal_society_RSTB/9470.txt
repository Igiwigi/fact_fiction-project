In
many genomes (e.g. human), TEs may be very numerous
but largely inactive. In others (e.g. pufferfish), each type of
TE may be present in low copy numbers but remain active. Some early comparisons suggested that there may in fact be
an inverse correlation between genome size and TE diversity. For example, the pufferfish genome contains far more types of
TEs than the human genome, despite being only one-tenth as
large [9]. However, a recent large-scale comparison by the pres-
ent authors revealed that any relationship between genome size
and TE diversity is much more complex [47].
