A further difference also demands special attention. The considerable amplitudes
associated with the annual and semi-annual periods which were a feature of the
statisties for the last 75 years and which were much diminished during the epoch
1755-1828 again make their appearance. Considering the general character of the
graph, however, the significance of their presence can hardly be considered as of the
same interest as for the epoch described in the more accurate data of registration.
From the data for the epoch 1703-1754 considered purely by themselves it is difficult
to draw any definite conclusions, but, as will be seen later, they afford some confirmatory
evidence which is not without importance to epidemiological theory.

It now remains to consider how far the results of this investigation conform to or
are explained by the facts observed in other places. The most important independent
evidence refers to Scotland. Since the year 1855 the Registrar-General for that
country has published the monthly number of deaths from measles for each of the
eight chief towns. These have been investigated for Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee,
Perth, and Paisley. Additional information for the first of these is furnished in
Dr. Wart’s celebrated ‘ Treatise on the Chincough,’ for the years between 1780 and
1820. The monthly numbers of deaths from measles for the last 30 years have also
been extracted from the statistics of Paris. No attempt has been made to examine
all the existing periods. In all these cases the amplitude of one particular period so
greatly exceeds the amplitude of any other that this special period must be considered
predominant.

When the statistics of these different localities are examined, it is found that in
