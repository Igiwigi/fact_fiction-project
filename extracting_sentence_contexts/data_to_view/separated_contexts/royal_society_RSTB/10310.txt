We con-
clude by arguing that the lessons learned from moving out of
one’s comfort zone and venturing into the lesser-known
realms of sexual selection can provide critical insights into
the mechanisms of (gamete-level) sexual selection in more
familiar taxonomic groups.

2. When you are both male and female

Here, we will mainly discuss simultaneous hermaphrodites
(hereafter simply referred to as hermaphrodites) in fungi
and mobile animals in which fertilization requires direct
contact between mating partners. While some aspects of her-
maphroditic fungi and mobile animals are also applicable to
sessile hermaphrodites, including angiosperms, we discuss
those in §§3—-5 as these groups have some unique properties
due to the fact they never interact directly. By definition, her-
maphrodites produce both small, more numerous gametes
(sperm), and large, less numerous gametes (ova). If we then
assume that ova, in general, are limiting while sperm are abun-
dant, it follows that a hermaphrodite might prefer to donate
sperm to a particular mating partner, while not necessarily
wanting to receive sperm from that same partner [5].
