Of phosphoric acid and siJica
alone, will the total produce of the corn crops remove more than the hay crop. To swm up the most important points: it is quite obvious that, in the 80il in
question, which it should be remembered is a loam with a clay subsoil, the effect
of the application of a complex manure such as dung, supplying as it doubtless does
much more of all the mineral constituents than the crop takes up, is in a striking
degree to increase the assimilation of potass ; notably als that of phosphoric acid,
and to some degree that of silica; much more chlorine was also taken up. In fact,
as will be shown further on, the supply by manure of potass has a more marked effect
on the quantity, and on the botanical and the chemical character, of the herbage of
the hay crop, than that, of any other of the mineral, or ash-constituents. If these few
illustrations relating to the composition of the crop be borne in mind, the results
