More GENERAL CASE—FLAT-PLATE AEROFOIL AT INCIDENCE

The more general case of a flat-plate acrofoil with plan z’OA (figure 13), at incidence ¢
in the stream M, can be treated by an obvious extension of the methods used above, provided
at least one of the edges Oz’, OA lies outside the Mach cone from O. We suppose that, in

fact, Oz’ lies within and OA without the Mach cone. Then, with the notation used previously,
we find for u the boundary condition
