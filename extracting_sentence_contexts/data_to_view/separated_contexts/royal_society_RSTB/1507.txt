For this purpose Professor Gap suggested the application of a fine hot needle
transversely to the path to be divided, and by this means it was quite easy to cut
any particular strand of fibres without pressing on surrounding points and without
causing hemorrhage of any kind. For instance, in a dog under ether and conditions
as described above application of the electrodes to the postero-external column at
any point of the 4th or 6th lumbar segment produced flexion of the hip and knee,
and these movements seemed identical in every respect ; then by gentle application
of the red-hot needle the postero-external column was divided across in the centre of
the 5th segment, after which stimulation of the 4th segment only evoked flexion of
the hip, whereas stimulation of the 6th segment produced only flexion of the knee. This fact is of great interest, especially in relation with the observations of Ramon-y-
Casa and Barsacct, because it is so plain that movement which results from
stimulation of the posterior external column must be brought about not only by
means of stimulation of the short reflex arc fibres in the same segment, but also by
means of stimulation of the intersegmental (see also below) fibres (RAmon-y-Casat),
and in all probability by stimulation either directly or indirectly of the collateral
fibres as well. (d.) Effect of transversely dividing the Cord above the Lumbar Enlargement.
