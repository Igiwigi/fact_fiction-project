For, as is well known, that sulcus is most frequently a more or less straight antero-
posteriorly directed line, while sometimes, though more rarely, it resembles a miniature

preecentral sulcus in possessing a vertical stem parallel to the fissure of RoLanvo,
from the middle of which there runs forwards an antero-posterior limb. If, therefore,
we regard this suleus, x, as the posterior extremity of the superior frontal sulcus, its
variations in form will be most easily understood. Finally, we would observe that the
superior frontal sulcus in Man commences posteriorly, well behind the line of the
precentral sulcus, directed vertically upwards; in fact, it begins posteriorly in the
middle of the ascending frontal convolution. It is just this first part of the superior
frontal suleus which, lying over the anterior half of the breadth of the ascending
frontal convolution, forms the sulcus, x, of the Monkeyâ€™s brain.
