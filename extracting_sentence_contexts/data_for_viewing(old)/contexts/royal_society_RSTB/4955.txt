Mandibles. (Fig. 13 a, b, ¢, also Plate 23, figs. 3, 4 and 5.)—These organs are the most
abundant of all the fragments of Crustacean remains found in the Chert. This is pro-
bably due to the fact that they were more strongly chitinised than any other part of the
body. They were powerful organs of the typical Branchiopod form without the slightest
trace of a palp in the adult. The triturating surfaces, oval in shape, were formed by rows
of minute denticles and some larger teeth. The two mandibles were not quite symmetrical
in this respect, however ; for whereas the triturating surface of the left mandible was
bordered on its upper edge by a row of teeth, diminishing in size from behind forwards,
the right mandible only possessed a single large tooth posteriorly, 7.e., approximately
in the same position as the first (largest) tooth of the series on the left mandible.

Mazillule. (Fig. 14.—See also figs. 4, 29, 30, 31 and 32.)—These were quite small,
as in most modern Branchiopods, and (as far as can be made out) consisted of a single
nearly semi-circular plate fringed on the free curved edge with a series of eight or nine
long plumose spines. From near the centre of the plate there arose a single long
