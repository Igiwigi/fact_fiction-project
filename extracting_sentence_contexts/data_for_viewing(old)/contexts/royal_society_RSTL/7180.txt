392 MR. W. HUGGINS ON THE SPECTRA OF SOME OF THE NEBULZ.

in constitution, invests these objects with a new importance to the theories of cosmic
science. A first consideration of these nebulz would suggest that we have now evideni
from observation of the existence of that primordial nebulous matter required by t
theories of Sir WiLLLAM HeRscnEL and LAPLACE®. But though it should be found ul
mately that, in some of its forms, the theory of the development of aGriform matter int
suns and planets is a true representation of the mode of formation of the universe, $ti]
it would show a want of the strict caution which experimental science demands in
interpretation of observed facts, to explain the phenomena presented by the gaseon

than a speculation. In a paper © On the Spectrum of the Great Nebula in OrionfF,”
stated, as the result of the observations which I had then made, the provisional opinic
that the gaseous nebulz may belong possibly to an order of cosmical bodies distinet fron
that represented by the sun and fixed stars. In this connexion it may be remarked
my examination of the light of Comet I. 1866 4 shows that a close relation probab
exists between nebular and cometary matter.

As further contributions towards a future determination of the true rank and cosmict
relations of these nebulz, I proceed to give the results of s0ome observations on th
intensity of their light, and also measures of some of the planetary nebule.
