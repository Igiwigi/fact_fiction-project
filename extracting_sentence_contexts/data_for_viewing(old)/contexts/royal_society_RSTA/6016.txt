stubbornly well above data obtained from DNS and laboratory experiments. The notion of
dynamical stability seems to be a critical element missing from existing methods for obtaining
rigorous bounds. Accordingly, in this study, we have introduced a novel hybrid approach
in which a physically plausible—although not rigorously derivable—marginal linear-stability
constraint is incorporated into variational formalisms for estimating the heat transport in
two-dimensional Rayleigh-Bénard convection. Our (conditional) upper heat-flux estimate is
constructed within the CDH variational framework for the stress-free case. A lower estimate
also is obtained for both stress-free and no-slip scenarios. To obtain these conditional bounds,
we first demonstrate how linear marginality can be imposed on the mean temperature profile
through a Rayleigh quotient formulation, and then solve the resulting Euler-Lagrange equations
numerically using efficient time-stepping algorithms. The computational results reveal that the
improvement (i.e. the reduction in the bound) provided by the upper estimate is negligible, i.e.
Nucant & Nucan ~0.106Ra°/12. This reflects the fact that the linear-stability constraint is almost
entirely accommodated by an adjustment of the interior gradient of Tg, rendering it slightly
unstable, rather than via the anticipated thickening of the thermal boundary layer. The lower
estimate, however, does successfully capture the classical 1/3 scaling for both stress-free (Nu) ~
