Boucué (1834) described and figured several Mycetophilid and Sciarine larvae.
His account of the mouth parts of Mpcetophila signata is of little value and the figures
are incorrect.

Durour (1839, a) divided the Mycetophilid larvae into Antennatae and Non
antennatae, comprising the Bolitophilinae in his first division and the rest of the
Mycetophilid larvae in the latter. This classification is incorrect since all the
Mycetophilid larvae possess rudimentary antennae, with the exception of the
sub-family Bolitophilinae, where the antennae are well developed. In another paper
(1839, 4) he described several Mycetophilid larvae belonging to the following
genera—Ceroplatus, Bolitophila, Sciara, and Sciophila ; but though this paper is rich
in biological and anatomical facts, his description of the mouth parts is incomplete.

In 1851, HeEGeR described Mycetophilia lunata, Sciara fuscipes, and a Bolitophila
which he mistook for Limnobia platyptera. The Mycetophila larva is figured as having

nine pairs of spiracles on the first nine consecutive segments and the locomotory
pads are shown on the dorsal instead of the ventral surface. The labrum, mandible,
and maxilla of Sciara are drawn with care, but he overlooked the spiracles, and*the
labium is represented as occupying the whole area between the epicranial plates on
the ventral surface of the head. In Limnobia (Bolitophila) the antennae and mouth
