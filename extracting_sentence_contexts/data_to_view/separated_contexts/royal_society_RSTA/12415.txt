Again both range and character figures
afford distinct indications of a 13—14-day period, which it will be remembered
appeared in Table XI. only in the group of years containing 1895. In 1894 the character figures and the range figures (i) both show not a peak at day
n+27 or n+28, but a high plateau extending from about day n+25 to day n+34. The range figures, in fact, would seem to favour a Schmidt, or 30-day period, rather
than a 27—28-day period. The reason of this is clear on examining the range
(ii) figures. The high values in the range (i) figures in column 7 +29 and subsequent
columns were mainly due to the fact that two outstanding ranges, respectively 637y
and 660y, “happened” to fall one or both in these columns.
