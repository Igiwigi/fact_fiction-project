in judging the age of the older larvee from the central and eastern Atlantic.

The graph, Stat. 1040, fig. 8 on p. 189, gives a good idea of the size of the larvee in
autumn in the western Atlantic. In the first place, it will be seen that the smallest
specimen was 17 mm. long only—a marked lowering of the previous minimum record
of 34 mm.—but, despite the intensive fishery, only a single specimen of this small size
was taken throughout the whole cruise, and only a very few slightly larger, 2~3 em.,
amounting to 1-2 per cent. of the total number. Furthermore, the graph shows that
an overwhelming majority of the larve were of sizes varying between 34 and 4$ cm.
in length. (As mentioned above, no specimen over 5 cm. was taken by the
“Margrethe ” in the western area, west of the line referred to on p. 189.)

These facts, in my opinion, warranted the following conclusions :—The spawning of

of the eel cannot go on regularly throughout the whole year; there must, in autumn
at any rate, be a cessation or decrease in the production, otherwise we must have
found tiny larvee in greater numbers at this season. Even though the time when the
eels did spawn could not be determined with certainty, the size of the larvee neverthe-
less rendered it likely that they had come into the world during the first half of the
year 1913. We were dealing, that is to say, with larvee in their first year (the
O-group), and these were as we have seen about 3} cm. long in the autumn.
