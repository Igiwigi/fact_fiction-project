where qo = 2b,/n + 3 In fact, this is the same generating function as the one for the canonical
transformation from position and momentum to action angle variables, showing that the
quadrature states |q) are formally equivalent to the position and |p) to the momentum of a particle
in a harmonic potential. As a generating function of a canonical transformation, the derivatives of F(q,1) satisfy

Note that, by this definition of 6, the phase is only defined between 0 and z, and therefore |p| = p. The overlaps of different quadrature eigenstates are given by

(qlq’)=5(q- q’), (2.128)

Finally, the resolution of unity in terms of quadrature eigenstates is given by

i={ dq)a)(a| =| ép|p)(pl. (2.13)

Thus, the quadrature states are a proper choice for the construction of a path integral, because
the resolution of unity is given by an integral rather than a sum.
