Let Q be a group and let K, be certain subgroups of Q, where « ranges over an index set A. Let every group K, be embeddable in a group G,, (in other words, there is an isomorphism of K, on to
a subgroup of G,). Then Q and the G,, can be simultaneously embedded in a group P in such a way that
(for all we A) ee a
and ( for all a, fe A, a=) Go G, = Ko Ky. (15-4)

t An amalgam is called ‘proper’ if it is not already a group, or if it contains two elements with no

product in it.

+ In fact continuously many different such groups. FREE PRODUCTS OF GROUPS WITH AMALGAMATIONS 533

Proof. We first form to every « the free product G% of G, and Q, amalgamating K, qua
subgroup of G, with K, qua subgroup of Q.
