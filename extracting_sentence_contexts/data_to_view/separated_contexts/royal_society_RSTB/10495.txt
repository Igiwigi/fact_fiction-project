It is well documented that eIPSCs control the timing of
neuronal firing with incoming activity [14,15], which is not
only critical for proper information processing, but also for
spike-timing dependent plasticity mechanisms [16]. While
both eIPSCs and mIPSCs could affect neuronal responses
via shunting, the potential function of action potential-
independent mIPSCs themselves has remained largely
speculative. It has been long recognized that the frequency of
mIPSCs is normally very high across many brain regions
[17,18] despite the fact that the density of inhibitory synapses
is orders of magnitude less than that of excitatory synapses
[19]. This observation has raised speculations that inhibitory
‘noise’ may serve a function [18]. In this study, we report that
in adults visual experience specifically regulates inhibitory
‘noise’ (mIPSCs) without changing eIPSCs.
