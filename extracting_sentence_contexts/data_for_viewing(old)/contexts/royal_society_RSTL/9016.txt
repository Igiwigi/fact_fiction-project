Bacteria spring does not exist in ordinary air.” The experiments, however, recorded in
this memoir constitute an ocular demonstration of the respective parts played by the infu-
Sion and the air. A pinch of fungus-spores, taken between the fingers, sown in a 8uitable
medium, and producing their appropriate crop, could not more clearly indicate the origin
of that crop than experiments with the luminous beam indicate the origin of our
harvests of Bacteria. Dr. SANDERSON is, I doubt not, now well aware that his first statement
was founded on an error of interpretation. In a lecture delivered at Owens College, Man-
chester, and published in the © British Medical Journal” for January 16, 1875, he to a
great extent qualifies and corrects his first inference. He there says that the Bacteria
*attach themselves without doubt to these minute particles, which, scarcely visible in
ordinary light, appear as motes in the sunbeam, or in the beam of an electric lamp.”
In fact the experiments on which he based his first inference owed their barrenness, not to
the absence of Bacteria-germs from the air, but to the inability or, rather, slowness of his
mineral s80lution to develop them.

With regard to the part played by the visible motes, I may repeat here what has been
previously stated, namely, that while the coarser particles could hardly exist in their midst
without loading themselves to some extent with the minute germs of Bacteria, there is
no reason to think the motes indispensable for the diffusion of the germs. Whether they
are attached to each other or not, the dryness and the moisture of the air are shared
equally by both. The germs, moreover, float in the air more readily than the larger
particles; and they, I doubt not, when properly illuminated, shed forth a portion
of that changeless light to which reference has been already made, and the perfect
polarization of which declares the s8mallness of the masses which scatter it.
