There are three obstacles one encounters in proving this theorem within the theory of
semigroups of operators: (a) nonlinearity in the boundary condition, (b) nonlinearity in the
equation, and (c) explaining in what sense (solutions to) equations in shells should converge
to (solutions to) an equation on the unit sphere. Problem (a) is taken care of by switching to
equations for inactive kinases KÂ° = 1 â€” K. As to (b), the fact that f(0)>0 and f(1) <0 allows
reducing the problem to the case where f is globally Lipschitz, and then the main result of [25]
says that convergence of solutions of semi-linear equations can be deduced from convergence
of semigroups. As to (c), the idea, accomplished by a family of isomorphism, is to look at the
thinner and thinner shells through a finer and finer magnifying glass. From this perspective,
all the semigroups of interest act in a single space of continuous functions on a shell of unit
thickness, and describe diffusion processes with faster and faster radial component.
