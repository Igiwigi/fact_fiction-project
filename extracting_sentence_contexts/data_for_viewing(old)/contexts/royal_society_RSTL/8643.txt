© The fall of pressure in December and January is, I think, evidently due to the rapid
condensation of the lower stratum of the atmosphere by the radiation of its heat, and,
while this cooled air flows away to the south as the source of the north-east monsoon,
by the consequent setting in of a compensating anti-monsoon current of higher humidity
and comparatively equable temperature at (or, in the case of Darjeeling, chiefly above)
the level of the hill-stations. From January to March, as well as from April to October,
the pressure at Darjeeling and Simla must, on this assumption, be lower than at equal
elevations to the southward in the course of this upper current.

The temporary rise in April is, I think, to be attributed to the expansion of the lower
Satmosphere, by which, for a time, a larger proportion of the atmosphere is lifted above
Sthe level of 7000 and 8000 feet. This requires further investigation.
© Certain effects of the Winds —T haye now discussed most of the more important facts
Z ralating to temperature, vapour-diffusion, and atmospheric pressure, to be gathered from
© the registers of the past few years, in 0 far as they bear on the causes of the winds. It
Sremains to notice certain effects of the winds, especially on temperature and rainfall ;
"®and I shali then briefly sum up the results of the whole discussion, and add a few
eremarks, in an Appendix, on the storms of the Bay of Bengal, to the explanation of

= In respect of temperature, it is obvious that, except in the case of dynamic heating
Zand cooling, a wind cannot per 86 raise the temperature of a place above, nor depress
vat below, that of the region from which it immediately comes. Any change of tempe-
S rature that it may undergo along its course must therefore be due to-local causes, such
