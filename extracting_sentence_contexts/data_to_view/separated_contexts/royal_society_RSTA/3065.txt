As IAMs have a detailed representation of the electricity sector and its decarbonization
potential [11], we take the radical transition of the sector projected in the lowest 1.5°C pathway in
figure 2 as a limiting case. For the sensitivity analysis of global average carbon intensity reductions of other energy
carriers and industrial processes, we assumed a linear decline of 35%, 45%, 60%, 80% of carbon
intensity from 2020 until 2050 and again from 2050 until 2070, followed by a linear extrapolation
to end-of-century values of 20, 15, 10 and 2.5gCO2/MJ, respectively. The more linear decline
compared to the power sector captures the fact that the use of solids, gases and liquids in energy
end-use sectors is harder and slower to decarbonize. CCS in the industry sector and replacement
of fossil fuels with biomass, hydrogen and carbon-neutral synthetic fuels are among the main
decarbonization options here. As shown in figure 2, the upper three decarbonization cases
approximately cover the range of SSP-based 1.5°C pathways, while the lower case falls below this
range.
