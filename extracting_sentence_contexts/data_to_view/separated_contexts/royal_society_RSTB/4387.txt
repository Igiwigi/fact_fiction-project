QueEnsrepr described a good tarsus (37). CREDNER (38) later published
a very imperfect restoration of the palate, and JAEKEL (39) made out some further
facts about the ribs and lower jaw. The very large skeleton No, 40162 in the British Museum allows me to add some
facts to those previously recorded. The parasphenoid was well figured by v. Mryer (Plate XIII, figs. 1 and 7).
