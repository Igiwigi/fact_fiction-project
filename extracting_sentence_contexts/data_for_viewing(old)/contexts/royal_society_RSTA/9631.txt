The following two photographs, figs. 13 and 14, Plate 4, obtained during this
part of the investigation are of such outstanding interest as to warrant separate
consideration.

PHOTOGRAPHIC INVESTIGATION OF GASEOUS EXPLOSIONS 43

Fig. 13 is of two separate explosions (a) and (6) through a moist 2CO + O,
medium in a tube of 3:62 mm internal diameter, this being near the limiting
diameter below which detonation would be altogether suppressed. The interesting
fact is shown of the detonation being alternately damped down by the cooling
action of the tube wall and afterwards re-initiated. This is, we think, due to the
essentially dual character of the spinning detonation as an unstable and separable
association of a “shock wave” anda flame-front. For with a sufficient cooling action
of the tube walls, separation of the two is sooner or later effected with the result that
the “shock wave” component goes on ahead of the retarded flame-front component.
The velocity of the now invisible “ shock wave,” moving ahead, is, however, degraded
faster than that of the following visible flame-front, so that eventually the two come
together again and detonation is re-initiated. We have found that in such a tube
of 3-6 mm diameter detonation can be so alternately damped down and re-initiated
after short-time intervals indefinitely and with the greatest regularity.

In each of the two separate explosions (a) and (b), the forward flame-speed on
