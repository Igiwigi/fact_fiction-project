And now the
thunder-lightning interval record confirms the fact that the most active region of the
cloud was nearest to the station at the time. A comparative study of (a), (b) and (c) of fig. 10 suggests that the most active region
of the thundercloud came nearer the station on October 6 than on September 6 or 7. This is supported by the fact that the lightning discharges produced more violent
changes in the electrogram of October 6, during the passage overhead of the most
active region of the cloud, than on the other two occasions.
