posite to the letters B, C . . . denoting the rays to which they respectively refer, and
then form a table of differences by subtracting the value of M for B from the value
for C, the value for C from the value for D, and 80 on. Let N be the number found
in the table of differences corresponding to any interval, as for example from F to G;
then the numerical value of N, that is to say, N or —N, according as N is positive


BANDS SEEN IN THE SPECTRUM, 231

or negative, gives the number of bands seen between F and G. For anything that
appears from the imperfect theory of the bands given in the preceding article, it
would seem that the 8ign of N was of no consequence. It will presently be seen,
however, that the sign is of great importance : it will be found in fact that the sign
+ indicates that the second arrangement mentioned in art. 2 must be employed ;
-that is to say, the plate must be made to intercept light from the thin end of the
prism, while the sign — indicates that the first arrangement is required. It is hardly
necessary to remark that, if N should be fractional, we must, instead of the number
of bands, speak of the number of band-interyals and the fraction of an interval.

Although the number of bands depends on nothing but the values of N, the values
of M are not without physical interest. For M expresses, as we have seen, the number
of waves' lengths whereby one of the interfering streams is before or behind the other.
Mr. Airy speaks of the formation of rings with the light of a spirit-lamp when the
retardation of one of the interfering streams is as much as fifty or sixty waves' lengths.
But in some of Professor PoweLL's experiments, bands were seen which must have
