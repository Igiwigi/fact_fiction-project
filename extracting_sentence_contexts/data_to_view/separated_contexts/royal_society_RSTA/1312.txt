Here the silver is found as a distinct micro-constituent. It will
thus be readily understood also why duplicate determinations of the silver content in
this specimen showed different amounts. This same fact did not escape the observant Farapay, who, in his joint paper with
Sroparv in the “ Quarterly Journal of Science,” published in 1820, mentioned that when
a mixture of silver and steel was kept long in a molten state, a perfect alloy seemed to
be formed : but on solidification, globules of silver appeared on the surface of the button. When a forged bar of this metal was acted on by dilute sulphuric acid, the silver was
left in threads through the mass, “ so that the whole has the appearance of a bundle of
fibres of silver and steel as if they had been united by welding.”

(c) Determination of Hardness. For this purpose the Diamond Pyramid hardness test was employed in preference
to the Brinell.
