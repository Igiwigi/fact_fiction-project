Even if this was so for har
solids, such as glass—and the results of our comparative experiments did not point t
it—it appeared most improbable that it could apply to a substance so permeate
and little differentiated from the water as woody cell-wall. To test the behaviou
of this material in presence of air-containing water under tension, we enclosed chips 0
the wood of Taaus baccata, which had been boiled in water to ensure complet
wetting, in tubes and subjected them to tension by cooling. In not one experime
of many did rupture occur at the chips, the liquid appeared, in fact, to break prefe
ably anywhere else. We add particulars of the experiments. . (1.)
