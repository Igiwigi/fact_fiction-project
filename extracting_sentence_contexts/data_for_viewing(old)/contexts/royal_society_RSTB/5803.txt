ANALYSES OF AGRICULTURAL YIELD. 339

Levelling —All levels are tied to Survey Department benchmarks on the farm, and
nearly all have been independently determined for us by that Department, to whose staff
we are much indebted, in 1913 as at the present time. The employment in the diagrams
of the lettering “ A.S.L.” signifies conventionally “ above sea-level,” being the mean
sea-level at Alexandria.

A.2. The General Water-Table Problem in Egypt.

The great improvements in Egyptian Irrigation after 1882 were in part due to the
adoption of free-flow canals which run above country-level, being fed by barrages across
the river. The fact that this improvement of supply was being purchased at the cost of
a sur-elevation of the water-table, with a reciprocal diminution of the soil available for
root-run, was noted fairly soon, at first by local outcrops of salt due to infiltration, and
then by direct measurements of water-table level begun by Lucas in 1894 in the Cairo
district and developed intensively at certain Delta localities by AUDEBEAU and Gipson.
The latter workers developed the thesis in 1906 that the water-table had risen, and that
there was a consequent fall in agricultural yield per acre. Both these conclusions were
unpopular, as tending to disparage the remarkable work which had been done on irriga-
tion, and a “ water-table controversy ” flourished from 1909 till the Great War.

The outstanding work during this period was that of Ferrar, who outlined the general
situation throughout the length of Egypt, besides making what were then considered to
be very detailed studies of certain localities, thereby framing the broad outlines upon
