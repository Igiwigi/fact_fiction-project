Bremen [22] and Barcelona [26], respectively. Another signi-
ficant social dimension of the conflict caused by salinization
in the two cases concerns the thousands of jobs provided
by mining activities.

The case of the Llobregat stands out as particularly rel-
evant in relation to the mix of natural and anthropogenic
causes of salinization. Owing to the saline geology of the
Llobregat river basin, primary salinization and secondary
salinization historically have been mixed. As a result of the
saline geology of the catchment, salt concentrations in its
waters were significant even before the potash mines started
their activity [30]. In fact, as observed by locals and visiting
naturalists, salt concentrations could reach critical levels
during the flash floods of the Cardener River, one tributary
of the Llobregat located in areas with higher saline geology
[30,31]. For centuries, salt has been exploited in the region,
becoming its main resource. However, after potash salts
were discovered in 1912 and production started in the
1920s, salinization caused by this anthropogenic activity
was added to existing natural salinity factors. Claims about
the social impacts of secondary salinization and discussions
about its relative importance in relation to the ‘natural’ salini-
zation started soon thereafter and remain controversial to this
day, when they are discussed in European courts of justice
