cavity of the female. Now the penis, like the cirri, has only a retractor muscle. It can
therefore be extended only by erection. Unlike the cirri, however, it has only one blood
vessel. Blood forced into the penis from the epineural sinus can thus only escape by being
withdrawn again through the same passage. I deduce, therefore, that during copulation,
the occlusor muscles must first be contracted. This closes the only exit from the body, but
still allows the passage of blood from the capitulum into the body through the scutal valves.
Contraction of any of the body muscles which I have described as putting up the blood
pressure will now tend to erect both the cirri and the penis. The cirri may be retained
within the mantle by the contraction of their muscles. Whether this happens or not, if the
muscle of the penis relaxes the latter will be erected and so can pass out of the valves. The
degree of erection can now be increased by further blood being pumped into the body
through the scutal valves. The erection will remain so long as the occlusor muscles are
contracted. In fact, there is no other way for the penis to be withdrawn into the valves
than the opening again of the occlusor muscles, for there is no other escape route for blood
from the body once it has passed in through the scutal valves.


126 H. G. CANNON ON THE ANATOMY

In all fixed specimens the penis lies along the mid-ventral line between the bases of the
cirri. It follows from what I have suggested above that, during the normal rhythmical
casting activity, the muscle of the penis must always be contracted to prevent its erection
along with the cirri.

A plan of the complete circulatory system is shown in figure 14.
