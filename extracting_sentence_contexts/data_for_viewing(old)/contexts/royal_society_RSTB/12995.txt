9 Reproductive barriers are the currency of speciation. These barriers can occur

e-mail: coughlanjenn@gmail.com before or after a hybrid zygote is formed (i.e. pre- and postzygotic), and selec-
tion against hybrids may or may not be mediated by the environment (i.e.
extrinsic versus intrinsic). While intrinsic postzygotic barriers were an initial
focus of speciation research [1-4], recent work has highlighted the importance
of ecology in reproductive isolation, namely prezygotic and extrinsic postzygo-
tic barriers [5-8]. This wave of ecology-focused speciation work, paired with the
observation that prezygotic barriers tend to reach completion before intrinsic
postzygotic barriers (e.g. [9,10]), has led to the prevalent opinion that prezygo-
tic barriers play a more important role in speciation than intrinsic postzygotic
barriers, particularly early on [11-15]. Yet, the fact that intrinsic postzygotic bar-
riers are common across all kingdoms of life, and are a hallmark of most ‘good’
species [16] suggests that their role in speciation may also be essential.

Here, we highlight the contribution of intrinsic postzygotic barriers to spe-
ciation and explore how this contribution may change as speciation proceeds.
While speciation is a continuous process, we refer to early and late stages
based on the degree of reproductive isolation between species, while acknowl-
edging that reproductive isolation is not unidirectional and can be accumulated
or lost (figure 1). While these stages roughly correspond to divergence times;
wherein recently diverged populations or incipient species may represent ear-
lier stages, and more divergent species pairs may represent later stages, it is
not a perfect proxy for reproductive isolation. For example, speciation can be
