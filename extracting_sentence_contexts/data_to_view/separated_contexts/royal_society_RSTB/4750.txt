For gq =8,
therefore, an observed multiple correlation 0-9 cannot be regarded as significant, that
is as convincing evidence that the ‘* crop ” is in any way influenced by the meteorological
variates. The only value, in fact, in the above table which could be regarded as definitely
significant is the value 0-9 for q = 4, while for g = 6 this is suggestive only of real
influence. A still more insidious source of illusory high correlations lies in the fact that the
particular variates chosen for correlation with the crop figures, are often chosen because
they appear in fact to be associated with the crop. It is a common practice, as a pre-
liminary to the study of weather correlations, to search for the so-called critical periods
by such methods as the following. The years are arranged in order of crop yield, and
a number of meteorological values are plotted on a chartin this order ; those meteoro-
logical values which show an apparent trend upwards or downwards, are then picked
out, and used to construct a weather formula by which the crop may be predicted.
