If it were the direct cause it would
follow that a great increase would result from the administration of slightly larger
quantities, which is not the case ; the duration of subnormal pressure, though greater
when larger quantities of the nitrites are administered, falls very far short of being
proportionately greater. That the quantity of nitroxyl is not the only factor in the
permanence of this physiological effect is clear from the circumstance that, whilst
iso-primary amyl nitrite represents almost exactly the same amount of nitroxyl as
tertiary amy] nitrite, the latter is much the more powerful compound. The fact that
the most volatile and diffusible nitrites (methyl and ethyl nitrites) act for the longest
