of that hypothesis the iatro-chemical doctrines which superseded the system of GaLex,
and which held their ground under various modifications for several centuries, were
the natural expressions *. The insufficiency of either of these hypotheses, or of both
of them combined, to explain the phenomena of life, gave origin to a third, which
was undoubtedly more correct in its fundamental conception than either of its pre-
decessors had been ; the position assumed being, that the phenomena of each living
body proceed from a vital agency, or anima, peculiar to each organized structure,
and having nothing in common with chemical or mechanical principles. The
sect of the Vitalists, however, did not steer clear of the exclusiveness which had been
the great. fault of the chemists and physicists ; but, in looking at every action of
the living body as the immediate result of vital agency, claimed for that agency
much that is clearly attributable to the operation of chemical and physical forces.
Among modern Physiologists there is a distinct recognition of the fact, that many
of the phenomena of living bodies may be placed in the same category with those
of inanimate matter, and that such are not otherwise affected by vital agency than
as this prepares or modifies the conditions under which they occur. But there is also
a distinet recognition of the fact, that living bodies present a large class of phenomena
which are altogether peculiar to them, and which can only be attributed to agencies
of which the inorganic world is altogether independent ; and hence has arisen the
notion of vital agency as the foundation of Physiological science, just as the notion
of affinity is the foundation of Chemistry, and that of mutual attraction of General
Physics. And putting aside all hypothetical considerations with regard‚Äù to the
abstract nature of that agency, Physiologists have been aiming to determine the laws
