9 and
10 with fig. 11). The loose marginal reticular zone of knot-tissue would readily
permit of such disintegration and disappearance. Renewed investigation of the relation
of the yolk-entoderm to the knot in our original Specimen DD has, in fact, shown
us that, in one or two of the sections at least, there are indications of an extension
of the yolk-entoderm for a short distance under the peripheral part of the knot, at its
anterior margin. Further, we have already seen that in the earlier stage, represented
by our specimen “alpha,” the layer of definite yolk-entoderm was absolutely complete,
and extended right across under that lenticular mass of cells which we must assume
to represent the earliest stage in the differentiation of the cellular tissue of the
primitive knot. Unfortunately, the evidence obtainable on this matter, from a study of the
sections of the knot in Specimen Q, is of little or no value, inasmuch as the free
ventral surface of the knot in that specimen presents an obvious imperfection.
