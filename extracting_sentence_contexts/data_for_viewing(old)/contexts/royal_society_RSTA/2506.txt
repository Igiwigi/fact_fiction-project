Recovery is defined as ‘returning to a normal state after a period of difficulty’ and most (lay) a
people think about disaster recovery as a return to normality [1] and an attempt to bring the post- : BS
disaster situation to some level of acceptability [2] and normal level of performance [3]. In this 8
paper, since complete restoration may take a very long time, we argue that a concept of ‘close to : 8
normality’ is more meaningful and we therefore define recovery as being when 90% of displaced IN

people have returned to their repaired homes, 90% of disrupted businesses are back in operation
and 90% of the affected working population has returned to work.

However, a different question is whether getting back to normal conditions is at all a
meaningful goal. Post-disaster ‘normal’ may not be a return to the same status as before the event;
in fact, this may be undesirable if the quality of a system could be improved to enhance resilience.
Recovery from disaster may be envisaged as a process of resilience building, whereby the capacity
of a community to spring back after the initial shock of a disaster is increased [4]. Floods can act
as catalysts for human adaptation [5] and there is a ‘window of opportunity’ in the early phase
of recovery to improve resilience or ‘build back better’ [6]. A balance must be achieved between
speed and enhanced resilience [7].

It has been suggested that the basic functions of a community should be restored within two
years to ensure successful recovery [8]. Within this period, governments are required to manage a
disaster and restore functionality of critical systems, and so issues relating to an event are pushed
high up the policy agenda [9].
