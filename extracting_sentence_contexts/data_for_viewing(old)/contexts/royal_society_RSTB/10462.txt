Despite the numerous studies of competence across a broad
swath of competent bacterial species, there still remains con-
siderable uncertainty about its function because no single
explanation seems to capture the particulars of different species
growing in different contexts. And this may in fact be the
answer: as with eukaryotic sex, a plurality of explanations
must be considered [77]. While Haemophilus may become com-
petent when it is hungry or to repair DNA damage,
streptococci, H. pylori [36] and L. pneumophiliae [37,78] may
only do so when they are damaged, while A. baylyi [42] and
Neisseria meningitidis [79] are constitutively competent
(although not necessarily all cells in the population at the
same time). However, a consensus option may lie in the fact
that not all transformable DNA is of equal appeal or value to
each bacterial species. Most obviously, non-homologous
DNA is a poorer substrate for recombination than homologous


DNA. But it goes further than this. As we detail below, all com-
petent bacterial species go to extreme lengths to ensure that the
DNA they take up or recombine is either from the same species
or from the same strain. This source of DNA is a safe and con-
servative way to either repair DNA or purge deleterious
mutations (including mutator alleles [68]) by restoring the
wild-type allele, to re-establish functions from related strains
