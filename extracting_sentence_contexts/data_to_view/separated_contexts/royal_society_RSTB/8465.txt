The number of infected cells was determined
pLgatewayIRESEYFP and pLgatewaySN by LR recombination. by staining for B-galactosidase 2 days later. Sequences of these primers are shown in table 1. The restriction phenotype of the lagomorph TRIM5as was

tested by the two-colour FACS assay as described previously. Briefly, CrFK cells were transduced with delivery vectors carry-

(b) Cells and virus production ing TRIM5a and the EYFP marker. These were challenged with
SIRC (European rabbit), CrFK (cat), D17 (dog), TE671 and 293T a panel of retroviruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, SIVmac, FIV, EIAV, PFV,
(human) cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS SFV, FFV, B-MLV and N-MLV) 2 days post-transduction.
