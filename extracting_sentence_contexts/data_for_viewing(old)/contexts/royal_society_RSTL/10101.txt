radiations, an angular projection is formed which, taking the whole length of the
commissure into consideration, really is a prolonged ridge astride which rests the
longitudinal fasciculus of the olfactory arcuate system (Plate 49, fig. 12, 7). In
vertical sections taken through more posterior planes, it is een that the portion of the
callosal commissure which thus supplies the inner marginal regions of the hemisphere
is distinetly to be traced through the whole of its extent as separate from the lower
segment which supplies the cortex further outwards. So notably is this the case that
all prepared sections show, as a rule, a distinct separation between these two callosal
segments, the inner as it were peeling away from the onterâ€”a natural condition due
to their opposed direction. It is therefore obvious, at a first glance, that these inner
regions of the brain which are similar and identical are connected by the same series
of fibres, and the same may readily be maintained for the outer regions of the hemi-
spheres. In fact, the regular superposition of fibres above one another, and the great
uniformity of their course in either hemisphere, conclusively show that they unite
identical regions of both sides. The most inferior fibres of the callosal commissure are

the lowest throughout their course, and are placed next to the ganglia in their course
to the cortex, which for them is the most external part of the hemisphere, 7.e., the
undermost portion of the corpus callosum terminates in the cortex just above the
limbic suleus externally. On the other hand, the uppermost series of fibres in this
commissure connect the more internal aspects of the brain. A superficial 8ection
