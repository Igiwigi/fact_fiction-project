may in turn be overlaid by differences in the shape and disposition of the main cusps, in
enamel pattern, and in the degree of development of certain small and variable cusps.
For example, the enamel of the molar teeth of the orang-outang differs from that of the
African apes and man by being crenated, while individual animals of all species occasionally
possess small additional cusps, sometimes arising, like the ‘Carabelli’ cusps, as excrescences
of the cingulum. Associated with these two categories of difference in the characters of
the crowns there are differences in the number of the roots of the premolar and molar
teeth.

Comparisons between the teeth of man and the apes, and between the teeth of extant
and fossil apes, have to take account of all these kinds of differences. Many are essentially
a measure of the relative degree of development of the same basic characters, and almost
all are amenable to statistical analysis. In spite of this obvious fact, the quantitative
aspects of comparative odontology have been little emphasized in recent years. Very few
figures have ever been published about dimensions of the teeth of extant species of ape,
and such as are available have neither been treated by the methods of modern statistics,
nor have they as a rule been presented in a way which allows of statistical analysis by other

which does not differ in basic pattern from the corresponding tooth of existing apes, may
