With regard to the 11* or 12® of obliquity which till remains when the moon and
earth are in their primitive condition, it may undoubtedly be partly explained by the
friction of the solar tides before the origin of the moon, and perhaps partly als» by the
simultaneous action of the ordinary precession and the contraction and change of
ellipticity of the nebulous mass.}

* « Precession,” & 19.

+ If the change has been as much as an hour the rotational momentum of the earth destroyed by solar
tidal friction must have been 33 times the present total internal momentum of moon and earth. For the
orbital momentum of a planet varies as the cube root of its periodic time, and if we differentiate logarith-
mically we obtain the increment of periodic time in terms of the increment of orbital momentum. Then
taking the numerical data from Tables I. and IT. we 8ee that this statement is proyed by the fact that
3x33 times [216+01720 x 109] x 365-25 x 24 is very nearly equal to unity,
