Ejaculate sub-
stances are singularly well-positioned to influence both the post-ejaculation
performance of own (and rival) sperm as well as the reproductive behaviour
and physiology of mating partners, and the ways they might do so are many
and varied. This therefore creates multiple potential routes for seminal fluid
action. In fact, many features of seminal fluid—such as its complexity, multi-
functionality, redundancy and species-specificity—are probably best understood
as accumulated signatures of historical selection for novel seminal fluid functions
exploiting these different routes, evolving principally through arms races among
