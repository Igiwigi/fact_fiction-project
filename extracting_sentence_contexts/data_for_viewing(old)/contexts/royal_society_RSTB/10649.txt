2 migratory prawns. Parts of West Africa, East Africa and south-
eastern Africa harbour the highest densities of large dam
catchments overlapping historical prawn habitats. These
areas also contain very high schistosomiasis prevalences.

2 Our results support the long-recognized association between
schistosomiasis and dams, and indicate that, across many of

Se. dam-building was dramatic. We further show that the effects
