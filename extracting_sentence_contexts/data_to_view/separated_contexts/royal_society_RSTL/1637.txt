The action of concentrated sulphuric acid on subsilicated
fluoric acid, is similar to that of muriatic acid gas, occasioning
a disengagement of silicated fluoric acid. gas. Facts which
appear to prove, that water is absolutely essential to the exist-
ence of this acid. Boracic acid decomposes it, in a very different way, not from
any predominant affinity for the water, but in consequence of
a stronger attraction for the fluoric acid itself. Silicated fluoric
acid of course is not produced ; but liquid fluoboracic acid and
the silex is precipitated in a gelatinous state, as when ammonia
is employed.
