“spark” line in company with a band spectrum is perhaps somewhat surprising,
although the existence of such a phenomenon shows clearly that, though the
conditions necessary for the production of these radiations may be different, they are
evidently at the same time not incompatible.

In recent years the radiation from the dark space has become of particular interest
in view of the fact that it is in this region that the Stark effect—or the electrical
resolution of spectrum lines analogous to the magnetic resolution known as the
Zeeman effect—is observed.

In this region the quantitative relation between the electric field and the distance
from the cathode was first investigated by ScuusrEeR,* who expressed his results by

the empirical formula
V =V,(1-e-*),

where the potential of the cathode is taken as zero and V, is the potential of the
cathode glow, V is the potential at distance x from the cathode and & is a constant.
