longitudinal mechanical stress, which must canse rotation of the molecules to a certain
extent, but without magnetic polarity, actually, unless carried to a very great excess,
produces decrease of resistance, we are probably right in conjecturing that the change
of resistance resulting from magnetization is in a great measure due to the fact that
the current used in the © bridge” is encountered by a seb of molecular currents
circulating all more or less in the same direction, and in planes mor or less at right
angles to the direction of the former current as the induced magnetism is greater
or less. RELATION BETWEEN THE © ROTATIONAL COEFFICIENT” Of METALS AND THE
