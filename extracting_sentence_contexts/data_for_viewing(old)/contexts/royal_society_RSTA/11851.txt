Ix previous papers* I have broached the question of the two-dimensional partitions
of numbers—or, say, the partitions in a plane—without, however, having succeeded
in establishing certain conjectured formulas of enumeration. The parts of such
partitions are placed at the nodes of a complete, or of an incomplete, lattice in two
dimensions, in such wise that descending order of magnitude is in evidence in each
horizontal row of nodes and in each vertical column. No decided advance was
made in regard to the complete lattice, and the question of the incomplete lattice is
considered for the first time in the present paper.

I return to the subject because I am now able to throw a considerable amount
of fresh light upon the problem, and have succeeded in overeoming most of the
difficulties which surround it. In fact, I am now able to show how the generating
functions may be constructed in respect of any lattice, complete or incomplete, in
forms which are free from redundant terms. I have not succeeded, so far, in giving
a general algebraic expression to the functions, but, in the case of the complete
lattice, I have shown that an assumption as to form, consistent with all results that
have been arrived at in particular cases, leads at once to the expression that has been
for so long the conjectured result. For the complete lattice of two rows, and for the
incomplete lattice of two rows, the results have been obtained without any assumption
in regard to form, and must be regarded as rigidly established.

Before proceeding to explain the new method of research which enables this paper
to make a notable advance, I must hasten to correct an error which I had not
detected at the time a former paper was written.
