Tax known fact, that artificial magnets receive additional
increments to their power by slowly adding weight to the
load they support, combined with the circumstance, that
pieces of iron or steel exposed to the influence of a magnet,
neither acquire nor lose their magnetism instantaneously, led
me to explain Mr. BazLow's experiments ** On the temporary
magnetic effect induced in iron bodies by rotation,‚Äù * without

magnetic virtue to the curious experiments of M. ARaco.
These views are stated in a paper printed in the Phil. Trans.
for 1825, which contains the observations that occurred to
Mr. HerscneL and myself, in repeating and varying those
