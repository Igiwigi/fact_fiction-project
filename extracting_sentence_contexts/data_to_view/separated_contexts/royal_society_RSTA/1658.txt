LOUPE’s aim is to pioneer spectropolarimetry as a uniquely qualified tool for exoplanet
characterization. For ground-based telescopes, polarimetry makes it possible to differentiate
between the reflected flux of a planet and the overpowering flux of its parent star [11] even
when direct detection is not possible from intensity alone, enabling us to find exoplanets which
would otherwise be lost in the stellar glare. This ability stems from the fact that sunlight and—
more generally—light of Solar-type stars can be assumed to be unpolarized when averaged over
the stellar disc, whereas the light scattered in a planetary atmosphere and/or reflected by a
planetary surface will generally become polarized (up to 10%.) Thus, measuring the polarized
flux of a planet can be used to enhance the contrast between the two. Future space telescopes
like HabEx/LUVOIR aim to deliver the intrinsic 107! contrast to directly image an Earth
orbiting a Solar-type star, and then polarimetry can be applied to further characterize the planet. As Solar System observations have indicated [12], the phase angle dependence of the linearly
polarized spectrum of a planet is highly sensitive to atmospheric constituents and clouds, as
well as surface features like vegetation, water, ice, snow or deserts (see §2.) Therefore, the
main advantage of spectropolarimetry is the ability to deliver unambiguous characterization of
exoplanets, breaking the retrieval degeneracies arising from flux measurements alone.
