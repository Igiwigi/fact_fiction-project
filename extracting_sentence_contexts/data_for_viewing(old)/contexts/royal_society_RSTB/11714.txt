complication, concerning the probabilistic nature of the
representations posited in non-slot models of working
memory. When are such representations correct [66]? A rep-
resentation to the effect that a certain item is red is correct just
in case the item is red. But what of representations that assign
credences across a space of candidate colours? Researchers in
formal epistemology have explored measures of verisimili-
tude, or closeness to the truth, for subjective probability
distributions [67,68]. But these measures do not amount to
correctness conditions. One might consider a probability dis-
tribution correct just in case the hypothesis to which it assigns
the highest value is correct. But, first, this threatens to treat
the probabilistic representation as, in fact, a representation
of just that hypothesis. Second, some theories of represen-
tational content take how a representation is used to
partially determine its content [69]. But not all models use
decision rules that extract the item assigned highest credence.
(In principle, the same representation may be subject to
different decision rules by different computations.)

Suppose probabilistic representations do not so much as
have correctness conditions (unlike the representations they
embed). Then, it might seem trivially the case that perceptual
consciousness can have more correct representations than
working memory. For, if the representations in visual working
