T-wave, the isoelectric line, and part of the P-wave are located to detect AF. The same observation
is shared by the work of Mousavi et al. [19], where an attention mechanism was used to show that
the network relied on samples between consecutive beats to detect AF. Thirdly, PVC (premature
ventricular contraction) have a morphology which is largely different from a normal sinus beat.
Therefore, considering the portion of the ECG where the P, QRS and T-waves are usually located

Even if the algorithms for ECG segmentation have become well established and validated in : =
recent years, it must be noted that the performance of the proposed framework is potentially : =
dependent on the algorithm used. Usually, segmentation is performed after beat detection which :8
is dependent on the quality of the ECG signal [36]. In the current work, we did not focus on the : =
selection of the most robust segmentation algorithm for the clinical 12-lead ECG. However, given :8
the fact that this type of ECG can be quickly acquired at low cost, physicians usually recollect : re
the measurements in case of low quality. We therefore assumed that the ECG within the dataset 1
