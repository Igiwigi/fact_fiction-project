maximum action from 100 to 9°7. It is extremely difficult to prepare the gas
mixture with a definite quantity of impurity in it, and as yet no experiments have
been performed which are sufficiently comparable to determine the relation between
the quantity of the impurity and the rate of the action. To quote the words of
BunseEN and Roscor: “ It is perfestly useless to collect the electrolytic gas in a large
vessel, then mix it with the impurity, and afterwards to allow the mixture to pass
through the apparatus, for there is no possible means of collecting this pure mixture
of hydrogen and chlorine in large masses, and again forcing it out in a given

direction.” In fact, any operation with the gas mixture is sufficient to alter its
properties. The only method of procuring reliable results is to evolve the impurity
required from a second electrolytic vessel and to pass it continuously through the
apparatus together with the normal mixture for some days, using the same current
for producing the hydrogen and chlorine and the impurity. However, even under

these circumstances, the results obtained are not in any very close agreement. The
only conclusion arrived at is that the effect of impurity is large at first, but the
effect increases in a much less ratio than the amount of impurity.
There is one form of impurity, however, which is not subject to such experimental
