Table VI. contains a comparison
of the conductivities so calevlated with those given by Koutrauscu. In the last
four columns are given the values of the velocities, calculated from KoHnrauscy’s
tables, at the concentrations indicated in the second column, and those reduced from
the author's measurements. Since the sum of the velocities is proportional to the conductivities, the sum of
U and V must show the same agreement with the sum of U and V from
Koutravscn’s figures, as is shown in columns 3 and 4; that U and V singly do not

show such an agreement is due to the fact that the velocity U = . p, and henee if

the Hittorfian p is used in the calculation, a different value for U will be obtained
than if the author's p is used. In columns 5 and 7 the p that is used is Hrrrorr'’s;
in columns 6 and 8 that obtained during the present research, and hence the want of
agreement. The fact that by the use of the latter the figures in question would be
brought into much greater concordance, speaks strongly in favour of their greater
accuracy.
