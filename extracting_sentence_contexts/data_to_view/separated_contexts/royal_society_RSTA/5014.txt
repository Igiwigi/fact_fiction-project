Examples are
shown in figure 17 for René 77 [4] and in figure 18 for René 80 [44], both second-generation
polycrystalline alloys that were used for turbine blades and continue to be used. A structure
similar to that shown in figure 17 was observed after only 50 cycles under the conditions given
in figure 17. As would be expected, for strain-controlled LCF testing, a stress-coarsened precipitate
structure would be expected to show a decreasing stress range as coarsening continues and in
fact this was indeed observed. Figure 19 shows a continuous decrease in the stress range during
continuous cycling. The effects discussed so far are intrinsic for high-temperature deformation.
