, while the synencephalon forms a
narrow segment intercalated between the epiphysial outgrowths and the first
neuromere of the mid-brain. It is beyond the scope of the present work to enter into a detailed discussion of
this very difficult problem, but I may point out that, in accordance with the inter-
pretation of the neuromery of the fore-brain given by Hr1,* the pineal organs belong
to the third, and not to the second neuromere, the boundary between the second
and third neuromeres being placed much more anteriorly than in von Kuprrer’s
scheme. This seems to fit in much better with the fact that, in Sphenodon, at any
rate, the epiphysial outgrowths arise immediately in front of the posterior com-
missure, which admittedly marks the commencement of the mid-brain. I cannot
help suspecting that the segment which von Kuprrer marks “ Synencephalon” in
