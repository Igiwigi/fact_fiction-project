National Numeracy is a UK charity that wants ‘Everyone in
the UK to have the numeracy that allows them to make the
most of their lives’. The only reference on their website to
dyscalculia is the following: ‘A senior lecturer for the Dys-
lexia Programme at Edge Hill University has shared her
recommendations for the top ten dyscalculia books.’

acy makes no use of the extensive behavioural, cognitive,
neuropsychological and genetic research on dyscalculia pub-

environments by keeping accurate track of the learner’s cur-
rent competence and rehearsing relevant material. Digital
