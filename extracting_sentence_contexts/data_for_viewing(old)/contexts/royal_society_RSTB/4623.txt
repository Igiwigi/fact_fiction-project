Devaronp (1843) maintain that the protoplasm of the Infusoria is itself digested,
and thereby contributes towards the nutrition of the host Ruminant. Similarly, the
Infusoria inhabiting the large intestine of the Equidie are possibly symbiotic in their
relations with their host.


DR. A. D. IMMS ON THE STRUCTURE AND BIOLOGY OF ARCHOTERMOPSIS. 163

In conclusion, the intestinal Protozoa of Termites appear to afford an interesting
case of symbiosis. By their action in breaking down ligneous matter, they con-
tribute towards the digestion of the latter by their hosts. The contention that they
are parasites or solely coprozoic forms is not, in my opinion, equally in accordance
with the facts that are at present available.

F. On Termites IN CaPpriviry.

Although not generally known among biologists, many Termites are comparatively
easy to retain alive in captivity, even when brought from the Tropics to England.
The species most suitable for observation are those which feed within the stems and
trunks of trees, and do not form any true nest or termitarium. It is further
noteworthy that such Termites include the bulk of the more primitive species, and it
is by conducting observations on these forms that the most light is likely to be shed
upon the complex. and unsolved biological problems associated with the Termitide.
The writer brought a number of Archotermopsis from India, arriving in England on
March 8, 1913; winged individuals of both sexes emerged between July 2 and 20,
