thoſe bodies that receive it from the glaſs, are ſaid to
be electrified plus. Whereas wax, amber, &c, upon
being rubbed in the ſame manner, have on the con-

trary been ſuppoſed to receive an eleCtricity from:

bodies, and thoſe bodies which part with it are ſaid
to be electrified minus, But no experiment, that I
know of, has yet appeared to determine which of
theſe eleQricities does really eledrify plus, and which
of them does really ele&rify minus; though it hap-
pens that the faCt turns out juſt as they have all along
ſuppoſed.

In a ſecond treatiſe upon the ſubject of eleQricity,
that I publiſhed in the year 1748, ſeveral experi-
ments were produced, to ſhew that all bodies are ſur-
rounded with a medium, which is of an exceeding
elaſtic nature, and extends but to a very ſmall di/-
tance from the body when it is not diſturbed by heat,
or other cauſes. Since that, other experiments of the
like kind have been publiſhed in a- work, wherein
my late worthy friend Dr. Hoadly was concerned
with me, Among the proofs therein | given, is a Cu-
