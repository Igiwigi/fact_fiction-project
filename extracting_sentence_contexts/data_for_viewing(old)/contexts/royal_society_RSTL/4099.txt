plate, beyond the photogenic lines, the red, orange or yellow rays; for the reason,
that if they were brought to the same point they would tend to neutralize and destroy
the effect of the photogenic rays.

In October 1846, M. LzrgBouss announced to the Paris Academy of Sciences that
the red rays prevented the action of the photogenic rays ; this announcement induced
Messrs. FoucauLT and Fizgav to publish immediately similar results, which they had
previously consigned to the Academy in a sealed memoir, bearing date May 1846.

These communications of Messrs. LEREBouss, Foucaulr and F1zeav, led Dr. Dra-
PER to write a letter, published in the Philosophical Magazine of February last, re
peating his observations on the spectrum of Virginia, adding several other analogous
facts confirming the theory of a protecting and even destroying action exercised by
the least refrangible rays. Dr. Dares, in the same letter, said that the rays which
protect the plate from ordinary photogenic action are themselves onpeble, when
isolated, of producing a peculiar photogenie effect.

Soon after the publication of M. Ep. BecquertL's memoir, M. Gaupix made some
analogous researches on the Daguerreotype plate; and he sncceeded in developing
an image as perfect as that produced by mercury, by submitting the plate, when
taken from the camera obscura, to the action of light alone under a yellow glass, and
without any subsequent exposure to mercury,

This curious discovery gave some hope that, from the supposed continuing action
of the red and yellow glasses, by submitting the plate alternately, or simultaneously,
