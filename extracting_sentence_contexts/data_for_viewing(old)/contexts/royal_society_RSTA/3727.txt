discontinuity lines is ¢ = 40° and wp = 0.143 — 0.083i. Note that, as in the single folding case, only
the real part of the solution exhibits folding.

The formation of single and cross folding patterns in the constrained Cosserat material is more
clearly depicted in figure 4, where the real part of the out-of-plane dimensionless displacement is
plotted in a region close to the point of application of the concentrated force. It is observed that in
both cases the folding angle decays away from the origin.

(b) The role of microinertia

The role of microinertia is investigated in this section, as connected to the formation of folding
patterns. An inspection of equation (4.15) shows that the microinertia lengths (11, h22) are related
to the (lower) second-order spatial derivatives of the out-of-plane displacement. In fact, for fixed

that the real part (a) of the displacement w exhibits single folding along the discontinuity line x = 0. (Online version in colour.)
