They contain both the work which has
been done by the Survey as a contribution to geodesy, as well as what has been —
executed as a basis for the topography of India, But they are thick, bulky volumes,
and are not very readily accessible, though they have been widely distributed to
public libraries. The results of the geodetic operations may, however, be summarized —
and capitulated in a comparatively small space; it seems desirable that this should -
be done, in order to place them within convenient reach of all mathematicians wishing —
to investigate the figure of the earth. I have therefore extracted from the published —
volumes all that is of essential importance in relation to geodesy, and added to it
several latitude determinations which I have recently received from the Survey and —
which have not as yet been published, all which I trust will be found of convenience —
and utility in future geodetic investigations. :
I now propose to give first a general sketch of the operations from their origin to. ‘
their conclusion; then to describe the measurements of the base-lines and the
principal angles, the instruments employed, and the method which was taken to bring
the very vast amount of measurements, each one necessarily fallible, into harmony —
with each other, so as to secure the smallest possible disturbance of the original facts —
of observation. The next thing will be to give a brief description of the instruments —
and methods employed for the latitude observations, and a synopsis of the results, and
to do the same for the electro-telegraphic determinations of differences of longitude 5
then to examine the extent to which these operations have been influenced by local
deflections of the plumb-line on the meridian and on the prime vertical. It will be.
seen that great deflections of the plumb-line are met with, not only in the vicinity
mountain masses, but in plains where there are no elevations or irregularities
