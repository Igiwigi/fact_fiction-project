As
in the case of Psilophyton princeps this feature became evident in isolated macerated
portions of the incrustation, though it was not noticeable in the specimen on
the rock. These brief references to early microphyllous plants will suffice to show that there are
indications of a series in complexity and specialisation from the type of Psilophyton,
through that of Thursophyton and Asterorylon, to that found in the Lycopodiales. Our
detailed knowledge of the pertinent facts for these and other early microphyllous forms
is still very inadequate. Sufficient has been said to indicate the interest, for com-
parative purposes, of additional information regarding the appendages of any of these
plants as contributing to the solution of the morphological problem of the origin of the
small Lycopod-type of leaf. The details regarding the sporangia that are described in this paper do not call for
much discussion.
