However, status signals do not provide information about
rank per se. Polistes dominula paper wasps have both chemical
signals of dominance and visual signals of status. On stable
nests, Polistes use chemical signals to assess which individual
is the dominant queen and chemical signals of dominance
change as an individual’s rank changes [138,139]. Polistes dom-
inula also have visual signals that are used to assess the fighting
ability of unknown rivals. The visual signals of fighting ability
probably minimize the cost of conflict by allowing individuals
to avoid escalated conflict with strong rivals [46,140]. Signals of
fighting ability are one of multiple factors that mediate domi-
nance hierarchy establishment, but they are not involved in
maintaining hierarchies on nests. In fact, wasps ignore visual
status signals on stable nests [141].

4. Opportunities for future research

Dominance hierarchies have been the focus of much research
in the 100 years since Schjelderup-Ebbe’s [2,142] pioneering
work in domestic fowl. It has become clear that dominance
relationships are common in social taxa, as they provide a
way for interacting animals to manage the trade-offs inherent
in social interactions. New methods and analyses have facili-
tated recent advances in our understanding of the diversity
and complexity of dominance interactions [77,143,144].
