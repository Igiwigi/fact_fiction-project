Considerations of space must also be borne in mind. Diurnal
3 inequalities for each of the 132 months of the eleven years—let alone shorter periods
F of the year—for H, V, N, W, T and I would have entailed printing an immense mass
& of figures. As a matter of fact, diurnal inequalities were calculated for H and V
2 from each of the 132 months, but not for the other elements. The H and V ranges
from these 132 inequalities are given later, but it was decided to publish for each of
these elements only four tables of diurnal inequalities. Thus, in the case of H, Table V.
gives the 12 diurnal inequalities obtained by combining all the months of the same
name in the 11 years, three diurnal inequalities for the seasons winter (November to
February), equinox (March, April, September and October) and summer (May to
August), and finally the mean diurnal inequality for the whole year.
