Rerzrus (1892, p. 15), after investigating the giant fibres of Lumbricus,* agreed
with von LennosséK that these elements could scarcely be considered to be nerve
fibres because : (1) they resist staining by Goxar's method ; (2) they never branch ;
and (3) they do not arise from cells. The particular staining reaction upon which such great dependence for specific
staining and diagnosis of nerve elements was placed is admittedly very capricious ;
there are many undoubted nervous structures in almost any Golgi preparation
which have not been blackened by this process, and therefore it cannot be relied upon
as a test for nerve elements. As a matter of fact, ApATHy and others have since
shown that these very structures investigated by von Lennossik and Rerazius,
namely, the giant fibres of Zumbricus, contain typical neurofibrillee and are certainly
nervous in spite of their non-impregnation by the method of Gouer. The giant fibres

* It is worthy of note that the majority of those who haye denied the nervous nature of the giant fibres
have confined their attention to the examination of these structures in Oligochwtes,
