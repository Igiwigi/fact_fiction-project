VS ON THe ACTION OF THE VAGUs NERVE.

E Ever since the brothers WEBtr discovered that stimulation of the vagus nerve

S cansed the heart to stand till, physiologists have been incessantly endeavouring to
discover the reason of this standstill, with the result that an enormous mass of facts
in connexion with the action of the nerve has been accumulated, and a variety of
hypotheses have been snggested to explain these facts.

Thus it was found that the vagus at one time causes complete stoppage, at another
only slowing of the heart's rhythm ; this fact has led to the view that the complete
cexxation of beats is simply a prolonged slowing, and therefore that the nerve by its

_ direct action upon the motor ganglia causes the discharges from the ganglia to take
Place at a glower rate.
