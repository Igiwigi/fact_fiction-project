Such values, as we see above, could be deduced from the modified
Galtonian law by taking y greater than unity,* but this would involve values for
the parental correlation sensibly less than those given by theory. We are again
compelled to assert that the modified as well as the unmodified theory of blended
inheritance, based on the Galtonian law, does not fit the facts. The above values,
however, are quite compatible with the theory of exclusive inheritance on the
assumption that there is an individual (not a sexual) prepotency from one pairing to
another. (ii.)
