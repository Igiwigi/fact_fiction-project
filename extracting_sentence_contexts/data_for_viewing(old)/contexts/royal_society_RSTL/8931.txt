DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL IN THE BATRACHIA. 641

There was, we saw, however, such a lamina, the first starting-point in the formation
of the Frog's girdle-hone ; and it existed when ossification of the actnal cartilage had
barely set. in (see © Frog's Skull,” plate viii. fig. 7, eth. p. 173, stage 9th). In that
observation I was right as to the bone, but did not fully see that the ossification of the
underlying cartilage right and left took place independently of, but in consonance with,
this ectosteal © superethmoidal ” plate. The fact is that the girdle-bone in the frog is
formed in the same way as its ** suprascapula,” the onter and inner bony growths being,
at first, quite independent of each other (© Shoulder-girdle and Sternum,” plate v. var.
figs., 8.8c., P. 79). In the common Toad and Frog this upper plate s00n coalesces
with the circle of bone which is formed around the ethmoidal region, changing the
solid cartilage into dense bone (ce © Frog's Skull,” plate ix. var. figs., eth.).

In Dactylethra this does not take place; here (Plate 59. figs. 1 & 3, 8.eth.) a large
elegant © supraethmoidal ” plate lies unattached on the surface of the unossified
ethmoidal cincture, which in the frog is marked out by being bony, whilst in this type
it is mapped out yery exactly, behind, by the arrest of bony deposit, and in front by
the presence of the nasal membranes. The overlying © supraethmoid ” is a common
bone among Ganoid and Teleostean Fishes (+ Salmon's Skull,” plate vii. fig. 1, eth.); it
