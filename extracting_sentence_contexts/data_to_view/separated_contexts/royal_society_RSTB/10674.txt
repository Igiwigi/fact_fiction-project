Because 53BP1 functions to limit end-resection and
specific DSB repair proteins to the chromatin. These include blocks HR [165-169], this implies that Tip60 opposes 53BP1
methylation of lysine 20 (H4K20me2), which is required for binding. In fact, acetylation of H4K16 by Tip60 blocks binding

53BP1 binding, and acetylation of lysines 5, 8, 12 and 16, of 53BP1 to the adjacent H4K20me2 [77,170]. Further, the


Tip60 complex can itself bind to H4K20me2 (through the damage signalling, and provide a mechanism for controlling Jj

MBTD1 complex) and limit ubiquitination of H2A by directly the spreading of damage-induced chromatin modification.

acetylating the H2A ubiquitin site [37]. Although the Tip60 Although BRD4 can bind directly to H4Ac [179,180], BRD4

complex itself can bind to H4K20me?2 [37], whether this inter- does not accumulate at DSBs [61].
