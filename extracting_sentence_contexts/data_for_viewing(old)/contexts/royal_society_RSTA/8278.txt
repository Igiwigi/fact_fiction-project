largely concerned with alloy steels during the whole of this period, the author maintains
that the steel alloys produced by Farapay more than a century ago constituted another
proof of his genius and foresight. They remain of great interest and importance, even
to-day, and they represent a research which was certainly no failure, but rather a column

built well and firmly as far as it went and then abandoned by its builder and others for
reasons not now known, when it might eventually have been continued, as it was later
by others, to a successful issue. Failure, as judged by the lack of continued practical
application and development, lay not in Farapay’s conception and research but in
the fact that his work was not continued by others when he laid it aside. Tt must be
remembered that outside certain comparatively small requirements, steel was then but
little used, wrought iron was the material of the day. As showing this, it is doubtful
whether an appreciable quantity of steel made more than a hundred years ago could be
found to-day except in Museum and Collection specimens. Steel formerly made has
disappeared, most of it, too, by corrosion.

Without doubt, no one before Farapay—whether metallurgist, chemist, physicist
or engineer—had ever experimented with so many elements in combination with iron.
At that time, however, there was neither the same opportunity for continued research
as there was later in the way of knowledge and resources, nor the same spur to investiga-
tion in the shape of insistent demand for steels of special quality, as regards mechanical
strength, corrosion and other factors. In this sense, Farapay’s research was long
