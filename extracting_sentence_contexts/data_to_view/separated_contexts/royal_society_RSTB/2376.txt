This view was, perhaps, a natural consequence of the assumption that
the Hymenophyllaceze are a primitive parent type; those who do not share this belief
will be free from the demands which it has made on the morphological faith of a
generation of botanists. F

As against this view of Pranti, that the sorus is a lacinia (Blattstrahl) I prefer
the alternative, which he rejects, viz., that it is merely a group of sporangia, and we
shall presently see how the existence of certain definite types of sorus with elongated
receptacle and protective indusium may be looked upon as results of specialisation of
other simpler types. The fact that a vascular supply runs to the base of the sorus,

or is even continuous into the receptacle, carries for me no morphological weight
whatever, as determining the nature of the sorus.
