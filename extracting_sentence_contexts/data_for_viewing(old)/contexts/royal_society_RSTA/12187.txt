_ We may not surmount the difficulty by the assumption that, in addition to the
finite resistance to rotation which is the cause of the propagation of the radiation, the
medium also possesses an enormously greater static resistance to rotations of some
more fine-grained structure, and that the surface integral of the rotation over any
surface enclosing a vortex-atom is a positive constant, of course definite and unchange-
able in value for each atom ; for this would lead to gravitational repulsion instead of
attraction. The term must be in the kinetic energy, not in the potential energy of

of gyrostatic elements spinning indifferently in all directions, and linked into a
system by an arrangement like idle-wheels between them, in fact by an ideal system
universal ball-bearings, the kinetic energy function would have a rotatory part

connecting mechanism to be a continuous function of position in the system.
