modern forms, to consist only of the first adambulacral fused to the second
ambulacral.‚Äù In JAEKEL's paper there is no statement to this effect, nor can we
agree that his figures even suggest the loss of the first ambulacral ossicles.

Paleozoic Ophiuroidea other than Lapworthura.

It has already been stated that in its main features the structure of Lapworthura
is typical of Silurian and Devonian Ophiuroidea, and that for this reason we propose
to institute a new group, Protophiuroidea, to include all Silurian and Devonian
Ophiuroidea with the exception of Eucladia and its ally, Euthemon. These genera
were placed by one of us (2, 1899) in an order of Ophiuroidea, the Ophiocistia.
Batuer (3, 1907) has recently made the very probable suggestion that the structures
regarded as muscular arms are, in fact, gigantic scale-covered tube-feet. Thus the
Ophiocistia, as far as we know them, agree with Ophiuroidea only in the possession
of an actinal madreporite and of a buccal armature ; these characters alone are not
sufficient to justify the inclusion of these fossils in the Ophiuroidea. The Ophiocistia
are, therefore, regarded as a class of Echinodermata, possibly allied to the
Ophiuroidea.

The diagnostic characters of the group Protophiuroidea are, as already stated,
(1) the completeness of the ambulacral series; (2) the meeting of the ambulacral
series of adjacent arms on the abactinal surface of the jaws (ad,); and (3) the
absence of upper and under arm-plates. In respect of these three characters the
structure of the Protophiuroidea is Asteroid in nature. The actinal position of the
madreporite is also shared by some of the early Asteroidea, so that the sharp
