interpretation of the few facts at his command by numerous small unrecorded and
even subconscious observations absorbed in the course of the experiments. For this
reason, perhaps, though numerous accounts are given of the courting habits of
butterflies, no opinion is usually ventured as to their general bearing. In the present
case it seems better to place on record the opinions formed during the experiments,

so that future observers may at least be on the watch for further facts on the subject
to be obtained from other species.

In the case of polytes, both sexes emerge from the pupa in the morning, frequently
about 8 o'clock, and the male is usually quiescent for the greater part of the day,
possibly taking a short flight in the afternoon, but making no attempt to pair. On
the following day the male is ready to pair, and, if well fed, is willing to do so on all
occasions until death, which in captivity occurred seven or eight days after emergence.
Only a single pairing was usually made by one male, though two pairings were not
infrequent, and the record numbers were five pairings, of which two only were fertile,
and four pairings, all of which were fertile.

In the case of the female, there were in captivity two distinct periods during which
