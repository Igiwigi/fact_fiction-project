By this means a continuous record of the temperature at
_ three positions in the air bath may be readily obtained, but as regards each of the
three positions this record is intermittent, and the indications afforded by each
individual thermo-junction form a dotted not a continuous line. The intermittence is,
however, very rapid, and the result is three clear and distinct time-temperature
records which enable any variation in temperature to be readily detected and
measured. The records, which are very numerous, show that while there was no
“rapid variation of temperature. there was, however, a gradual fall in temperature
from the beginning to the end of the experiment, and this is due to the fact that
athe burners became slightly obstructed by the products of the combustion of the
has, and in experiments which are now in progress a thermostat is employed. The
sional slight adjustment of the gas-taps by hand in accordance with the indications
2f the thermo-junctions rendered it possible to maintain a very constant temperature. Much care was taken to prove that the method of inserting the thermo-junctions
“lown a central tube really indicated the mean differences of temperature between the
Gipper, middle and lower portions of the bath, and it was shown that there was no
Bbject in continuing the use of a lead bath which was first adopted, as it greatly
eget the manipulation.
& Now that the possibility of making accurate measurements on the diffusion of
@rolten metals has been demonstrated, and as it has been shown that convection
rrents are not established, even when the temperatures at the top and the bottom
-2f the diffusion tubes only differ by 35° C., it will be well to attempt to do without
his graduated temperature altogether, trusting to the difference in densities of the
golvent and the diffusing metal.
