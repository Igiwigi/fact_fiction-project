at opposite ends of the Island, at the extreme west and extreme east, where very
different climatic conditions prevail.

Thad thought it possible this investigation might show that the occupation of F.
had some general relation to the differences observed in the proportion of the sexes
produced in different provinces, but as a general rule this is not apparent. Roughly
speaking, the 1899 Census shows there are 490,000 white F. in the island, and of
these only 1Â°63 per cent. are engaged in any business other than household duties in
their own homes or as domestic servants. There are no doubt great differences in
household work in different provinces ; where agriculture is the chief interest, home
life will be different from what it is where mining or fishing or manufactures prevail,
but it is not justifiable, so far as I can see, with the meagre amount of knowledge
I possess of the facts, to attempt to formulate any theoretical explanation of the
differences, which are indeed apparent in various provinces, on any such grounds.

T have also failed to discover that the proportion of the sexes produced has any
close relation to the physical characteristics of the various provinces: there is as wide
variation in the results obtained for the high and hilly as for the low-lying provinces.
Broadly speaking a higher proportion of M. are produced in the westerly than in the
easterly provinces and more uniform results are obtained for the central provinces
than for those to the east or west of them ; it is quite possible, therefore, that physical
conditions might be found to exercise influence if sufficiently large figures were
available ; as it is, however, with the exception of Pinar in the extreme west and
Oriente in the extreme east, to which attention has already been drawn, the
