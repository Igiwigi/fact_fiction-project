external opening. The nerves of the ear pa outwards from the brain, and
appear to terminate at onee on the external ſurtace of the ſwel-
ling of the ſemi-circular tubes above deſcribed. They do not
appear to- paſs. through thoſe tubes ſo-as to get on the inſide, as

live fiſh which only tends to prove this fact ; but 1 will mention
Zone experiment, to ſhew that founds affe&t them much, and is

A1762, when I was in Portugal, I obſerved in a nobleman's
-2garden, near Liſbon, a ſmall fiſh-pond, full of different kinds

by forming a bank all round.
