the constant temperature of 62° F, with the electric thermostat; that is, the fact that
the rulings now being employed are on speculum metal. When further experience of
these rulings has been gained, however, the author feels convinced that we shall be

and, therefore, assuming the first difficulty overcome, directly on the bar itself. Gold and invar are not so promising, the former being apparently too soft and the
latter too hard.
