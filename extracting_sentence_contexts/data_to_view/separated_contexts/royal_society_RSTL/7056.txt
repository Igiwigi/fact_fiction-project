MrrcueLL of Philadelphia discovered a power in gases to
_ india-rubber in a thin sheet, or in the form of the little transparent balloons
hich Dr. MrrcneLL was the first to prepare from that substance. He remarked in
Particular that such balloons collapse sooner when inflated with hydrogen than with
atmospheric air, and still s0oner when filled with carbonic acid; and he connected the
latter fact with the observation that a solid piece of india-rubber is capable of absorbing
its own volume of carbonic acid when left long enough in the pure gas. By means of @
Proper arrangement, Dr. MrrcuelL found that various gases passed spontaneously
through the caoutchouc membrane, when there was air on the other side,; with different
degrees of velocity. * Ammonia transmitted in 1 minute as much as sulphuretted
hydrogen in 24 minutes, cyanogen in 3+ minutes, carbonic acid in 53 minutes, nitrous
oxide in 64 minutes, arsenietted hydrogen in 274 minutes, olefiant gas in 28 minates,

hydrogen in 374 minutes, oxygen in 1 hour and 53 minutes, carbonic oxide in 2 hours
