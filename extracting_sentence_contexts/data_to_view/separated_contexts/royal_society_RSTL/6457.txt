Then, since the velocity is the complete differential
coefficient of the radius vector R of the particle, and since &, y, 2 are the components of

"These formulee simply express the fact, that the absolute velocity is equivalent to the
relative velocity together with det (Q, R).

v., 2,, ». be the components of the particle's velocity V, and let f., f,, f. be the components
of the particle's acceleration.
