becomes invaginated to form mesoderm. Secondly, at a later stage, there is a movement
along the primitive streak, from the anterior towards the posterior, by which the
material of the notochord and somites is drawn away from its original concentration
in the anterior part of the primitive streak, and comes to lie in its final position. There
is no particular reason for supposing that these movements would be present in the
inducing epiblast but not in the induced, therefore it is to be expected that the induced
neural plate would be co-extensive with the inducer. In other words, conditions
here are not parallel to those found in the Urodeles: in that group, the neural plate
stretches away in front of the region of invagination and an implanted dorsal lip of the
blastopore may therefore induce a plate not all of which overlies graft tissues. In
the chick, since the neural plate is co-extensive, or nearly so, with the region of invagina-
tion, it is to be expected that the whole of the induced plate will overlie implanted
material. This is, in fact, usually the case. In some cases, however, the induced plate
extends rather further posterior than the inducing plate; this is probably due to the
development of the posterior part of the inducing plate being obscured or prevented
by the unfavourable conditions under which it is growing.

The question of the possible orientation of induced plates is of interest ; the orientation
is, of course, determined by that of the inducing plate, but it is interesting to inquire
whether a medullary plate can be induced at any angle to the normal neural plate of
the same epiblast. It appears to be true that they can be induced in any orientation.
Thus in 500 they are nearly parallel, in 459 they make an angle of about 40° (or perhaps
130°), in 479 they are at about 150°. The most interesting case is 349. Here the
primitive streaks are at right angles, but only one medullary plate is visible in the
