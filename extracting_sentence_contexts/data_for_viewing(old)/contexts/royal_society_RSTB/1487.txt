gyrus just behind that last dealt with is the one excitation of which results in arrest
of the cords in abduction. It is situated just below the level of the anterior end of
the anterior ecto-sylvian sulcus (see fig. 1) and corresponds closely to the focus from
which Horsiey and Semon obtained abduction of the vocal cords in the cat. When
this focus is stimulated the vocal cords are arrested in abduction, as is shown in fig. 7,
a tracing taken under such circumstances. It is an effect more readily obtained than
the last, but like it can only be evoked in a stage of moderate ether narcosis, as
excitation of the same area in deeper narcosis results in slowing of the movements of
the cords, or arrest in adduction, according to the precise degree of narcosis.

7. Intensification and Acceleration of the Movements of the Vocal Cords.—This is
not nearly so easy to demonstrate in the dog as compared with the cat, owing to the
fact that the movements of the dog’s cords are as a rule very energetic, except in the
deeper stages of narcosis. This being the case, in order to show the effect well in
dogs, it is as a rule necessary to place the animal as deeply under the influence of
ether as is necessary to obtain slowing of the movements of the cords on excitation of

the two areas last described. Thus, in deep ether narcosis, at a stage in which
excitation of both the area for arrest in adduction and that for arrest in abduction
usually results in slowing of the movements of the cords, excitation of this focus,
