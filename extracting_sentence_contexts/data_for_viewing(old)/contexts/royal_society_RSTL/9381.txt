Section X.â€”General Results of the Investigation.

Combining the results of the two series of experiments, it seems to me most probable
that FRreEsNEL's theory is only true as a firs} approximation.

Both series of observations have led to the discovery of considerable deviation from
the theory, unless we assume errors in the experiments, especially in the determination
of the position of the planes of the prisms with reference to the axes of the crystals,
which are greatly in excess of the amounts we can reasonably expect.

Tt will be noticed that the values taken for the constants p, and jy, in the two parts
of the paper differ by 0002 and 00017 respectively. This is due to the fact that the
two crystals used were different. RupBERG (PocaG. Annalen, vol. xvii., p. 1) found
differences of as much as 0004 in the values of p, deduced from two specimens of
arragonite.

It may be objected that the variations between theory and experiment are not in
exactly the same direction in the two Parts ; but we must remember (1) that the
arcs investigated are taken from entirely different portions of the surface ; (2) in the
first Part, the approximately elliptic section belongs to the outer sheet; in the second,

to the inner sheeb of the wave surface.
