the friction of the air, just as in the clock : but there is another conceivable cause of
the limit; and this is, that the force which causes the motion diminishes with the velo-
city. Fortunately, however, there is another test by which the resistance may be
examined, a test altogether independent of the action of light or heat. This is the
rate at which the mill comes to rest when the light is turned off, If the pivot were
the only source of resistance the time required for the mill to come to rest would be as
the speed; that is to say, if it required 15 seconds for the mill to come to rest when
making 10 revolutions per minute, it would require 150 seconds to come to rest from
100 turns per minute. In fact, however, my mill, which requires 15 seconds to come
to rest from 10 revolutions, does not take 30 to come to rest from 100 revolutions.
In these experiments the wheel was set in motion by turning the envelope, and not by
the aid of light or heat. We have, therefore, conclusive evidence that the resistance
is not merely that of the pivot (which, in fact, is 80 small as to be inappreciable); and
the only other resistance of which we know*Â® is that of the air. But this is not all.

The behaviour of the mill furnishes us with the exact law of the resistance ; and this
is identical with the law of the resistance of air in a highly rarefied condition, a law
distinctly special in its character.

The resistance which bodies experience in moving through the atmosphere at consi-
derable velocities is proportional to the square of the velocity ; but if the velocity is
very small, less than one tenth of a foot per second, then, as Prof. SrokEs has shown,
the resistance is nearly proportional to the velocity, Now, s0 faras this latter resistance
goes, Prof. MaxwerL has shown the singular fact that, although it depends on the
nature, it is independent of the density of the air or gas. A body moving at a very
