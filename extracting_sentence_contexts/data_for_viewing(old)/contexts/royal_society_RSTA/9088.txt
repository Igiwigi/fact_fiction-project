head of an observer at a distance. On the contrary, when travelling with the wind,
the wave-front is continually tilted downwards, thus explaining the familiar fact that
sound may be more easily heard, and at a greater distance, when the observer is to
leeward of the source. This explanation was given independently by Rrynoups*
and confirmed by a number of observations. These conclusions have been supported,
on the whole, by the results of the various fog-signal tests already referred to
During the last few years, through the development of aviation, a great deal of
attention has been directed to the investigation of the structure of the atmosphere.
Tt has been known for a long time that the wind near the earth’s surface is the seat
S of innumerable eddies.+ Quite recently the subject of eddy motion in the atmosphere
, has been definitely formulated in mathematical terms by Tayior.{t Observations by
= Drves§ and others on the gustiness of the wind are interpreted by Taynor as
@. indicating that the eddy-motion has a tolerably regular structure, and that in a wind
“” of given velocity and vertical gradient, a fairly definite diameter may be assigned to
