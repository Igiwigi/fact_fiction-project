by the reasoning of last section *.

This explanation is extremely probable, and requires only to be confirmed by
observations of the tides of the adjacent parts, which might give the course of
the two component tides before they meet.

It has already been mentioned, that at Juan Fernandez the tide is said
to run 12 hours each way; and the same is stated to occur in other cases.
But the only instances in which we have accurate accounts of such phenomena
are two others, which also are found in the Indian Ocean, one on the north and

The two explanations appear to me to coincide, both in the forces to which they attribute the fact, and
in the laws of the phenomena to which they lead.
