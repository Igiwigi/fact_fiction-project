Other approaches have further focused on the role of the particular symmetry group G
which, according to Noether’s theorem, comes with the conservation laws. As a consequence, the
internal reference frame that one can define following this approach is heavily group dependent. This fact is clearly illustrated by the construction of the ‘model’ reference frame L(G): the square-
integrable functions on the group G (under the invariant Haar measure) equipped with the left
regular representation [8]. Hence, while this approach is mathematically very elegant, both in
its definition and its interaction with the system, the construction is very complex, and so is the
interaction required to implement the desired unitary on the system. Hence, one might wonder
what sort of complex physical system this frame actually represents, and how to physically
implement the necessary interaction.
