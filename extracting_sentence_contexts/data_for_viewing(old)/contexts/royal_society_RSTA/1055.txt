Regardless of how it is measured, the full magnetic excitation spectrum can be formalized in fa
the magnetic dynamic structure factor S*(Q,), which characterizes the magnetic correlations : s

in a magnetic material. This quantity is the space and time Fourier transform of the spin-spin
correlation function (s%s*(r,t)) between a reference spin component s* and another spin P(r, t)
at distance r and time t > 0. This fact makes it clear that similar information can, in principle
at least, be obtained by either frequency domain or the time domain. An excellent discussion
of such correlation functions is provided in books such as [10]. It is further known that these
correlations encode the interactions present in the magnetic Hamiltonian [11]. In general, fast
processes correspond to high frequencies and are often probed best in the frequency domain,
whereas the converse is true for slow processes.

Connecting I(Q, w,€,€’) to S(Q,a) isa topic of considerable active research [7,8,12-14]. But
the connection between these quantities is particularly well-established for Mott insulators based
on 5d° electrons, including iridates such as Sr2IrOy4 [15]. The interpretation of such spectral
information will be covered in §4.
