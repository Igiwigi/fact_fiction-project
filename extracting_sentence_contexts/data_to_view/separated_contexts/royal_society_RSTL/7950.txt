.Y(@, y)'%, viz. we have, according to the theory, 5=(10—6)+1, that is,
of the form in question there are 10 composite covariants connected by 6 syzygies, and
therefore equivalent to 10 —6, =4 asyzygetic covariants; but the number of asyzygetic
coyariants being =5, there is left, according to the theory, 1 irreducible covariant of the
form in question. The fact is that the 6 s8yzygies being interconnected and equivalent
to 5 independent syzygies only, the composite covariants are equivalent to 10—5, =5,
the full number of the asyzygetic coyariants. And similarly the theory as it stands
gives a non-existent irreducible coyariant (a. .Y(a, y)”. The theory being thus in error,
by reason that it omits to take account of the interconnexion of the syzygies, there is no
difficulty in conceiving that the effect is the introduction of an infinite series of non-
existent irreducible coyariants, which, when the error is corrected, will disappear, and
there will be left only a finite series of irreducible covariants.
