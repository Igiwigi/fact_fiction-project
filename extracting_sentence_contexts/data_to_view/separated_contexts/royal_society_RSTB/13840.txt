Top row: impact of 10 min bath application of TGOT on electrically evoked field EPSCs
in control and pair-bonded (a) males and (b) females. Middle row: impact of AM4113, a CB1 receptor antagonist, on the TGOT-induced potentiation recorded in pair-
bonded (c) males and (d) females. Bottom row: impact of GABAzine, a GABA, receptor antagonist, on the TGOT-induced potentiation recorded in pair-bonded (e)
males and (f) females. (Online version in colour.)

The fact that oxytocin agonism produces the same end of their partner, but not other women [51]. While the outcome
result in the NAc of male and female voles suggests it must in voles is the same in both sexes, just as the ability to form a
serve an adaptive physiological function. We hypothesize bond is shared by both partner, the mechanism underlying
that oxytocin-induced potentiation is a mechanism facilitat- oxytocin action appears to be sex-specific.
