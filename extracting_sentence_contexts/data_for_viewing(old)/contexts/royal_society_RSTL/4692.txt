CERTAIN APPLICATIONS TO THE THEORY OF DEFINITE INTEGRALS. TT5

Hence on substitution we have, since the number of values of y is 2,

2; S.. 2rs 2 2rn\_,* 9 m
Eſo(2)vp"da=3E;=re[p(a)] (cos + —Lean =) 4þn log {x (cos = Eton 74}.
which agrees with the result in question.

We now see why it is that, although in the investigation of the latter formula we
had to take distinct account of the terms u and v in the fraction X 3; in the final result
they are recombined, and only present themselves implicitly as component parts of X-

It is due to the fact that the equation determining the irrational factor of the original
integral wants a second term, 7. e. that p,=0.

Ifp,=1, the term—0| o(a)?* |log vin (11.) becomes —O[g(#)]p, log v, or —E0[@(«)]y, log v.
whence the theorem assumes the following form,

Eſo(z)ydr=E;=7[8(z)]y,{flog (x—9.)+ log v} =E;270[p(a)]y, log (u—y,v).

We may remark in concluding this section, that all general theorems like the above
for the comparison of algebraical transcendents are difficult of application, from the
2 necessity which they impose of developing logarithmic and irrational functions. This
difficulty we avoid by employing directly the theorem of transformation exemplified in
the earlier problems of this section. The application of that theorem requires only the
