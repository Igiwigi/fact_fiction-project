EZ I cannot find better words to express my conviction of the state of the question as now
= analyzed and tested than those of the gifted and lamented Palzontologist, whose criti-
6 cisms, as reproduced in his posthumous work, reiterated, as it were, from the grave, have
S overcome the reluctance which, till now, has kept me silent. In those words, therefore,
S I venture to remark, that, if my inferences and conclusions be favoured by acceptance,
A it will not imply that my opponents had * fallen into errors of observation and deserip-
tion”®, 80 much as it will expose © the fallacious train of reasoning which had led them
astray”. Should Thylacoleo be permitted to rest, after the facts and inferences from the scanty
fossil evidences at my command, in the section of diprotodont Marsupials, with Plagi-
aulaz, amongst the predaceous feeders on flesh, and not with Hypsiprymnus amongst the
harmless Zerbivora, it will only be further proof of the worth and truth of the principle
which CuvigR laid down as our guide in such dark routes in Paleontology.

what I deem the truth of the matter.
