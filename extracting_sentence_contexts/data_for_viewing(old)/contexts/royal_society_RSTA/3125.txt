In this form, it is evident that the information in (6.1) is implicitly contained in the joint
probability distribution for S; and the squared Brownian radius |B;|?. A quantum Lévy area
formula would similarly contain the same information as a joint distribution for the quantum
Lévy area SP) dQ(s) — Q(s) dP(s)), and the quantum-squared Brownian radius P(t)? + Q(t)*.


Unfortunately, these two processes do not commute with each other or with themselves at
different times.

However, help is at hand in the observation that P(t)? + Q(t)? is, like the Lévy area, itself an
iterated stochastic integral; in fact,

P(t? + Q(t)? =2 [eo dP(s) + Q(s) dQ(s)) + 207¢
0
=Ji(dP @ dP + dQ @ dQ + 207 dT),

where, following the notation of [22,24], pe means integrate the multi-differential which follows as
an iterated integral over [a,b]. Having removed the time integral which commutes with the rest,
we may find a substitute for the joint characteristic function, which is the exponential of a double
integral and thus problematic in a non-commutative context, as the corresponding double product
integral, to define which does not require commutativity.

A start has been made on this procedure [26].
