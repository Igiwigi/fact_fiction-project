mean of the TL of all consumer compartments. with a t-test. Instead, we used the non-parametric effect size


statistic Cliffs 6 introduced by Cliff [34] (J. Lequesne and
V. Girardin 2015, personal communication [14]), to test the differ-
ence between all unique pairwise comparisons between time-
steps (n = 120). Cliffâ€™s 5 estimates the probability that a randomly
selected value in one sample is higher than a randomly selected
value in the second sample minus the reverse probability. Invert-
ing the two samples changes the sign of the statistic. As in a f-
test, the null hypothesis is an absence of difference of the studied
variable between the two time steps and the alternative hypoth-
esis the fact that the difference is significant. This test is not
associated with a probability of rejection of the null hypothesis,
but it uses threshold values for 161 to indicate the magnitude
of difference [35]: negligible for less than 0.147, small for less
than 0.33, medium for less than 0.474 and otherwise large. We
calculated Cliffs 5 using the effsize library in R.

To compare the results generated at the flow, node and
system levels, we created bivariate plots (example in figure 4).
Each dot represents one comparison between two time-steps,
based on two levels. The tendency of dots to align to the diagonal
1:1 line is further illustrated by a fitted regression line (red line in
figures 5-7) going through the origin. The closer the slope was to
