June 1835, of the results of which an account was given in the Sixth Series of these
Researches *, it appeared that the diurnal inequality on the east coast of Scotland
was, during that semilunation, irregular, passing over a tide in the middle of the
series. This and other anomalies in the diurnal inequality, as it appears on the
coasts of the German Ocean, appear to show that the waters in that region are
affected by the mixture of more than one tide. In the most material point, however,
the observations of June 1835 confirm the results of our present inquiry ; namely, in
showing that the diurnal inequality travels more slowly than the other inequalities.
On the east coast of America, the changes of this inequality appear to be contempo-

raneous with the corresponding changes of the moon's declination, and the epoch is
zero. On the coasts of Spain, Portugal, and France, it is successively two and three
days. And this is quite consistent with the fact that this epoch is fovr days on the
coast of Cornwall and Devyonshire, fie days at Bristol, s:x at Liverpool, and ?welve
at Leith. That the diurnal inequality should thus creep from place to place on snc-
cessive days is difficult to explain ; but the laws of fluid motion are $0 little known,
that we cannot collect from hydraulical views any good reason for doubting this
curious fact. The fact is certainly not easily reconciled with our conception of the
