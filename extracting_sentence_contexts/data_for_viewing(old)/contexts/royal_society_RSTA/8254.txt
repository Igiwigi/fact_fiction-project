(a) 6 in. behind trailing edge.
(b) 12 in. behind trailing edge.

It should be noted that the drag of the slligi oylindles at an angle of satan of
2-84° is appreciably lower than that at 0°. The drag coefficient due to the tangential
forces for the aerofoil used in the experiments of Part III was found to be about 0-0030
in the region of minimum drag, that is, about 20 per cent. of the total drag.

(13) The position of the stagnation point for.an inviscid flow around the aerofoil has
been determined indirectly in the electrical tank,} in view of the fact that a direct deter-
mination was not possible. To establish the value of this work (given in Part III) an
investigation was undertaken to determine, firstly, how closely the flow mapped out in
the electrical tank resembled the flow of an inviscid fluid, especially in the region of the
stagnation point, and, secondly, whether it was possible to estimate from the flow pattern
the pressure distribution around the surface. This investigation will now be described.
