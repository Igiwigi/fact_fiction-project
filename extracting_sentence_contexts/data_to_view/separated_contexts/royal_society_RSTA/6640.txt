Extrapolating the experimental
results to these limiting concentrations we obtain 230 and 213 cal. for AH, and AH, respec-
tively. Thus if we assume z = 4, Nw is 38 cal. in pure benzene and 53 cal. in pure diphenyl. Although this appears to be a considerable increase in w, the change is in fact small when
