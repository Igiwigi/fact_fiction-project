It
does not, however, pretend to be an exact presentation of the experimental data. Portions for which no statistical observations are available have been filled in on the
basis of previous discussion. Further, in it we have disregarded the fact that the earliest sowings become
actually shorter than middle sowings, and have represented them as being all of the
same height. This has been done simply for convenience in construction of the
figure, as it does not affect the general argument. On examining this schema we see that the general form of the height curve of all
sowings is sigmoid, with a period of maximum elongation in the centre, where the
curve is steepest.
