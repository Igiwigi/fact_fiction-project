In fig. 16 the facts are clearly illustrated by the results
of comparative experiments carried out respectively in a sphere and in the cylinder. It is proposed to reserve the general discussion of the questions of dissociation and
rate of cooling for the third part of the present research ; we shall then be dealing
with gaseous mixtures of simple composition which will serve as a natural introduction
to the consideration of more complicated questions. A few words are, however,
necessary with regard to the somewhat unusual conditions under which the cooling
of the products of combustion of a solid explosive takes place.
