specialized subunits that carry distinct functions, ranging from energy production to translation,
folding, sorting and packaging of proteins, etc., typical examples being mitochondria, ribosomes,
the Golgi apparatus or the endoplasmic reticulum. To execute their function, organelles display
complex structures and internal organizations of large sets of proteins, whose type is closely
related to the containing unit.

A major hallmark of cell compartments and the cytoplasm is the high level of crowding with
small solutes, proteins, nucleic acids and membranes, such that macromolecules can reach a
volume fraction of 40%. In addition, cell membranes are stuffed with lipids and proteins, some of
which have large appendages or are tethered to skeletal proteins.

From the biological point of view, the consequences of crowding is still an open question. In
fact, crowding exerts important effects on the transport of macromolecules and their aggregation,
binding, reactivity and stability, cell metabolism, signalling and motility [5,6]. Given the wide
diversity of cellular environments, it is quite arduous to determine a few working principles in
the compartment organization. Crowding hinders solute diffusion, so that compartmentalized
metabolism requires diffusive barriers to be overcome. A key characteristic of the cellular
environments is the promiscuity of macromolecular interactions, such that functional interactions
have to compete with a large number of non-functional ones. As a consequence, interactions in
cells, such as protein-protein associations and enzyme reactions, are drastically altered. From the
physico-chemical point of view, it is possible already today to shed some light on how crowding
modulates the structural and dynamical features and on the role of non-functional interactions in
influencing the properties of proteins.
