Smale [7] describes the situation as follows: ‘I wish to point
out what an immense gap Gauss’s proof contained. It is a subtle point even today that a real
algebraic plane curve cannot enter a disk without leaving. In fact even though Gauss redid this
proof 50 years later, the gap remained. It was not until 1920 that Gauss’ proof was completed.’


e Let me quote several momentous statements chosen at random from the 1821 Cours
d’analyse by Cauchy [8], where he ‘set the foundation of rigour’ for modern Analysis:
‘Each continuous function is differentiable almost everywhere’, ‘The sum of a convergent
series of continuous functions is itself continuous’, ‘A function of several variables,
continuous in each variable is continuous’, ‘Any essential singularity is a pole’. Browsing this textbook for a few minutes, you will easily find dozens of similar
statements, ‘accompanied by complete and detailed proofs.’ (Of course, I know Lakatos’s
objections [9] that Cauchy made no mistakes, but was arguing in terms of non-standard
Analysis.
