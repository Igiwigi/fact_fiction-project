— Derive a map of continents from the disc-integrated signal and identify notable features,
such as rain forests, deserts and ice caps.

LOUPE shall perform its science goals by recording and demodulating the disc-integrated Stokes : Ss
vector of sunlight reflected from the Earth. The minimum and goal technical requirements for : =
LOUPE’s mission are stated in table 1. :8

In order to maximize deployment opportunities, LOUPE will be prototyped with platform : 3
versatility in mind, so that it may be suitable for multiple use cases (including geostationary, : 3
Lunar orbiting and landing scenarios). To keep a first proof-of-concept version of LOUPE as : 8
simple as possible, key trade-offs may be undertaken, such as limiting the instrument not to : s
measure the circular polarization V, but only F, Q and U. This trade-off is justified by the fact iS

that, although V has the potential to be considered a biosignature of homochiral life [29], V of
light reflected by an (exo)planet is several orders of magnitude lower than the linearly polarized
flux [25,35,36] and neglecting it introduces no significant errors in F, Q and U [37]. Some other
capabilities of LOUPE are functionally optional as well, such as radiometry, though its addition
could provide data for climate research. The additional capability to resolve the Earth at the
continent scale would also introduce additional signal processing difficulties, as the ability to
perform straightforward disc-integration of the signal is integral to LOUPE’s mission. Weighing
the advantage of a wide field of view with passive pointing against a narrower, baffled field of
view with better protection from the Solar glare, but a need for active pointing, is another topic
for contemplation in the design process.
