corresponding to the resistance chosen from (B). (d) The Effect of the Deviation of the Wave Form from the Sinusoidal Form.â€”In actual
fact the wave of electromotive force of the machine on open circuit is not sinusoidal, the
armature windings and field form being arranged to give a wave which is, neglecting high
frequency tooth ripples, trapezoidal in form, being illustrated in fig. 2. SORE = A SO eg S
