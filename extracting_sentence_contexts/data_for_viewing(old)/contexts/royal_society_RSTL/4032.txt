under consideration are much less strikingly observed. The borate of lead, however,
is a substance much more fusible, softening at the heat of boiling oil, and therefore
far more easily prepared in the form of glass plates and annealed ; and it possesses
as much magneto-rotative power over light as the silico-borate itself. Flint-glass
exhibits the property, but /in a less degree than the substances above. Crown-glass
shows it, but in a still smaller degree.

2177. Whilst employing erystalline bodies as diamagneties, I generally gave them
that, position in which they did not affect the polarized ray, and then induced the
magnetic curves through them. | As a class, they seemed to resist the assumption of
the rotating state.  Rock-salt and fluor-spar gave. evidence of the power in a slight
degree; and I think that a erystal of alum did the same, but its ray length in the
transparent part was 80 small that T could not ascertain the. fact decisively. Two
specimens of transparent fluor, lent me by Mr. Texxaxr, gave the effect.

2178. Rock-crystal, four inches across, gave no indications of action on the ray,
neither did smaller erystals, nor cubes about three-fourths of an inch in the side,
which were 80 cut as to. have two of their faces perpendicular to the axis of the
crystal (1692, 1693.), though they were examined in every direction.

2179. Tceland spar exhibited no 8igns of effect, either in the form of rhomboids,
or of cubes like those just described (1695.).

2180. Sulphate of baryta, sulphate of lime, and carbonate of s0da, were also without
action on the light.
