electrolyte and in fact is equivalent to Debye-Hiickel theory [49]. Thus, we see
that by suppressing spin fluctuations (i.e. setting H(r) = x7 M()) we recover the
Debye~Hiickel approximation of Castelnovo et al. [17].

Introducing the Fourier transformed field H(r)= V7! >, H(a) e4™ and

substituting into equation (8.4), we find

where V is the volume and we have used D/k = Bh and the fact that the field,
being derived from a scalar potential, is longitudinal to the wavevector. Since the
