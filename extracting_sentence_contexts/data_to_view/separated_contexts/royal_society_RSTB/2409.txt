OF SPORE-PRODUCING MEMBERS. 103

It is to be noted that in these cases there is no highly specialised stomium, such as is
found in many Leptosporangiate Ferns. They appear to illustrate just such non-
specialised dehiscence as might be expected in cases where there has been a shifting
of the line of dehiscence from the median to a lateral position. Though the facts
noted do not in any way demonstrate that such a shifting has taken place along any
sequence of descent, they at least countenance the suggestion that there probably has
been a change from the median to the lateral dehiscence. Taking now the position of the annulus as a whole, we see that it is oblique in the
Schizeeacer, Gleicheniacere, Hymenophyllacex, &c., while it is usually described as

& vertical in most of the Polypodiacese. The facts I have described above show that

“the one type graduates by almost imperceptible steps into the other, while even

Sin those which are described as having a vertical annulus, details may often be traced

2 which compare with those where it is oblique ; we shall not, therefore, look upon the

“A two types as essentially distinct.
