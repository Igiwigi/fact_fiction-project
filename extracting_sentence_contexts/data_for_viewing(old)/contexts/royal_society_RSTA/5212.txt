At this time, CERN’s immediate priority was to upgrade and fully exploit LEP. During 1995,
we persuaded the CERN Council to fund a final stage in the upgrade, which was not easy given
the very recent commitment to the LHC and the financial situation. In the following years, while
fighting the attack on the CERN budget described below, we were preparing the ground to ask
Council to allow operation of LEP to continue through the year 2000, which was finally agreed in
June 1998.

In June 1996, I decided that we had obtained sufficient funding from non-Member States to
make single stage construction of the LHC possible, and to bring forward the planned 1997
review of the construction timetable to December 1996. In August, however, there was a major
set-back when Germany, where the economy was in bad shape following re-unification, asked for
a cut of 8.5% in its contributions to CERN for two years and 9.3% thereafter, and similar cuts in
its contributions to all other international scientific organizations. Germany was in fact already
enjoying a temporary reduction in its contribution to CERN because of the difficulties caused
by re-unification. However, before I could point this out, the UK—where the Director General
of Research Councils, Sir John Cadogan, was trying to reduce expenditure on particle physics,
for which he had little sympathy—seized the opportunity to demand a large reduction for all
Member States.

Fighting this attack on the CERN budget had to be done quietly in order not to lose the
contributions of the non-Member States, who appeared to have been misled. There was an extra
difficulty in the UK where the particle physics community’s support for the CERN budget had
been undermined by Cadogan who had told them that cutting the CERN budget was the only
way to fund the UK’s contributions to the LHC detectors.
