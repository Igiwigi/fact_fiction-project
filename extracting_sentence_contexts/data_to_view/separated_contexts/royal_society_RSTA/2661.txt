Furthermore,
recent studies by Kawamura, Yamamoto and Ueda have revealed that the BK model under the
RSF law can also describe the slow-slip phenomena including afterslips and silent earthquakes
[43] (see also [44]). Afterslips are a long-lasting slow-slip process which takes place following
the high-speed rupture of main shock, while silent earthquakes are a slow-slip-only process
not accompanying any high-speed rupture nor emission of seismic waves. In fact, a recent
development in GPS technology and in high-density GPS and seismograph networks has revealed
these slow-slip phenomena where the fault sliding velocity is several orders of magnitude slower


than that of the standard high-speed rupture [45-53]. While such slow-slip phenomena have
turned out to be well reproducible by the BK model under the RSF law but are not describable by
the BK model under the simple velocity-weakening law. In this way, the 1D BK model under the
RSF law allows reproducing a variety of seismic slips within a single framework, including main
shocks, precursory nucleation processes, afterslips and silent earthquakes by varying only a few
model parameters.
