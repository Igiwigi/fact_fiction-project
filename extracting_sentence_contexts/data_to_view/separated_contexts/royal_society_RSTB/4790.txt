(or genera reckoned as such, ¢f. the discussion at the end of Section IV). As a matter
of fact the number of genera with 100 species or more in the Chrysomelide is only 16
(Table V) and we have to class some 65 genera as primordial (Table TV). Tables XI, XII and XIII show data arranged in the same form for the Cerambycine,
