This particular plasmoid structure was reminiscent of those identified at
the gas giants (see [60-63]), pointing to internal driving; however, the plasmoid signature was
succeeded by a post-plasmoid plasma sheet, indicating that solar wind-driven reconnection was
likely occurring between the magnetotail lobes [64]. It is hypothesized that these plasmoids are
common within the magnetotail of Uranus and may occur on timescales of approximately 17h
[61] or more often. Although plasmoids probably exist at Neptune as well, they were not detected
during the Voyager 2 flyby, likely due to the fact that the spacecraft trajectory did not cross the
tail current sheet.


4. Solar wind in the outer Solar System

The interaction between the solar wind and a planetary magnetosphere is often parameterized
in terms of the Alfvénic Mach number (Ma), which is a dimensionless comparison between the
solar wind’s dynamic and magnetic pressures. In the inner heliosphere, observations of lower Ma
values in the solar wind, and therefore low plasma f (the ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic
pressure) in the magnetosheath, have been attributed to the continuous solar wind-driven
dynamics.
