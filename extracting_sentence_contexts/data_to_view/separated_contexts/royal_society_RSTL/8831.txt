These all agree in showing that S, or the rate

of change of the coefficient of friction relatively to change of velocity, becomes greater
as the yelocity becomes less. This being 80 it is perfectly possible that at velocities
below 0:0002 foot per second, which is the lowest limit to which our observation may
be taken as extending, a considerable further increase of the coefficient may take place
before motion entirely ceases. It is in fact highly probable that in those cases in which the static coefficient of
friction is greater than the kinetic (that is, the coefficient which is observed when the

surfaces are moving at a moderate speed), the latter gradually increases when the
velocity becomes extremely small, 80 as to pass without discontinuity into the former. The experiments of CouLoMB show that the friction between surfaces at rest is itself not
constant, but increases as the time of rest is prolonged.
