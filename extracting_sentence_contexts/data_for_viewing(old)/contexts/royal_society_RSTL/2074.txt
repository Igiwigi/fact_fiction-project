That the manner in which the neryous influence affects the muscular fibre
is not essentially different from that in which it is affected by other stimulants
and sedatives.

That this influence is not an agent peculiar to the nervous system, but capa-
ble of existing elsewhere, and consequently not a vital power properly s0 called ;
which further appears from an agent which operates in inanimate nature being
capable of all its functions.

That the brain and spinal marrow therefore, 80 far from bestowing on the
muscular fibre its power, only supply an inanimate agent which, like all othe
such agents capable of affecting it, acts on it either as a stimulant or sedative,
according to the degree in which it is applied ; and that the whole of the facts
relating to this agent, prove its identity with voltaic electricity, which has
been found experimentally to be capable of all its functions.

Wer cannot review the phenomena of the animal economy without being
struck with the extent and variety of the functions of the neryous influence.
We not only find the intercourse between the animal and the external world
maintained Ã¾y it, the heart and vessels subjected to its controul, and secretion
and the other assimilating processes immediately dependent on it *, but that by
its means the animal body is formed into a whole, every part of it being capa-
ble of influencing every other. Can we be surprised then that it more exten-
sively than any of the other powers of that body influences its morbid states?
