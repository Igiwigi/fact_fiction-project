On the Relation between the Proportion of Oxygene and Chlo-
rine in Combination with several Metals. Errors being very common in chemical analyses, even in
those conducted most skilfully and carefully, all possible means
$hould be taken to discover them ; and no means, I think, pro-
mise to'be more effectual for this purpose, than the general
analogy of definite proportions. From a great variety of facts,
it appears that oxygene and chlorine combine with bodies in
the ratio of 7.5 to gg.6. With 1 part by weight of hydro-
gene, for example, 7.5 of oxygene unite to form water, and
33.6 of chlorine unite with the same proportion to produce
muriatic acid gas. To judge therefore of the accuracy of the
analyses of the preceding combinations of the metals and
chlorine, it is only necessary to compare them with the ana-
lyses of the oxides of the same metals.
