formance was evaluated using the continuous Boyce index
(CBI, where a model with a CBI>0 is considered better than
random [59,60]). Here, models with a CBI < 0.25 were discounted
from our further analyses, leaving 8791 species.

Many Cerrado region species are found only in either grass-
land, savannah or W&F stands [14], so a separate potential
species richness layer was calculated for each vegetation type.
Modelled species were assigned to one or more vegetation types
based upon the vegetation classification in Flora do Brasil [16]
and their corresponding MapBiomas landcover class (see elec-
tronic supplementary material, table S1). In recognition of the
fact that savannah vegetation with high woody cover (cerradao)
is classified as forest in MapBiomas [12], 1138 woody species
from the Flora do Brasil vegetation type ‘cerrado sensu lato’ were
also classified under W&F. Across Brazil, this resulted in 6233
W&E 2525 grassland and 3930 savannah species. Models were
summed from each vegetation type across the Cerrado region to
provide a potential species richness map for each restoration type.

(ii) Net vegetation biomass change

The estimated net total biomass (AGB +BGB) gained through
restoration was calculated for each potential restoration hectare,
based on the assigned restoration vegetation type. Localized
