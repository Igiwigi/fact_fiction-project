sesses nine such pairs of nerve extensions (figure 3). In
contrast with the vertebrate nervous system in which a
single spinal cord connects to the two brain hemispheres, pla-
narians have two nerve cords, one from each lobe.
Interestingly, the planarian nerve cords are connected by
additional nerve fibres, giving them their characteristic
ladder-like appearance (figure 4; for an extended discussion
of the planarian nervous system please see [3], chapter 9).

of their regeneration abilities, one of the species most adept at
this process, Girardia dorotocephala, only requires a fragment of
about 0.08 mm’, the equivalent of approximately 10 000 cells,
to achieve complete body regeneration [18-20]. As if this fact
was not remarkable enough, the regeneration capabilities of
some planarian species include the complete and correct recon-
stitution of their nervous tissue, including their brain [21-24].
It is difficult to overstate the potential relevance of these organ-
isms’ regenerative abilities for the possible development of
medical treatments for neurological diseases and injures. Inter-
estingly, there is also mounting evidence that decapitated
planarians that regenerate their heads partially retain some
learned habits or training acquired prior to the decapitation
event, a fact that is particularly relevant to the exploration of
where memories are stored in an organism [25-27].
