this respect in different individuals. The termination projects freely into the centre of
the perivisceral chamber, and here, as in the Terebratulide, there is no anus; the bul-
bous enlargement” is entire, exhibiting no opening whatever. This is perfectly obvious
in Rhynchonella psittacea, in which the facilities of examination are comparatively great,
on account of the terminal portion of the intestine being free and projecting into the
perivisceral cavity. I have, nevertheless, made every endeavour to find an anal perfora-
tion, both in this and in the Terebratulide. IT have made numerous dissections under a
powerful doublet ; T have removed the part and examined it with the microscope ; I have
filled the tube with fluid as a finger of a glove with air, and by pressure have attempted to
force a passage ; I have tried injections; but have equally, on all occasions, failed to dis-
cover an outlet, and have only sncceeded in demonstrating more and more clearly the *
cxecal nature of the terminal extremity of the alimentary canal. 'Þ herefore, how much
80ever it may be opposed to analogy and to authority, the fact must be recorded—there

is no anal orifice in Waldheimia, in Terebratulina, or in Rhynchonella.
In Rhynchonella the gastro-parietal and ilio-parietal bands, particularly the latter, are

longer than in Waldheimia. The last-mentioned bands, too, are united across the
intestine, their posterior margins being continuous and free. And not only these, but
