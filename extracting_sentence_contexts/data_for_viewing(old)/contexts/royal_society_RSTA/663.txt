However, note in the final panel, where vg =c/300, we still see points where S3=+1,
indicating the continued existence of C-points. Figure 2d shows the positions of the C-points
found in the modes marked I, II, ..., VI in figure 2a. Left-handed C-points are labelled red
(S3 =—1), whereas right-handed ones are blue (S3 = +1). L-lines (S3 =0) are marked by grey
contours. C-points always occur in pairs of opposite handedness, separated by an L-line. As
we approach the bandedge, we observe the C-points of opposite handedness approach each
other, until they annihilate at the position of the L-line. As a guide to the eye, we have marked
the approach of the C-points closest to the waveguide centre with a dashed line. (Far from the
bandedge we also see C-points with the same handedness come together in groups of three, two
of which are eliminated; similar behaviour can be seen in [37,38].)

In fact, C-points still exist for any wavevector arbitrarily close to the bandedge; it is only at
the bandedge that they collide and disappear. However, as the bandedge is approached, the left-
and right-handed C-points approach each other until they are very close (the pixelation in our
calculations means they are poorly resolved for vg < c/300). Note also that when two C-points of
opposite handedness annihilate on an L-line, a point at which the electric field strength is zero
results, referred to as a V-point [39] or ©-point [38]. Thus, as the two C-points approach, the
