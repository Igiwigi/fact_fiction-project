Since Mek inhibition also reduces expression of Gsk3 target
genes and leads to an increase in Akt phosphorylation, an
inhibitor of the Mek/Erk pathway that acts downstream of
Erk could potentially account for all observed X-dosage-
dependent effects [8]. It is, however, likely that a combination
of different X-linked genes shapes the X-dosage phenotype. The fact that X-dosage affects pluripotency and differen-
tiation has so far only been shown in mice since they are the
prime model system for mammalian development. In addition,
delayed in vivo development has been observed for female
embryos in several other species such as cows, rats and
humans [1]. For more detailed mechanistic studies, embryonic
stem cells from these species will be valuable model systems.
