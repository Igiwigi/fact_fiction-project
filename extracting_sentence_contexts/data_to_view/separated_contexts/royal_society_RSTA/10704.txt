No other eruption was attended by these circumstances; no second black cloud
involved in its mass the forest growth which for 90 years had clothed the surface of
the mountain, It had vanished like a fall of snow, and in its place was now a waste
of ashes. Carbonic acid and carbon gases there may be in the later outbursts,
but these are from the magma, original and not accidental ingredients. We may, in
fact, be certain that they are there, but we may be equally certain that they are not
the principal gaseous components, and that neither does their density determine the
behaviour of the heavy cloud, nor does their potential energy furnish the motive
torce which impels it. The gases emitted by voleanoes have been the subject of much study, though they
are still less known than any of the other products. In the interests of science it is
desirable that some day we may be able to obtain samples of the gaseous emanations


SOUFRIERE, AND ON A VISIT TO MONTAGNE PELER, IN. 1902, 519

| of Pel√©e and the Soufritre, It is to be hoped that the investigations of the French

- Commissioners will greatly advance our knowledge in this respect, for the gases
; of the Caribbean volcanoes may be supposed to present important points of
difference from those which accompany less violent and more continuous activity.
