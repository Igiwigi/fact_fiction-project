The dependence of the critical feedback rate n corresponding to the drift instability threshold
defined by equation (4.4) on the feedback phase Â¢ and carrier relaxation rate y is illustrated by
figure 4. In this figure, the curves labelled by different numbers correspond to different values
of y. Considering the fact that the feedback in equation (3.1) is introduced with the minus sign,
we see that the drift instability takes place only for those feedback phases when the interference
between the cavity field and the feedback field is destructive, i.e. when the cos function in the
denominator of the right-hand side of equation (4.4) is positive. On the contrary, when this
interference is constructive the feedback has a stabilizing effect on the LS. Furthermore, the
slower the carrier relaxation rate, the higher the drift instability threshold.
