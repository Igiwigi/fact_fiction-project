Of the Stomach.—This organ varies extremely both in shape and in size in the
Cryptocarpe and Phanerocarpze. But whatever its appearance, it will be always
found to be composed of two membranes, an inner and an outer. These differ but
little in structure ; both are cellular, but the inner is in general softer, less transparent
and more richly ciliated, while it usually contains but few thread-cells. The outer,
on the other hand, is dense, transparent, and either distinctly cellular or developed
into a muscular membrane. It may be ciliated or not, but it is usually thickly beset
with thread-cells, either scattered through its snbstance or concentrated upon more
or less raised papilla developed from its surface.

8. I would wish to lay particular stress upon the composition of this and other
organs of the Medus out of two distinct membranes, as I believe that it is one of the
essential peculiarities of their structure, and that a knowledge of the fact is of great
importance in investigating their homologies. I will call these two membranes as
such, and independently of any modification into particular organs, © foundation
membranes.”

9. When the stomach is attached to the disc, the outer membrane passes into the
general substance of the disc, while the inner becomes continuous with the lining
membrane of the canals. There is a larger or smaller space between the inner aper-
ture of the stomach and the openings of the canals, with which both communicate,
and which I will therefore call the © common cavity.”

10. In the Rhizostomidz the structure of the stomachs is fundamentally the
same, but they are very minute, and are collected upon the edges and extremities of
