Although there is a
relationship between BOLD and neural activity [58-60] that
has enabled advances in cognitive neuroscience, the interpret-
ation of BOLD response is not always straightforward [61]. For example, BOLD response is affected by the local vascular
anatomy [62,63], differs according to age [64], and certain
regions are susceptible to imaging artefacts. The fact that
BOLD does not simply reflect aggregate neural activity
(either synaptic or spiking) complicates its usage. On the positive side, BOLDâ€™s divergence from simple aggre-
gation presents some opportunities. Perhaps rather than just
reflecting grey matter activity, BOLD may also reflect white
matter [65-67] and astrocyte [68-71] activity as well.
