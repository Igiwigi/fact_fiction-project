membrane attachment as the primary cause of the instability
that leads to the Min-protein patterns.

An elegant description of a mechanism based on
cooperative MinD membrane attachment was formula-
ted shortly after the works described above. It suggests
that membrane-bound MinD linearly increases the MinD
binding rate [32]. Explicitly, the MinD attachment term is
given by

Taq = wa(1 + @aaCa + WdeCde) Cp. (2.7)

In fact, the term waeCae, Which indicates that MinD binding is
enhanced by membrane-bound MinD in any form, can be
omitted and pole-to-pole oscillations emerge [33].

All these mechanisms reproduce essential features of
the Min system in geometries that correspond to E. coli
cells. Notably, they exhibit a reduction of the oscillation
period with increasing MinE concentration. Furthermore,
they produce an intrinsic length scale and thus standing
waves with multiple nodes in long bacteria. For this
to happen, the reaction rate equation (2.3) needs to be
accompanied by an ADP to ATP exchange rate for cyto-
plasmic MinD that is below a critical value. Alternatively,
