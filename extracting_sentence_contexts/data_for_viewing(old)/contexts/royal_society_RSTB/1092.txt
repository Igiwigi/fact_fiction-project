‘SEARCHES INTO THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CEREBELLUM. 827

ebellum is looked on as a coadjutor and reinforcer of the great cerebro-
em, its action being considered quite different from the action of all other
he nervous system. Deficiency of the organ is attended by asthenia, atonia,
‘a, while absolute or partial paralysis of motion and sensation attends similar
of other parts of the nervous system. Luctant contends that the differ-
xe to the fact that the cerebellum forms a small system, relatively inde-
‘defects of which do not interfere with the passage of centripetal and centri-
pulses passing between the cerebrum and the periphery; and to the other
tit does not dominate over any territory exclusively reserved to itself, and
}mporaneously under the influence of the cerebro-spinal system. Lastly, the
«between the action of the cerebellum and the intervertebral ganglia is
, both the direct and indirect trophic actions being instanced as strikingly
; and to complete the parallelism, the reinforcing action of the intervertebral
the anterior roots, and on the muscles they innervate, is insisted on as
g closely the sthenic, tonic, and static action of the cerebellum.
