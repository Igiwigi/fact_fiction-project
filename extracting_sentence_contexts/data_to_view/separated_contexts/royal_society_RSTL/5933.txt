PropE880R WILLIAM THOMSON has published® a theoretical investigation of the subject

Hf temperature, T the temperature from absolute zero, e the expansibility by heat, p the
Sressure in pounds on the square foot, J the mechanical equivalent of the thermal unit
Sn foot-pounds, and K the capacity for heat in pounds of water, of a cubic foot of the
Huid employed. He has also given a Table of theoretical results for the compression of
Water and mercury. The investigation being established on the basis of well-ascertained
-Srinciples and facts, the correctness of the Table could not be reasonably doubted. Nevyertheless, believing that an experimental inquiry would be interesting if not im-
Fortant, I have ventured to offer the following to the notice of the Royal Society.
'> The only previous experiments on the subject of which I am aware are those of
al. Recxauir.
