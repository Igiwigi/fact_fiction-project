We might believe it to be owing to an evolution of electricity independent of the
muscular and proper current; but how can we suppose it 80, when we see that the
induced contraction propagates itself through certain insulating strata, as turpentine,
oil, &c., while it does not take place if we use an extremely thin plate of mica? It might
be supposed that the electricity developed in the muscular contraction could have acted
by induction. In this hypothesis it is clear why the turpentine does not stop the in-
duced contraction, but it still remains doubly obscure why with the extremely thin
plate of mica this should take place. I have made an experiment by covering a
galvanoscopic frog, placed upon a plate of glass, with a sheet of mica; the electric
discharge of a jar passes between the knobs of the universal discharger upon the sheet
of mica, and the contractions in the galvanoscopic frog are aroused. I hall not
occupy myself at this moment in analysing these facts ; it is sufficient at present to
prove that there must be induced contractions through the plate of mica if the occa-
sion of the phenomenon were an electric discharge. I will add finally, that I have
very many times attempted, and always uselessly, to awaken the contractions in the
frog, by holding the nerve of the galvanoscopic frog near and almost in contact with
a metallic conductor traversed by the electric current.

To place myself in favourable cireumstances that the induced current may be com-
plete in the frog, I prepare it in such a manner that a long nervous filament (that is,
one of the lumbar plexuses with its continuation in the thigh) may be uncovered. The
frog is otherwise intact, and the two legs touch each other. I support the frog with
silken threads, s0 that it may be horizontal, and that its nervous filament may be in
contact and parallel with the voltaic conductor which is varnished. When every
