In order to mitigate such issues, the creation of innovative ML algorithms, capable of
incorporating the domain knowledge, would facilitate the development of these models (e.g.
less data-hungry algorithms, faster training, larger interpretability) and the introduction of such
methodologies in the clinical practice, thus fostering trust in their use.

a) Limitations of the study

The frameworks presented some limitations. First, rhythm-based cardiac abnormalities were
not properly handled by our methodology. Given the fact that an altered rhythm may or may
not affect the regularity of the occurrence of any waves, it was not possible to define the one-
to-one match between the cardiac abnormality and a specific ECG wave. For example, Brady

bradycardia), one of the class detected correctly by the network (recall of 0.53), refers to a


very low heart rate. Typically, heart-rate alterations are quantified looking at the time intervals
between consecutive R peaks because of their ease of detection.
