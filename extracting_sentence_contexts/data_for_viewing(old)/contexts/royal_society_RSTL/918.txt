« been. very long exposed to water ;”* for Dr. Hic6ixs has
somewhere shewn that the heavy inflammable air, after stand-
ing long over water, leaves a larger residue of azote, on com-
bustion, than when recently prepared. It is probable also,
that the proportion of azote derived from the water, would in-
crease with the time of its exposure; and thus a fertile source
of error is suggested, which appears wholly to have escaped
Dr. AvsTiN's attention. In repeating his experiments, I was
careful that comparative ones, on two equal quantities of the

may be scen in Dr, PrresTLEY's Experiments on Air, Vol. I. P- 59, 158. I found
that oxygenous gas, from oxygenated muriate of pot-ash, acquired, by exposure a few
weeks to water, .125 its bulk of azotic gas.

intervention of any time that could vary the proportion of
azote in either of the gases.
