There is yet another point of importance to be noticed in the Tables on pages 608, 60
While the stations at the lower levels, Goalpara and Roorkee, as well as all others
on the plains, show but one annual maximum and one minimum of pressure, the former
in December, the latter in June or July, the two hill-stations (Darjeeling and Simla
have two maxima and two minima, like places on the Atlantic coast of Purope.
epochs of the maxima and minima are, however, very different in the two cases. absolute minimum of the year at these hill-stations coincides with that on the ane

and is doubtless due to the same cause ; but the absolute maximum falls in Novem!

at the former, and is followed by a fall, at first rapid, and gradually decreasing till March,
A small rise then takes place, which brings the mean pressure of April above that
February; it is, however, only temporary, and in May and June the pressure falls
rapidly to its minimum.

explain the apparent anomalies that haye led some authors, especially Mr. Lav@nros (Phys. Geog. pp.
