the picture as a whole) that a charge of electricity had been concentrated in a
comparatively small volume in the head of the cloud, and that the discharges took
place approximately along lines of force.

The mean height of the upper ends of the two discharges—the height of the
centre of the charged cloud-head according to this view—must have been just under
2 km., if its horizontal distance from the camera is taken as 11°7 km. The distance
and height may in fact have been somewhat greater, since the track of the long flash
may at some point of its course have been nearer the camera than the vertical flash,
and the distance deduced from the interval between the lightning and thunder is
that of the nearest point of the discharge.

VUI. Electric Field of a Thunder-cloud.

It is much more difficult to obtain direct information about the electric field of a
thunder-cloud than about the sudden changes produced in the field by lightning
discharges. The observed field may be the resultant of the fields of several thunder-
clouds superimposed upon the normal electric field; while a single instantaneous
change in the field will in general be due to the passage of one lightning flash, of
which the approximate distance may frequently be determined. Nothing approach-
