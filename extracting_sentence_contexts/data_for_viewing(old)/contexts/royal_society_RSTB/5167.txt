China. The reduction in size of the glaciers of this region may have resulted from
either a reduction of precipitation or from a fall in temperature due to some general
climatic change or from a variation in level. Mr. Kingpon Warp (1916, pp. 64-65)
made the interesting suggestion that the diminution of the glaciers on the mountains
near the Mekong and Yangtze was due to a decrease in the precipitation owing to a recent
uplift of the Irawadi-Salween divide ; its uprise would have deprived the mountains
to the E. of some of the precipitation which they had previously received. This view
assumed that the glaciers on the Irawadi-Salween divide had not shared in the general
reduction in size. They would, on the contrary, have grown and probably be still
growing. Mr. Warn’s observations during his journey in 1922 from the Mekong to the
Upper Irawadi show, however, that the western glaciers have also dwindled (WARD,

1923, p. 12); and that fact is inconsistent with the later uplift of the mountains along
the Burmese frontier,

230 DR. J. W. GREGORY AND MR. ©. J. GREGORY ON THE

Parr V.—PrrroLocy or THE Iangous Rocks.

The igneous rocks along the route traversed proved to be of remarkable variety.
As preliminary to a detailed account of the rocks, some reference to their general
relations is given here. The rocks may be classified as follows :—
