416 MR. E. J. REED ON THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF

approximation to the maximum bending-moment, taking account in each case of the
action of the forces on one side only of the station considered. He also attempts, but
with less success, to find expressions for the deflections corresponding to the bending-
moments, in order to estimate the amount of hogging. Next he shows that the longi-
tudinal fluid pressure has a considerable bending-effect on a ship afloat, following, no
doubt unconsciously, in the path of EvuLzr, but not falling into the error which Evizr
had made in supposing that this pressure tended to reduce the hogging caused by the
vertical forces. The great merit of Dr. YouxG's paper consists in the fact that,
throughout the investigations of the strains of ships, quantitative results based upon an
actual ship are given. No preceding writer, to whom I have referred, followed this
course, although BouGuer and Dox Juan took hypothetical cases to illustrate their
methods. Dr. YouxG also takes a much more complete review of the principal causes
of straining than any of his predecessors. In dealing with the question of the strength
of ships, however, he is not 80 successful.

About two years after the publication of Dr. YouxG's paper in the Philosophical
Transactions, appeared another written by the eminent French geometrician Dueix, It
was professedly © A Theoretical Examination of the Structure of English Vessels,”
meaning thereby vessels built on the diagonal system. Although Dueix followed
Dr. YouxG and SEgPPiNGs in the discussion of this subject, he contributed several addi-
