overwhelming evidence indicates that these theories are,
given our current knowledge, largely unshakable bulwarks.

That does not mean theories are not subject to refinement
and revision, but true refutation is implausible given how
well they are established. The laws of thermodynamics
including and especially the first law, the law of energy con-
servation fit into that category. In that sense, they are
underlying theoretical frameworks for much of what was dis-
cussed. In fact, often the theories presented and discussed at
our conference dealt with evolutionary explanation of why
we have obesity as a phenotype. Other things discussed are
closer to the idea of theories in the sense that the general
public often uses the word. We operated at both levels.

The next word to unpack is conjectures. Conjectures are
vital in science. They move us forward. Ramanujan’s Note-
books, Hilbert’s 23 unsolved problems, Fermat’s Last
Theorem, all were conjectures. Even the Wright brothers
implicit proposition that a flying machine of the type they
conceived could be built and function was a conjecture.
Jacob Bernoulli beautifully brought thinking about conjecture
