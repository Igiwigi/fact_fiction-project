I attempted also to bring the focus of the lens
within the compass-box, but the heat was $0 great that it burned part of the
apparatus ; and I desisted, lest by injuring the essential parts I should put an
end to my experiments. The coloured glass consisted of two semicircles, each
having a small concentric semicircle cut out, 80 that they fitted each other
round the tube carrying the suspending wire. Having clearly ascertained the
fact that the effect produced on the magnetized needle was different from that
on any other, the observations which I now made were on the vibrations of a
magnetized needle alone ; and I employed that which I had already used, re-
moving however the additional weight of paper which had been fixed to it, 80
that its weight was now only 197 grains, and its time of vibration was likewise
diminished. The following are the observations which I thus made. MDCCCXXVIII, 3D
