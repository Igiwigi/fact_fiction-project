Enot the cause of the fact that a film, of which the true thickness is about 22 wp,

‘precisely the same as those which our previously published results have shown to be
‘Beflicient in the case of liquide glycérique, which is much more sensitive to changes of
Shygrometric state than solutions containing no glycerine.
3 The bottom of the vessel in which the films were formed was flooded with the
‘gliquid. A continuous roll of linen dipped into the liquid, and could be moved so that
Zall portions in turn were moistened, thus exposing a large evaporating surface. A
@hair hygrometer was enclosed in the vessel. No observations were made until the
index of the hygrometer ceased to move. A constant hygrometric state was there-
Rafter maintained. In the case of liquids not containing glycerine, we found that the
glayer of liquid at the bottom of the vessel was sufficient for this purpose, as the results
