Table IIT., are as a rule larger than the probable errors of the differences, sometimes
several times larger. Yet in some cases they are not such large multiples of the
probable errors of the differences that we can afford to lay great stress on the
divergence of 7 or ¢ or win a pair of special cases. We must lay weight rather on
the general tendency of the tables when all the series are taken together. Thus,
while we may have small doubt about the correctness of (i.) of § 7 or (b) of § 8, we
should look upon (iv.) of § 7 as an important suggestion which deserves serious
consideration rather than a demonstrated law. The same again holds good for (¢) of
§ 8. It is because of their suggestiveness that they are here included. That a
differential fertility -or an individualisation in the sex of offspring should be corre-
lated with colour, would, if proved, be a fact of very considerable interest. It would
again emphasise the important part which genetic selection plays in the modification of
characters.* 4 priori it is not more unreasonable to expect coat-colour in horses than
to suppose hair-colour in men to be correlated with fertility. But the fertility of man
does seem to vary from the light to the dark races. The special feature of interest
here, however, is that a different colour in the two sexes appears to influence the
preponderance of one or other sex in the offspring. It would be an interesting
inquiry to determine whether the sex-ratio in the offspring of “mixed marriages”
varies when the races of the two parents are interchanged.
