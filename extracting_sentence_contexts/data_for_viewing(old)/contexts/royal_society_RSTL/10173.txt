tried, viz., the lead, the varnished pipes, the glass pipes, and the cast iron, there
are certain differences in the laws connecting the pressures and velocity in the pipes
of different material. In the logarithmic curves this is very clearly shown as a
slight but definite difference between the inclination of the logarithmic homologues
for the higher velocities,

The variety of the pipes tried reduces the possible causes of this difference to a small
compass. It cannot be due to any difference in diameters, as at least three pipes of
widely different diameters belong to each slope. It is not due to temperature. This
reduces the cause for the different values of to the irregularity in the pipes owing
to joints and other causes, and the nature of the surfaces.

The effect of the joints on the values of 7 seems to be proved by the fact that
Danov's three lead pipes gave slightly different values for n, while my two pipes
without joints gave exactly the same value, which is slightly less than that obtained
from Darcy's experiments.

Darcy's pipes were all of them uneven between the gauge points, the glass and
the iron varying as much as 20 per cent. in section. The lead were by far the most
uniform, 80 that it is not impossible that the differences in the values of n may be due
to this unevenness.
