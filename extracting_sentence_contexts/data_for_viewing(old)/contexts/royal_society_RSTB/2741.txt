cestrus, or even for a very short time during metcestrum.}

This is due to the extreme shortness of the processes of procestrum and cestrus in
many domestic sheep, the mucus not having had time to escape, although the

* The longer duration of the cestrus periods of Scotch Black-faced sheep under more extreme conditions
(e.g. of climate and altitude) may be taken as evidence that in the perfectly wild state on the high
mountain, sheep have a still more prolonged cestrus which does not recur.

+ A sheep breeder tells me that in Dorset Horn ewes in the south of England the cestrus may recur as
often as every eleven days, each cestrus lasting for only about two hours.

} That cestrus does not generally commence with bitches until external bleeding is over is a fact well
known to dog breeders. But a slight flow of mucus, accompanied by a little blood and a swollen vulva,
may continue for some days during cestrus, or even after. Such, at least, was the case with a Dandie
Dinmont terrier, in the possession of the present writer, for nearly a week after the performance of
artificial insemination. This is owing to the process of procestrum in the bitch, although longer, being of
far greater severity than in the sheep, the resulting discharge consequently requiring a longer period in
order to completely escape. The bitch in question was ready to take the dog on the day preceding
artificial insemination, and gave birth to pups fifty-nine days afterwards, or sixty days after the
commencement of cestrus.

A breeder of Angus and Shorthorn cows (see above, note + on p. 50) informs me that with these
animals he has noticed a mucous discharge from the vagina before the cows come “on heat” (i.¢., before
they are ready for service), and that heifers before coming ‘‘on heat” for the first time frequently pass
