Size, but the female has a slightly smaller bill. They do not, however, show any
gpproach to the slender-hilled species G. microrhyncha of Mr. Saunders, of which
Ae Museum has a specimen presented by Admiral Sir E. Belcher, and collected
@mewhere in the eastern eas. The white shafts to the quills and tail feathers in

dition to the 8mall size of the bird seem to be adequate distinetions for G. micro-

Eynocha. «
= Four eggs of Gygis were obtained by Mr. Slater, but the dates of capture are not
Soorded, nor the cireumstances of nesting. Mr. Saunders writes (7. 6. p. 669) :—
& The nesting of Gygis is peculiar, the single egg of clay-white mottled with brown
© being placed on the cavity of the branch of a | Jvo0s or in a fork of two branches,
S and on the points of the coral reefs—anywhere, in fact, where it will lie.” The
Fet of there being but one egg laid by these birds will account partly for the differ-
See i in type exhibited by the four specimens obtained by Mr. Slater.

E No. 1. Ground colour clay-white, sparsely spotted all over, the underlying pots

Ind blotches being of a pale purple, the overlying marks being larger and of a dark

Erown colour, deepening on some to blackish hrown ; the larger blotches seem to

is more about the larger end and centre of the egg. Length, 1-55 ;
