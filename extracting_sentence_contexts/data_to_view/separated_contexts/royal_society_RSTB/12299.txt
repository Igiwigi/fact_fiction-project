The Gln conjugates then appear to with closely related amino acids such as aspartate, asparagine
be substrates for the ABCC11 protein: while this was bio- or glutamate, or the methyl-ester of glutamate are all not recog-
chemically verified for the GSH conjugate with in vitro nized (figure 6). On the acyl side of the substrate, the enzyme is

ing a functional ABCC11 allele are unable to secrete these Gln are accepted. Thus, a highly selective transition-state inhibitor
conjugates strongly suggests that, indeed, they are a substrate could be developed, that binds this enzyme with a K; in the
for this transporter too (see below) [17]. Again, the Gln con- nanomolar range (figure 6).
