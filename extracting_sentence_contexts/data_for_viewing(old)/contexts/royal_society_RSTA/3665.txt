Figure 2. Plot of H)0/CO, ratios of comets versus CO/CO, (data taken from [38]). There are a number of additional measurements
that have yielded H20/C0, ratios (spanning a range of 3.5—14.5) but no accompanying C0/C0). Filled diamonds are spectroscopic
Measurements made by remote, telescopic means. The circles represent the equivalent ratios measured at the nucleus of 67P by
Ptolemy (data from [34]; note that there are, in fact, seven points plotted—two of the Abydos points plot on top of each other,
while the point that shows the highest C0/CO, ratio is that measured at Agilkia). The far more extensive datasets acquired
by ROSINA are not included since these are influenced by specific regional-scale processes (which are, in turn, the result of
daily and seasonal effects) and are complicated by the orientation of the spacecraft with respect to the nucleus at the time
the measurements were made. Notwithstanding this, on the basis of data taken from the coma at about 3.5 AU from the Sun,
H,0/C0, is typically in the range 5-10 with CO/CO, of 1-3 [39]. In extreme cases, H)0/CO, drops to about 0.01.

to appear at a different mass peak from that which is expected (i.e. not including differences
due to the presence of isotopes). The main problem for consideration here is what we loosely
refer to as ‘protonation’; by this is meant a peak appearing at 1.a.m.u. higher than the expected
mass (M + 1 instead of M). This can be the result of protonation itself (addition to a neutral ion
of Ht), but may also result from other processes (proton abstraction from neutral water by an
ionized molecule, charge transfer, chemical ionization, and so on). The end result is the same; the
