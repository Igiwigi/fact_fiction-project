The surface cuticle, which now appears, seems to be rather thick, notwith-
standing the fact that the colour disappears fairly soon, if the beetle is polished with
carborundum. Sections of other Buprestids show a very similar structure when
treated in the same way, except that the surface cuticle sometimes tears away,
though remaining a single layer. If it were not for the fact that the colour disappears
with very varying rapidity on polishing such wing-cases as these, it would seem as if
the layer which produces the metallic colour must lie on the surface, for, as in the
dragon-fly, Newrobasis chinensis, LINN. (p. 53), the chitin is so heavily pigmented
that if the colour-producing layer were more deeply seated, nothing would be seen,
because of the intervening black pigment.

27. Lytta vesicatoria, Linn. (Europe). This green beetle of the family Meloidse has wing-cases which are very thin, and which,
therefore, give little difficulty in cutting.
