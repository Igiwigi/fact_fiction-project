of the fault propagation paths. On top of the DT network, a performance evaluation network can
be built, where each node is constantly interacting with the corresponding digital twin to acquire
real-time performance-related information. Based on such a network, plant-wide performance
degradation analysis becomes feasible.

The use of DT can also help improve the security of the internal monitoring and control
network, as each DT will be assigned a unique identification (UID). This makes the information
source verifiable and traceable before a decision is made based on the automatic monitoring
results. It reduces the risk of security breaches against unauthorized devices (e.g. external sensors)
and unknown data sources. In this sense, security-related services are needed in the plant-wide
monitoring system.

For the DT-powered services, the attractive aspect lies in the fact that the companies do not
have to bother developing dedicated software and solutions for various online analysis needs.
They just need to turn to the market of third-party service providers and instruct the digital
twins to ‘use the apps’. By doing so, more opportunities are available to compare and change
the solutions based on different approaches (e.g. deep learning-based versus subspace-based
versus principle model-based fault detection approaches). Among them, deep learning-based
approaches have been rapidly developed over these years, which are likely to be adopted for
plant-wide process monitoring using the massive data generated in the DT framework.


(b) Remaining useful life prediction

Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction has long been a hotspot problem in the research on the
