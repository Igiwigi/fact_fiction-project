membrane of a pitted cell is perforated by fine protoplasmic threads, it will be found
that when 8wch a cell is treated with sulphuric acid, the protoplasgm projecting into
the pit, and especially that portion of it abutting on to the closing membrane, will
firmly adhere to the latter, and will resist, without rupturing, a very considerable
strain ; and even if rupture should at length take place, ib will seldom, if ever, occur
close to the pit membrane. In attempting to explain the appearances produced by
the action of strong sulphuric acid, one must clearly bear in mind that there are
two factors to be considered, viz. : the role of the protoplasm and the role of the cell
wall. At the same time there is going on, not only a shrinking of the one, bub a
swelling of the other. Two principal objections may be very reasonably brought
forward to explain the fact, that the protoplagm adheres to the pit. Firs, ib may be
8aid, that the protoplasm is retained and even injected into the pit by the pressure of
the 8welling wall. That this objection will not hold is apparent from the fact that the
8ame phenomenon occurs in the case of cells which have been cub into. Furthermore,
the swollen wall frequently does not abut directly on to the protoplasm, but a con-
8iderable space intervenes between the two. Again, by the action of strong

debydrating agents a further shrinking of the protoplasm may be induced. The
second and more important objection is, that the narrowing of the pit, on account
of the 8welling, imprisons and firmly embraces the protoplasm in the pit cavity. In
answer to this, it may be urged that the shrinking of the protoplasxm takes place
more quickly than the 8welling of the wall, and that the protoplasm projecting into
