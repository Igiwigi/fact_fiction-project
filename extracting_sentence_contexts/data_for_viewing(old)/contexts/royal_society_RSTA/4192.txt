the traditional analysis of contextuality for the cyclic-4 systems. :B

Theorem 6.5. A consistently connected cyclic-4 system (3.3) is non-contextual (by definition 6.4) if : s
and only if (5.2) is satisfied. D4

This is a special case of theorem 7.2 below, which in turn is a special case of a theorem proved : a
in [5] (see also [1,2,4,21]) that applies to a broad class of cyclic systems, of which cyclic-4 ones are :&
a special case. .

7. A general definition and criterion of contextuality in the contextuality-by-
default framework

The fact that we relate definition 6.4 to the notion of maximal couplings for connections reflects
the intuition we are guided by and suggests a natural way of generalizing contextuality beyond
consistently connected systems.

The intuition in question can be explicated as follows. For an inconsistently connected system,
we interpret the non-coincidence of the distributions of Ri and RE as evidence that changes
in context, c—> c’, ‘directly’ influence the measurement of q. For instance, in the Alice-Bob
entanglement paradigm, if the two measurements are time-like separated, Alice’s choice of the
spin axis can influence Bob’s measurement along a given axis. This is referred to as ‘signalling’. It
is also possible that a Charlie who receives information from both Alice and Bob and records both
their settings and their measurement results makes systematic errors in recording Bob’s results
depending on Alice’s settings. This is referred to as ‘context-dependent biases’. Whatever the
cause, when we model these ‘direct’ influences by a coupling {Ti To} of {RRO}, we translate
