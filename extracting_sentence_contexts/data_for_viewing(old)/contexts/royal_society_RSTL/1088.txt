ner similar to that in which osmium forms a volatile and acrid
substance by the absorption of oxygene, does the amalgam of
ammonium produce the volatile alkali ; and if 'we suppose
that ammonia is metallized, by being combined with hydro-
gene, and freed from water, the same reasoning will likewise
apply to the other metals, with this difference, that the ad-
herence of their phlogiston or hydrogene, would be exactly
in the inverse ratio of their attraction for oxygene. In
platina * it would be combined with the greatest energy; in
ammonium with the least ; "and if it be separable- from any

® The common metallic oxides are lighter than their bases, but potash. and soda
are heavier ; this fact may be explained on either theory ; the density of a compound
will be proportional to the attraction of its parts. Platina, having a weak affinity for
oxygene, cannot be supposed to- condense it in the same degree as potassium does z
or if platina and potassium be both compounds of hydrogene, the hydrogene must be
attracted in platina, with an energy infinitely greater than in potassium, © Sulphuric
acid is lighter than sulphur ; but phosphoric acid (where there is a stronger affinity)
is heavier than. phosphorus. The oxide of tin (wood tin) is, yery little inferior to tin
in specific gravity... In this instance, the metallic base is comparatively light, aad the
attraction for oxygene strong; and.in a case when the metal is much lighter and the

attraction for oxygene stronger, it might. be expected a priori that the oxide would-be
heavier than the base,
