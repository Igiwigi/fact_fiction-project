JEANS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF MOLECULAR ENERGY.

admit an interaction, no matter how small, between the molecules and the sur-_
rounding ether. That such an interaction must exist is shown by the fact that a
gas is capable of radiating energy. In fact, BottzMann’s Theorem rests on the
assumption that the molecules of a gas form a conservative dynamical system, and
it will appear that the introduction of a small dissipation function may entirely
invalidate the conclusions of the theorem.* Thus we may regard the BorrzMayn
distribution as unstable, in the sense that a slight deviation from perfect conserva-
tion of energy may result in a complete redistribution of the total energy, and it
will appear that this new distribution of energy will lead to values for the ratios of

g the two specific heats which are not open to the objections mentioned above.
¥ § 2. A second difficulty, of a mathematical rather than physical nature, may be
FE mentioned here, as it will occur incidentally in the course of the analysis. It is

well illustrated by the consideration of an imaginary type of molecule which has
been suggested by Bourzmann.t A loaded sphere, that is to say, a sphere of which
the centre of gravity is at a small distance r from the geometrical centre, will, for
the present purpose, possess five degrees of freedom, and this is true, however, small
rmay be.
