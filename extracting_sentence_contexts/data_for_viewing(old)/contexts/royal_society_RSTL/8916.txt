Concerning Dr. Eixgr's histological observations, it is, of course, impossible for
me to say any thing; for he neither figures nor describes the elements which he
regards as nervous. 'They may therefore or may not correspond with appearances
which I have myself obseryed.

It only remains to notice Dr. Encer's statement with reference to Cyanea capillata.
He says that the effects of the fundamental operation upon this species were precisely
similar to the effects of it upon Aurelia aurita, whereas in my experience it was not 80.
As already stated, I found these effects to be analogous, but not identicalâ€”Cyanea
capillata, as @ rule, being less frequently or less completely paralyzed by excision of its
lithocysts alone than was Aurelia aurita. I can only explain this discrepancy between
Dr. Engr and myself by the fact which he states, viz. that he performed but few
experiments on Cyanaea capillata.

In now concluding this somewhat elaborate postscript, I wish it to be understood
that I have mentioned the various points in which Dr. Ee and myself do not quite
agree, only because I think it is for the benefit of the subject on which we are both
engaged that such differences should be noted before the work of another year begins.
In this way, when opportunity again affords, we may both be able to repeat such of our
observations as are now rendered doubtful by want of complete accordance.
