(c) Combined effects of the two types of state dependence

We now study the combined effects of both types of state dependence, that is, we consider ne > 0
and nc > 0. Figure 7 demonstrates that state dependence due to upwelling has a large effect on
the overall bifurcation set when the ocean-adjustment state dependence is also present. This is
surprising since state dependence due to upwelling on its own does not appear to change the
bifurcation set.

Figure 7a considers the effect of the maximal nominal value n- = 0.08 of upwelling on the case
of asmaller ocean adjustment of nc = 0.11 shown in figure 4a. The comparison shows that figure 7a
features a dramatic change in the way the different types of solutions are distributed across the
(c,T)-plane. In particular, the torus bifurcation curve appears to have split into two segments
around 7, =1.2. In fact, as we checked but do not show here, even for c > 40, the two curves
remain disconnected. This change of the bifurcation set is the result of a transition similar to the
interacting torus bifurcation curves in figure 5. Note in figure 7a how some resonance tongues
have become significantly wider and overlap to a greater extent, resulting in larger regions of
chaotic behaviour. We observe again the emergence of the period-doubling cluster near t, = 1,
as well as the cusp bifurcations of the forcing dominated solutions near (c, t) = (6,1) and near
(Â¢, tm) = (6,2).
