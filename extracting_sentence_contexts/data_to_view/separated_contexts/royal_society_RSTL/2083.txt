After a number of new experiments, which I shall
have the pleasure,of laying before the Society, and notwith-
standing the various novel views which have been brought
forward in this and in other countries, and the great activity
and extension of science, it is peculiarly satisfactory, to me to
find that I have nothing to alter in the fundamental theory
laid down in my original communication ; and which, after a
lapse of twenty years, has continued, as it was in the begin-
ning, the guide and foundation of all my researches. I am the more inclined to bring forward these new labours
at the present moment, though they are far from being in a

finished state, because the discovery of OtrsTeD and that of
Moricnrni, illustrated by some late ingenious enquiries,
connect the electro-chemical changes with entirely new
classes of facts, and induce a hope that many of the compli-
cated phenomena of corpuscular changes, now obscure, will
ultimately be found to depend upon the same causes, and to
be governed by the same laws; and that the simplicity of
our scientific arrangements will increase with every advance
in the true knowledge of nature.

II. Some historical details. As T am not acquainted with any work in which full and
accurate statements on the origin and progress of electro-
chemical science are to be found, and as some very erroneous
statements have been published abroad, and repeated in this
country, I shall take the liberty of laying before the Society
a short historical sketch on this subject ; which is the more
wanted, as the journal in which the early discoveries were
registered has long been discontinued, and is now little known
or referred to.
