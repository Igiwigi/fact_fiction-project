That all the relations shown by the above analysis should be as they are gives an
exceedingly strong support to Exsrer and Gerret’s theory of the origin of the
atmospheric radio-active emanation. According to their theory, the air which is
mixed up with the soil of the ground becomes highly charged with radium
emanation.* When the barometer falls, this air passes out of the ground into the
atmosphere, bringing with it its charge of emanation. All the facts of the above analysis receive a very simple explanation by this
theory if one extends it to include the fact that, as the emanation is a gas contained
in the soil, it must constantly diffuse into the atmosphere above quite independently
of the state of the barometer. Assuming this constant diffusion, we at once see that
everything which tends to reduce the atmospheric circulation, 1.e., to keep the air
stagnant, tends also to increase the quantity of emanation in the lower layers of the
atmosphere. Looking now at each of the tables in order, we see that the temperature does not
have a direct, but an indirect influence on the radio-activity.
