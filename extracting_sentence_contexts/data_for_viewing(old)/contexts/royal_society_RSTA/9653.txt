§0 to 27, and the mean lunar variation for such a period cannot be expected to show
‘Sany special dependence on solar time. At any particular lunar phase, however, the
solar day hours, during which (over a given part of the earth) the atmospheric
~conductivity is greatest, occur at a definite part of the lunar day, this part changing
with the lunar phase; and it has, in fact, been found* that the lunar variation
Sdetermined from the mean of a number of days all at the same lunar phase is not of
the semi-diurnal form. The variation curve goes through a regular cycle of change
‘2with lunar phase, in such a manner as to leave the mean variation over a whole
‘Blunation of the simple form already described. The magnetic needle is most mobile
Sduring the day hours: at certain seasons of the year, Broun found that the
‘Zamplitude of the lunar diurnal variation of magnetic declination at Trevandrum was
‘gfive times as great during the solar day hours as during the night hours.t These
& facts clearly show that the conductivity of the medium in which the electric currents
flow to produce the lunar magnetic variation depends on the position of the sun ; and
since it is unreasonable to suppose that the mechanisms concerned in producing
Ethe lunar and solar diurnal magnetic variations are materially different, the
assumption of variable conductivity in Scuusrer’s theory is confirmed in a very
8 definite and independent way ; in Scnusrer’s discussion two barometric oscillations,
& diurnal and semi-diurnal, were concerned, and it was necessary to explain why the
E resulting magnetic variations, deduced on the assumption of uniform conductivity,
A did not bear the proper ratio to one another. This might be because the conductivity
was not uniform, or because the ratio of the two oscillations was different in the
upper regions of the atmosphere from that indicated by the barometer. This latter
uncertainty is absent in the case of the lunar variations, where there is only a single
barometric oscillation, from which arise magnetic variations of other periods,
