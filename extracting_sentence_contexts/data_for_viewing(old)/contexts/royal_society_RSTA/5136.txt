matter physics. Inelastic X-ray scattering is an emergent complementary technique that has been

proved by the Swiss Light Source to have enormous promise. In view of these, a strategic decision â€œ3
was taken to build the 105 ARPES beamline and the [21 inelastic X-ray scattering beamline. 105 : a
became operational after the 10-year Anniversary Symposium had been held, but within its first ig
year it has attracted the attention of leading practitioners in the field worldwide and is producing : s
outstanding quality publications. The inelastic scattering beamline is designed for a 17m radius :&

spectrometer arm and as such is housed in an external building. First users of this beamline are
eagerly anticipated in spring 2017.

Finally, and as a complete contrast to the other beamlines, a versatile soft X-ray beamline,
VERSOX, is being built on a bending magnet source to take advantage of the fact that it is now
possible to perform XPS in non-UHV conditions. This beamline will allow experiments to be :
carried out on wet surfaces and will be of interest to researchers studying ice crystals in climate =
studies, to catalyst chemists and for studies of corrosion. Eventually, this beamline will develop a 3
strong industrial portfolio because more realistic surfaces can be studied.

Diamond has engaged at a very early stage with industry through establishing the Diamond DN
Industry Science Committee (DISCo), which has representatives from 12 different companies in 1B
various industries, including the pharmaceuticals and aerospace sectors. 13
With Diamond firmly into its third phase of construction, the availability of new beamlines .
is allowing the industrial usage to thrive. The scope for industrial research and development
