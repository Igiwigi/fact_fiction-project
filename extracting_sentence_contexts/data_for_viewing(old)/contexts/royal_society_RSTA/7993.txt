ON THE PHENOMENON OF KNOCK IN PETROL ENGINES 487

PART ITI—ORGANIC PEROXIDES
By A. R. UsBELonDE and A. Ecrrron, F.R.S.

1—INTRODUCTION

Apart from general theories of hydrocarbon combustion and in spite of the main
conclusion of Part II as to the nature of the “‘ peroxides,” certain experimental facts
indicated that organic peroxides might still have an important connection with the
phenomenon of “ knock.”

a These indications were that :—(1) organic peroxides were found to be pro-
“nounced “ pro-knock”’ substances ; (2) metallic anti-knocks markedly inhibited
8 their effect ; (3) the detonationof hydrogen was not prevented by metallic anti-knocks ;
9 (4) the effect on the KI “ droplet ’’ was not always accounted for entirely by the NO,,
@ particularly in the neighbourhood of the top dead centre ; (5) metallic anti-knocks
© inhibit the ignition of hydrocarbon mixtures, and particularly seem to counteract
P the effect of pressure, which should favour the formation of peroxides ; (6) the use
sof fuels with more than 15 times the maximum aldehyde formed in the cylinder did
8 not enhance the “ knock” and alcohols do not knock, so that no main product formed
