effect of this procedure. It is evident that, as could be proved otherwise, it
introduces no appreciable change in the distances between axes of parabolas.

(XVI) Isolation of Components of a Line.

The photograph for H, is found to consist of two parabolas—slightly distorted —as
in the figure (fig. 6), where the normal parabolas are
shown, intersecting at P. The axes are «, and w, and ¢ B
is their separation on the photograph whose contour is
