It will be seen that in the case of lead azide, the threshold for large masses, agrees with the
self-heating curve. The exact agreement must to some extent be regarded as fortuitous, until
thermal conductivity data are available. But the fact that for large masses the experimental
curve assumes the same slope as the self-heating curve suggests that this mechanism of
detonation takes over when the amount of initiator is large. On the other hand, for small
