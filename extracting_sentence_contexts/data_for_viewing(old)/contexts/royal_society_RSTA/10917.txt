substance. A glance at the diagram shows that this is what we should expect. The
B was at first not striated, but an ignition to a temperature of about 300° developed
striation when the surface was again etched.

Sn 15. Chill at 600°, v.s.c. chill (fig. 33).

This is important. It consists of several large polygons differing, on account of
orientation, very much in brightness. There are also fainter polygonal boundaries, but
these which do not separate regions of different brightness, may be cracks. There is
no «, and the B is not striated. The ingot is undeniably a uniform solid solution.
We have no other chills of Sn 15.

The fact that in this group of alloys all the primary « is absorbed at 790°, and that
only at lower temperatures does « again crystallise, accounts for the singularly
disjointed appearance of the combs seen in the unchilled alloys. The photograph of
Sn 12, published in our paper in the ‘ Proceedings,’ vol. 68, shows this peculiarity,
but in slowly cooled ingots of Sn 14 it is much more marked. For in Sn 12 a little
of the primary « has persisted, and so decided the orientation of the new «, while in
Sn 14 there were no such nuclei, and the character of the primary « combs is not in
the least reproduced in the later crystallisation. The chills of Sn 14 at 530° and
470° illustrate this when compared with the chill at 800° (fig. 28).

Sn 15'5. 25°5 per cent. by weight.

The alloy is important, because at this composition occurs the angle C in the
