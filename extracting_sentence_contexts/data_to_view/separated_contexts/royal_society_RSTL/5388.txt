H. E. ROSCOE'S PHOTO-CHEMICAL =

The fact that the action of light upon a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen does not
take place instantaneously, but that a considerable continuation of the exposure is neces-
sary before an action occurs, was noticed by DRAPER in 1843. From this observation he
concluded that chlorine, on exposure to light, undergoes an allotropic modification, per-
manent for several weeks, which differs from ordinary chlorine by possessing a greater
combining power. We shall show that the true cause of this phenomenon is totally a different one ; that
it cannot be explained by the supposition of an allotropic modification of chlorine, but
that the peculiar action which we have called photo-chemical induction here comes into
play.
