revealed the distance traversed in the walls of the vessels. The stems of the pear
and oak formed suitable material, but the amount of transference observed in the
tracheal walls was not more than 0°5 centim. per hour, except in a couple of doubtful
cases in which the vessels were apparently not completely blocked.

No appreciable change in the viscosity-of the water passed through the vessels of
living wood is noticeable if the liquid is examined immediately. If, however, the
water is passed slowly through a long length of stem, the viscosity of the liquid
which first issues may be from 4-6 per cent. higher than that of water. This is
however, a natural result of the solution in it of soluble materials gained from the
wood.

The fact that slow lateral diffusion into or out of the surrounding more slowly
conducting tracheides is possible from the vessels, must have some effect upon the
rate of flow, but probably not a very great one. In any case, it is of interest to find
the relationship between the radii of the conducting vessels and the amount or rapidity
of flow.

Section 6.—The Ratio between the Radii of the Vessels and the Rates of Flow.

The amount of flow through a capillary tube is, other things being equal, propor-
tional to the fourth power of the radius, and hence the velocity of flow is proportional
to the square of the radius. In the following table the relative values are given in
parallel columns.
