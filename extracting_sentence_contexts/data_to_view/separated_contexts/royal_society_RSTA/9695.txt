In fig. 26 (x 150) we have
the micro-structure of alloy No. 77, which in this respect is typical of all alloys
containing less than 78 per cent. of zinc, after annealing for a considerable time at
430° C. followed by quenching from a temperature just above 256° C. The specimen
exhibits a perfectly homogeneous structure merely diversified by a few holes and
cracks. If this structure were met with only in the alloy of the composition of the
compound Al,Zng, the structure might be described as that of the pure 8 meteral, but
as a matter of fact this same homogeneous structure is exhibited by all the alloys
containing less than 78 per cent. of zinc which have been treated in the same way. It follows from this observation that the 8 body forms a solid solution with the y
body, since to the right of the line GFK the reaction y+liquid = 8 must leave a
residue of y. For purposes of distinction the authors have termed this solid solution
of 8 and y the } meteral.
