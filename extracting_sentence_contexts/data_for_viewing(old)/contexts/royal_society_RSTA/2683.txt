minimized the work of adhesion [117]. Sojoudi et al. followed up on this work by measuring the
adhesion of tetrahydrofuran hydrates and cyclopentane hydrates to CVD fabricated surfaces of
polydivinylbenzene capped by poly(perfluorodecyl acrylate). Again, it was found that hydrate
adhesion scaled with the work of adhesion of the surface, reaching as low as Tclathrate = 20 kPa
[97,118].

Despite the high modulus of natural gas hydrates in the context of solid fouling materials, to
the best of our knowledge, no work has been done to investigate the effects of surface modulus on
meso- and macro-scale adhesion of these materials. Owing to the extreme similarity in modulus
and chemical composition between ice and clathrates [36], it is reasonable to assume that many
surface design strategies may be shared effectively between the two fouling scenarios. In fact, the
CVD surfaces fabricated by Sojoudi et al. [97] were also applied to mitigate ice fouling; however,
these surfaces were able to reduce ice adhesion strength to only tice = 185.3 kPa. In comparison,
as discussed previously, durable, low-modulus surfaces achieved values of tice < 10 kPa [108].
Therefore, by considering the high modulus of this foulant and incorporating surface elasticity
into low hydrate adhesion surface design, significant additional reduction in adhesion strength
may be achieved.

4. Inorganic scaling

The deposition of inorganic scale [119] is a major challenge in a range of industries including
oil and gas, water desalination and power generation [120-122]. The uncontrolled build-up of
scale can cause flow restriction and increased friction in pipes (figure 5a), under-scale surface
