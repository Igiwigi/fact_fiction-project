Proceeding us in Section 2, making use of (18) and (15), we find that the goneral formulw

for A, are the same as (14). An inspection of (17) shows, furthermore, that the special

formula (18) with (dZ,/dz),-, = 0 is applicable, while the first term in the expansion
(19) is omitted, in view of the fact that C = 0.

Section 4. Determination of ) for Medium of Varying Conductivity of Infinite Depth.

It is obvious that the physical problem limits the character of p as a function of the
depth. The fundamental equation (7) requires that both p and dp/ds be continuous
functions of s and single valued in the interval for which the equation is valid. At the
surface z= 0 the specific resistance p must be neither zero nor infinite. If the law of
