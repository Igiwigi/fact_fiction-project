In Group L, for instance, the separations as measured from D lines are
less than those determined from § lines. In the rare gases also this difference appears
quite decisively, but here (group 0) the separations as determined from the D lines
are, in general, larger than those from 8. The key to the explanation is found in the
fact that the difference between the two determinations diminishes with increasing
order—in other words, that the sequent in the same set of satellites is not the same,
and that in a large number of cases the value of »,+1, is the same in both S and D
although 1», ». themselves are different. It is found to be completely explained by
the displacement of one or two ouns between the sequents of the first or second
members of a triplet. Sometimes it occurs in the third member.
