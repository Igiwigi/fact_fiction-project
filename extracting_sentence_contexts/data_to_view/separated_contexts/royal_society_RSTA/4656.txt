Relations (3.2) simply state :8
that induced currents are related to the corresponding fields by linear relations, reflecting the : es
assumption that the metasurface is a linear system. The averaged tangential fields right at the ie
metasurface are defined as the averaged tangential field components on its two surfaces:

These boundary conditions for various structures are discussed, for example, in [6,32]. [3

For the most general linear metasurfaces (with magnetoelectric coupling), it is appropriate to :
model the electromagnetic properties of metasurfaces by the general matrix relation between the |

In the general case, the matrix elements in (3.2) have no clear physical meaning as effective [=
surface parameters. This dyadic impedance model (3.4) can be used, in fact, for arbitrary linear Dk
planar layers which are homogeneous in the layer plane, for example [14]. Sometimes, it is more .
convenient to rewrite these relations expressing the fields on one side as linear functions of the
fields on the other side of the surface. The corresponding matrix is called the transntission matrix.
