Thus every Y-primal, in any of
the transformations {2, 4 (2), n}, has a double line. Locus of Double Line.—Now it requires one condition to make a ®-quadric touch a
given prime through the plane = at a given point of the line 1; and we may say, then,
that to all points of the section by a prime through = of the neighbourhood of any point
of 1, there corresponds one point of 2. For transformations of class I of the table the
’ locus of such points of = is a quadric surface Q, as appears from the fact that any two
-quadrics touch each other at two variable points of |; and it is easy to see that to
generators of one system of Q there correspond neighbourhoods of points of 1, and to those of
the other system there corresponds sections of the whole neighbourhood of the line | by primes
through x. For transformations of class Il, however, we get, instead of Q and its two
systems of generators, only a plane c and two pencils of lines in this plane ; and for
those of class III, we get only a line 4 which then corresponds to the whole neighbourhood
ofl. Also if any prime of S meet / in a point O, the corresponding ‘’-primal will have
for its double line ‘the line corresponding to the neighbourhood of O.
