Up till quite recently it had been considered that a Simuliwm larva was provided with
definite suckers, which enabled it to cling to rocks and weeds in swift currents. 'TonNorr
(1923, a, pp. 163-172), in his work on the modes of fixation and the progression of these
larvee, made it abundantly clear that no sucker-action was involved in the fixation of
either the anterior or the posterior appendage ; but he made one mistake in an other-
wise excellent chain of reasoning. He observed that, “ La dissection montre, d’ailleurs,
qu'il n’existe pas de faiseeaux musculaires destinés 4 la formation de cette coupe.”
Puri (p. 311) observed “ that there are fairly strong muscles connected with the centre
of the dise (Plate 8, fig. 10) and that they contract when the larva fixes itself by its
posterior end. But in spite of the presence of these muscles the larva cannot fix itself
effectively without the further help of the sticky salivary secretion; a fact which
may mean that the saliva helps to fill up the spaces between the hooks and thus to
form a complete rim all round. There is no doubt, however, that a larva remains
fixed to the substratum mainly by means of the hooks which firmly grip the salivary

secretion, but it is not possible to say how far the sucking action of the appendage
helps the larva at the moment when it first attaches itself to the support. The first-
stage larva has a pair of long hairs arising from the middle of the circular area surrounded
by the rows of hooks, and it is therefore very improbable that this appendage functions
as a sucker, at least in the first-stage larva.”
