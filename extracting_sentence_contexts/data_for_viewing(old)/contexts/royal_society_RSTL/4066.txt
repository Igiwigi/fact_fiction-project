8 SOME months back, at the instigation of Dr. GoLpinG Birp, I undertook some
experiments to ascertain whether, in cases of diseased and imperfect function of the
5 lungs or liver, when the normal quantity of carbon could not be discharged from the
D system by those channels, the kidneys undertook an extra duty, and whether under
5 8uch circumstances an excess of carbon could be shown in the urine above that,
E usually secreted under healthy conditions.
S Should this question be answered in the affirmative, and should it be found that a
E larger amount, of carbon was excreted by the urine in persons affected with such
= diseases, a practical application might reasonably be made of the fact. For by
2 stimulating the kidneys to still greater exertion, the amount of work required of the
© lungs or of the liver could be lessened, and thus a better chance offered then: of
2 being restored to a healthy state.
SE The method proposed for s0lving this problem was, to precipitate the urine of dif-
Z ferent patients suffering from diseases of the kinds mentioned, with basic acetate of
EZ lead, keeping it slightly alkaline by the addition of a few drops of ammonia, then to
= ascertain the amount of organic matter contained in the precipitate, and in particular
E the amount of carbon, and lastly to compare these quantities with those obtained
= in a 8imilar manner from the urine of healthy individuals.
L In endeayouring to determine the amount of organic matter in the lead precipitate
© by burning, as likewise in determining the quantity of carbon by an elementary ana-
S lysis of the same precipitate with oxide of copper, results were obtained which did
