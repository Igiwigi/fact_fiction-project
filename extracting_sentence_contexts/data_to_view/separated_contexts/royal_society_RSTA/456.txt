Offshore wind farms are remotely located and operate under challenging conditions, much worse ;
than the onshore wind farms. Early failure of their components has been frequently observed â€˜a
in the past. This fact could inhibit their establishment as an attractive alternative option for 1
power generation. It is for this reason that the development of a reliable structural health
monitoring (SHM) and condition monitoring (CM) strategy is particularly necessary and why
current research is focusing on this aim. In order to perform a health monitoring strategy, one of the initial steps is to acquire the
appropriate data for the purpose of damage detection.
