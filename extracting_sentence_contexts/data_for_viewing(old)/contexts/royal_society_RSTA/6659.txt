may be regarded as that of the variation of constant type, and the period of the other is then that in
which the variation of constant type oscillates, whilst the complex variation of the formula remains
identically the same; and this result is general so long as the number of terms in the formula is the
same as the number of terms in each of the variations of constant type. The name—the luni-solar
variation—has been chosen to distinguish the variation expressed by the formula as one involving the
periods of a lunation and the solar day, and of sub-multiples of these periods; and the name—typical
variation—has been given to the variations of constant type.

sion of the phenomena in question, there is nothing anomalous in our finding, as we
do in fact, definite lunar diurnal variations from the observations of complete lunations.
Tt will, indeed, be seen further on (paragraph 17) that the lunar half-day wave is one
of the two most prominent, and that the lunar day wave has, generally speaking, an
amplitude as great as any of the remaining five.

14. Proceeding now to find the values of f,,(h), f.,(h), having entered the observed
lunar diurnal variation for new moon in a Table having the solar hours, from 0 to 23,
marked at the top of the columns, commencing with 0 hours of the lunar day, we
enter underneath this the observed lunar diurnal variation for full moon, commencing
Qvith 12 hours, and then subtract the lower entries from the upper: half the
alifference we take to be the value of f,,() as derived from the new moon and full
Booon variations. Similarly, entering the observed lunar diurnal variation for first
§uarter, commencing with 18 hours, and under it the observed lunar diurnal variation
