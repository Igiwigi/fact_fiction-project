If the reversed-piece fails to heal
essentially the same regeneration may take place dorsal to the reversed-piece, which is
therefore left isolated and inconspicuous ventral to a normal embryo. This has happened
in three specimens (which have been included in column 4 of table 1). It is, however,
hardly possible for such an isolated reversed-piece to disappear without trace, and in the


322 M. ABERCROMBIE ON THE REVERSAL

majority of cases of complete regulation the healing of the reversed-piece to the residual
blastoderm was actually observed during development; so there can in fact be little doubt
that the cases of complete regulation involve the incorporation of the reversed-piece into
the resulting embryo. Since the embryos have not been carried beyond a 10- to 15-somite
stage, normality refers only to structures developed at this stage. For this reason, the
attainment of complete regulation is often not of the same significance after operations of
types III and IV as after the other types, since such reversals may have involved tissues
still little differentiated at the time of fixation.
