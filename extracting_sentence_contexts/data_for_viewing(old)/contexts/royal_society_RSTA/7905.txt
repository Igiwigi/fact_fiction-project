between these two explanations in the present state of our knowledge.

The Solution Range.—By far the greater part of the work described has been con-
cerned with the solution range above the compatibility point. Most of the experiments
were made with solutions containing 12°, of nitrocotton. Two outstanding results
appear. The first is that as the activity of the acetone increases above that corre
sponding to critical solution, absorpton appears to fall. The second is that in solutions
weaker than 12° the recorded values of solvation are higher.

The first result is very unexpected because all the other available evidence such as
that obtained from experiments on the sorption of acetone vapour by nitrocotton
makes it almost inevitable that the total solvation must increase with the activity of
the acetone. It is possible to account for the observed facts only by supposing that
in addition to the acetone some water must be absorbed. This absorption of water
can hardly be continuous throughout the whole range of acetone concentration but
must begin or at least become much more marked at the solution point.

The idea that the apparent sorption of acetone, as determined in this way, was the
effect of the attachment of water and acetone separately, say, the acetone on the nitro-
groups and the water on the hydroxyl groups, was considered at one time. Two
smooth curves of similar shape could be postulated, which when combined would give
an apparent acetone solvation rising to a maximum at the compatibility point, and
then falling to zero at 100°% acetone. That this is not a true explanation is shown
by the fact that the apparent sorption calculated from two continuous separate sorption
curves would always be continuous. Any theory of the sorption curve must therefore
