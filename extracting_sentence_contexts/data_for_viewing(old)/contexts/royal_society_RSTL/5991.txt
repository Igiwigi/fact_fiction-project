Hlations of that Paper the following instance occurs (p. 46, in the Table). A tabular mass
Zonly about 600 feet high, and measuring thirty-seven miles by forty-six, will canse a
eflection of 3”-172 at a station three miles from its longer side, and about one-third
-Sfrom one end of it and two-thirds from the other end. Colonel Everesr himself enters
Zinto an elaborate calculation in his earlier quarto volume (of 1830) to find the local
Sattraction at the Station Takal K'hera, which had been previously fixed upon as one of
Sthe principal stations of the Great Arc; but was afterwards abandoned, notwithstanding
all the time and labour which had been bestowed upon calculations in connexion with
=Sit; and that because the deflection 5-098 was found to result from the attraction of an
Eextensive table-land commencing as far as twenty miles off, and rising to only about
£1600 feet above the level of the station. Colonel Lawprox had considered the table-
Bland to be too distant to have any effect ; but calculation proved the reverse.
16. In fact, as it appears to me, while the absolute necessity of attending to local
Fattraction is strongly illustrated by the investigations I have given in this and my pre-
vious Papers, the utter hopelessness of attaining to any certain results seems to be as
clearly demonstrated. Here are causes, not only visible in mountain-masses and table-
lands and deep neighbouring oceans which affect the yertical, and which can be calcu-
lated if sufficient labour be bestowed ; but also invisible and hidden, as important as the
others, of which we know absolutely nothing, except that they may exist and that we
have no power of proving or disproving their existence. Were it not for these disturb-
ing causes, the comparison of the parts even of the same arc ought to bring out its ellip-
ticity (if the meridian be elliptical) with considerable precision. The approximation can
