Second, some models have allowed dynamical change, so that, for example, the mental state
changes as a result of the available information and the evolution of the mental state (and
corresponding probabilities) are set up in a way that matches the observed behaviour [11,20-22].
The difference between static and dynamical models partly relates to modelling objectives, with
dynamical models sometimes presented as having a greater process component, whereas static
models tend to be focused on the just representation and relevant computational principles (cf.
[23,24]). The denomination ‘dynamical’ here does not intend to model any physical processes in
the brain substrate itself. Quantum-like modelling in cognition is essentially a phenomenological
approach that not only provides the kinematical evolution of states in a person’s belief space,


but also can detail the various transfers of these probability amplitudes. The denomination
‘dynamical’ captures the fact that, in the model, the cognitive evolution is driven by parameters in
the Hamiltonian and Lindbladian operators, which should be psychologically interpretable and
of which the relative parameter amplitudes can be used to assess the importance of constituent
transfer processes.

The focus of the present work is cognitive QPT dynamical models. Notwithstanding their
descriptive success, it is typically the case that many simplifying assumptions are made when
specifying the relevant dynamical processes. How important are such simplifications and what
kind of modelling assumptions do they entail? If one is to allow QPT dynamics in their
full complexity, what is the ensuing modelling flexibility and is it likely that this flexibility
will be relevant in cognitive modelling? It is worth bearing in mind that QPT is one of the
most technically sophisticated theories developed by the human mind. As we shall see in :
this work, even for simple situations, QPT dynamical systems can provide an extremely rich [=
