which again are easily satisfied within observation errors. With regard, however,
to (2), (3), it is not common to find two satellites so close together, and as they both
belong to doublet sets we should suspect that they belong to different groups, and
in fact the condition is satisfied by regarding the limit of 20875 as displaced by —3,
on that of 20871. We shall consider the conditions more fully later in connection with the more
accurate determination of the oun. The preceding results are sufficient to show
that (1), (4), (5) are a definite normal D satellite on the basis of A, = 4680+.
