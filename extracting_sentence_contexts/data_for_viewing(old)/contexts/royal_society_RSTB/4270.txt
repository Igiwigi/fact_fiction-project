448 MISS P. GC. ESDAILE ON THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF

Meckel’s Cartilage, Auditory Ossicles, and Dentary.

Though somewhat hidden in the side view by the dentary, Meckel’s cartilages
(cart.m.) form a stout and complete primitive jaw. Anteriorly they unite to form
the short but thick symphysis. Meckel’s cartilage is a curved rod which passes
without distinction into the malleus (mal.). This, as will be seen in fig. 4, is a
thickening forming the head of the malleus and the manubrium, which at this stage is
mainly procartilage.

A comparison of the ventral views of the models of the three stages (Plate 29, fig. 3 ;
Plate 30, fig. 11; Plate 32, fig. 22) reveals the fact that the Meckel’s cartilages of the
youngest are very much bowed. In the older stages they dre very much straighter
and even become curved inwards, forming a long symphysis. An explanation of this
developmental change might be that the widely separated condition of the younger
stages allows of a firmer hold on the teat.

The hollowed external surface of the head of the malleus articulates with the
rounded body of the incus, forming a close-fitting joint (fig. 8). The incus is provided
with two projections—the crus breve, which passes backwards and upwards in close
relationship with the overhanging portion of the auditory capsule ; the other, the crus
longum, passing downwards and inwards, and eventually articulating with the stapes.

The condition of the crus breve is very similar to that described by Kinasiry (29)
