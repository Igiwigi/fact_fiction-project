While the spinal nerve centres have been investigated in numerous ways since

unptt estimated the delay in the passage of an impulse through them, it is

considerations on this matter, and, to indicate their bearing, we will first enumerate
categorically the facts that have been previously ascertained by various investigators. The facts may be conveniently divided under the headings of—
