highlight that aggregating the data to UK level changes the dynamics of the data streams and ZR
masks important local dynamics. ae

There were limited differences in general trends between the first and second wave of COVID- :s
19 across the UK, with both waves showing linear reductions post-lockdown interventions. MVBs :8
generally became less dominant while hospitalizations emerged as more dominant in the second : S
wave. Deaths in England were also more dominant in wave 1. This could relate to a change 8

in policy of only intervening in the most serious cases, or an improvement in outcomes due
to an improved understanding of the disease and the impact from the large-scale vaccination
programme from December 2020.

The fact that most analyses of spatial trends show two major principal components, while
temporal analyses tend to show only one dominant trend in space, is worth highlighting. The
principal spatial trend will generally show the dominant trend over larger regions, while the
second spatial trend could relate to an increase in testing capacity over the time period, showing
an overall increase in numbers detected over the whole, whereas early in the emergence of
SARS-CoV-2, only those with severe symptoms would likely be detected. It could also highlight
second-order structure in the data, corresponding to higher variability in times of policy changes
(e.g. lockdowns, reopening of schools, reopening of public services) or local variations in trends
not picked up by the main principal component.

One of the drawbacks of conventional PCA is that as an unsupervised method, it is often
challenging to interpret the often abstract outputs that it produces. Also, in many scenarios,
known structures in the data can be readily available and are not themselves of interest. One of the
