non-locality), we could find it in scenarios 1 and 1’, and (with uncertainty) in scenarios 3 and 3’.
But in scenarios 2 and 2’: the event space has changed unbeknownst to Alice and Bob and this
change has diminished information. We can almost argue for an approximate level of ‘non-local’
dis-information.

Translating the Alice and Bob example in the so-called risk-neutral pricing approach, which we
use in modern asset pricing, would lead to some conundrums. Risk-neutral pricing essentially
uses non-event-based probabilities to force expected returns of risky assets to be risk free. The
importance of using a risk-free rate of return on risky assets provides for a superior advantage in
modelling the pricing of assets: such a rate is objectively determinable.? The essential problem
with using risky rates of return is that they reflect so-called preferences for risk by decision-
makers, and those preferences are of course not unique and hence they are notoriously difficult
to model. In fact, the risk-neutral pricing setting would require the red line event to be much
more sophisticated. Instead of simply swapping colours, one would need to create a red line

2One can peruse the financial newspapers to find the risk free rate. Typically, it will be the rate of return of some very safe
investment product such as a government bond from a country which has an outstanding financial position.


event where black and white squares would now be converted into black and white squares
with varying degrees of intensity. In other words, the level of ‘non-local’ dis-information would
be much higher than in scenario 2’. If we want to approximate instantaneous transmission of
information, then this would be even more difficult in this setting.

Here are a couple of points we may want to keep in mind while progressing through this paper:
