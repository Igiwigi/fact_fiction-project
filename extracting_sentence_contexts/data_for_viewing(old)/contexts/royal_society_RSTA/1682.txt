the effective appropriation of these features appear possible. Partial precedents from comparable
environments suggest that actors on the Moon would attempt to establish exclusion zones. For
example, the partners in the International Space Station (ISS) assert a 200m ‘keep out zone’, [61].
More recently, the private company Bigelow Aerospace in 2013 successfully sought a review by
the US Federal Aviation Administration’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation of its plans
for a lunar habitat, which included a zone of operation that other US entities would be barred
from entering [62]. Given these conceptual precedents for exclusion zones, it is plausible that
actors modifying or building installations on or around lunar sites of interest would take similar
steps to limit others’ access to them. As noted, a NASA statement of principles for the Artemis
Accords provides for creating ‘safety zones’ that could entail such restrictions [48]. The potential
for disputes is aggravated by the fact that no forum exists for the ‘appropriate consultations’
between parties facing interference called for in Article XII of the OST. Efforts to address such
eventualities are more likely to succeed if they are pursued before new “facts on the ground” are
established.


4. Policy considerations

Means of managing these challenges at lunar sites of interest are suggested by coordination and
governance mechanisms developed to address similar problems in other settings, most of them
terrestrial. From the perspective of policy studies, lunar sites of interest present analogues to
global ‘common-pool resources’ or ‘commons’ [63,64]. These are resources over ‘which no single
nation has a generally recognized exclusive jurisdiction’ [65]. In outer space, other comparable
environments of interest include orbits and other celestial bodies, such as asteroids and Mars [65].
On Earth, they include the resources of the deep seabed, the water column beyond territorial seas,
