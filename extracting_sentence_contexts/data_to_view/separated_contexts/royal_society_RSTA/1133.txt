(a) Mechanisms of ammonia impacts on vegetation

The examples presented highlight the increased sensitivity of lichens and bog vegetation to
gaseous NH3 compared with wet deposited NH4y* and NO3_, which appears to be at least partly
related to the alkaline effect of NH3. In this way, higher correlations were found between Lan and
NHs in the UK-scale lichen survey than with total N deposition. In fact, the highest single-factor
correlation was found with the ratio of N to S deposition (electronic supplementary material,

NHs3, also provides an indication of acid-base balance.
