whom expressly mention that, in the case of the particular form which they studied,

solitary individuals became encysted and no signs of conjugation could be found. For

my part, I certainly believe I should have found syngamy in my cultures, if such a

‘process of union occurs in the life-cycle of B. candatus. 1 conclude, therefore, that
syngamy is lacking in the binucleate genus Bodo.

The process of excystation differs from that occurring in, at any rate, [elkesimastix
and Copromonas, in that the cyst-wall is not dissolved as a whole, but is ruptured at
one point and, when the newly active individual has emerged, the remains of the cyst
are left behind. This fact was mentioned in our account of Helkesimastix and we
can entirely corroborate Srvron’s description and text-tigs. 12-17 (Joc. cit.).

culture of this flagellate on agar-plates, I
have found that an interesting modification has taken place in the character of the
“ encysted ” individuals and the mode in which they become active again. In an old
culture, the appearance of the resting quiescent forms is quite different from that of
the normal refringent cysts. The body is rounded or ovoid, and of course the
flagella are completely lost, but there is no sign of any conspicuous refringent cyst-

But in the course of the “ intensive
