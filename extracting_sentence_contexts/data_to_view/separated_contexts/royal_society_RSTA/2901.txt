and j0(t2) exp(iB) + y10(t2) exp(—iB) — i(y3q(t2) exp(iB) — 920(t2) exp(—iB)) = 0. In fact, the second algebraic equation of (3.5) establishes a connection between the horizontal and
vertical vibrations of the outer mass through the motion of the internal rotator. Thus in some sense
this equation can be viewed as an effective coupling between the axial and the lateral vibrations
of the outer unit. It can be easily shown that system (3.5) possesses two integrals of motion.
