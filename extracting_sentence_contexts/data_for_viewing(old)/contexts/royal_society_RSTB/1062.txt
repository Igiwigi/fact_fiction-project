in late winter and in spring the sea of part of the §.W. coast of England (Plymouth),
or that around Jersey, may swarm with Cirripede larvee (Chthamalus, Balanus). In
order to obtain Nauplii of Lepas faseicularis it is, according to Witvemors-SuuM
(28), during the day time necessary to fish at some depth below the surface, as these

Nauplii perform the daily descent to depths characteristic of the pe’agic fauna as a

whole, while at night they may be obtained in vast numbers at the surface itself:

The first moult is, as a rule, speedily accomplished, as WILT :
Lepas fascicularis, in fact so speedily that in this species, as well as in Balanus
perforatus, after half an hour or so it is often difficult to find any individuals which

have not undergone it. It appears to take place more slowly in most Lepads, but
the number of batches examined was too small for generalization.
In consequence of this cireumstance it is only comparatively rarely that one meets in
the Auftrieb (result of surface-net fishing) with Nauplii which have not moulted once.
On the other hand the Nauplii of all the species kept in confinement, with exceed-
‘ingly few exceptions, did not moult more than once. I could get those of Balanus
perforatus alone, in some cases, to moult a second time. All my efforts to rear the
