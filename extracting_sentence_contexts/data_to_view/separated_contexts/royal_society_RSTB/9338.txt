Unfortunately, in my experience, there is widespread ignor-
ance and misunderstanding about the workings of criminal
adjudication and regarding the nature of forensic science
evidence, including among those who are professionally
concerned with the administration of criminal justice. Crim-
inal adjudication is complex. Misapprehensions are partly
attributable to the fact that not everything in this field is as
simple or straightforward or foolish or corrupt as it may
appear on the surface, or from only one occupational or
disciplinary perspective. In order, hopefully, to move the reform discussion
forward, this article revisits the diagnostic question and
places it within the broader institutional context of criminal
adjudication. Section 2 attempts to specify what actually
goes wrong with forensic science evidence in contemporary
criminal proceedings and to clarify the scope for effective
remedial interventions.
