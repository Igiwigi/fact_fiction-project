rounded, and bears upon a plate of agate, on which the weight of the revolving parts
is taken. A little above this comes the driving pulley (9 inches in diameter), and
above this again the screw and nut by which the divided card is held. The top piece
is hollow, forming a tube with an aperture of 1; inches, and is held by a well-fitting
brass collar attached to the upper part of the frame. On this bearing the force is very
8mall, s0 that the considerable relative velocity of the sliding surfaces has no ill effect,
Notwithstanding its great weight, the ring ran very lightly, and the principal resistance
to be overcome was that due to setting air in motion.


662 LORD RAYLEIGH ON THE VALUE OF THE BRITISH

In the original apparatus the ring is very light, in fact scarcely strong enough to
stand the forces to which it is subjected in winding on the wire. In order to avoid
this defect, and als on account of its larger size, the new ring was made very magsive.
Cast solid, with Ings at the ends of what was to be in use the horizontal diameter,
it was cut into two equal parts along a horizontal plane. The two parts were then
inzulated from one another by a layer of ebonite, and firmly joined together again at,
the lugs by bolts and nuts, after which the grooves, &c., were carefully turned, As it
was intended to use two coils of wire in perpendicular planes, two rings were prepared.
The smaller ring fitted into the larger, the end pieces passing through holes along the
vertical diameters of both. But for a reason that will presently be given, only the
larger ring was used in the present experiments.

In the spring of 1881 the larger ring was wound in Messrs, ErLiorrs' shop under
