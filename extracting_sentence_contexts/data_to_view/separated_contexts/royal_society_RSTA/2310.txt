For
instance, in the case 41 =0.05, 42 =0.1, there are three distinct intervals of admissible and
forbidden regimes. A similar variation in the regimes is also observed for a high contrast in model
parameters in a simple chain and a square-cell lattice. The other plot, figure 4b, illustrates the fact that even though the macroscopic properties, such
as speeds of sound v1,2 and stiffness c of the springs between the chains, remain the same, the
microlevel fracture properties vary. The energy release rates take different values and, moreover,
qualitative changes in the admissible regimes occur. We see a growth in the admissible regime
with an increase in 4; while j12 remains constant, for all presented cases.
