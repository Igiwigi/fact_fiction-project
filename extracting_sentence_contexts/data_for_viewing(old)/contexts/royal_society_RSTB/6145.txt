leave a single wall for observation. Several methods were tried for carrying out
this operation, and finally the following was adopted. A suspension of macerated
cells, obtained as described above, was allowed to flow over a slide previously
thoroughly cleaned in alcohol and covered with a thin layer of albumen fixative,
applied by means of a finger covered with a rubber fingerette. The water was
evaporated at 30° C, the glycerine of the fixative removed by alcohol, and the slides
replaced in the oven until the fixative was hard. The slides were then “ shaved ”
with a sharp microtome knife. The majority of the tracheids were lying parallel
to the surface of the slide, either on their tangential or their radial faces, so that
this operation resulted in the partial or complete removal of one longitudinal wall,
leaving the opposite wall for observation. In order to measure the spiral inclination
of such a wall we require some co-ordinate axis to which to refer. This would be
furnished by the long axis of the cell were it not for the fact that the wall is not, in
general, bounded by parallel sides.* It was therefore found most convenient to
define the long axis of the cell at any point as the direction bisecting the acute angle
between the direction of the two limiting side walls. Tips of cells, bordered pits,
and parts containing obvious deformations were avoided. The inclination of the
fibrils in any cell was then found to be fairly constant over its whole wall surface
(radial or tangential) except perhaps at the tips, where some uncertainty occurred.
Each individual reading was taken six times in all, the experimental error being
not greater than +0-75°,
