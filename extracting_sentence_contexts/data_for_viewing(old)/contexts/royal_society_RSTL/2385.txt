male of another hive ; for I much doubt whether she ever receives the embraces
of a brother. The results of some of Hupex's experiments are very fayourable

to this conclusion, as is the otherwise excessive number of male bees, and in
both the animal and vegetable world nature has taken very ample means of
facilitating what the breeders of improved varieties of domesticated animals
call cross breeding.

I have also been led by the following facts to believe, that not only the
future permanent habitation of each 8warm, but the place where they tempo-
rarily settle, apparently to collect their numbers, soon after they quit their hive,
is known also to each individual. Different families of domesticated animals
of every species present some peculiarities of disposition and habit ; and the
swarms of the family of bees, which were the snbject of my experiments,
showed, I think, more than an ordinary disposition to unite, by two apparently
joining the same queen. My attention was consequently attracted to the
circumstances which preceded such unions.

The simultaneous movements and agitation of two hives, had during several
days led me to expect that a junction of their swarms was contemplated ; and
the two ultimately issned ont. almost. at, the sxame moment, and instantly united,
