forms cannot be separated by any definite line of demarcation ; and that they must there-

tion of the surface of the shell, which are such marked features in the physiognomy
of Peneroplis, are repeated in Dendritina (Plate Il. figs. 21, 22) in a manner s0 precisely
s8imilar, as strongly to impress every one who has his attention directed to the aspects of
these two forms respectively, with the idea of their very close relationship.
