Such constraints can be found
in the works dedicated to high-order closures based on the MEP for the description of rarefied
gas dynamics. The latter includes works on both DVMs [39] and moment methods [55,66]. For
example, the seminal paper by Levermore [39] introduces sets of admissible moments whose
maximal order is either two or four:

— 5-moment:

(L, Siees Six Six), (2.17)
— 10-moment:

(1, Siar Fini), (2.18)
— 14-moment:

(L, Sia, SiaSip, Six Six Sica, Fix Six Sin Sin), (2.19)


— 21-moment:

(CL, bias Siakip, Sia Sipésiy, Six Six SinFin) (2.20)
— 26-moment:

(1, bias Sia kip, SiakipSiy, Fix Siz ia kip), (2.21)
— 35-moment:

(L, Sias Siakip, Sia kipSiys FiaSip bi Six)» (2.22)

In fact, the above sets enclose all linear combinations of moments belonging to each set, i.e.
their raw, Hermite, central and central Hermite version—a fortiori, it does not extend to non-
linear combinations of moments such as cumulants. In addition to Levermore’s sets of moments, :
restrictions to third-order moments (and their linear combinations) were proposed in the context :B
of moment approaches:

— 13-moment:
(L, Siar SinSip, Six Six Fie), (2.23)
— 20-moment:
(1, Siar Sia&ip, Sia Sip§iy), (2.24)
where Grad’s 13 moments can be obtained from the set (2.23) by considering second- and third- : a
order moments based on peculiar discrete velocities & jy = fig — Ua [66-68]. : 3
In the context of LBMs based on the numerical equilibrium (2.13), each set of moments : a
two

(2.17)-(2.24) leads to a different macroscopic behaviour. Roughly speaking, the asymptotic limit
recovered by LBMs based on the above sets of moments can be summarized as

dp + dy (puy) =0,

9t(Ptla) + Op(PUattg + Pdap) + A2 = 9p(Tap) + As (2.25)
and Ap(PE) + Aq((PE + p)ite) + AY = dq(Gy) + AL,

where Ay and Af are errors, respectively, related to equilibrium moments of order 1 and
their trace, that would emerge if the corresponding constraints are not accounted for in the
computation of the exponential equilibrium (2.13).
