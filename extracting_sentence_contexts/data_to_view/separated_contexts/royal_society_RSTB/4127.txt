(1) The Different Forms of Experiment. The procedure carried out in the nine experiments was varied in six different ways. They all agreed in the fact that a particular nerve or particular nerves had connection
with the central nervous system severed, and attachment of the peripheral end or
ends made to a neighbouring nerve or to neighbouring nerves. There were two
groups of the experiments, namely, those in which attachment was made of the
severed root or roots to another root or to other roots of the brachial plexus, and those
in which attachment was made to a nerve not belonging to the brachial plexus,
namely, the spinal accessory. Thus, in the former case, in any restoration which took
place the muscles were still innervated through the cells appropriate to the plexus,
whereas in the latter case the function had to be restored through cells not by nature
related to the brachial plexus.
