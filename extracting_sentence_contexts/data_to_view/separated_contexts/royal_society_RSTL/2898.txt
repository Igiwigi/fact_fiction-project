In other observations I found that on one occasion, when the atmosphere
was 725, a 8ingle female bee while nursing upon a single cell, from which a perfect,
insect was developed about eight hours afterwards, had a temperature of 92*3 : the
bulb of the thermometer in this instance was placed upon the cell immediately
beneath the abdomen of the bee, which was respiring at the rate of 120 per minute. In another obseryation, when the temperature of the atmosphere was still the same,
725, a single bee while nursing had a temperature of 945, but a little while after-
wards when the atmosphere was 72*7 it had subsided to 91%. These facts distinctly prove that bees have a voluntary power of evolving heat,
while it seems only fair to conclude, on comparing the facts, that the quantity of heat
produced in a given time and space, has relation to the number of respirations per-
formed by the individual; and from the quantity of atmospheric air consumed, and of
carbonic acid gas evolved, that animal heat is greatly and perhaps almost entirely
dependent upon the chemical changes which take place in the air respired. Temperature of the Hive Bee, Apis mellifica, Linx., during the Winter. The many curious facts connected with the production of heat in the Humble Bee
and other insects, naturally disposed me to wish to extend my inquiries to the ascer-
tainment of that of the inhabitants of the hive, and fortunately circumstances enabled

me to carry my wishes into execution, and commence my observations in the summer
