Returning to (95), it follows that XY is equivalent to a multiple of one of the
three products which are obtained by multiplying together two of the three linear forms

u+Ov+0-w, u+dv+Â¢?w, u+yo+yw. (99)
The three possible products are themselves mutually equivalent. This follows from the
fact that the field is galoisian and cyclic, so that there is a unimodular substitution which has
the effect of permuting cyclically the three linear forms (99). Hence XY is equivalent to
a multiple of (89), and this establishes the main assertion of theorem 11. It remains to prove the final assertion of theorem 11.
