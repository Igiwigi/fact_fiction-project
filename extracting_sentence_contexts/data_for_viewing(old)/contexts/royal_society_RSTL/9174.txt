action in Sarsia is of a yery marked and unmistakable character, I may begin
by stating that when any part of the internal surface of the bell is irritated, the
polypite responds ; but as there is no evidence of ganglia occurring in the poly- |
pite, this cannot properly be regarded as a case of reflex action. But, now, the
conyerse of the above statement is likewise true, viz. that when any part of the
polypite is irritated, the bell responds; and it is in this that the unequivocal __

evidence of reflex action consists. Of course the objection at once arises, if response by
the polypite to irritation of the bell is explained by the simple supposition of there being
a continuous or common excitability pervading these organs, why may not the converse

A case be explained by the same supposition ? But this objection is met by a fact that makes
=] an essential difference between the two cases, viz. that while the sympathy of the polypite
E with the bell is not in the least impaired by removing the marginal ganglia of the latter,
I‚Äù the sympathy of the bell with the polypite is by this operation entirely destroyed.

S We have thus very excellent demonstration of the occurrence of reflex action in the
- Medusz; and as this is snch an admirable instance of it, I shall describe it a little more
2 in detail. Suppose the experimenter to have chosen a vigorous specimen of Sqrsi with
E: its polypite well retracted, and snppose him to wait for the occurrence of one of the
i= natural pauses in the swimming-motions ; if he then suddenly seizes the end of the
ie polypite with a pair of forceps, taking care not to touch any part of the bell, the
S polypite is instantly retracted even further than it was before, and immediately
2 afterwards the tentacles are drawn up while the bell begins to make violent efforts
