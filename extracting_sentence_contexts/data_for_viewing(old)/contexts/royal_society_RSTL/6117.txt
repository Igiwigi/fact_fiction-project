writes Mr. BALL, © and I have frequently verified his observations upon this point,
though the air-cavities show traces of compression reducing them to the form of flat-
tened lenses, the directions in which they are flattened are most various, and $how No
constant retationship to the planes of the veined structure. Here then we have direct
evidence that separate portions of the ice have been acted upon by pressure sufficient in
amount to modify their internal arrangement, but that these pressures have not acted in
the same, or nearly the same direction.”

Granting the inference that the observed flattening © furnishes direct evidence” of
pressure, the foregoing argument would, I confess, be a very formidable one. If the
bubbles are thus flattened by pressure, and if the veined structure, as I contend, be the
result of pressure, and approximately at right angles to the direction of the force, we
ought to have the bubbles squeezed out in planes parallel to the structure. The fact
that the bubbles are not s0 squeezed out, would then afford a strong presumption that
the structure is not produced by pressure. I expect, however, to be able to prove that
the shape of the bubbles is not a © direct evidence ” of pressure, as hitherto assumed ;
and I think, as I do 0, it will be seen how necessary it is to associate experiment with
an inquiry of this kind, if we would read aright our observations.

In a paper in the Philosophical Transactions on the Physical Properties of Ice, T have
shown that when a sunbeam traverses a mass of ice, the latter melts at innumerable

points in the track of the beam, and that each portion melted assumes the form, not
of a globule, but of a flower of six petals. The planes in which these flowers are formed
are independent of the shape of the mass and of the direction of the beam through it ;
