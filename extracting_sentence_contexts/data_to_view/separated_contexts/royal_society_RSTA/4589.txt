compared with what condenses in the form of drops. From the quantity of water
which separates, and the size of the drops, we may calculate the number, assuming
the water to be equally divided among them. It is assumed here that the cloud-particles are actually liquid drops and not ice-
crystals, in spite of the fact that the condensation begins at temperatures much below
the freezing point, and that the temperature when the particles are full grown is, as
we shall see, also slightly below the freezing point. Let us consider first the quantity of water which separates out in consequence of
an expansion of a given amount. Let us suppose the expansion to be completed
before the drops have grown to more than a very small fraction of their final size, so
that the theoretical lowering of temperature results.
