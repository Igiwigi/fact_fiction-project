Column I. gives the scale number, IT. the wave-length, III. the actual mean reading,
IV. the last x 1°8, V. the ordinates of the normal luminosity curve of the central
part of the eye, VI. the difference between M.’s curve and the normal luminosity
curve, whilst VII. gives the difference multiplied by 515 to bring the maximum to
100 for comparison with other curves. It will be seen that this curve (F., fig. 33) very
nearly coincides with our persistency curve, except in the part of the spectrum affected
by the yellow spot.

No measures were taken to ascertain if the eye of M. had any central absorption,
and, therefore, we do not know what correction should be made to the curve to make
it comparable with the others; but taken as it is, it is remarkable how closely this,
which represents the deficiency in M.’s sensations, corresponds with the one sensation
of either of the brothers. In fact, it seems as if the eyes of M. and P. together
would make up a pair of normal eyes.
