M. Parrixsson. That is indeed an interesting avenue for future research, in
particular, if one can establish quantitative analyses. Stability analyses exist for
special cases of stochastic mathematical programming with complimentarity
constraints (SMPCC) (e.g. Shapiro 2006), and of course also for special convex
stochastic programming problems (e.g. R6misch 2003), but for general SMPEC I

am not aware of any general such results. In fact, we probably have not seen the
ast well-defined set of optimality conditions of SMPEC yet.

would be interesting to compare the approaches towards this problem from
different perspectives.

M. Parriksson. It is indeed interesting and important to discuss these relations.

The most important thing to recognize is that the ‘stochasticity’ involved in a
