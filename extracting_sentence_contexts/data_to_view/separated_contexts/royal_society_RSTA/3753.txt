OF LOGICAL CLASS-FREQUENCIES, ETC. 119 The set of equations II. may be obtained from the set I. by the transformations
(2) above, thus affording the verification
The fact that the model for wy values of p,, p,, and ps can always be transformed
into a model for the case p, < 0°5, p, < 0°5, ps < 0°5 justifies our terming case
(4), § 20, ‘a type of the most general case.” The geometrical transformations here
suggested would seem to correspond to “ reductions” of the syllogisms. Thus in
