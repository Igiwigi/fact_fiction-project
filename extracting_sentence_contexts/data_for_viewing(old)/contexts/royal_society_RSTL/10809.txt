Of the quantities involved in this equation a, b, and X are known with great
accuracy, certainly within one part in ten thousand. 'T also is known with consider-
_ able accuracy, but the value of a—b is uncertain, to the extent of perhaps 1 per cent.
The third term is 8mall compared with the others, and s0 requires only approximate

values of @—b and c. We may therefore use (11) as an equation to find a—b,
inserting the observed value of « for each of the rings measured. If the value of a—b
does not come out the same for each ring, then MacCurLacn's theory is incon-
sistent with the facts, unless indeed the discrepancies may be attributed to errors of
observations.

This mode of presenting the results of the measurements possesses the great
advantage that it shows at once how far the observed wave=urface departs from the
theoretical one, For instance, if for a certain value of þ$ a—b comes out +F5gth
part too large, this indicates that the real separation of the two sheets is very
approximately xgggth part greater than that given by the theory, This is true
throughout, except for the firs two small rings.

The results from the large rings im Plate 2 are exhibited in Table ITI. The first
line gives the value of %. The next four lines give the observed diameters, two sets
of observations having been taken in plane A and two in plane B. The oblique
