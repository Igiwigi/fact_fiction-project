For the 95th percentile estimate of forcing this date is brought forward by around a decade. The results for the 2°C threshold are similar but the impact on dates is slightly larger. This
means that when considering the extra feedbacks, it is not just necessary to take account of
the impact on levels of emission reduction and mitigation for a given warming limit, it is also
necessary to consider the fact that warming happens sooner, which is relevant to adaptation. The
slight increase in probability of staying below 1.5°C after 2050 is due to the more pronounced
temperature overshoot in the 1.5°C case. It is important to note that we are not providing a best estimate here of the year where the
probability of limiting warming falls below a given level.
