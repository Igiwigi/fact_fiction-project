At other times the same assumptions were
made for physical or theological objectives, such as ensuring the permanence of atoms, but ran
into mathematical problems, as in Kelvin and Tait’s attempts to apply Lagrange’s equations of
motion to vortices. Osborne Reynolds was clear that the origin of the tensions lay in the impossible attempt to
match abstract theory with reality. The fluid dynamicist,


has to begin by apologising for his fundamental assumptions as being obviously contrary to
facts, and after carrying his readers through most difficult and complex mathematics, he has
again to apologise for his conclusions, which are in general contrary to experience... The
only real success, has been obtained by the rigorous development of the theory of the
motions in a perfect fluid... regardless of whether or not these motions take place in actual
fluids [58, p. 343]. Vortex atom theory in Britain was pursued by an elite group of Cambridge-trained
mathematicians and physicists.
