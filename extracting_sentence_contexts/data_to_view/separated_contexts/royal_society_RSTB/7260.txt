Armeria, A. labradorica, which now exists in northern Greenland, is monomorphic. In view
of these facts it is of particular interest to note not only that Armeria pollen occurs in these
late-Glacial Cornish deposits, but that since both A and B types of pollen occur, the
dimorphic species was present. The same condition is found in late-Glacial deposits in the
Lea Valley where calyces also occur, and in the Irish late-Glacial. The pollen may thus be referred in all probability to.A. vulgaris s.l. (Iversen), and its
presence undoubtedly indicates open conditions.
