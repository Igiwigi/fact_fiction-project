So far as the histology of the stem is concerned the three forms tannensis, elongata
and lanceolata are essentially identical with each other, so that one description will
do for them all. The notable points of difference from 7'm. Vieillardi lie in the absence
of medullary xylem, the sclerenchymatous nature and pitting of the pith and, so far
as observed, in the fact that the sieve-plates are always uniseriate. Concerning the distribution of the phloem, my conclusions with regard to this species
are the same as in the case of 7â€™m. Viedllardi.
