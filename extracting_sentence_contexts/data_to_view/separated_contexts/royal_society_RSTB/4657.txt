A section from the peripheral blue area (Plate 1, fig. 3b) shows a very striking
contrast. The chitin pillars, a, instead of being over 2 in height, are less than 1 p,
becoming, in fact, merely bosses of chitin at the extreme edge of the blue border. The change of colour is no doubt correlated with this variation in height, for it is

clear that the number of plates traversed by a ray of light at any angle depends
upon the height of the plates, as well as upon the inclination of the ray; and the
greater the number of interfering surfaces, the greater will be the saturation of the
resulting colour, This is indeed the case, for at normal incidence the central portion
is bronze green, the periphery brown, whereas, when the incidence increases, more
and more plates are cut by the oblique rays, and the central portion changing to a
vivid green, seems to spread outwards, because the periphery containing the shorter
pillars becomes an iridescent blue. 3.
