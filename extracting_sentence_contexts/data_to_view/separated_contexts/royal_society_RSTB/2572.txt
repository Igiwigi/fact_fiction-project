As these nodules are frequently connected with each other by this mode of
bending of the rows of fibres, now into upright, now oblique, now horizontal direction,
one may look upon a synapticular bridge as growing out from one septum to the next. Pratz seems to have had this particular form of synapticula in view when he gave
his definition of the “ true synapticula ” (antea p. 185). I am led to this opinion by
the fact that these synapticular knobs of Hupsamma outwardly resemble the com-
ponent “nodules” of a trabecula of Cyclolites, Mucrosolena, and other genera of the
Pseudo-Astrainze examined by Pratz, Pratz did not identify the structure of the
nodule of Cyclolites, &c., with that of the Astrid granulation. Their identity is
however demonstrated in the preceding parts of this paper, since both “nodule” and
“granulation” correspond with one or more fasicular groups of fibres extending
towards the lateral surface of a septum. Some of the synapticular knobs uf Hup-
sammio are, on the other hand, formed in special invaginations of the basal body-
wall of the polyp, and are homologous with the new centres of calcification introduced
in the interseptal loculi of Fungids and Lophoserids and forming a coalescence of the
adjacent granulate outgrowths.
