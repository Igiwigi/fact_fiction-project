AND ON THE DIURNAL INEQUALITY. 7

no longer common, 8uch as confounding the time of high water with the time of
turn of the tide-stream. But there is probably till s0me unnecessary difficulty pro-
duced by regarding, as a cardinal point in the observation, the © estahlishment,” as
vulgarly understood, namely the hour of high water on the day of new or full moon ;
for, in fact, the hour of high water on this day is of no more importance than the
hour of high water on any other day, except in 80 far as it gives the means of know-
ing the hour on other days. And it does not afford the means of doing this, any
more than the hour of high-water for any other given age of the moon does. For
just as much inaccuracy as, from whatever cause, there is, in deduciny the time of
high water at all ages of the moon from the time at a given age, just s0 much inac-
curacy is there, from the same causes, in deducing the time of high water for all
ages of the moon, from the time for full or new moon. ' And if the time at which the
tide follows the moon on two or three snccessive occasions, be greatly and irregularly
different, the observations are equally of little value, (either for drawing cotidal lines,
or for predicting tides, or for any other purpose,) whether any of the observed tides
fall on the day of new or full moon, or do not. If the tides are regular and the ob-
servations good, the common * establighment” may be obtained from the observa-
