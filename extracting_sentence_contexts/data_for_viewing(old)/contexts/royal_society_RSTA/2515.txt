The bijection /*: a d that is obtained ‘from the diagram’ is indeed Dedekind’s, as it is defined
by h*(x) =h(x) if x is in U [h"[a\d] | 1 €] and h*(x) = id(x) if x is in a\U [h"[a\d] | n € N]. However,
Dedekind wanted to avoid any appeal to natural numbers in the development of his general
theory of chains; after all, the natural numbers were to be founded on it. Once the natural numbers
had been given a chain-theoretic characterization, Dedekind established that the approximation
from below and above (as the intersection of all chains containing a\d and closed under h)
yield the same set.° The latter characterization is going to be discussed next to address the two
problematic and deeply related issues I just pointed to: an explicit set-theoretic definition of c and
c* as well as the proof of the structural identities.

5Many proofs, including Kénig’s original one and more contemporary proofs like that of Doyle & Conway [20], define a
partition of a into sets c, c* and r based on the basic insight underlying figure 3; cf. also footnote 4. Scott Weinstein pointed
me to Doyle and Conway’s paper and provided a proof of the graph-theoretic fact that is crucially used there to prove CBT.
Weinstein’s proof emphasized for me the parallelism of the Doyle and Conway argument to that of Kénig.

In the last part of #131 of [23], one finds an unnumbered theorem that expresses this identity. The theorem guarantees the
existence of the approximation from above—on the basis of the existence of N. In that restricted sense, the general theory
is dependent on N: the infinity axiom guarantees the existence of N in ZF; N together with the Replacement Principle (and
the union axiom) ensures the existence of a set that contains a\d and is closed under h; thus, the intersection is applied to a
non-empty set.
