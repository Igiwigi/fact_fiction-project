Most
materials are more likely to adsorb water than oil. Only the non-woven textile made of artificial
mineral fibres showed similar adsorptions for transmission lubricant and water. Based on the fact
that high amounts of water could be wrung out of the specimen after the experiment, adsorption
must have been the predominant mechanism. The results performed with water and water mixed
with 2 and 3 vol% xanthan are shown in figure 7. The increase in viscosity of water leads
to a reduction in water adsorption of the investigated non-woven textile specimen.
