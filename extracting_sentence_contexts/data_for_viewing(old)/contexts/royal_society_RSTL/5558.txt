SJoints at oo are, I think, triple points, and the other two points of intersection with the
I =, cuspidal points, but I have not verified this: assuming that it is 80, there will be
S reduction 54 accounted for in the class of the curye, but the curve is, in fact, as will be
Shown i in the sequel, of the class 6 ; there is consequently-a reduction 72 to be accounted
Dr by other singularities of the curve.

S It is obvious from the preceding formule that the caustic stands to the circle radius
Z in a relation similar to that in which it stands to the circle radius 1, 7. e. to the
Foſroting circle, In fact, the very same caustic would have been obtained if "wp circle
Sudius | = had been taken for the refracting circle, the index of refraction being = — instead

Follows.
