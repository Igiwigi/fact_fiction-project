a transition layer, the normal component of the magnetisation vanishes there, and
consequently the surface integrals applied to the outer surfaces of any such body
would also vanish ; the two different expressions for the contained energy thus become
equivalent.

This is perhaps sufficient to justify a summary rejection of this new interpretation
of the energy relations of the magnetic field, as being at most no, better than the
older one which it presumed to displace. The real trouble in both cases seems to have
arisen mainly in an effort to discover an analogy in the relations of the electrie and
magnetic fields. Hrrrz and HeavistpE were the first to insist on the existence of
this analogy, and practically all the modern writers follow them in this matter, even
so far as to regard it as providing sufficient justification for certain fundamental
formule of the theory. _ A close scrutiny of the subject will, however, reveal the fact
that although the mathematical relations connecting the magnetic force induction and

polarisation are to a certain extent similar to those connecting the electric force, total
electric displacement and dielectric displacement, the similarity ends with these
relations, and the dynamical characteristics of the two types of field are essentially
different ; and the analogy itself, so far as it exists, seems to be based on erroneous and
confused conception of the nature of the magnetic energy as determined by the usual
expression of the theory, so that it finds no place in a consistent formulation of the
subject, notwithstanding even HEAvistpr'â€™s spirited defence in criticism of Larmor.
