Although the problem of the origin and nature of these bodies has never been con-
templated by chemists in the general point of view, by which alone consequent and
satisfactory results could have been arrived at, yet from a very early period in
organic chemistry, attention had been directed to isolated portions of it, particularly
with regard to litmus, which from its general use as a reagent excited curiosity, and
became the subject of frequent, though incomplete examination. Indeed, the nature
of litmus appears to have been to many chemists peculiarly obscure, as notwithstanding
the researches of Fourcroy and VAUQUELIN, of TEXNAaNT, CHEVREUL, PERETTI, DzSFossEs,
and many others, Bzrzerivs declared in the last year that the chemistry of litmus
remained yet to be created. Regarding archil, still less knowledge has been obtained.
I am not aware of any writer who has occupied himself directly with its examination;
and, indeed, it is only incidentally that Hezren mentions, in his admirable memoir
of the lichen products, any facts belonging to the substance found in commerce.

'The origin of those beautiful colouring materials from the different kinds of colour-
less lichens has, however, formed the subject of extensive and connected investiga-
tion, for which we are indebted to Heerex and to RonrqQuer; and it will be found
useful in the subsequent portions of the present paper, to notice briefly the results to
which those eminent chemists arrived. Hetren analysed particularly the lichens
Parmelia Roccella, and the Lecanora Tartarea. He found therein a peculiar body
which he termed Erythrine, as being the basis of the red substances. This erythrine
appeared by boiling in alcohol to be changed into another Psendo-erythrine, and by
exposure to the air, into a material soluble in water, which he called Erythrine-bitter.
By acting on erythrine or erythrine-bitter with ammonia and exposure to air, there
were produced in his experiments three substances, one, yellow, which he did not
