of tube, as already stated in the text:
A = 22'7 millims, of tube, as read off from the line in the diagram, | %m = ‘273 millims. of tube (deduced from the value of the compressibility of mercury given in
Lupron’s tables, viz., — per 10° grms, per sq. centim., and the fact that rotor of the

volume of mercury employed = ioe of 1513 millim. of the tube). Hence
— 50°6 99 _ 90°6 - , 22:7
"= i596 * 722 96 * 13 es
= 7°36 — 0-278 — 0-456. = 6°626 millims.
