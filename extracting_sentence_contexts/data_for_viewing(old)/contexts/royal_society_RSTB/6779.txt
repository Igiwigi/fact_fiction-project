It is most unlikely that the Tilia maxima and minima, or the relation of Tilia to
Ulmus, is affected by local fen woods containing Tilia, since the Tilia percentage is high
in sites distant from the fen margins, and since these maxima occur in different types
of deposit, for example, brushwood peat and raised-bog peat.

Had it been possible to have used larger counts of Tilia and Ulmus pollen, doubtless
greater correspondence in detail would have emerged. As it is, a purely tentative basis
for correlation of the four sites is given by the serial letters on the right of each figure,
which represent equivalent horizons.

With this common basis of similarity in all four sites, it is clear that the fen beds at all
of them were developing more or less together, a fact already apparent from the
stratigraphy.

It is also possible to advance from this recognition of the regional component of all
the diagrams to a detailed consideration of how local factors have differently influenced
each of them.
