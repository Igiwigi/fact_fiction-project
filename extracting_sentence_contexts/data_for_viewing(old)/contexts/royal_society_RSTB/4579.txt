specimens in winter. There was, however, the possibility that both Husorr’s
summer specimens and our winter specimens were in their first year, but if so, it
had to be presumed that a regular production of ova and larve took place all the
year round, so that not the season, but the locality, 7.e., the distance from the site of
production, would be responsible for the size of the larvee. There were, however,
several facts which spoke against the theory of such uninterrupted production, as, for
instance, the periodicity in the occurrence and metamorphosis of the larvee which I
had discovered on board the ‘‘ Thor” in 1905-06.

The net result, then, of our investigations by the close of 1912 was that a great
deal more research work would be needed, since the new data obtained had practically
raised. new difficulties in the way of an interpretation—as, indeed, often happens when
an investigation has passed beyond the earliest stages, when the paucity of facts
gives freer play to the imagination.

The year 1913 was marked by important progress. Not only did our fishing cargo
vessels send us in richer material, but we succeeded in getting the little schooner
“Margrethe,” belonging to the Vendsyssel Packing Co., of Copenhagen, equipped
and sent out on a cruising expedition over the Atlantic, with a supply of nets, etc.,
for pelagic work. The investigations were carried out during the months of
August—December along the following three lines: (1) from the Faroes to south-west
of the Azores (about 28° N., 40° W.); (2) thence to the Newfoundland Banks ; and
(3) from there to the West Indies. The yield was 714 larve of the European eel,
besides a small number (24) of the American. We had now at last obtained a large
amount of material from the open Atlantic Ocean, and the study of this yielded
