VI. Bagneres de Bigorre.

A. Geological Position.—A superficial view of the environs of Bagndres would in-
duce us to question the general application of the views we have given respecting the
connexion of hot springs with intrusive rocks. But it is a very interesting fact, that,
low as these springs occur, indeed at the very outskirts of the range, three distinet
outbreaks of granite appear in the vicinity; and though Bagneres itself is situated
on limestone, clay slate is immediately connected with it. This granite has a re-
markable structure. It consists in great proportion of felspar, is deyoid of mica, and
is extremely friable. It resembles much some of the decomposed granites of Western
Cornwall.

to, otherwise I might ascertain whether the name of Le Grand Bain (synonymous with Le Tambour) occurs.
