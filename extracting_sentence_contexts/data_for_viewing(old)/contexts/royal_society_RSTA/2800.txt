difficult.

Plate tectonics is defined by rigid plate interiors and narrow zones of active deformation, i.e.
plate boundaries [6-8,12]. Even allowing for diffuse plate boundaries [13,14], plate tectonics is
associated with deformation zones that cover a relatively small portion of the Earth’s surface area
(figure 1). Across their full lateral dimensions, plate interiors do not experience significant levels
of deformation. The lack of deformation is what defines ‘rigid’ plate interiors and allows Euler’s
theorem for rigid body rotations on a sphere to be applied to the relative motion of plates [7,8].


The fact that a mathematical theorem sits at its core highlights the precision associated with plate 4 |
tectonics theory (it is no accident that plate tectonics was also referred to as tectonics on a sphere

during its development). It is that precision that makes the theory testable. It also distinguishes 2
plate tectonics from other potential tectonic modes. 8

The creation and maintenance of a global network of narrow plate boundaries is a critical is
condition for plate tectonics. This is what allows Euler’s theorem to be applied to plate motions. : a
It is also why continental reconstructions can be used to determine continental configurations : 2
in the Earth’s past—continents are not being deformed to the degree that the ‘pieces of [2

the jigsaw puzzle’ get too mangled to put them back together. This applies to the shallow
structure of continents and, for the time range that temporal constraints are available, also
