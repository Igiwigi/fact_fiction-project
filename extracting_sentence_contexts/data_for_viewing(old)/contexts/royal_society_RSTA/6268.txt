2. Black-box studies

In this section, we provide a background on the origins of black-box studies and typical features
of their experimental designs. We also provide an overview of what is currently known about
missingness in black-box studies.

(a) Design of black-box studies

The PCAST (2016) report stated that empirical studies must show that a forensic method is
accurate, repeatable and reproducible [14]. However, forensic feature comparison disciplines
are difficult to evaluate empirically. This is, in part, due to the fact that they rely on subjective
decisions. In response to this complication, PCAST (2016) suggested using black-box studies to
assess the scientific validity of these disciplines.

In these studies, researchers compile test sets or items for comparison. Each item ideally
consists of one comparison between a sample of unknown origin (e.g. a latent print) and a sample
of known origin (e.g. one or more latent prints taken from a known individual). These samples
will either be from the same source or a different source. To ensure error rates can be calculated,
the researchers know the ground truth. However, the examiners do not. The examiner is then
asked to decide whether the samples came from the same source.

Using the known ground truth for these items, researchers then arrive at measures of accuracy,
repeatability and reproducibility. Accuracy is measured by the rate at which examiners obtain
