examined.* But it will be well, before entering upon a full discussion of the results,
to re-state the general problem of origin of the sporophyte generation, of which those
members are so constant a feature. For since 1893, when the first Memoir of this
series was written, many fresh facts bearing on the larger question have been disclosed,
while a new face has been put upon the whole doctrine of alternation by the recognition
of those differences of nuclear state, which have now been found in so many cases to
accompany the alternating phases of the life history. Moreover, I am aware of having
stated the problem in the first instance so that some of my expressions have been
misunderstood, while others require amendment for other reasons. I therefore take
the opportunity of first re-stating the general views upon which such data as have
been acquired will have their bearing.

There are two broad facts which form the basis of the whole discussion : first, that
spore-production is the end to which the life of all typical sporophytes tends ; and,
second, that the sporophyte in all typical cases arises from the unicellular zygote.t
It is the generation thus initiated by the zygote, and tending uniformly to the
