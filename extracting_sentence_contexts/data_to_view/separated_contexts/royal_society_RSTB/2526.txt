high,
even in plants derived from grains treated in ether for 15 minutes or singed in the
Bunsen flame. The ether method, according to my experience, although it retards,
does not completely destroy the external saprophytes, and dry heat at 95—98° C. for
10 minutes is insufficient to destroy the bacteria. In view of these facts, and also of
the failure of my culture experiments with separated hyphe, as well as those of
Nester, it seems very probable that the hyph in the starch endosperm described
by Nestuer are not identical with the fungus in the nucellus ; the latter has disap-
peared usually before the culm is 1 decim. high. The following culture experiments are of interest in connection with the possibilities
and development of the nucellar hyphze of the grain. In addition to the recorded attempts given below, numerous attempts have been
made to get cultures of these hyphze separated from the grain.
