tion would make a yery great difference. I give this number for mercury therefore
with very great reserve, and only to show that the resistance of water is many times
greater than that of mercury.

QF 63. At the conclusion of one of his papers © On the Absorption of Heat by Liquids,”
Dr. TYNDALL uses the expression © bisulphide of carbon is the rock-salt of liquids.” It
appears from the Table (4 60) that we may with equal propriety say that © water is the
Silver of liquids,” at least of the non-metallic ones; for it shows as great a preeminence
amongst liquids as silver does amongst metals.

$ 64. It appears that after water itself those liquids have least resistance which
contain hydrogen easily replaceable by a metal, as acetic acid, sulphuric acid, and gly-
cerine. "This fact forcibly suggests the experiments of Herr Ma6xvs on the conducti-
vities of the gases, and the extraordinarily great conductivity of hydrogen. As, however,

the conclusions drawn by Herr MaGxus from his experiments have been questioned by
Dr. TyxNpaLL and other physicists, I refrain from doing more than point out this distinct
coincidence.

< 65. Of bodies belonging to the same chemical series or isotypic bodies, those have
the least thermal resistance which have the simplest constitution. Thus the resistances
of the three alcohols examined are in the order amylic, butylic, and ethylic. Again,
