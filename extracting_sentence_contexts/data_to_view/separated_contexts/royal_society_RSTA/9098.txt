Now for the wedge adopted, it was known that if an intensity I, passing through

emerged as I,, and if
logiy (L/L) = X,

then X = 0'°2+0°4y, where y ‘was the distance from the thin end, which was not
indefinitely thin. But :
i = Le7==s = as P LOZ AS lorwe-
and therefore
ptana = 0'4/log,, e = 0'922,
or practically unity. DISTRIBUTION OF INTENSITY IN BROADENED SPECTRUM LINES. 481

The form of the curve for H,, and in fact of all curves obtained, is not consistent
with the supposition that q is the same for all components. There are two
alternatives to consider in a very simple proof. If the separations are very minute,
all points on the contour not between two components—or in other words all points
except very close to the vertex, are outside all the component axes, and if q were
constant throughout, all the boundary beyond a small distance from the vertex
would take the form

Lert = (+2 > I, eosh ga,)en*,
r=1

and be entirely straight.
