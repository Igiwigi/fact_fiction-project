(3) In the increment of growth weight/hr., C. marginalis is higher than C. chloropyga or
Lucilia (1-29 and 1-34 times as great respectively) but is lower than C. albiceps. This advantage
over the two first-named species is offset by the disadvantages stated above, since the
increment is spread over the total growing period and is greatest during the most rapid
growth period which occurs much later than in Lucilia and C. chloropyga.

Since it is especially in relation to the control of Lucilia populations that C. marginalis has
been brought to the fore, comparisons with Lucilia will be stressed here. In order to do this
more readily, the Lucilia growth curve has been superimposed upon that for C. marginalis in
figure 44.

Lucilia is half-way through its most rapid growth period by the time that C. marginalis
enters this phase. In fact, by this time, Lucilia has completed nearly three-quarters of its
total growth and has a very excellent chance of finishing it before a shortage of food occurs.
Furthermore, Lucilia can, at this juncture, form viable pupae, larvae which have attained
this weight having given rise to healthy adults in experiments. The relative weights of the
larvae of the two species at this point are significant. While Lucilia larvae weigh 0-380 g.
each, C. marginalis are only 0-0160 g., i.e. less than half the size of Lucilia. There can there-
fore be no question of any crowding out of Lucilia by C. marginalis when the two species
find themselves in competition for a common food supply of given size, presuming that the
larvae hatched at approximately the same time. It is only after 90 hr. of feeding that the
C. marginalis larvae attain to approximately the same size as the Lucilia larvae at one and
the same time. At this stage, however, the latter species has nearly completed its full
growth, while C. marginalis is only half-grown.
