The other three lines are all greatly enhanced with respect to (5876. They were
selected because of the astrophysical interest attaching to these lines. The greatest
degree of enhancement occurs in 4388, which would suggest the conditions obtaining
in nebule, but there is an almost equivalent enhancement—producing in fact an
actual greater intensity—in \5015. In a previous section of this communication, we
concluded that the relative behaviour at low pressure, as regards their own individual
series, of \\4472 and 4388, reproduced the intensity relations found in the nebule. But the corresponding effect for 45015 shows that we have not isolated the conditions
which produce the nebular intensity relations in this way.
