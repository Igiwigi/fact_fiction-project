extent. An independent operculum was attached to the hinder border of each visceral
arch from the mandibular to the fourth branchial. The backward extension of the
palato-quadrate and Meckel’s cartilages, necessary for the formation of the mouth and
the attachment of a powerful jaw musculature, brought the hinder end of these
elements over the lateral surface of the hyoidean arch and enabled the mandibular
operculum to extend backward for a great distance, until in fact its ventral part came
to rest on the front margin of the lower part of the shoulder girdle. This operculum,
however, left uncovered a large triangular area above its dorsal margin. It is necessary
for the functioning of the gill apparatus that the gill slits so left exposed should be
provided with an opercular apparatus. This is done by the retention as functional
structures of the dorsal parts of the small opercula (the homologues of the flaps in
Scyllium, which become the frills of Clamydoselache) on the hyoidean and branchial
arches. Each of these structures is provided with a bony skeleton, which ceases
abruptly where it is overlapped by the main mandibular operculum. In fact Climatius
reticulatus gives us for the first time a stage in the evolution of an operculate fish in
which a relic of the Elasmobranch condition of the gill slits is still preserved.

The lateral-line of the body is represented by a groove which runs between two
