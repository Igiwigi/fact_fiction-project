generously and freely, even though this involved much work and, in some instances, travel
over considerable distances. They have served this particular subject and science generally
in the best scientific traditions.

Members of the Board advised on the choice of referees (who remain, in accordance with
scientific tradition, anonymous), and each of the papers published here was reviewed by at
least three and in some cases five referees. None of the papers was accepted in its original
form. We insisted on modifications to all papers, in the light of comments made by the
referees. We rejected one of the papers in the light of refereesâ€™ comments.

The final decision to publish was reached unanimously by the Advisory Board, and we
are now confident that these papers merit publication on scientific grounds, which is our
only concern. Science is, of course, an on-going process. Future work may reveal facts that
support the conclusions reached here or go against them. The work on which these new
facts will be based may come from individuals or from institutions. Philosophical Transactions
will consider for publication all future material in this and other subject areas, regardless of
its provenance. We hope in this way to continue serving science and the society that ulti-
mately sanctions and finances all our research, as we have done for the past 339 years.
