all five areas on the third day had some spores still living on them,
evident that the two top ones, A and B, had fewer than the two bo
D and E, and even than the centre one C—facts brought out more cleadil
photographs than in the reproductions. ;

If each area had an equal number of spores on it to begin with, we should exy
the order of clearness, 7.e., the sharpness of the figure, to be in the order of 4
exposure, C was exposed 6 hours, D only 5 hours, whence C should be es
than D. Nowin the figure this is not the case. But it was the case the day h
and the only reason that C is not now the clearer is because a large number of or
have germinated on the area C, and are rendering it somewhat obscure. j

As a matter of fact, the order of clearness of the areas was just what we show
expect in Stage I.

The “ ghosts” or faint secondary circles on this plate are not easy to explain. ©

This experiment shows, then, that 6 hours’ exposure to the rays of the ele i

is very probable that only such spores escaped on D and C as were directly b

contingencies were certain to arise. It may be regarded as extremely probable, tli
