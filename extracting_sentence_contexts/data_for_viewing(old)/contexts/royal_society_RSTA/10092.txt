of the cause, to oscillations varying as cos (7+7,)t and cos (%—%.)t. The corres-
ponding time of the second combination tone would be 33°38 years.

But it is also found that the two first numbers are very nearly in the ratio of three
to four, so that we may also express the three periodic times as sub-periods of
33°375 years, thus:

4x 33°375 = 11125
4x 33°375 = 8°344
1x33°375 = 4-768

How far this connexion is accurate or approximate is impossible to say at present,
but the fact that the three periods which have been traced with certainty should also
bear a remarkably simple relationship to each other is worthy of note.

The question naturally occurs whether the great difference in sunspot activity
observed when different maxima are compared with each other may be accounted
for by the overlapping of different periods which sometimes will strengthen and
sometimes weaken each other's effects. That the difference is not exclusively due
to such overlapping is proved by the evidence of the periodogram, which for instance
teaches us that in the second part of the eighteenth century the 11-year period was
reduced to a fraction of its normal value.

Nevertheless it is true that in the exceptionally great outburst in 1870 nearly all
the periods found seem to have been at their maximum phase. Similarly in the
