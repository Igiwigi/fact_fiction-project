cylinder wall for any of the above assumptions provided that shear stress is regarded
as the determining factor both for initial failure and subsequent flow. There is, however,
no means of verifying experimentally the theoretical conclusions other than by the
measurement of strains. Agreement between the measured and theoretical diametral
extension, for instance, would be strong evidence of the existence of the stress distribu-
tion assumed. Unfortunately, a difficulty is introduced in the calculation of the strains
by the fact, to which attention was drawn by Turner, that although in an overstrained
cylinder axial strain will remain constant over the cross-section, it does not follow, as
in the case of a completely elastic cylinder, that the axial stress will also be constant.
Tf the cylinder is partially overstrained the axial strain must necessarily be uniform over
the outer portion, which remains elastic. Its magnitude, however, depends on that
in the overstrained portion. Turner has shown how, by making assumptions regarding
the nature of plastic strain, a differential equation may be obtained involving the axial
stress, but has not attempted a solution, and it does not appear that any simple
solution exists.

Under these circumstances it is proposed to make the simple supposition that the
axial stress does not differ materially from the value it would have under a uniform
distribution. It is fully recognised that results thus obtained must be considered as
