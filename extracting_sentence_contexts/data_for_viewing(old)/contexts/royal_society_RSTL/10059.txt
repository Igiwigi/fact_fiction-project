1082 DR. H. WATNEY ON THE MINUTE ANATOMY OF THE THYMUS.

The indigo-carmine s0lution, if injected into the thoracic portion of the thymus, can
be traced to lymphatic glands lying in the thorax, generally to one gland lying on the
arch of the aorta, and from thence to the large veins on the left s8ide. There seems to
be no intercommunication between the Iymphatics of the thorax and of the neck.

Tre BLoop VEssSELS.

The most noticeable fact about the blood vessels of the thymus, in an injected speci-
men (se Plate 85, fig. 6), is the disposition of the large vessels in two rings :—(1) They,
to a great measure, surround the follicle, more 80, usually, than in Plate 85, fig. 6;
and (2) form nearly a complete circle on the margin of the medullary portion of the
follicle. This latter circle is not, however, outside the medulla, but situated within it,
or just on its borders. This disposition of the vessels is true of all cases where the
follicle is polygonal, and contains one medullary centre. Where there are two
medullary portions there are two central rings of vessels, or if the medulla be in
the form of long processes, the surrounding vessels run longitudinally. The ring of
vessels surrounding the follicle is composed of arteries and veins, which give off or
receive branches from two neighbouring follicles. 'The inner circle, or circles, is als»
composed of arteries and veins, but chiefly of the latter. The cortex is thus surrounded
by large vessels running parallel to its inner and outer surfaces, and is chiefly 8upplied
