the applications and verifications of the fundamental equations of his theory were exem-
plified and established by M. Porssox himself (pp. 47-49), by the accordance of their
calculated results with the facts observed and recorded in the Arctic voyages of 1818,
1819, and 1820. The convenient and practical formulz for computing the corrections
of the three magnetic elements, which were subsequently derived from Po1ss0xN's funda-
mental Equations by Mr. ARCHIBALD SMITH (Philosophical Transactions, 1843, Art. X.),
have since furnished, and still continue to furnish, the means of surmounting, even in
an extreme case, sch as that of a survey executed in the high magnetic latitudes of the
southern hemisphere, and in dips even exceeding —88*, the serious embarrassments
which would otherwise have been occasioned by the iron which necessarily formed part
of the equipment of the ships. Sir Jaxns Ross was one of the junior midshipmen of
the © Isabella”* in the voyage of 1818; and thus early commenced that interest in the
general subject of Terrestrial Magnetism, and that practical acquaintance with the
resources which modern science has introduced, by which in his subsequent career he
has earned for himself and for his country 80 distinguished a place in the history of thab
great branch of physical geography.
