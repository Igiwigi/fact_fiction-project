in Pithecanthropus the inferior precentral (5)} remains in front of it, for it does not lie
as far behind the temporal perpendicular as it does in the two Neanderthal men. In the
latter there may be two reasons for the more backward position of the inferior precentral
in regard to the temporal perpendicular. Firstly, the temporal perpendicular may have
shifted forward in Neanderthal man as compared to the Java ape-man, as a consequence
of the temporal lobe having grown out further forward in Neanderthal man, and, secondly
the precentral may have shifted backwards. As, however, the posterior border of the
operculum has shifted backwards in Neanderthal man and nevertheless the inferior
precentral corresponds with it, while in the Java ape-man it remains in front of it, this
shows that not only the operculum in Neanderthal man has extended further backwards,
but also the inferior precentral.

Both facts, the caudal shifting of the inferior precentral in regard to both perpen-
diculars, as well as the caudal displacement of the post-opercular perpendicular, show the
increase of the inferior frontal lobe, which in man covers the frontal operculum. Both
features, the more backward position of the post-opercular perpendicular and the more
caudal position of 5, are evident also in the upper palwolithic Prdmost man, represented
in the same figure, Plate 48.

Besides, these brains are higher than the lower paleolithic brains, Further developmental features observed

in this race (Homo sapiens fossilis) are the tendency of the inferior frontal fissure to run more horizontally,
or to make a frontal branch, as is especially evident in Prdmost IV and in the Vestonice (Winternitz) cast.

* As far as I can see only one anterior Sylvian branch is distinct in my Neanderthal casts. In several
