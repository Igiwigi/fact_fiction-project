of the acid in solutions containing 55 and 85 per cent. of water; the rotatory powers
of the anhydrous acid, as shown under e = 0 in Table IL., are derived by interpolation
from the observations of Brunar (‘ Trans. Faraday Soc.,’ 1914, vol. 10, p. 89), and
the differences between the observed and calculated values are :—

1°2, 1°5, 1-6, 1:7, 1-7, 1-7, 1-8, 0°6°, Mean 1°5°.

This agreement is remarkably close, having regard to the facts that (i.) the linear law
is only an approximation, (ii.) the extrapolation covers nearly half of the total range of
concentration, and amounts in the case of the violet mercury line to an extension of
over 12 degrees in the range of rotatory powers.

In view of the fact that the linear law is valid to this extent over the wide gap between
the anhydrous acid and its saturated solutions in water, we were prepared to find that,
although closer examination would show marked deviations in the values for dilute
solutions, no substantial errors would occur in the case of the more concentrated solu-
tions. This anticipation was, however, by no means correct. Basing the linear formula
again on the rotatory powers of the acid in solutions containing 55 and 85 per cent. of
water, we find that the deviations which are produced by increasing the concentration
to water 45 per cent., acid 55 per cent., are even greater than those which result from
diluting to water 95 per cent., acid 5 per cent. ; and this is true, not only for one wave-
length, but for the whole range of wave-lengths shown in Table II. The linear law is
thus shown to be even less exact in concentrated than in dilute solutions.

A natural sequel to the recognition of the fact that the linear law is inexact, is the
