My own opinion is that in the present state of our knowledge the case is not proved
either for the phyllome theory, which is out of harmony with the known facts in the
fossils, or for the non-phyllome theory, which certainly is a less obvious explanation of
the Hquisetum strobilus. But the balance of evidence seems in favour of the latter,
as without undue pressure it covers the whole area of facts, while it harmonises also
with what is seen in other groups of Pteridophytes. (5). Toe Type oF THE FILICINEA.
