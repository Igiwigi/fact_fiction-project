dentine. The honeyeomb would, according to these appearances, be a kind of
directing membrane, serving, like the “heddle” or guiding frame of a loom,
to contro] the orderly arrangement of the forming prisms and the spaces between
them.

In later stages of calcification there is no trace of the honeycomb, so it would
appear that when a large amount of calcified enamel is already formed there would
be no necessity for any directing membrane, the formed tissue being a sufficient
support and guide for the ameloblastic processes.

Mr. Tomes speaks of the Tomes’ processes as being soft and extensile, so that See
the ameloblasts are displaced they may be drawn out into thin threads, but is it
not possible that this appearance may be due to the fact that the Tomes’ processes
are surrounded by a jelly-like colloidal material, and that the processes when not
broken off are glued together by this adhesive substance, and while probably slightly
extensile their fine thread-like appearance in disturbed sections is chiefly due to the
action of this agglutinating material ?

It is certainly evident that the colloid material in which calcification takes place
and the Tomes’ processes are not one and the same thing, as Mr. Leon W1ILirAms (4)
would appear to suggest when he says: “An instructive picture with reference to
the nature of the Tomes’ processes is shown in fig. 36” (of his paper), which he
describes as “showing that the Tomes’ processes are formed by drawing out strings
from the albumen-like substance of calcoglobulin.” I scarcely think that Mr. Leon
Wit1aMs could have intended to convey this meaning, as the processes in question
