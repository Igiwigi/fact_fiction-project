HISTORICAL REVIEW

Historical accounts of the study of corals up to the end of the previous century have been
given by Ogilvie (1897) and by Potta (1902), while among later works containing com-
prehensive reviews may be mentioned Grove (1934), Sanford (1939), Hill (1935)and Vaughan
& Wells (1943). The following is a brief sketch of the development of our knowledge con-
cerning the Rugosa since the middle of the previous century. The study of the Rugosa has always been influenced by that of the Scleractinia; in fact,
no attempt at a historical treatment of one group could omit some account of the other. Vou. 234. B. 611.
