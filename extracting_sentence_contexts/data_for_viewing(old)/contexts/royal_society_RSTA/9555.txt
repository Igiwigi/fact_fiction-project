For sodium the value 0000224, determined by us in some preliminary experiments
by a new method, has been utilized.

This method, which will be described in a later paper, did not indicate any marked
change in the coefficient over the range 0° C. to 95° C.

For low temperature a coefficient of decrease of the same order as that of
cadmium was assumed, a procedure which is justified by the fact that the
coefficient of expansion is proportional to the atomic heat, as shown by GRUNEISEN,
and at low temperature the atomic heat curves of sodium and cadmium are
similar.

Nernst and Lrypemann*™ adopt a different procedure, basing their method on
GRUNEISEN’s observation that the coefficient of expansion is proportional to the atomic
heat ; they obtain the approximate relation

C,—G, = GFA stp keane oe

measurements of the compressibility and coefficient of expansion made at one tempe-
