merely laid between them, without any connection, and the
medullary fibres in contact with a coloured mucus retained in
its situation by its consistence alone. This account is fotally
at variance with the general laws of the animal economy :
in no instance have we parts, $0 dissimilar in nature, in actual
contact: wherever contact without connection exists, each sur-
face is covered by a membrane, from which a fluid is secre-
ted; and wherever parts are united, it is by the medium of
cellular membrane, of which serous membrane may be con-
sidered as a modification. If the retina be merely in con-
tact with the vitreous humor and choroid, we argue from
analogy, that a cavity lined by serous membrane exists both
on its internal and external surface ; but this is not the fact.
In the eye a distinction of parts was necessary, but to accom-
plish this a serous membrane was not required ; it is only
demanded where great precision in the motion of parts was
indispensable, as in the head, thorax, and abdomen ; a single
membrane, with the interposition of cellular substance, answers
the purpose here. By this explanation we surmount another
difficulty, the unphilosophical idea of the colouring matter
being laid on the choroid, and retained in its situation by its
viscidity, is discarded ; as it follows, if this account be correct,
that it is secreted into the interstices of fine cellular mem-
brane here, as it is upon the ciliary processes, back of the iris,
and pecten, under the conjunctiva, round the cornea, and in
