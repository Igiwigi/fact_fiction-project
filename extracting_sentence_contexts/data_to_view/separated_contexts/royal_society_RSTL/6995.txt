« A hen, lightly wounded with one of theſe lit-

I was ſtruck with amazement on reading theſe
facts : but my ſurprize was ſoon follow'd by a defire
of repeating thoſe experiments myſelf, and even of
trying them on different ſorts of animals. Monſieur de la Condamine, to whom I imparted
— My intention, offered, with the belt grace in the world,
S to ſatisfy my curioſity, and for that purpoſe made me
» a preſent of a certain quantity of this poiſon: and the
5 reſult of the experiments, which Imade with this ſame
S Poiſon, will be the ſubje& of this memoir. S I will begin the detail of thoſe experiments by
& thatof two accidents, which had like to have diſabled
me from proſecuting the work I had undertaken ;
Z having very narrowly eſcaped death,
= The firſt accident happen'd thus : M. de la Con-
= damine had forewarned me, that, when the Indians
5 deligned to uſe their poiſon (which, in colour, con-
2 tfiſtence, and even in ſmell, has a great deal of re-
Z ſemblance with Spaniſh liquorice) they diſſolved it
Z in water, and then eyaporated it on a flow fire to the
E confiſtence of a foft extra, I made this prelimi-
s nary preparation in a ſmall cloſet, in which a young
& Jad was aQually at work; and I did not think
S of making him quir it, becauſe T did not imagine,
S that the poiſon, of which I intended to make trial,
E could produce any bad effes, without being intro-
g duced inta the blood, by the opening of a wound,
Nor did I then recolle& what M. de la Condamine
had told me; which is, that, while they are pre-
paring this poiſon in the country, they oblige ſome
criminal old woman to take care of the boiling of
this


[ 78 ]

this poiſon, aſter ſhutting her up alone in a ſeparate
place: fo that, when this woman dies, 'tis a ſign, that
the poiſon is ſufficiently boil'd, and that it has all the
qualities requiſite to make it good, But I was ſoon
' made ſenſible of my imprudence: the door of the
cloſet, where the young lad above-mention'd ſaid,
was open ; and from the next chamber I faw, that
the lad, who had been there about three quarters of
an hour, fat ſtill, with his arms acroſs. 1 began to
reprimand him for his lazineſs ; but he excuſed him-
ſelf, by anſwering, with a trembling voice, that he
was fick at- heart, and felt himſelf very faint, "Tis
eaſy to imagine the uncaſineſs, which this ſight gave
rae; but luckily it coſt me no more than the fright.
