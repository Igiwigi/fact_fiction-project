generating for each produced interval an evolving population pattern of activation. The vertical lines correspond to the tapping times (triangles on top). Note that a
similar population response profile is repeated in a cyclical manner for the four intervals (colour coded) and that the resetting of each moving bump corresponds to a
potential internal pulse representation. (c) Neural trajectories during the synchronization task. The trajectory starts from the first tap, completes a cycle during every
intertap interval and returns to the tapping manifold. We assume that the tapping attractor area in state space, highlighted by a box, is the internal pulse manifold
which is invariant across durations. The metronomeâ€™s tempo modulates the amplitude of the trajectories.
