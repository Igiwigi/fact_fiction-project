nical force exerted by the initiative detonation to which it is snbjected. The force ex-
erted by small quantities of strongly confined silyer- and mercuric fulminate greatly ex-
ceeds that developed by the explosion of comparatively large proportions of the iodide
and chloride of nitrogen. This may be accepted as accounting, to some extent, for the
fact that the detonation of gun-cotton conld not be accomplished by an amount of iodide
of nitrogen twenty times greater than that of fulminates required for the purpose, while
ten times the quantity of the confined chloride were required to produce the result. That the quantity of mercuric fulminate required to produce detonation is reduced in
proportion as means are applied to increase the violence of the force exerted by it at
one time, is quite in accordance with the above view. Several curious and apparently anomalous effects were, however, observed in the course
of the numerous experiments referred to in this paper, which snggest the inquiry
whether there may not be some peculiarity in the concussion or powerful vibration pro-
duced by a particular kind of explosion, which acts apart or distinct from the mechanical
force of that explosion in developing or promoting the detonation or sudden chemical
disintegration of the molecules of a neighbouring explosive body.
