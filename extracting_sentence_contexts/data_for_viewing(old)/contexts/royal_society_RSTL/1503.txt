een, will agree with the relations of the attractions of this
alkali for acids, to those of other salifiable bases.*

If hydrogene be supposed to bea simple body, and nitrogene
an oxide, then on the hypothesis above stated, nitrogene
would consist of nearly 48 of oxygene, and 34, of basis ; but
if the opinion be adopted, that hydrogene and nitrogene are
both oxides of the same metal, then the quantity of oxygene
in nitrogene, must be supposed less.

These views are the most obvious that can be formed, on
the antiphlogistic hypothesis of the nature of metallic sub-
stances ;' but if the facts concerning ammonia were to be
reasoned upon, independently of the other general phazno-
mena of chemical science, they perhaps might be more easily
explained on the notion of nitrogene being a basis, which
became alkaline, by combining with one portion of hydrogene,
and metallic, by combining with a greater proportion.

* Even in common air, the amalgam eyolyes hydrogene and ammonia, nearly in these
proportions, and in one experiment which I lately tried, there seemed to be no absorp-
tion of oxygene from the atmosphere. This circumstance appears to me in favour of
the antiphlogistic view of the metallization of the yolatile alkali ; for if the hydrogene
be supposed to be given off from the mercury, and not to arisefrom the decomposition
of water adhering to the amalgam, it might be conceived, that being in the nascent
