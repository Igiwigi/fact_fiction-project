The presence of
=this dense layer has perhaps something to do with one of the differences between the
Sbranches of Equisetums and Calamites, which in the former are yery much more persis-
Stent than the deciduous ones of the latter appear to have been. TI have shown that in
Sthe more matured stems of the Calamites the pith becomes wholly absorbed, which is
=not the case with the Equisetums. It may be urged that the reason for this difference
lies in the fact that the stems of the former have been much more persistent than the
Aannual growths of the latter. Such may be the case; but the distinction holds equally
good in the case of the permanent snbterranean rhizomes of the Equisetums, where
also the pith remains intact, not eyen becoming fistular. 'The existence of these rhizomes
in both instances presents another feature of resemblance; but as they occur equally in
many other Cryptogams, e. 9. the Marsileacee, they have little definite yalue in rela-
tion to the present argument. But this is not the case with the medullary rays that
abound in the Calamites.
