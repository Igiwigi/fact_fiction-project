separation in the spatial spread, and therefore the action, of these two species. The specific
activatorâ€”inhibitor interaction is encoded in the reaction terms F(i) (1.2).

The success and the impact of the LALI approach rests on two pillars: first, the mechanism
underlying the formation of patterns is compelling, easy to understand, and sufficiently general
to implement in a wide range of biological contexts. Second, when implemented in a specific
model context, numerical simulations robustly show the emergence of spatial patterns, the shape
of which can be adjusted to match biological observations and experiments by tweaking the
model (e.g. [5,29]). Hence, the approach possesses strong explanatory and predictive qualities,
which make it a prime candidate for the explanation of several spatial patterns observed in
nature. However, when merging this theory of pattern formation with biological practice, a hurdle
presents itself, which prevents the direct application of the ideas of Gierer and Meinhardt. The
difficulty lies in the fact that the theory needs (at least) two independent, diffusing, species, that in
addition must form an activator-inhibitor pair, i.e. interact in the specific manner described above.


In very many applications, this poses an insurmountable problem. While a prime candidate for
the activator can often be identified without much difficulty, the same is not the case for the
inhibitor. Either a long-range (fast diffusing) agent exists, but does not interact with the activator
in the required fashion, or an inhibitory agent does not manifest the required spatial long range
action (e.g. [30]). In both cases, identifying the inhibitor remains elusive.

Nevertheless, the LALI idea remains singularly persuasive. Its simplicity endows it with a ring
of truth: one is tempted to reason that, when patterns are observed, the LALI mechanism must be
its cause, therefore an inhibitor must be present. This conviction has guided the experimental
