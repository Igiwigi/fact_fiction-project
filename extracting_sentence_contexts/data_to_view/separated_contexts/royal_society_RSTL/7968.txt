But what is the testimony in re-
Zgard to the habits of the existing pouched carnivore no bigger than a rat?
2 GovLD, who would be the last to repeat testimony to which zoology and comparative
$ anatomy ran counter, writes © Phascogale penicillata, mall as it is, comparatively, is
E charged with killing fowls and other birds”. = I can bear personal testimony, and that to my own loss, of the attack and slaughter
2 of nearly full-grown Shanghai Pullets by Mus decumans. Comparative anatomy lends
Z more aid to the credibility of the predatorial powers of the carnivorous marsupial than

= than twice their size and weight is a zoological fact. Though magnitude may be, in one sense, a measure of force, it by no means neces-

Z important ingredient,” in the question of the carniyority of Mus, Mustela, Phascogale,
A and Plagiaulaz. But whatever bears on the interpretation of the singular dentition of the small © pau-
cidentate ” marsupial, logically applies to the larger one.
