Hence the locus of chords of ¢;, M,°, breaks up in the present case into the
solid Il and a quartic primal M,*, generated by lines meeting c, and cs, and having the
former of these as triple and the latter as double curve. ‘To chords of ¢; correspond in
= points of a plane c containing the point 0: for any plane 4 of = meets o in one
point, namely that corresponding to the chord of c, which completes the section by I
of the ®-surface corresponding to %; and since one chord of cs, namely O, Os, lies in
#, ¢ must contain the point O. Thus F,’ must break up into this plane o and a surface
of order four F,* corresponding to M,‘. F,‘ is in fact the general quartic rational
ruled surface* in [4]; and its generators correspond, as in the general case, to cubic
