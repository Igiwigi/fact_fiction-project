196 J. GRANGE MOORE ON THE DETERMINATION OF THE

(iii) A similar linear relation was found to apply over a wide range between the readings
taken with a blue and the readings taken with a red disk (part III). As this relation is not of
the form of the probable relationship between the two extinction coefficients, it would appear
that the extinction coefficient for a given ‘colour’ cannot empirically be deduced from the
standard Secchi readings given by a disk of that colour. Observations of disks through red
and green filters gave similar results (figure 16).

(iv) Atkins suggested privately to the author that the Secchi disks normally used are
too small, having regard to Helmholtz’s values for the variation of the discrimination
coefficient of the eye as the angular dimension of an object changes; this, coupled with the
fact that the discrimination factor may vary with both intensity and with wave-length,
makes it very difficult to interpret Secchi readings taken with coloured disks, although the
readings were extremely consistent amongst themselves. It is unfortunate that a full study
of these matters does not exist, as the Secchi reading, despite its difficulty of interpretation
(Le Grand 1939), has the great advantage of simplicity and reproducibility.

When the experimental work to be described in part III was being planned, it had been
hoped that Secchi disk readings would at least serve to emphasize any irregularities in the
various water types. The results with coloured disks were inconclusive. The readings with
white or black disks were probably reliable indications of water clarity provided the disk
was sufficiently large, the water deep, and the reading not less than about 10 ft. for the white
disk or 5 ft. for the black.
