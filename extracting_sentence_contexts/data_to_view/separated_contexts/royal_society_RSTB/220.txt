and hence, though rare, it is represented about the same region as is the equally
rare movement of flexion of the small toes, z.c., close to the fissure of Ronanpo. This,
as we have pointed out before, is the focus of representation of the limb, and perhaps
the rare movements of extension and rotation in, which occur at the centres :—

owe their representation to the fact that, this being the middle of the lower limb area,
the cortex here is most highly organised, and thus possesses centres for every move-
ment of all the joints. (b.) Primary.—The 10 primary movements of the knee were all flexion, with one
