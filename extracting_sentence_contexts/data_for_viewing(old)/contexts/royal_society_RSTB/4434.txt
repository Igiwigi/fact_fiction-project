course,- be very specialised, either in adaptation to some special environment or
‘* fortuitously.”

It is thus necessary for a satisfactory study of any fossil material to recognise by
persistent characters that certain groups are closely related, and then by arranging
the members of these groups in their order of appearance and comparing them
one with another to determine the evolutionary trend of the group.

That such a study has not yet been undertaken for the early Stegocephalia is
owing largely to the following causes :—

1. The fact that the existing material usually allows of a very incomplete
description. Of most forms we know only the structure of the dorsal surface of
the skull, a region which seems to show no clear direction of evolutionary change.

2. That existing descriptions are usually inadequate because they give no detailed
account of the skull base and brain case, in which regions evolutionary changes are
obvious.

3. That many existing descriptions and figures are very inaccurate.

4. That with the partial exception of the British and Munich Museums no
collections cover the whole field of Amphibia at all fully.
