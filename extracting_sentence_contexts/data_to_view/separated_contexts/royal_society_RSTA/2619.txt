If the magma
is sufficiently compressible, post-eruptive deformation will be deflation. These models raise the
possibility of reconciling petrological inferences related to pressure changes with observations
of deformation. In fact, the timescales derived from diffusion studies described in ยง5 have been
linked directly to the occurrence of earthquake swarms and deformation prior to, and during,
eruptions [162,165,233,234]. These correlations show that the monitoring signals are linked
to significant pressure and/or temperature perturbations, such as those expected for magma
movement and/or mixing in shallow crustal reservoirs. Gas emissions during and between eruptions also hold a clue to processes occurring in
crustal magma reservoirs.
