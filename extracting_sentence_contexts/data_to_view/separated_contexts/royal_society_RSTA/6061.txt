The result (2.3) says : Ss
nothing at all about the CC and the vacuum energy in the expanding universe. :s

Even though we could preserve Lorentz invariance using an ‘educated cut-off’ by regularizing 18

a la Pauli—Villars, let us adopt the MS scheme (see e.g. [114-116]) with dimensional regularization
(DR), as it also preserves Lorentz invariance and leads to the same result. The one-loop calculation
of the ZPE using DR in n space-time dimensions renders

where yg is Euler’s constant, and Bw? =hm'/2 (47) is the one-loop coefficient of the 6-function

for the parameter p, (see below). The above (flat space-time) result is well known [98,117,118];
in actual fact, it is collected in textbooks since long [116]. In it, 4 is the arbitrary ’t Hooft’s mass
unit of DR [114], and n —> 4 is understood in the final result. Obviously, the ZPE is UV-divergent
in that limit, as there is a pole at n = 4.
