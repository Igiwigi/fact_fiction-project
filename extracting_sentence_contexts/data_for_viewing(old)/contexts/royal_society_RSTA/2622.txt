of the available thermal data in 2011. Or perhaps the unrest in the magmatic system did not
impact the temperatures of the hydrothermal system at the surface. This might be expected if
the magma transfer from depth to the surface was highly localized and happened rapidly, but
this partitioning of the hydrothermal system from the rest of the magmatic system calls into
question the utility of monitoring surface temperature change as an indicator of magma or fluids
on the move at some volcanoes. Unfortunately, there were no gas measurements in the volcano
hydrothermal system in the months preceding the eruption and right after it to detect possible
changes in the shallow hydrothermal system.

The volcano underwent almost 1m of uplift right after the end of the 2011-2012 eruption
in three discrete pulses during 2012-2018 (figure 4a), ongoing as of May 2018, and with very
similar spatial footprints [61]. This post-eruptive inflation is not associated with abnormal
seismicity [51] or temperature change (figure 4b). The fact that the ground deformation followed
an exponential trend during the first three years after the eruption [51], as predicted by the magma
injection models (§2b), strongly suggests that the post-eruptive deformation is of magmatic
origin. Finite-element simulations show that viscoelastic relaxation is of secondary importance
with respect to magma injection [61]. Alternatively, inflation after eruption is possible with
no recharge for an incompressible magma [58]. While the Cordén Caulle erupted magmas
