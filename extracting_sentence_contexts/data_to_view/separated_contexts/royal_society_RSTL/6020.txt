The rocks

Zare polished and striated, and present at some places the appearance of huge rounded

Emounds, which, at first sight, would appear to offer an insuperable barrier to the motion

Sof the glacier, but which show by their aspect that the ice actually moved over them,

Sgrinding off their angles and furrowing their summits and sides. All along the valley

Ltowards Meyringen, similar evidences exist. In fact. the phenomenon is very common,
and admitted on all hands. A The conclusion which Mr. HoykiNs has drawn from these facts is unavoidable ; the
glaciers must have s/idden over the rocks on which such traces are left.
