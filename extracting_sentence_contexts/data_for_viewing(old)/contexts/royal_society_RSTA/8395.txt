There is apparently no definite explanation to be found for the persistent difference
between the N.P.L. and B.I.P.M. values for Ni 184. Since W. H. JoHnson has sub-
stantially repeated at the Bureau his N.P.L. results, it can be concluded that the con-
ditions under which the observations have been made do not account for the divergence.
Since the two institutions, so far as line standards are concerned, carry out their work on
such closely similar lines, there appears to be no reason why a result obtained by one
laboratory should not be repeated by the other. In the present case the precautions
taken in procedure should elimimate any effect on the final results arising from
personal equation in the ordinary sense, and this is confirmed by the fact that for
a considerable portion of the work, namely, that in which Ni 184 does not figure,
there is reasonable agreement. The divergence is throughout associated with Ni 184,
and the only explanation that presents itself is that possibly some peculiarity exists
in the graduations of this bar whereby the two observers â€˜interpret one or both of
the lines of Ni 184 somewhat differently. This opinion, however, can be regarded
only as a surmise arrived at by a close scrutiny of results and by a process of
exhaustion of probable causes. The discrepancy appears to be one that cannot be
either eliminated or definitely accounted for, and its existence appears to point pretty
definitely to a limitation of the accuracy which can ever be expected in dealing with
comparisons of this kind.

Turning now to the values obtained by W. H. Jounson and L. Mauper for the length
