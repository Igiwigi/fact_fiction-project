In the case of glass-hard
steels it is well known that a certain amount of annealing takes place at 100°C., and
even at atmospheric temperatures ; but in the case of steel, where a distinct chemical
change is involved, the nature of the annealing action may differ very considerably
from that in an approximately pure metal. Certain phenomena in the recovery of
elasticity after over-strain in both iron and steel (Murr, J., ‘ Recovery of Iron and
Steel from Over-strain,” ‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1899) also point to the fact that changes of
internal structure may occur in iron at very moderate temperatures ; further evidence
in the same direction is afforded by the effect produced (Roger, 8S. R., ‘Proc. Roy.
