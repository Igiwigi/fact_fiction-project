not only closed strings but also open strings with endpoints on fixed p-planes [18], called
‘D-branes’ (Dp-branes if we want to specify p) because of the Dirichlet boundary conditions at
the string endpoints [19]. They are branes because the massless modes of open strings attached to
them can be interpreted as fluctuations of the fixed p-plane; the Dp-brane tension is [18]

where g; is the dimensionless string coupling constant (g; <1 in string perturbation theory).
Note that the tension becomes infinite in the g; — 0 limit. This is a reflection of the fact that
the undisturbed Dp-brane fills a fixed p-plane in string perturbation theory, but that is precisely
the circumstance of interest here since it provides us with a Minkowski ‘vacuum’ on which the
open-string massless modes propagate. Moreover, the effective action for these fields (on length
scales much larger that ¢;) can be found from superstring perturbation theory; the result is a
generalization of a 1985 result of Fradkin & Tseytlin [20] who showed that the effective action for
slowly varying massless fields of the open bosonic string is (a higher-dimensional version of) the
Born-Infeld action for nonlinear electrodynamics [21]. The generalization fuses the Born—Infeld
action and the Dirac p-brane action into the Dirac-Born—Infeld (DBI) action [22].

For the IIB D3-brane the massless open-string modes form an N = 4 Maxwell supermultiplet,
in agreement with the supergravity results. The DBI action for the bosonic fields of this
supermultiplet (i.e. omitting the fermionic fields required by supersymmetry) is (again for h =
