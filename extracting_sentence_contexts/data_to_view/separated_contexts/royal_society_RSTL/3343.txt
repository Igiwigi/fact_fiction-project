Which of these alternatives is the correct one,
I shall now attempt to show. It is to be observed, that the latter supposition entails one of two consequences
worthy of being traced ; either those filaments only can receive markings which are
at the surface of the fasciculus, or, if it be proved that all are marked, all must be at
the surface, and the fasciculus must be of the nature of a tube. But both snch con-
s8equences would be at yariance with fact ; for there will be no difficulty in proving all
the fibrillaz of a fasciculus to be thus marked, and the fasciculi to be not tubular, but
composed of a solid bundle of fibrille. First, all the fibrille are marked. If a muscle that has been macerated in a cool
place be examined, the fibrillze will generally be found to fall readily asunder, and
float in great numbers about the field of the microscope ; all these fibrille present the
dark and light spaces alluded to; there are none without them.
