From the second part of the experiment we get

dT/T=0:021/4'51 x 0:77=0-60 per cent. Second Method of Experiment. Our second group of experiments was intended to utilize a fact which we had
observed, viz., that a spherical film thins more slowly than a cylinder, A cylinder of
the usual dimensions (length=1'25 x diameter) was formed on one of the 8maller pairs
of rings. The larger rings were used to form the sphere, and, since the ratio of their
diameter to that of the smaller pair was very approximately 1'6, ib is evident, if
the distance between them was made =1'2 x 2Y, that a sphere would be formed the
radius of which was 2Y, and which would therefore be in equilibrium with the
cylinder if the surface tensions were identical. In consequence of the slow thinning
of the sphere, a longer interyal could generally be allowed after flooding with this
arrangement than when two cylinders were employed.
