It, however,
contains the F eutectic as one of its constituents; this is very well shown in the
horizontal section of the 45 atom slowly-cooled alloy (fig. 27), the gold-smeared E of
the eutectic having a minute pattern of pure white, X, scattered through it ; this is,
of course, in the unetched alloy. The quickly-cooled alloys of the branch GH do not
always show the detail of the eutectic very well, but the row of very steady third
freezing points makes the matter certain. The fact that these freezing points occur
after marked surfusion may explain the scantiness of the F eutectic along the
branch GH, and the fact that. many of the blobs of E are large.
