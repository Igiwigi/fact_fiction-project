can thus influence biological times, such as development
time and lifespan [61]. For instance, a study on B. calyciflorus
(a) Constant environments [62] has shown that LCL amounted to 5.5, 10 and 13.6 days at
The constant environments model consisted of a constant temperatures of 25°C, 20°C and 15°C, respectively (note: we

both facultative sexuals as well as obligate asexuals. Not period’ from the data reported in Halbach [62]). Thus, low


temperatures may decrease the probability of extinction in
stochastic environments by increasing LCL, which would
allow obligate asexuals to tolerate longer periods of bad
environmental conditions. In fact, the existence of ‘overwin-
tering clones’ in Daphnia and aphids found in temperate
zones suggests that this mechanism could be important in
nature [63,64].

In addition to temperature, LCL might be affected by
food quantity, although the resulting patterns are less
straightforward. Complete starvation unequivocally leads to
an earlier death, which has also been shown in rotifers [65].
Nevertheless, starvation times depend on species-specific
life-history patterns, such as whether a species still invests
in reproduction during starvation [65,66]. Rotifers of the
genus Brachionus are known to reduce their reproductive
