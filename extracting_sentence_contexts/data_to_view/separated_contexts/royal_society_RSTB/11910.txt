One-month-old seedlings were punch-inoculated with isolates 85-14, indi-
cating that pizh-1 partially but pizh-1/pizh-2 completely lost blast resistance, compared with the wild-type ZH11. A Student's t-test was used to analyse the
significance of the difference (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, n.s.: not significant) (c,d,g,f).

(e) Pizh-1 interacts physically with Pizh-2 to form performed a split luciferase complementation assay to
determine the Pizh-1 and Pizh-2 interaction in planta

hetero-complex (figure 5b). Therefore, Pizh-1 and Pizh-2 form a functional
The functionality of Pizh-1 and Pizh-2 described above NLR pair that confers broad-spectrum blast resistance.
allowed us to speculate that Pizh-2 may function through Given the fact that the transgenic NIPB plants expressing
direct interaction with Pizh-1 to form an NLR immune Pizh-1 alone developed broad-spectrum blast resistance
