In
practice, (1.9) is observed to hold approximately over the inertial range; see figure 2 for evidence
from [23]. The 4/5-law captures some aspects of the turbulent cascade: energy is transferred
through scale by a cubic nonlinear flux term related to si (€) until it is removed, ¢ > 0, from the
system by infinitesimal viscosity. In fact, the 4/5-law (1.9) fixes the scaling exponent p/3 in (1.6) via the statistical assumption
of monofractal scaling in Kolmogorov’s theory. On its face, this indicates that the turbulent fluid
velocity satisfies 5;u ~ 1/5 and so is ‘1/3 differentiable’, at least in some averaged sense. More
precisely, the fact that ¢ is a priori bounded by initial data and forcing via equation (1.3) ensures
that si ()/€ is controlled uniformly for small ¢.
