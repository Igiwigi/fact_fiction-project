We also conclude from the above deduced values, not only that the resistance dimi-
nishes with the temperature, but also that the diminution of resistance is greater for
equal increments of temperature at higher than at lower temperatures.

$ 53. The first of these results, namely, that resistance diminishes with increase of
temperature, agrees fully with the result given in $$ 43, 46, that the rate of penetration
t is less for less temperature-differences than for greater ones. The cause of the more
speedy penetration of great heats is in fact due to the less resistance offered to the pas-
8age of the heat by those portions of the liquid which have already been heated. VII. Influence of Constitution of the Liquid on the quantity of the Heat which passes.
