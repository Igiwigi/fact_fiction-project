are most often found at the distal end of the sporangium.* Anticipating a little, it
may be mentioned here that four spores—one large and three small—were also found
in the large integumented specimen, of which three sections are shown in Plate 39,
phots. 14-16. I have never found more than four in any sporangium, and believe that
this was the full number. In one section from the distal end of a sporangium, three of
the smaller spores are shown, arranged as if belonging to a tetrad; the fourth spore
had, doubtless, developed into the principal megaspore, but was missed by the
section. In all cases there is one megaspore large enough to occupy almost the whole
of the sporangium, while any others there may be are very small in comparison,{ and
have a partially obliterated appearance. The obvious explanation of the facts
appears to be that one tetrad was alone developed in each megasporangium, and that
of the four sister-cells composing it one only came to perfection, constituting the single
functional megaspore, in which, as will be shown below, the prothallus was formed ;
the other three were evidently abortive. This is a case hitherto unknown among
Lepidodendrew, or indeed among any Lycopodiales, in all of which, as at present
known, four megaspores at least (often more) come to maturity in each mega-
sporangium. A perfectly analogous case is, however, presented by the Rhizocarps
among the Filicales. It need scarcely be pointed out that in the predominance of
one megaspore, displacing its fellows and arresting their development, we have an
approach to the condition usual in Flowering Plants.

The form of the sporophyll bearing the sporangium has already been described ; its
