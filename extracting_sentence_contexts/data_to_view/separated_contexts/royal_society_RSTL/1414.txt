They may direct him in his pursuits, and possibly facilitate
his enquiries into the immediate causes of the decay of animal
strength and life; and on a subject of 80 much importance to
mankind; no source of information should remain unexplored,
and no lights, however feeble, be disregarded. Naturalists, both-of ancient and modern times, have con=
sidered the structure of plants, as an inversion of that of
animals, and have: compared the roots to the intestines, and
the leaves to the lungs, of animals; and the analogy between
the vegetable sap, and animal blood, is very close and
obvious. The experiments also, of which I have at different
periods communicated accounts to you, supported by the
facts previously ascertained by other naturalists, scarcely
leave any reasonable grounds of doubt, that the sap of trees
circulates, as far as is apparently necessary to, or consistent
with, their state of existence and growth. The roots of trees, particularly those in coppices, which
are felled at tated periods, continue 80 long to produce, and
feed, a succession of branches, that no experiments were

wanted to satisfy me, that it is not any defective action of the
root which occasions the debility and diseases of old varieties
of the apple and pear tree ; and indeed experience every
where shows, that a young seedling stock: does not give the
character of youth to the inserted bud or graft. 1, however,
procured plants from cuttings of some- very old varieties of
the apple, which readily: emit roots; and these plants at the
end of two years were grafted, about two inches above the
ground, with a new and very luxuriant variety of the 'same
species.
