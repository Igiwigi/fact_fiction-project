(6.) Tae Navure or tHE Vicrnat Faces on PorasH-ALUM AND AMMONIA-ALUM,

In the course of the present research many attempts were made to discover some
regularity in the angles or in the indices of the vicinal faces. That they possess
rational indices is rendered possible by the established fact that they lie in certain
well-defined zones, but the indices are in that case very complicated. A very well-
defined set of faces, for example, on one crystal represented a triakis-octahedron
inclined at 6’ 7” to the octahedron; its symbol would, therefore, be (hh), where
A = 1:00378, or something approaching (251.251.250); but it is impossible to say
whether these are the indices to be adopted, or some other numbers having nearly
the same ratio. Clearly the indices cease to be of much use when they are such
