The xylem in the intruded roots (which are all at an early stage of development)
is invariably feebly developed, and the middle zone of the cortex is not differentiated. In other respects the structure is similar to that of the roots outside. It is remarkable
how well the root-hairs have been preserved, even in the intrusions (Plate 5, figs. 27,
clearly seen with a lens, 28; Plate 6, figs. 41, 43, 46), a fact which suggests that they
continued to function as well as in the roots outside. The invading roots almost invariably run lengthwise through the petiole. Whether
they grew downwards or upwards, or some in one direction and others in another, is a
question which will be discussed presently.
