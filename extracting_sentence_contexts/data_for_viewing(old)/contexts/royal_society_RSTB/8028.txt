a prominent protuberance, the tip of which appears to be unmistakably a trauma of ovula-
tion. Its form will be referred to later, when the mode of formation of the corpus luteum
is considered. One other corpus luteum in this pair of ovaries was, equally obviously,
newer than the others, and it too was evidently formed by ovulation.

The remaining four corpora lutea of E130 were intermediate in age and indistinguishable
from each other histologically. They must, in fact, have been formed at approximately the
same time, and under a single endocrine stimulus. Two of them were evidently formed
from follicles which ovulated. These several corpora lutea are represented diagrammatically
in figure 7c, and some of them can be seen in the photographs in figures 17a, db.

It is notable, with regard to the relative longevity of the corpora lutea in these three
animals, that as many as three ‘generations’ can be distinguished in one pair of ovaries,
the newest being developed before the oldest has regressed sufficiently far to have lost its
definite form. Further consideration will be facilitated if at this stage the probable mode
of ovulation and corpus luteum formation is described. The follicle of E146, and the two
similar follicles in one of the ovaries of E116, were the largest encountered in the present
material. If such a follicle were to rupture without much further increase in size, the
former antrum being filled by luteal tissue, one might expect the formation of a corpus
