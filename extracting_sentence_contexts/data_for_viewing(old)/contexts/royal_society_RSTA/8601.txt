one moiecule, it would account qualitatively for all the facts. Such systems, it is well
known, extrapolate for 7 = 0 to vy and vy + C/4, respectively. This would correspond to

a displacement of about 0-03 frequency units at the origin. If C[= h/8x? (1/I’ — 1/1’)]
is a function of m, as is to be expected, owing to the distension of the molecule by
centrifugal force, then we may expect an increasing stagger or displacement of the two
systems for large values of m. This is, in fact, the case, the staggering becoming as
large as 0-6 units at 7 = 70 (it would be at 7 = 35 on this hypothesis).

If this view is correct, it should be possible to relate mathematically the triplet separa-
tion as a function of m, and the “ staggering ” as a function of m, for in Section IX we
have also considered the former as originating in centrifugal deformation of the molecule.

A serious objection to breaking up the band structure into two bands governed by
whole and half-quantum transitions is that the moments of inertia of the molecule will
then have only half the values of Table X. In the case of the 5165 band, for example,
we should then have for the internuclear distances 0-87 x 107° cm. initially, and
0-90 x 10~' em. finally, which are too small, as seen by comparison with the data of
other similar molecules, for which d is about 1-2 x 107° cm.
