in the notation of §§ 8 and 9, a standing (as before) for the distance between nodal points.
This formula is very convenient in practice, used in conjunction with a table of squares
and square roots. Some ‘smoothing’ of results may be necessary (it will be realized
that we are in effect performing a double differentiation of the computed /), and in this
connexion (when high accuracy is wanted) use may be made of the fact that log A, like
f, is a plane-harmonic function of x and y.*

Geometrically interpreted, his the ratio in which the sides of an infinitesimal rectangle
are altered when the curvilinear is transformed into a rectilinear map as indicated in
figure 1. The scale of the rectilinear map can of course be chosen arbitrarily: in figure 8,
numbers attached to the bold-line contours give values of h on the assumption that
h = 1 in the region of the “web” of the rail section, where the contours of « and / are
approximately straight. Actually, of course, h must vary in this region; but its variation
is too slight to be calculated accurately, and for that reason the contour h = 1, as being
somewhat uncertain, is indicated by a broken line. Like uncertainties exist in regard to
contours near the corners of the rail section, and these have been indicated similarly.
