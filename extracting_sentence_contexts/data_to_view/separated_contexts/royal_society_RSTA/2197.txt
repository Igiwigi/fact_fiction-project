As discussed in detail in [10] when viewed in the intrinsic geometry of the surface where
the motion is taking place, the dynamics of a system of N-point vortices is described by the
autonomous Hamiltonian system of equations

dq; aH dp; dH
- and -—,j
dt = ap; dt aq;

where in cases of surfaces with constant curvature and no boundary the Hamiltonian is
N-1
=D DFG pn
j=l kj

with rj = (xj, yj) being the position of the jth vortex and the coordinates are related to the area form
do; = dx; A dy;, see below. The corresponding canonical variables are chosen to be

qg=Ty and Pj =Xjr j=1,...,N. The phase space of the system is the product manifold MN endowed with the symplectic form

doy = DL Fj dxy A dy.

(d) A geometrical point of view: a surface as a symplectic manifold

Summarizing what we have discussed above: to do point-vortex dynamics on a Riemannian
surface M one needs:

— the metric g, to define the Laplace-Beltrami operator Ag which is necessary to find the
corresponding Green function G(r, r’);

?This can be easily proved by using integration by parts,

iH |VOP do =-]] PAPdo,
g2 s2

Gauss’s theorem and the fact that the surface has no boundaries.


— a Hamiltonian formalism,
d :
q _ 9H an dp _oH
dt ap dt oq

which is naturally defined when using coordinates of the area form do = dr; A dry of the
given surface M, by setting q = rz, p =11. In the case of the plane and of the unit sphere
S*, the corresponding area forms can be written as

doge = dx A dy and dog: = d(cos 0) A dg, (2.9)

where g and @ are, respectively, the longitude and the co-latitude coordinates. Notice that
by using z € [—1, 1], the vertical distance to the equatorial plane (z = cos @), the area form
of S? can be also be written as dog: = dz A dg, and this is why the cylindrical coordinates
constitute a natural pair of canonical variables for vortex dynamics on a sphere.
