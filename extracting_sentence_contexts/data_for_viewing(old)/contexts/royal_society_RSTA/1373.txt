solving a more general class of problems, namely

u* =arg min {f(Ku) + sw), (3.12)

where f and g are convex (possibly) non-smooth functions and K a linear operator. The key change
from the FISTA problem is the splitting of the complicated f(K(u)), which as a whole may not be
proximable, into simpler parts f and K to be handled separately. CIL provides two algorithms
for solving this problem, depending on properties of f and assuming that g is proximable. If f is
proximable, then the linearized ADMM method [30] can be used; available as LADMM in CIL. If the
so-called convex conjugate, f*, of f is proximable, then the primal dual hybrid gradient (PDHG)
method [31-33], also known as the Chambolle-Pock method, may be used; this is known as PDHG
in CIL.
In fact, an even wider class of problems can be handled using this formulation, namely

u* =arg min | Yo fi(Kiu) + «| , (3.13)
