measured at large distances from the interface. In fact,
the local water structure dominates ion distributions [3,
4], double-layer capacitance [5,6], electrokinetic mobility
and surface conductivity [7-10]. The changing structure
and dynamics of the water close to the interface manifest
themselves primarily in the form of two quantities: the
viscosity profile and the dielectric profile. In their seminal
work, Lyklema & Overbeek [8] consider a decrease
in the interfacial dielectric constant and an increase
in the interfacial viscosity due to the strong electric
field in the interfacial layer.
