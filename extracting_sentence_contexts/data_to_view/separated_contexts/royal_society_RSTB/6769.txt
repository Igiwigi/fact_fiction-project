One is the
very considerable increase in the total volume of nuclear sap, which began at late
preleptotene (fig. 12) and continues until zygotene (fig. 14), as was accurately
described by Lawson (1911). The other is that at leptotene, unlike preleptotene,
mutual displacement of parts of chromosomes certainly occurs. The fact that the
chromosomes not only open out their loops but slip over one another in doing so is
clearly reflected in the behaviour of the nucleoli. These tend to be pushed out of
place; they often come in contact with each other and coalesce, so that whereas at

Janssens (1924). +
