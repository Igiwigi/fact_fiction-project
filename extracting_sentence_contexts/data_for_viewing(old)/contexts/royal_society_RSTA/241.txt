which is a good approximation except close to the fold points. Notice that the
wave speed (6.5) gives the gradients of the equilibrium curve q* = Q(p*) at the
Hopf points (p"", q#"), i= 1,2, while the wave speed (6.6) gives the gradient of the
line connecting points (pt, q*) and (p~,q~). Clearly, this line does not coincide
with g°“8 (in contrast to the suggestion in figure le). In the FD in figure 4c, the
bistable regimes are located at p+ < p* < p#? and p#! < p* < p~. Notice that h~ <
Kstop  P” > Pstop, that is, during oscillations, higher densities can be observed
than suggested by the equilibrium FD. This corresponds to the fact that drivers
intend to stop at the distance hgto), but can only achieve this at the distance h~
owing to their inertia and reaction time.

As mentioned above, if the reaction times were omitted, the Hopf bifurcations
are usually supercritical (or weakly subcritical), which would result in (p4?, q#?) ~
(pt, qt) and (p™, g#!) = (p-,q-) and would also yield cll’, ~ 8; see (6.5),
(6.6). In this case, the extended bistable regions would disappear, oscillation
would appear only for p#? < p* <p"! and the corresponding FD would be similar

o figure 3d. That is, no overlapping region between equilibria and oscillations
could be observed, which contradicts the empirical findings in figure La.
