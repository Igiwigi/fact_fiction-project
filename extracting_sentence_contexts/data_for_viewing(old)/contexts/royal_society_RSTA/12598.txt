phenomena of different years shown in Tables VI. and VIIL., it is clear that other
important influences have to be considered.

These other influences would appear to have sometimes opposed the influence in
virtue of which a sunspot pulse is followed by a magnetic pulse, and so long as the
nature of the other influences and the various inter-relationships are unknown, it
would be unsafe to assume that years of sunspot maximum always behave in the same
way as 1892 to 1894.

§ 20. One of the possibilities suggested by Tables V. and VII. was that there might
be a periodic fluctuation in magnetic properties, which was in phase with sunspot
variations to a much greater extent in some years than in others. Various such
periods have in fact been advanced by earlier investigators. A 26-day period has
been suggested by several magneticians, including Hornsrery and Broun. Dr. Ap.
Scumrpt, of Potsdam, claims to have discovered that a large proportion of magnetic
storms of the very largest kind are separated by intervals which are multiples of
29°97 days. In 1904-5, Mr. E. W. Maunper,* in two important papers, discussing
the magnetic storms recorded at Greenwich from 1848 to 1903, claimed to have
discovered a period of 27°275 days, corresponding to the time of rotation of the sun-
spot zones on the sun. The validity of Mr. Maunper’s claim to have established a
period was supported by the present Astronomer Royal amongst others, on arguments
based on the mathematical theory of probability.

I had myself} occasion, at the instance of the Editor of ‘Terrestrial Magnetism,’ to
read carefully and criticise the first of Mr. Maunpmr’s papers, dealing with magnetic
