The product formule just obtained correspond to the expression of the o function
as an infinite product of circular functions.

Such a circumstance, of course, at once prompts us to try and find a formula
corresponding to the expression of the o function as a sum of exponential functions.
But it is readily seen that such is an impossibility. We cannot express the double
gamma function as a sum of an infinite series of simple gamma functions of varying
arguments.

It is this fact, combined with the absence ot any quasi-addition theorem for the
double gamma functions, which precludes the possibility of any collection of formule
rivalling in number and elegance those of the doubly periodic functions.

gamma functions.
In Wererstrass’ notation of elliptic functions we have
