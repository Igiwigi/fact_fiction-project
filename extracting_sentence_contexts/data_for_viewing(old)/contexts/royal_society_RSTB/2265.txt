recur : I find no evidence for believing them due to trophic disturbance. They seem
the result of pressure during the paralytic condition of the limb, idema of the
foot also occurs. The muscles waste greatly, especially, I think, the quadriceps
extensor of thigh,

* ie. a reflex elicited by excitation of the limb itself.

140 PROFESSOR CO. 8. SHERRINGTON ON THE PERIPHERAL DISTRIBUTION

A fact of importance is that if regularly repeated passive extensions be not under-
taken and kept up, “late rigidity” “ contracture” ultimately flexes the hips and knees.
The onset of the rigidity is shown by resistance to movement in the direction toward
which act the muscles antagonistic to those becoming rigid: this can be in some
cases felt in two or three weeks. The atrophy is severest in the extensors of the
knee, at least that is my experience in the Cat, Dog, and Monkey. I cannot confirm
Freusperc* when he states there is to be found in the dog no alteration in the
nutritive condition of any of the muscles, Myself, I find it affect both sets of
muscles, flexor and extensor ; much as Munxt describes after cortical ablations, when
hemiplegic contracture occurs in the Monkey. That the rigidity “contracture”
affects in the lower limb the flexors in the Monkey, rather than the extensors, as I am
told is the case in Man, may be due to extension of the limb being more predominant
in the erect position than in the quadrupedal.
