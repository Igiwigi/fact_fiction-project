FOX ON THE DIFFRACTION OF

equations are, however, still linear and can be satisfied simultaneously by assuming a series
of the form (55) for each of the two unknown functions. The first term in each series is then
a solution of the half-plane problem corresponding to the upper or lower edge respectively,
whilst, after application of the Laplace transformation, the (r+1)th term in either series
is related to the rth term in the other series by an integral equation identical in form with
equation (29). Much of the analysis is therefore essentially a repetition of the previous
analysis and can, in fact, be avoided if we make the following direct appeal to the physical
nature of the problem. First, although the incident field is not necessarily symmetrical, we still have an inherent
symmetry in the strip itself and this can be used to advantage if we introduce two systems
of co-ordinates (x,y) and (x,y’) one to each edge, by writing

felt hee toedt: Sama ich (128)
where y, Y as before are measured from the upper edge as origin and y’, Y’ similarly from
the lower edge. We can now generalize equation (71) to express the pressure on the back of the strip
rr ee Po= FY, 4/00), , (129)
where F, f refer to diffraction effects arriving from the upper and lower edges respectively.
