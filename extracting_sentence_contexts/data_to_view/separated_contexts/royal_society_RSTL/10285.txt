Such statements,
though based on careful observation on the plots during growth, and on botanical
analysis of zamples, are of necessity approximately correct only, for it can hardly be
imagined, that in all cases of disappearance the plants are absolutely banished from

S the plot, either by the direct action of manures or by internecine conflict. They
amay be present, but in swch diminished numbers, or in snch limited growth, that
Ethey are nob obvious on the plots at the times when the observations are made,
Sand till less are they found in the samples. That this may be the case is shown by
Sthe fact that when cireumstances become favonrable they again appear. As has been
Said, many of the plants on the plots seldom, if ever, ripen their seed. The reappear-
ance of such plants after an interval is nob likely, therefore, to be due to the transport
Af seed.
