YA*=0:

Conversely if these equations are satisfied the function will be a covariant.

I assume that A is a function of the degree 0 and of the weight 4 (m/—w), satis-
fying the condition

XA=0.

And I represent by YA, Y*A, Y*A, &c. the results obtained by successive operations
with Y upon the function A. The function Y'A will be of the degree 09 and of the
weight 4 (m0—p)+s. And it is clear that in the series of terms YA, Y*A, Y*A, &c.,
we must at last come to a term which is equal to zero. In fact, since m is the
greatest weight of any coefficient, the weight of Y* is at most equal to md, and there-
fore if 4 (ml—p)+s>md, or 8>4(m0+þp), we must have Y'A=0.

Now writing for greater simplicity XY instead of X.Y, and s0 in similar cases, we
have, as regards Y'A,
XY—YX=p—2s.
Hence
(XY—YX)A=pA,
and consequently
