In the one case, a direct stimulus is applied to a proportion only of the organ, and in the
other case all, or the major part of the organ, is stimulated indirectly through its nerve
supply. The constancy and gradation of the anti-diuretic response

If, during a water diuresis, a given stimulus was repeated after the anti-diuretic effect of
any previous stimulus had disappeared, the second response tended to be greater than the
first (see figure 5). This fact has been observed in a series of fourteen experiments on three
rabbits of group C. The first observations were made on rabbits under a sedative dose of
chloralose and urethane, and it was thought that the increasing effect of similar stimuli
was due to the decreasing level of anaesthesia as the experiments progressed. That this was
not the whole explanation was shown by the fact that in five later experiments the same
results were obtained without the use of any sedative.
