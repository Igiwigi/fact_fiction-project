different thicknesses. If we take a rhomboid, of calcareous
spar, whose principal section is A B C D, fig. 2. and
cement upon its two surfaces AB,CD, two prisms of flint
glass, having their sides perpendicular to the principal sec-
tion, and their refracting angles EBF, GDH, a little greater
than FBb which is 45” 2g' 26”; and if polarised light is inci-
dent, perpendicularly upon the surfaces BE,DG, it will be
transmitted parallel to Bb,F and will exhibit in the most
beautiful manner the system of coloured rings shown in

* M. Bior was the first who deduced this conclusion for crystals with one axis
from experiments on calcareous spar and rock crystal; but it could not be considered
as a general fact when drawn from such a small number of crystals. It will be seen
in the sequel of this paper, that I have extended the result to crystals with two axes,
and have thus established it as a general principle,

+ This mode of exhibiting the coloured rings, is greatly superior to the mode
employed by Bior, of grinding down the solid angles at B and D. Beside the
advantage of procuring the greatest possible thickness from a given rhomboid, we
preserve the polish of its natural faces, and the thickness of crystal through which
the polarised ray passes can be calculated with the utmost accuracy from the thick-
ness Bb of the plate. This method is also peculiarly favourable for sbowing the

influence of pressure upon the polarising structure of the crystal, and for various
other experiments on the coloured rings.
