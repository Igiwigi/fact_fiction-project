tigated, and the problems connected with that theory can generally be more easily solyed,
by merely bearing in mind that G=D(H) than by using EvLER's equations, which
merely expres that fact in one particular form; for that form is not always the most
convenient form, and is in all cases apt to conceal the fact which it embodies.


500 MR. A. COHEN ON THE DIFFERENTIAL COEFFICIENTS

Take, for instance, the problem of a body rotating about a fixed point, no external
forces acting on it. Tere D(H)=0, therefore I is a line of constant length and direc-
tion. The motion of the body must therefore entirely depend upon the fact that, whilst
the body moves about the principal axes with angular velocities w,, m,, w,, the line H, whose
projections on those axes are respectively Aw, Bo,, Cz,, remains throughout the body's
motion the same in magnitude and direction.

The length of H is evidently \/A*7;+B*o;+C*o;. But the length of HH is constant,
say equal to h. Therefore 1
