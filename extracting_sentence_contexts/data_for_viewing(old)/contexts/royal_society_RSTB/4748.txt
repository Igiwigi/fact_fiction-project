“investing layer” around the double cone which is seen in trunk and anterior caudal
vertebrae of late embryos (fig. 31, E, p. 385; fig. 28, A, p. 382).

The “individual” method has much to recommend it, and it is quite possible to
conceive that the study of the whole vertebral column in a few appropriately chosen
fishes may be more productive of results of morphological value than the study of
isolated vertebrae taken one from each of a much greater number of species,
particularly if these single vertebrae are not taken from corresponding regions of the
body, so as to render the comparison just. One of the results of the present inquiry
has been to show that in a range of closely allied forms the vertebrze of the caudal
region differ less than do those of the trunk, and they are more elementary in
structure ; witness, for instance, the series of Rava, shown in fig. 33, p. 388. A series
of Torpedo, Rhinobatus, or Cestracion would illustrate the same fact.

It is not a new thesis that the structure of the caudal vertebra of sharks and rays
is simpler than that of the vertebree of the trunk region, K6LLIKER, in 1864, wrote :
“Die vorderen Wirbel von Ginglymostoma sind verwickelter gebaut als die des
Schwanzes” (20, p. 53). And Gapow and Axporr write: “the tail of embryonic
Elasmobranchs generally shows more primitive conditions or stages than the trunk,”
and “as the tail generally shows earlier stages than the trunk, a forward gradation
can be made out in each embryo in passing from the tail towards the head” (6, pp. 181
and 178).

The general proposition, however, that the caudal vertebree are in a less advanced
stage of evolution than the trunk vertebree is not universally accepted, for GRAHAM
