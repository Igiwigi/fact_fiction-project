Extirpation of the pre-frontal lobe (Exps. 26, 27, 28).
2, Extirpation of the frontal lobe anterior to the pre-central sulcus, and its
prolongation upwards to the superior longitudinal fissure (Exps. 29, 30).

1. The posterior boundary of the pre-frontal lobe was determined in each case by
electrical stimulation, and the non-excitable portion of this lobe only removed. Our recent researches have not added anything to the facts already known in
connexion with the functions of this area.

2. In a case in which both frontal lobes were removed in front of the pre-central
sulcus, certain phenomena were observed which had not been previously noted in
experiments upon this region. The frontal lobes were removed in two operations, the first consisting of extir-
pation of the left lobe.
