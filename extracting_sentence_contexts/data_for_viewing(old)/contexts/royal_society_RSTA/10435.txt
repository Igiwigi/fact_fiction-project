The above observations are represented by dots in Diagram IV.

All the above experiments indicate that the composition of a supersaturated, a
saturated, or a strong solution may be ascertained with a certain degree of accuracy
by determining the refractive index by means of a totally reflecting prism; there

appears to be no sudden break in the curvature of the curve which expresses the
relation between refractive index and constitution.

They must not be regarded as more than a first attempt to establish this fact and
to determine the curve for four substances: in the case of the supersaturated
solutions, the stirring was not always satisfactory, on account of the danger of making
the solution erystallise ; and in the same series of observations the constitution was
only deduced by comparison with another series. However, the very fair coincidence
between the determinations made quite independently by the two methods gives
some confidence in the experiments next to be described, in which a growing crystal
itself is employed as the totally reflecting prism. :

As explained above, the growing erystal itself may in some instances be used as
