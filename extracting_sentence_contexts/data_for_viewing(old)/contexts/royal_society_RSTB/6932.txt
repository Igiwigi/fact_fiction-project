(1) Gross form. There are seven specimens of A. manis, four of which are very badly
preserved, while the other three are only moderately good. This is surprising, as most
fossils in the bed with A. manis are beautifully preserved. The coaly substance of

A, manis has contracted and cracked into minute rectangular blocks which come apart
when the fossil is removed from the rock. This is apparently a property of the fossil
substance, and is not due to the thinness of its cuticle, for it is the parts of A. manis
where the coaly substance is thickest that are the most friable, while other fossils in
the same bed with just as thin cuticles are coherent. This fact, which has meant that
pieces as small as 0-1 x 0-2 mm. have been used for cuticle preparations, has con-
siderably increased the difficulty of description.

from the type-specimen (V 25900 A), those in A, B, D from V 25899 D. E, typical stoma;

outer side of the displaced scale at the right of the type-specimen; V 25900 D, x 800. I, cell
from one of the lower scales of the type-specimen; V 25900 C, x 800. J, cell from the middle

aperture, cleared to show the thickening of the cells; V 25899 B, x 400.
