I think T am justified in expressing my conviction that the present memoir confirms
the views I have 80 long advanced, viz. : that at leass many of the Lepidodendroid
plants acquire, through advancing age, those characteristics thab have hitherto been
relied upon to distinguish the Sigillarian from the Lepidodendroid forms. In his
latest memoir, already quoted, M. RExAuLT combines his fossil Gymnospermous
Phanerogams in one group, to which he gives the common name of *Diploxyl6es,”
and in a foot-note (oc. cit., p. 260) he 8ays : © Sous ce nom je reunis toutes les plantes
qui, dans le faiscean lib6ro-lignens de la tige on des feuilles, presentent un double
accroissement, V'un centripdte, Vautre centrifuge.” My friend here reasserts the old
Brongniartian hypothesis in all its definiteness. Tf the evidence produced in the pre-
ceding pages is nob sufficient to demonstrate the erroneousness of this hypothesis, I
am wholly unable to conceive what kind or number of facts would accomplish that end.

The enormous number of Lepidodendroid and allied plants that have now been
described by M. Rexavir and myself seem to me to justify an attempt to ascertain
what bearing our discoveries may have upon the problem of Evolution. In making this
attempt we must not forget that, whilst our researches have been confined to carboni-
ferous plants, the discoveries of Dr. Dawsoxn have shown that the differentiation of
the Gymnospermous Dadoxylons from the Cryptogamic Lycopods was as definite in
the Devonian age as in that which sneceeded it. Nevertheless, it seems to have been
during the later portion of the Palzozoic epoch that the great changes were effected
which caused the arborescent Lycopods to be replaced by the oolitic Gymnosperms ;
and it fortunately happens that the plants which have furnished 80 rich a morpho-
logical harvest belong to that important period of transition.
