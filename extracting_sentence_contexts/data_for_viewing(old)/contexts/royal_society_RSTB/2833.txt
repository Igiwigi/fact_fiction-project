stated the problem in the first instance so that some of my expressions have been
misunderstood, while others require amendment for other reasons. I therefore take
the opportunity of first re-stating the general views upon which such data as have
been acquired will have their bearing.

There are two broad facts which form the basis of the whole discussion : first, that
spore-production is the end to which the life of all typical sporophytes tends ; and,
second, that the sporophyte in all typical cases arises from the unicellular zygote.t
It is the generation thus initiated by the zygote, and tending uniformly to the
production of spores, which is the subject of our present study, but especially the
parts of it which produce the spores,

The materials for the general discussion are the facts as to form and structure of
this sporophyte generation in living plants, together with those relating to fossil
forms. It is easy to arrange these in apparent series, illustrating possible progressions
from the simpler to the more complex, or conversely, possible retrogressions from the
more complex to the simpler. But it is on broad lines of comparison and probability,
checked by such knowledge of stratigraphical sequence of the fossils as can be
obtained, that opinion must be based as to the true validity of such series as real
exponents of any evolution in the past; it is only thus that it can be decided whether
any particular series has actually been progressive or retrogressive.

I desire to repeat here with all emphasis, that the present is no mere attempt to
trace homologies, or to define the actual relationships of the families of Archegoniatze,
though the new facts acquired will undoubtedly have their bearings on such questions.
