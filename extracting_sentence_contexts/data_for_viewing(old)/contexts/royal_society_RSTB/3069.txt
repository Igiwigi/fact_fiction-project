connection in a certain sense is one of cause and effect.

Apart from the experimental evidence, FRAENKEL adduces certain other facts
which tend to support his theory. He points out that the general structure of the
corpus luteum is suggestive of its being a ductless gland, that it is formed mainly of
large epithelioid cells arranged in regular rows or columns not unlike those of the
cortex of the supra-renal body and surrounded by a network of capillaries, and that
its inerease in size until it becomes bigger than a mature follicle, is otherwise
inexplicable. This increase, he shows, is out of all proportion to that of the rest of the
ovary, and when the corpus luteum is most hyperemic, the other part of the ovary is
unusually anzemic, while towards the close of pregnancy, when increase in the blood
supply to the generative organs is at its highest, the corpus luteum is frequently
reduced toascar. FRAENKEL also lays some stress on the fact that it has been shown
that the lutein cells are derived from the follicular epithelium and not from the
connective tissue of the theca wall (Soporra, 1896, etc.). He points out further, that
though many cases of double ovariotomy during pregnancy without disturbance of the
pregnancy have been recorded, in none of these, so far as he is aware, has the
operation been performed during the early weeks.

An apparent exception, however, has lately been recorded by Essen-M6LLER
(1904). A cystic ovarian tumour had been diagnosed in a woman of 43, On
September 6, 1903, laparotomy was performed and the left ovary removed. ‘The
right ovary, which was said to contain a corpus luteum of pregnancy, is also stated to
have been removed, ‘The patient made an uninterrupted recovery, and on June 2,
1904, was delivered of a full-term child, which, however, died six days afterwards of
