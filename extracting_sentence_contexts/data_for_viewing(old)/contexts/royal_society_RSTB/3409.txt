are less able to resist hardship and want than male larvee, so want, privation, and
unfavourable climatic conditions are consistently correlated with an increased
production of M., while prosperity or a plentiful supply of nutritive food and
favourable physical conditions are associated with an increase of F. births.

The evidence I have to offer substantially confirms this view.

Attention is drawn to the fact that in dealing with mammals we are concerned
with animals who produce only a very limited number of the ova stored in the
ovary during their whole life, that many of them degenerate and are absorbed, and
that it is certain a struggle for existence takes place among these ova.

This is a fact of great importance, for if the ovary experiences the effects of
influences which bear upon selection, forces are there introduced which will not only
bear upon sex but also upon every hereditary constitutional variation which is directly
associated with the vigour of the ovum. Natural selection.

I suggest that such struggle results in the increased production of M. or F,
ova according to the physical conditions which prevail from time to time, and
conclude that in all animals in which only a limited number of ovarian ova come to
maturity selective action takes place in the ovary, and that the growth and
