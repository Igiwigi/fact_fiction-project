4, Group size effects on predation risk versus

energetic gain
We now consider how collective behaviour and the result-
ing patterns of group formation can influence Malthusian
fitness, through modifications in the per capita gain (f ) and
cost (g) functions described above. We start with a consider-
ation of predation risk, long-recognized as a potential benefit
of grouping [11,36]. If the entire population of prey breaks up
into tightly knit groups of size G that are no more visible to
predators than individuals, then the rate of prey encounter =
aN/G, rather than aN, due to the fact that clumps of prey
will be encountered far less frequently than the same prey
population distributed randomly across the landscape
[19,37]. If the predator can at most attack and eat a single
prey item, the risk for each individual in a group drops geo-
metrically with group size (1/G), due to simple dilution of
risk [36]. The combination of both group-dependent effects
implies that per capita predation risk would be modified in
the following manner [19]:

paP(1/G)

8(N,G,P) = 1+ pab(N/G) + acP* (4.1)
