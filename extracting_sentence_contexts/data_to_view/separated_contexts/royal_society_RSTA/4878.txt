Received January 18,—Read February 7,—Revised March 28, 1895. Introduction. In a paper published in ‘ Acta Mathematica,’ vol. 16, M. Forte announces the fact
that the latitude of places on the earth’s surface is undergoing periodic changes in a
period considerably in excess of that which theory has hitherto been supposed to
require. This result has been confirmed in a remarkable manner by Dr. 8S. C.
CHANDLER in America (vide ‘ Astronomical Journal,’ vols. 11, 12), who, as the result of
an exhaustive examination of almost all the available records of latitude observations
for the last half-century, has assigned 427 days as the true period in which the
changes are taking place.
