a stimulus. 'The limbs and the tail possessed a certain degree of firmness or
tone, recoiled on being drawn from their position, and moved with energy on

the application of the stimulus. On withdrawing the spinal marrow gently out
of its canal, all these phenomena ceased. The limbs were no longer obedient
to stimuli, and became perfectly flaccid, having lost all their resilience. The
sphincter lost its circular form and its contracted state, becoming lax, flaccid,
and shapeless. The tail was flaccid, and unmoved on the application of stimali.


OF THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA AND SPINALIS. 645

This experiment affords evidence of many important facts in physiology. It
proves that the presence of the medulla oblongata and spinalis is necessary to
the contractile function of the eyelids, the sub-maxillary textures, the larynx,
the sphineters, the limbs, the tail, on the application of stimuli to the cutaneous
surfaces or mucous membranes. It proves the reflex character of this property
of the medulla oblongata and spinalis, and the dependence of these motions
upon the reflex function. It proves that the tone of the limbs, and the con-
tractile property of the sphincter, depend upon the same reflex function of the
medulla spinalis,â€”effects not hitherto suspected by physiologists.

I must now state that the phenomena which have heen detailed subsist in
distinct portions of the divided nervous system. If, after severing the head of
the turtle, the lower extremities and the tail be separated together, in the man-
