facet, which is very apparent on the occlusal surface of the first upper premolar. It
is therefore clear that the first lower premolar was situated mainly behind the
canine of the maxilla, and did not produce a facet upon its lingual surface, as it
usually does in regular human dentitions (fig. 5). The facet for the lower canine on
the mesial (medial interstitial) surface is placed very definitely on that border of the
tooth and not on the lingual surface, and is, furthermore, separated from the facet of
the premolar on the distal surface by a very appreciable interval, namely, the breadth
(mesio-distal diameter) of the tooth between these mesial and distal facets.

The conclusions to be drawn from these facts are of the utmost importance.
Deductions may be made from such facets with especial confidence in considering
the teeth of more primitive races and anthropoids, since there is much better agree-
ment between the maxillary and mandibular teeth in these instances than in modern
types, such as the European. The condition and position of the facets of wear are
identical on both the canine teeth, so that the possibility of some individual
abnormality in their mandibular opponents may be excluded as an explanation of
these peculiarities. Further, the very curious position of the facet on both canines
for the lower premolar placed high up on the distal surfaces cannot be explained by
the absence of the upper premolar, since, on the left side, this premolar is present
and is a normal tooth. In the normal human dentition, though great variation in
the detail of these facets occurs, there are certain characters invariably present.
The upper canine tooth usually shuts over and in front of the lower canine and first
