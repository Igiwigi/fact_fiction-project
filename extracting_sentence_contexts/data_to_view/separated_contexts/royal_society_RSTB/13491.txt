Importantly, because natural phenomena
are not scattered randomly but form a network of effects
with uneven numbers of connections (harnessing fire, for
example, can reveal many more natural phenomena than har-
nessing probing sticks), Type II CCE can result in punctuated
rather than gradual cultural accumulation. This is illustrated
by recent theoretical models showing that puzzling cultural
evolutionary patterns such as periods of stasis interspersed
by sudden increases in cultural traits need not depend on
exogenous factors such as abrupt changes in population
size and connectedness [46,47]. Instead, sudden increases in
cultural complexity can result from the emergence of cultural
traits that facilitate the emergence of other related traits
[21,37,48].

(c) Type Il cumulative cultural evolution generates

cultural dependencies
The fact that natural phenomena are not readily available but
must be progressively uncovered using solutions that harness
less deeply hidden natural phenomena creates cultural
dependencies, which some have argued is the core of what
CCE is about [6,21,37,49,50]. This contrasts with solutions
accessible through Type I CCE that need not depend on
pre-existing solutions. Take the wheel experiment mentioned
above for instance [5].
