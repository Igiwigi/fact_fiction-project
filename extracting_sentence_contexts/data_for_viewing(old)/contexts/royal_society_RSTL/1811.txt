WHICH SUBSISTS BETWEEN THE RESPIRATION AND IRRITABILITY. 331

sion of respiration such an animal would not drown though immersed in
water. Now there is precisely such a case. It is that of the hybernating
animal. Tt will be shown in the subsequent paper, that in the state of
perfect hybernation the respiration is nearly suspended ; the blood mnust,
therefore, be venous. Yet the heart continues to contract, although with
a reptile slowness. The left ventricle is, therefore, veno-contractile, and in
this sense, in fact, sub-reptile. The case forms a sole exception to the law
pointed ont by Harvey, that the left ventricle ceases to contract sooner than
the right. If in the hybernating animal the left ventricle does cease to heat
s00ner than the right, it is only in $0 slight a degree as to be referred to the
greater thickness of its parietes, and the slight degree in which respiration
$till remains. It is obvious that the foregoing statement must -be taken with
its due limitations. Venous blood is unfit for the other animal purposes, even
though it should stimulate the heart to contraction.

Another mode of determining the degree of irritability, is the application of
stimuli, as galvanism. A muscular fibre endued with high irritability, as that
of the frog, and the galyanic agency are mutually tests of each other*.
