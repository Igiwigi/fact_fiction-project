status. There have so far been no comparative studies that
examine variation in species growth rates and telomere loss,
and how these link to body size and life histories. Thus, there
is considerable scope for further work in this area.

Within species, we would expect the larger, faster grow-
ing individuals to have shorter telomeres. In species where
males are larger than females, the males often have shorter
telomeres and shorter lives, while there is no sex difference
in telomere length in monomorphic species; however, factors
other than body size may drive this sex difference [106,107].
Understanding the relationship between body size and telo-
mere dynamics within species is complicated by the fact
that individuals may be small due to poor nutritional or
social conditions during growth [108]; both of these factors
can accelerate telomere loss but not necessarily via generating
oxidative stress [16,70,71,109].

An experimental study in which artificial selection for body
size was imposed on a wild population of house sparrows
Passer domesticus suggested that, within species, the relation-
ship between size and telomere loss goes in the predicted
direction [110]. However, since no detailed information on
post-natal growth rate was collected during this study, it is
not known how growth rate and body size were linked, or
