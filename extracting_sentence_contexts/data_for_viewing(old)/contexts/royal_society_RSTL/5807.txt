MR. J. LISTER ON THE BARLY STAGES OF INFLAMMATION. 677

ted, although, if the skin be carefully replaced 8 as to prevent drying of the
es, the blood will remain fluid in that part of the vein for many hours. Whether
the adhesiveness of the corpuscles in this case depend on a post mortem change in the
als s, or whether it is merely the result of the large size of the vein preventing the
>*1 tis$ues from acting effectually on the blood, remains to be determined ; but such a fact
weems to prove that a higher grade of vital activity, 80 to speak, is required to prevent
adhesiveness of corpuscles than to maintain the fluidity of the blood. Hence it is pro-
bable that, even if the blood were at rest in the vessels of a part, a stronger degree of
irritation would be required in order to determine coagulation than would suffice to induce
wn adhesiveness of the corpuscles, which seems to be a more sensitive test, of a deviation of
S the tisses from the standard of health. T have however ascertained, by experiments
2 upon the amputated sheep's foot, that if canstic ammonia is applied freely to a part of
= a yein after pressing the blood out of it, and the blood allowed to return when the
Z ammoniacal odour has passed off, coagulation takes place in the portion of the yessel
£ which has been 80 treated, although the chemical action of ammonia, if any of it remained
S in the tissnes, would tend to prevent or check coagulation*. I have also found a similar
£j local clot form, though more slowly, after merely pinching a piece of a vein.
