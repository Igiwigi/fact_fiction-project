value for a single year of one of the 31 columns of Table VI. is normally 60. Now
there are a few days the H range of which is altogether outstanding. Thus in
February, 1892, two successive days had ranges of 720y and 650y. The range of the
average day of 1892, though larger than that of any other year, was only 84y. This
will explain how the presence of even one outstanding range in a column sensibly
affects the mean value, and if any “accident” should bring two or three such days
into the same column for a single year the result might be to simulate a marked
influence which had no real existence.

It is obvious @ priori that, so far as the present research is concerned, a range of
720y must be regarded as largely an “accident.” There are no outstanding daily
values of sunspot area in the whole 11 years which overtop their neighbours in the
way the larger magnetic ranges do. The recognition of this fact suggested the next
mode of attack. It follows lines which were suggested by the procedure followed now
