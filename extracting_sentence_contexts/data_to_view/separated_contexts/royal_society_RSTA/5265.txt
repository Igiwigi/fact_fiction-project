Our contribution. In this article, we extend the series of results presented in [8,9] by introducing
an algorithm that computes all subtree repeats in unrooted unordered labelled trees in linear time and
space. The importance of our contribution is underlined by the fact that the presented algorithm
can be easily modified to work on trees that do not satisfy some or any of the above assumptions
on the tree structure, e.g. it can be applied to rooted, ordered or unlabelled trees. A preliminary
version of this article appeared in [16].

2. Preliminaries

(a) Basic definitions

An unrooted unordered tree is an undirected unordered acyclic-connected graph T =(V,E),
where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges such that EC V x V with |E| =|V| â€” 1.
