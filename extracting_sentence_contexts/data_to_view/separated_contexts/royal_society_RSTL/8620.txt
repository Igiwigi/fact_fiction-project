'This road was chosen because at the commence-
ment of the experiments the wind was blowing almost at right angles to it. The wind
was very light when the start was made, but before the first gun was fired it had consi-
derably strengthened and changed in direction s0 as to blow against the sound. It was
to this cause I attribute the fact that the first two guns were not heard at a distance of
a mile and a half and two miles respectively. After this the direction of the wind again
changed, and the two next guns were heard distinctly, although at greater distances ;
but, strange to say, the rockets at the same distance were not heard, The wind remained
constant in this direction until the end of the experiments, and a rocket was heard at
four miles. Owing to the changes in the wind the results of these last experiments have
shown nothing as regards the refraction of sound, although they show (what was, indeed,
shown by the previous ones) that it is possible on a very hot day when there is little or
no wind to hear the discharge of a small cartridge, such as that carried by the rockets,
distinctly for a distance of four or five miles, and this when the lower stratum of the
atmosphere was s0 heterogeneous that all distant objects near the ground appeared to
waver and twinkle as they do when seen over the top of a furnace.
