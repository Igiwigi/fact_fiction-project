that the * greenish cuticle” described by Mr. Carter as covering his Operculina arabica (Ann. of Nat, Hist.
ser, 2, vol. x. pp. 168, 172) and eupposed by MM. »'Arxcntac and Haim (op. cit. p. 52) to be specially con-

materials) which promotes a more rapid growth on one side than on the other. And
this view is most remarkably borne out by the fact, which I shall more fully illus-
trate in a $ubsequent memoir, that in another example of this group *, which, though
normally growing upon the cyclical type, possesses a greater degree of segmental
independence, such irregularities occur far more frequently ; so that, in fact, it is rare
to meet with a disk whose increase has taken place with uniformity throughout.

37. Reparation of Injuries —Looking at that vegetative repetition of parts which
pre-eminently characterizes the body of the Orbitolite,—every one of the segments
first budded-off from the nucleus, and subsequently from the margin of the pre-formed
zones, being the precise repetition of every other,—it may be expected from the
analogy of similar organisms, that every one of these parts should be equally capable,
both of repairing injuries done to itself, and of maintaining an independent existence
when detached from the mass to which it originally belonged. And although no
