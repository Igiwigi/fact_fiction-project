So far, then, as appears from his writings, Ds SaussuRs considered the ice of gla-
ciers to constitute a mass posses8ing rigidity in the highest degree, such rigidity in
short as common experience assigns to ice tranquilly frozen in small masses, which
is sensibly inflexible. It is' in this 8ense-in which I have spoken of Ds Saussure's
sliding theory, as one which © supposes the mass of the glacier to be a rigid one
Sliding over its trough or bed in the manner of solid bodies*,” and I adhere to the de-
finition as excluding the introduction of the 'smallest flexibility or plasticity, to which
the term rigidity is correctly opposed. I consider/ too that Dg SavssuRE's theory
supposes the mass of the glacier to slide over its trongh or bed in the manner of
solid bodies, that is, not as a heap of rubbish- or absolate fragments, 8uch as a gla-
cier 80metimes precipitates over a' rock, but which evidently did not enter into Dz
SavssURE's explanation, nor, in fact, required any theory.

As to the crevasses which form s0 prominent a feature of many glaciers (although
many are-in parts almost. devoid of them), I do not recollect, that Dz Savssurs alludes
to them as facilitating in any way the movement, of the glacier, but simply as rexults
of its motion and of the rigid character,of ice. And I believe that this view (whether
it was beld by Ds Saussure, or not) is substantially correct. The regular system of
crevasses of a glacier is approximately transverse, rather arched upwards towards the
origin of the glacier, and as Ds SavssvrE supposes the: glacier to be pressed down-
wards by the, mass of snow accumulating at its head; it is hard to believe: that be
could have regarded these fissures as in any way esential to its movement, even were
they very numerous; the tendency of such a pressure from above would rather seem
to be to pack the ice like an arch, opposing its convex ide to. the direction of the
