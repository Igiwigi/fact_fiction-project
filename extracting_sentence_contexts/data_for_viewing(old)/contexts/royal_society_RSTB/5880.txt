ARIENS KAPPERS ON SOME CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SKULL AND BRAIN. 417

But even the study of the convexity is much hampered by the fact that only some
parts of the endocranial casts show ridges and indentations of fissures.*

These are the orbital, frontal occipital and (usually to a smaller extent) also the
temporal lobes. On the centro-parietal lobes only the impressions of the arteries are
distinct, and it is by its supposed more or less constant relation to these arteries that the
position of the lower end of the central sulcus may be guessed.

Sir ArrHur Kerrn (1929)} has explained this particular characteristic of the centro-
parietal lobe by the fact that this part more than other parts is separated from the skull
by cerebro-spinal fluid, which may be due to the specific weight of the brain being
slightly higher, so that in the erect position of man the orbital surface of the skull is
most apt to receive impressions and, by sideward pressure, the lower temporal parts (cf.
also Symineton, 1915), and the lower frontal and occipital parts.

Although according to Symrveon in recent skulls the course of the Sylvia is frequently
fairly well marked in casts of prehistoric skulls, usually the upper part of the Sylvian
fissure can only be guessed and consequently here our lines and angles are of no help.

Only the lateral horizontal can be drawn in several casts with fairly great accuracy,
for, as pointed out by ScHwALBE (1904), the third frontal convolution forms an evident
marking on the endocranial (and external) surface. Similarly the ventral pole of the
