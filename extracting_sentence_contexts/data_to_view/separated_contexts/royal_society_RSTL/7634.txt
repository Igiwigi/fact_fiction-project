+ Entwickelungsgeschichte des Menschen, pp, 404, 405 (1861). 390 DR. M. TONGE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SEMILUNAR

riosus cannot be described as if it were formed by an inward growth of the ventricular
septum, as also comes out in the clearest manner from the fact that in certain creatures
the aorta divides at a time when the ventricle is till single. This is the case in the
Viper, according to RaTHKE, in which, at the time when the truncus arteriosus divides
into three vessels, the ventricle still possesses no trace of a septum. Therefore, as RarukE
correctly observes, the cause of the division of the primitive aorta into two canals cannot
with Von Barr be sought in certain peculiarities of the circulation, in a particular direc-
tion of the current of blood, but it depends solely and alone on particular developmental
phenomena of the arterial wall.
