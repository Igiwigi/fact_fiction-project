The complex story thus indicated, contrasted so sharply with the character of ‘recurrence-
surfaces’ familiar in the upper layers of raised bogs, that it demanded much fuller
investigation. We were at this stage fortunate to have the service of Miss W. Abery, then
resident at Street, who undertook a detailed examination of a length of 240 ft. (73 m.) of
the peat face in the turf cuttings at the site in question. She made examination of the peat
at 12 ft. (4 m.) intervals along the peat face, and the results of her investigation have been
presented in simplified form in the diagram (figure 7). The salient feature of this evidence
is of course the fact that Cladium peat is developed in two thick and persistent layers
separated from one another by fresh Sphagnum peat. The small-reed peat found in April
was here demonstrated also to be consistently developed at the top of the lower Cladium
peat, but only exceptionally was more Cladium found immediately overlying it. Of con-
siderable interest is a local development above the small-reed peat, of lenses 5 to 10 m.
across of humified Sphagnum-Calluna peat. This accentuates the conclusion that after the
substantial flooding with base-rich water, the peat bog experienced freedom from such
conditions for a substantial period of time, in which oligotrophic raised-bog communities
re-established themselves as islands over the fen surface: the high humification indicates
fairly dry conditions. A complete cover of fresh Sphagnum-Calluna peat spread over the
bog after this under presumably increased atmospheric moisture, and in its upper part
