We have just referred to the thermal loss due to the cold walls of the explosion
chamber. The total loss, cwteris paribus, is proportional to the time.

When the diameter of the cordite, and consequently the time occupied by the
combustion, is very small, the theoretical value of the maximum pressure is closely
approached, and the shape and size of the enclosure have but little effect (compare
A and B, fig. 14). These factors become, however, of considerable importance in
determining the maximum pressure developed by the slower burning cordite (see
fig. 15).

The shape of the cooling curve depends, on the other hand, essentially on the
dimensions of the enclosure. In fig. 16 the facts are clearly illustrated by the results
of comparative experiments carried out respectively in a sphere and in the cylinder.

It is proposed to reserve the general discussion of the questions of dissociation and
rate of cooling for the third part of the present research ; we shall then be dealing
with gaseous mixtures of simple composition which will serve as a natural introduction
to the consideration of more complicated questions. A few words are, however,
necessary with regard to the somewhat unusual conditions under which the cooling
of the products of combustion of a solid explosive takes place.

Under ordinary circumstances the convection and conductivity of the gas itself are
the ruling factors which determine the rate of cooling.
