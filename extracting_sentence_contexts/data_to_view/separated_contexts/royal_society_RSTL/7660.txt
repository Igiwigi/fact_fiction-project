A second sample, weighing twelve pounds, from the same
maker gave 723 grains of sulphur by treatment with excess of sulphuretted hydrogen. All the samples contained large but variable amounts of sulphurous acid, and gave
copious deposits of sulphur &e. by treatment with excess of sulphuretted hydrogen ;
they also contained yery variable percentages of HF, varying from about 10 to 70. Oil
of vitriol is sometimes added to weak hydrofluoric acid to enable it to etch glass in a
Suitable manner ; it imparts to it a fictitious strength, probably by abstraction of water. A ixty per cent. acid requires dilution before it can be used for etching glass; too
strong an acid etches glass roughly.
