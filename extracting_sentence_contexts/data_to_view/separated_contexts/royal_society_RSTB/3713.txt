The Araucarinee with large leaves resemble Monocotyledons with numerous
parallel veins. The small-leaved forms have only a single vein. Scorr (1909, p, 654),
in deciding on the ancestral type of leaf, says: ‘ That the multinervate character is
primitive (in the Araucarinese) is indicated by the fact that the cotyledons likewise
contain several bundles.” The force of this is very evident when one considers such
a form as Araucaria excelsa, where the adult foliage is so much reduced that there is
only a vestige of the multinervate condition in the leaf trace as it passes through the
cortical region of the stem. Here two small and very short lateral branches are given
off from the single central bundle, which alone continues into the lamina. In the
large cotyledons of this form there are several distinct veins.
