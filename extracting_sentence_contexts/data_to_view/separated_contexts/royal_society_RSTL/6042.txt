attributing to these any specific values,
Sr writing &, 7, Z=Â«, 3, y, we have a particular line of the plane. And we may say that
Ihe plane is the /ocus in guo of the point-coordinates (&, y, 2), and of the line-coordinates
3x, n,%). It is not necessary to consider separately the analytical theories of point-coor-
Ainates and of line-coordinates; for the theory of the former in relation to points and
Jines respectively is identical with the theory of the latter in relation to lines and points
Hespectively; but it is necessary to show how either system of coordinates, say the system
Sf point-coordinates, is applicable to both points and lines, or in fact all loci whatever,
nd to explain the mutual relation of the two systems of coordinates. 2 170. Considering then point-coordinates, the equations
