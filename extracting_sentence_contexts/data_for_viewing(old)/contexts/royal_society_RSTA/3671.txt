Figure 2. The evolution of D/H ratio in the Martian atmosphere over time. Previous estimates of atmospheric D/H increase used
ALH 84001 apatite D/H to suggest a rapid initial hydrogen (and general atmospheric) loss prior to 4.1 Ga (e.g. [65]). However, as
ALH 84001 is a highly shocked meteorite that is reported to contain a crustal assimilant, the D/H ratio of its apatite may not be
representative of the Martian atmosphere at the time of crystallization.

the D/H ratio of Mars’ mantle is low (5D < 275% [57,58]). However, not all hydrous primary
(igneous) minerals contain D/H ratios representative of the Martian mantle reservoir (figure 3).
In fact, the majority of these minerals have D/H ratios somewhere between low mantle and high
crustal/atmospheric ratios (assuming the crust and atmosphere are equilibrated, but see [64]).
There are a number of ways that these intermediate D/H ratios can be produced, both pre- and
post-crystallization.

In contrast to eucrite apatite D/H ratios, apatite in the shergottites and ALH 84001 shows
a distinct trend of increasing D/H with decreasing water content (figure 3b). This trend is also
weakly apparent in ALH 84001 feldspathic glass (figure 34), and is characteristic of Hz degassing
from a melt [45,46]. By contrast, Nakhla apatite D/H ratios stay constantly low over a range
of water contents, indicating a lack of degassing in this melt. These low D/H ratios probably
represent the Martian mantle reservoir.

A similar D/H trend is visible in chassignite amphiboles (figure 3c). However, instead of
