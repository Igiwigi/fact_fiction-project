The focus of this plate was not exact, the lines being broadened. Curiously, the first
order lines were all sharp on both edges, while the second order lines were sharp on
one edge and shaded on the other. Since this asymmetry probably persists even in
the position of best focus, it is obvious that measurement by the superposition of orders
is always untrustworthy.

The remaining unobserved portion of the spectrum, the infra-red, was photo-
graphed at the Bureau of Standards at Washington, D.C., where Dr. MeGcrrs was
kind enough to allow me to use his infra-red concave grating spectrograph. There
can be no doubt that very few lines between A 10,000 and 4 600 have escaped detec-
tion. Intensities are, of necessity, rough visual estimates of photographic blackening
and are quite untrustworthy outside any narrow range of wave-lengths. _ The actual
range of intensities must be enormous, judging from the fact that the strongest lines
on the prism plates were composed of over 60 diffraction fringes.

Tue ANALYSIS

The once ionized copper atom contains ten electrons outside tightly bound closed
shells. The low structures to be expected are, therefore, representable by the
symbols 3d1°, 3d°4s, 3d*4s*. From the series in the are spectrum, 3d! *S_ should
be about 22,000 wave-numbers below 3d4°45*D;, and from Gibb’s analysis of Cu HI,
it can be predicted that 3d%4s? °F should lie above 3d%45*D by about 50,000 wave-
numbers. The higher terms should have structures 3d%mx and 3d*4snx. Of the
latter type of structure only 3d%4s4p should be in the energy range capable of ex-
citation in the helium filled Schuler tube.
