250. RaTukE in a recent paper, though not doubting that the © primitive trace”
is constituted by the © central portion of the germinal membrane” (for he uses these
terms synonymously), makes known the fact, —observed by him in Mammals, Birds,
and some Reptiles, —that parts previously supposed to be formed by what Barr had
denominated the © lamine ventrales of the serous lamina of the germinal membrane,”
really originate independently of any membrane. 'These parts are the ribs and pelvic
bones and the muscles of the thorax and ahdomen, which, according to Raraks, arise
in a newly added substance © proceeding out of the primitive trace,” and pushing the
membranous © laminz ventrales” farther and farther from the latter. Observations
previously made by RercuerT4Þ are referred to by RaTakE as being in accordance with
the above. Re1cuerr had found that the part originating the lower jaw and hyoid
bone © grows out of the primitive trace.” Now if, from the facts made known in the
present memoir, it should appear that the © primitive trace” is not constituted by the
central portion of a membrane, it will be easy to understand that the parts above
referred to by Reicauerr and RaTakE 8hould have an origin equally independent of
a membrane.
