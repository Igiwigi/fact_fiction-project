the part
actually sectioned was about nine inches long, and in Specimen I. nearly the same. Tt must therefore, I think, be taken as proved that the structure of the stem in our
species was really far simpler than in any other known Medullosa, as regards the
small number of the steles, and the absence of differentiation among them. This fact
agrees well with its greater antiquity. Possibly some botanists might regard this
difference as sufficient to justify generic separation. I do not think so myself, bearing
in mind the close agreement with other species of Medudlosa in leaf-characters, and in
the structure of the individual steles.
