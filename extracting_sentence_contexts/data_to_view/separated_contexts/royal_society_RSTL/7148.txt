J. V. Tnoxrsox, and confirmed by Professor EpwarD Forbrs, an
Antedon placed freely in water will swim with considerable activity, moving back foremost
by advancing five arms at a time, and then the alternate five ; in fact I do not know any
animal of which the movements are more graceful than those of the © feather-star ” (as. Professor EDwarD ForBEs appropriately called it). But I am quite satisfied from repeated
obseryations that these movements are not habitual to the animal, and are to be regarded
only in the light of a restless search after a new attachment, being kept up no longer
than is requisite for obtaining this.
