from the measured fuel and air consumptions using the method of Taylor, Leary & Diver
(1941) with the thermodynamic charts of Hottel, Williams & Satterfield (1949). Locally,
the ‘end-gas’ temperatures may be much higher than are indicated by these overall
figures, and, in fact, it seems probable that a cool flame must pass in the ‘end-gas’ of the
engine prior to the occurrence of knock in the case of those fuels which oxidize by a two-stage
mechanism. Both Jost (1946) and Miihlner (1942) have claimed to have seen a cool flame
in the combustion chamber of an engine motored under conditions of high-compression

dahl & Sargent (1948) have obtained evidence of two-stage ignition in motored engines.
In addition, there is a striking parallel between the engine peroxide curves (figure 9) and
