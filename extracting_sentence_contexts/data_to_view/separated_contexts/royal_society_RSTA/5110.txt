On this assumption, the calculated whirling
speeds in the above four experiments would be (see § 44, Experiments 110, 109) 3056,
3056, 2600 and 2600 respectively, and the percentage errors would be + 5, + 6°2, +7, and + 3°4, instead of + 4°4, + 8°7, + 4°7, and + 6°4,

46. The discrepancies between the observed and calculated results are accounted
for by the fact that the empirical formula—viz., N,N./,/(N,? + N,°)—upon which the
resulting calculated speeds are based, is not strictly accurate.
