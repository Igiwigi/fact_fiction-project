At 100 eV
the cross-section for the transition 1 \S' 3! P is 0-397a?, according to the measurements of the
former, and 0-497a?, according to those of the latter. In spite of the reasonable agreement
between them it is difficult to accept these values. Both would appear to be too high, since,
at the same energy, the contribution to the total cross-section from all discrete excitations is
estimated to be only about 0-37a?;+ indeed, the amount by which they are in excess would
seem to be considerable in view of the fact that the transition concerned is not the major
one, its cross-section being certainly several times smaller than that of 1 1S > 2'P. However,
it is worth attempting to extract as much information as possible from the results, as they form
the most comprehensive set that have been published; and even though the absolute scale
is untrustworthy the relative measurements on the different spectral lines should be approxi-
mately correct. To facilitate comparison with theory the excitation functions derived from the intensity
data were reduced in magnitude so as to bring about coincidence at moderate energies in
some particular case; the transition 1 1S'â€” 3'D was chosen as most suitable for this fitting.
