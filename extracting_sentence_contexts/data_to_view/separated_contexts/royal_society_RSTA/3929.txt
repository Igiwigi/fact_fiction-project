I look upon this series as a fairly homogeneous one, representing the degree
of resemblance between leaves on fully developed forest trees. The counting of the
veins on this series was undertaken by Miss C. D. Fawcerrr, B.Sc., and the
tabulating and numerical reduction by Dr. Lez. Both these processes involved
an immense amount of labour, in fact days and days of careful and fatiguing work. * The leaves were all gathered in the autumn, towards the fall.
