Quenching thus played a prominent
part in Farapayâ€™s experimental work. Light of these hardened specimens are found
in Groups E.1 and 2, thus pointing to these specimens of specially prepared form being
intended for heat treatment experiments. The hardness figures obtained on these
groups in fact seem to provide some further clue in this connection, although still not
a complete one. Thus it will be seen that it is the first four specimens only of each
group, E.1 and E.2, which are of over 600 hardness. These are the ones having three
nicks cut in them.
