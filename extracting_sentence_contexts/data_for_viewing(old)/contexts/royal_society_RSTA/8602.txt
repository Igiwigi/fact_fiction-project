quantity of air beyond a definite amount changes this to an equally pronounced blue
colour. ‘These changes correspond to a diminution in the strength of the Swan system,
and an increase in that of the CH bands when the Oxygen supply is increased. Now the
CH bands have admittedly a hydrocarbon origin, and if the Swan bands originate in
CO then the above observation admits of no satisfactory explanation. But if the Swan
bands arise from C,H, and the “ CH ” bands from a simple CH molecule, as the writer
believes, a natural explanation follows from the increased tendency to dissociation of
the former molecule in the hotter flame.

Turning now to the positive evidence in favour of a hydrocarbon origin for the Swan
bands, we have the experimental observation recorded in Section II. Only Pure
Hydrogen can be admitted by heating the Palladium regulator of such a tube. The fact
that the tubes used were furnished with side bulbs containing caustic potash and phos-
phorus pentoxide, respectively, and in some cases had been run for hundreds of hours,
eliminates any doubt as to their complete freedom from Oxygen. ‘The Swan bands were
therefore produced with intense brilliance in the presence of high pressure Argon, with
only Carbon and Hydrogen present, and the admission of Hydrogen was necessary,
otherwise the tube ‘cleaned up,’ leaving only the continuous and a little of the red
spectrum of Argon.

Warts (34) describes a number of experiments in which the possibility of Oxygen
contamination was probably eliminated. These consisted in examining the spectrum of
a minute spark under the surface of various carefully distilled hydrocarbons contained in
a fluorspar vessel, the vessel being evacuated. Heptane, hexane, octane, etc., all yielded
