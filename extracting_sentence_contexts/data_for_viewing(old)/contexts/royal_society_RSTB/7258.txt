at 97-5 and 100% r.x. with 38° C. Some larvae of this species even grew for a short time
at 38°C with 80 and 90% r.u. The fact that its larvae can withstand 97-5% R.H. for
a much longer time than 100% R.a. appears to me to indicate the direct adverse effect of
a high vapour pressure on the growth of the larvae.

Thus high humidities by themselves exert an adverse effect on the growth of rat-flea
larvae, but only with extremely high temperatures. This is possibly due to either of two
causes or perhaps both; first, the larvae may be susceptible to ‘water poisoning’; secondly,
the high vapour pressure may itself exercise a harmful effect on them. Water poisoning,
as explained by Buxton (1932, p. 298), is either due to the inability of larvae to lose water
by evaporation in the saturated air (which prevents regulation of temperature by evapora-
tion), or the larvae may be actually gaining water of metabolism faster than they can
dispose of it. The fact that intrinsic injurious effect of high humidities is only perceptible
in combination with high temperatures is in favour of the latter assumption.

XI. Errects OF TEMPERATURE ON THE GROWTH OF FLEA LARVAE AND PUPAE

I desired to find out the effect of a temperature on the resting larvae and pupae within
cocoons. I made use of cocoons spun at temperatures between 24 and 32° C and an opti-
mum humidity of 80 or 90%, which will be referred to hereafter for the sake of brevity as
‘the favourable temperature and humidity’. In order to determine the probable percent-
ages of pupation within the cocoons of different ages, as given in the tables, two methods
were adopted. First, some of larvae, after defaecation, from the same batch that spun
cocoons were put in a clean, empty tube, and the time required by them to form naked
pupae was taken into consideration for calculating the approximate percentage of pupation
