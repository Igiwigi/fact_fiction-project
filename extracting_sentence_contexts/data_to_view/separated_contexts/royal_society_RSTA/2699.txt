Treated in the same way a correction of {9 the possible must be added, making
N = 109791'1. It is clear that the value of N can easily be constant and
= 109790+5 within limits of error. In fact, with this value the errors in \ are
respectively about 0, 4, %, 4, ~ the possible ones. The results are given in the
following table :—
