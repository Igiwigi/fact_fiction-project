The great contrast
between the two months is self-evident. In July temperature is lower, and humidity
higher ; moreover, the difference between day and night is much reduced. If
humidity is referred to the saturation deficiency scale, it is seen that at night the
deficiency is just over 2mm and by day about 10 mm. _In fact, if we compare the
day in July with the night in April, it is seen that the mean saturation deficiency is
the same, and that the difference in temperature is slight. The mean values for the
24 hours are 25-04° C, relative humidity 79-3°%, saturation deficiency 4-9 mm. Conditions of temperature and humidity, during July, on the ground in the
thicket, Screen 4, have been plotted in a similar way, and the result is C.
