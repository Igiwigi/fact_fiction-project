BrecayerH and others, that
galvanism may be substituted for the neryous power, not only in the more
simple, but in the more complicated functions of that power. It not only
appears that galvanism is capable of exciting the muscles and causing an
evolution of caloric from arterial blood, but of forming the secreted fluids
from the blood, and supporting all those functions on which the structure of
the body depends. How far do the whole of these facts, whether relating to
the nature or functions of the neryous power, go in proving its identity with
galvanism ? On reviewing what has been said of the relations of the sensorial, nervous,
and muscular powers, the question naturally arises; If both the nervous and
muscular powers are thus independent of the sensorial power, and capable of
their functions after it is withdrawn, why do the more perfect animals for s0
$hort a time survyive the loss of the sensorial functions ? The cause is, that on the
removal of the sensorial power, respiration' ceases; because this function par-
takes of all the three powers, the sensorial, nervous, and muscular.
