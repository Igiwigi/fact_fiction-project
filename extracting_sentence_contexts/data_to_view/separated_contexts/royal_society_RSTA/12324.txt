PROFESSOR G. H. DARWIN ON TIDAL PREDICTION. 185

Let T, T’ be the times of true and fictitious transits, and let # be the moon’s R. A
Then if ¢ denotes the mean solar hour angle at time T,

t+h—-a=q7,
aud, dropping the suffix o to 7, at time He
t+h—l=qrz,

where q is an even integer at upper, and an odd one at: lower transit. Tf « be the value of the moon’s R, A. at time T’, then its value at T is
tata (I —T’); also the t+h of the first equation is equal to the t+ h of the
& second corrected by y (T — T’).

8 Hence the two equations may be written

S tth+y(T—T)—a-—a(T—T)= 47,
S t+h—l=qr.
