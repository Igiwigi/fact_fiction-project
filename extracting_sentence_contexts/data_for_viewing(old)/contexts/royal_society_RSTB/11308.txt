In other words, the generative model establishes an explicit
causal relationship between the assumed processes of socia’
learning defined by @ and observable population-level
patterns of cultural change.

We note that there are no restrictions on the type of gen-
erative model used. Models ranging from systems of partia’
differential equations to agent-based simulations have also
been used successfully; in fact, a number of the models men-
tioned in §1 could, with an appropriate choice of generative
model, feasibly be adapted for use within this inference
framework. As we want to generate frequency data at differ-
ent time points, we advocate the use of non-equilibrium
models, which can also account for temporal changes in
demographic properties of the cultural system (e.g. variations
in the total size of the population of cultural variants). This
modelling choice aims at reducing the risk of misinterpreting
non-equilibrium dynamics as evidence for the presence or
absence of particular social learning processes (see [65] for
a detailed discussion). For instance, the rejection of the
hypothesis of neutral cultural evolution, based on empirical
