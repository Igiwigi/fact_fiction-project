This gives the cast a more
Squat appearance. Although the vertex in Sinanthropus is higher the difference in the
two casts in this respect is not so much a matter of contrast in cortical structure, but is
due in great measure to the fact that the great longitudinal sinus in Sinanthropus has
grooved the bony parietes more deeply so that the cast of it forms a prominent feature
on the vertex. These facts are very clearly demonstrated in the examination of the
vertical sagittal contours of the lateral aspects of the right hemispheres, figs. 13 and 14.
