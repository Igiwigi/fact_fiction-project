making myself, in the first place, acquainted with the anomalies adduced by Professor Macxvs, that I have
been able to render my results secure. I may add that the communication aboye referred to was made to the
Academy of Berlin before my friend had an opportunity of examining my rock-salt plates. I do not think he
Fould now urge this objection against my mods of experiment.
