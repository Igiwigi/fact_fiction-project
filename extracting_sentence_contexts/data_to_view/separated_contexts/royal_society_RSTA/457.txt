Calculations would take too much space to give in detail,
but it can be shown that 1220° K > 7> 590° K, on the basis of reasonable physico-chemical

assumptions about the extent of decomposition required for self-heating, sufficient to lead
to detonation. (2) Experiments with skins of low melting metals on the anvil

The temperature of grit hot spots has an upper limit which is determined by the melting
point of the metal surface, on which the grit impinges. This fact makes it possible to control
the maximum temperature of grit hot spots by using metal foil to confine the explosive in
the Rotter impact test. The following table describes experiments on the grit sensitization
of cyclonite using 0-2 % of carborundum grit, the explosive being confined between disks
of aluminium or of tinfoil 0-001 in. thick.
