no somites disappear, and where the total number of segments included in the head
is 4.

In the remaining vertebrates, one or two, but never more, of the metotic somites
disappear. In Selachians, the results of several workers (BALFouR, 1876, vAN WIJHE,
1882, Goopricu, 1918, pe Brrr, 1922) have established that at a given moment the
series of prootic and metotic somites is uninterrupted and complete, as in Cyclostomes,
but that two somites, the 4th and 5th of the whole series, disappear. The total number
of segments included in the head varies from 7 or 8 in Scyllium (Goopricu, 1918),
to 9 in Squalus (pe Brmr, 1922), or 10 in Spinax (Braus, 1899).

Among vertebrates above Selachians, the problem is rendered more difficult by
the fact that the series of prootic and metotic somites are interrupted, more or less.
Nevertheless, it would seem that the total number of segments included in the head
in Amia and Lepidosteus is 10 (ScHREINER, 1902), in Salmo 6 (Harrison, 1895),
while the results concerning Dipnoi are too conflicting to enable definite conclusions
to be drawn.

In Amphibia, the Urodeles, represented by the axolotl, have been subjected to
detailed study by Goopricu (1911) who finds the total number of segments included
in the skull to be 6. In Anura (represented by Alytes), the number is 5 (van SETERs,
1922).

Turning now to Amniota the constitution of the metotic region of the mammalian
head has recently been studied by BurcHEr (1929), who describes three occipital
