occupied in part by transparent connective-tiszue, From the circle of tentacles a cylin-
drical cavity, showing twenty-two plications on its wall, leads to the stomach. The
stomach is globular, with a long conical mouth or proboscis projecting up in the centre
of the last described cavity. A similar proboscis is deseribed by Sans as existing in
Allopora oculing. The stomach seems to have no outlet below; but it is of course diffi-
cult to be certain of the fact in 80 small and yielding a structure. A series of bundles
of fibres, each bundle continuous with one of the plications of the cavity above, is
attached to the periphery of the stomach. There are no mesenteries, at least none
80 distinct]y differentiated histologically that they can be recognized by methods which
show them plainly in /eliopora and Pocillopora. Fine transyerse sections of polyps
stained with carmine were obtained; they showed only the open meshwork of tissue
around the stomach, but no definite mesenteries. In the part of the meshwork sur-
rounding the cavity leading from the tentacular circle to the stomach, and just below
the level of the tentacles, lie the generative organs. All the individuals of the only
stock of Stylaster examined were males; hence these corals appear to be dicecious.
Very large globular sacs crammed with spermatic cells, containing some of them vesicles
of evolution, and others masses of spermatozoa spirally wound, were found in the
position above described, attached to parts of the meshwork, and disposed sometimes
