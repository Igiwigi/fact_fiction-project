— the difference, for the reconstructions with sharp and smooth filters, is significant in
the case of cross sections which have large range of density values with non-uniform :
distribution. The RMSE is observed to be approximately 0.23 for two- and three-phase a
simulation cases. Sharp filters are recommended for such flow conditions; 3

— second-level reconstructions, in the case of IITK data and similar simulated data, show 8
slightly larger density values in comparison with first-level density values; :

— air fractions, in second-level cases, are relatively smaller for both two- and three-phase aa)
cases; and Dw

— inferences drawn from the second-level KT-1 approach are consistent with the first-level :
KT-1 approach in cases of simulated data. This fact gives confidence that second-level a
analysis with real-world data has good reliability. :8

Appendix A

An experiment was performed, at the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz University Hannover, Germany,
to analyse the phase distribution in a three-phase bubble column and this experiment was done
and reported by Behling [28]. Some salient features of the data collection process and related
