the 5th nerve in Lacerta, and its orbito-sphenoid, a rudiment of that of the Lizard, behind the forks.


DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL IN THE LACERTITIA. 607

From the pituitary fos8a to the end of the snout, the coalesced trabeculze are
marked as the thick, rounded, lower edge of the orbito-nasal septum.

In front of the ethmo-presphenoidal fenestra (c,/,#.), this wall is thickened, rises
higher, and then gradually lowers forwards ; at its highest part it is fused with the
nasal roof (fig. 7).

The zudden rise of the septum is due to the fact that there is an olfactory recess, as
in © Mammals,” where the firs} pair of nerves are given off to the nasal mucous
membrane (fig. 7, I) ; there is, however, no erifriform plate, but merely a single aperture
on each side of the septum.

A little further out, under the floor of this recess, the orbito-nasal nerves (V?) are
seen to pass on their way to the front of the snout.

The winged top of the septum—the wings are the nasal roofs—ends in front of the
basal part, which retires a little, and is emarginate in the front (Plate 43, figs. 1, 2, 8.n.);
the thickening above is where the roofs have been cut away ; the notch below is caused
by the bend of the trabeculz. ;
