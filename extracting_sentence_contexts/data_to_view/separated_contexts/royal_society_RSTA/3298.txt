In the present experiments with lime, although there were considerable variations in
the value of A calculated from the negative leaks at different temperatures, there was
no sign of a progressive increase with increasing temperature. From WEHNELT’s work on the discharge of negative ions from glowing lime and
other metallic oxides, RicHarpson has drawn the conclusion that the corpuscles
proceed not from the glowing oxide, but from the platinum, and that the oxide
merely has the effect of lessening the amount of energy required to set them free. This conclusion is arrived at from the fact that the number of corpuscles per cubic
centimetre calculated from the value of the constant A, as found from WEHNELT’s
numbers, is about the same as for platinum. The value of A for lime obtained in the
present experiments is much greater than the value obtained for platinum, the former
being 6°42x10" and the latter 1°55x10°. Other experiments with lime-covered
cathodes gave values ranging from A = 1:23x 10" to A = 7°12x 10", the value given
by the observations recorded in Table VI., taken after the cathode had been heated
for a long time to a high temperature.
