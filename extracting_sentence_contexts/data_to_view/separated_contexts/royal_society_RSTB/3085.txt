The name appears to be associated in the popular mind with purple rather
than the violet of the spectrum. One often hears the remark, “ Real violet has more
red in it.” In point of fact, the flowers and paints and dyes called “violet”
invariably give a spectrum containing red rays. But this colour, whatever be the
name given to it, is recognised by the majority as. one of the principal colours of the
spectrum.
