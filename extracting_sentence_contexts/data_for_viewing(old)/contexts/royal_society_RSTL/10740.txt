same way, and with various amounts of M.C., but the results were of the same nature,
though much less in amount, as with the knitting-needle. It may be added that both
the knitting-needle and the wire were made s0 hard that they were quite brittle, and
with both there was a permanent as well as a temporary increase of resistance
produced by the magnetization.

AN ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE ALTERATION OF ELECTRICAL
RESISTANCE PRODUCED BY ANY MAGNETIZING FORCE, THE FORCE ITSELF, AND
THE MAGNETISM INDUCED BY THE FORCE.

On consulting the fourth, fifth, and 8ixth columns of Table XXVI., it will be
obseryed that the increase of resistance ensuing from magnetization depends not only
upon the magnetism induced, but also upon the magnetizing force itself; and, in fact,
we may say that if y denotes the increase of resistance, whilst « and Þ represent the
magnetizing forces and the magnetism induced respectively, y=a.«+b.Þ, where a, b
are two constants. In the case of the nickel wire, « and Þ were measured in terms of
the divisions of the scale of the tangent galyanometer, and of the scale of the THoMs0N's
reflecting galvanometer respectively ; whilst a and b were calculated from the observa-
tious made with a=279 and a=86, The agreement between the observed and
calculated values of y is good, and certainly quite equal to that between the different
obgervations made with the same values of «. Columns 4 and 5 &how clearly that the
alteration of resistance depends in this cage more on the value of the magnetizing force

than on the magnetism induced, and from the fact that 7 is nearly constant throughout,
