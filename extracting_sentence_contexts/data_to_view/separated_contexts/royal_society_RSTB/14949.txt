For example, people tend to assume that others will share traits and preferences with
their friends [101,102]. Such assumptions shape subsequent behaviour—e.g. people are less likely to trust those who are known
to have untrustworthy friends, even when they consistently show themselves to be trustworthy [101]. Similarly, people appear
to be aware of the fact that those who occupy central positions in their social networks are particularly likely to behave in ways
that are reflective of community norms, as they preferentially look to such individuals to efficiently ascertain social norms [103]. In addition to using social network knowledge to guide inferences about others, people can also apply such knowledge to guide
effective information-sharing [86], manage their own reputations (e.g. showing more positive attributes when being observed
by central others [104]), and manipulate their social environment, such as by participating in defensive behaviours aimed at
protecting one’s own friendships, avoiding replacement by others, and maintaining one’s social standing (e.g. [105,106]).


(c) How do people build mental representations of their social networks? Clearly, people are very attuned to information about others’ locations in their social networks and use such knowledge in many
aspects of everyday life.
