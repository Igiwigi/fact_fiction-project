suitable interpolation in the middle. A standard approach to this interpolation would be to


take w(r,0) = Oy(r) + f(Nky 1 sin(k0) + g(")ky 1 sin(k2@), where k;,kz are the optimal choices at r1
and rz, respectively, and f =1,g=0 near r; while f =0,g=1 near rz. Recall that k,,kz wh},
while, by our choice of 7; and 12, |k; — k2| ~~ h-‘/2. To make the second term in the ‘error’ Rj,
(see (3.7)) negligible one needs to choose —dgug to be approximately the deviation of (dw)? /2r
from its average. Computing (d9w)* =f?(r) sin2(k10) + 97(r) sin?(k20) + 2f (g(r) sin(ki9) sin(k29),
we see that the first two terms are of order 1 with a period of order h (as ky, ky ~ h-!), and therefore
their contribution to ug (i.e. after integrating once in @) will be of order h. However, the remaining
term is problematic. Indeed, it can be written as f(r)g(r)[— cos((k1 + k2)@) + cos((k; — k2)@)]. The
(ky +kz) term is not harmful by the same argument as above, however the (k; — kz) term is
problematic. In fact, it provides a term of order h'/? in the expression for ug; this occurs because
(ky — ko) ~ h7"/2 whereas ky, kz and ky + ky are all of order h~!. Moreover, as w changes with r on
length scale h'/2, so should ug. Thus, one expects 0,Ug ~ 1. This makes the third term in R;, (the
cross term) of order 1—much too large.

In summary: we need a better answer for what it should mean to ‘change from one k to
the next’.

Second pass. To get started, we need some notation. We will consider an ansatz (u, wv) of the form
uy(r, 9) = vn(7) + Uosc(r,A) and w(r,0) = Wy (r) + Wosc(r,0), where for each ré (0,19) we require
Jor Uosc(I, +) = Jor Wosc(t, :) = 0. Then using (3.5), we get that

E(u, @) — Fy (vp, @n)
