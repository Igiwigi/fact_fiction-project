build up savings to buffer potential future losses, and/or a ‘micro’ physical adaptation decision
that reduces future losses from climate change (though not limiting climate change itself). We
then consider how the welfare of this agent is changed through improved understanding of the
likely evolution of climate change.

Our work relates to two strands of the preceding literature. In the first, the option value of
arriving information has been analysed following a framework long since established [21-23].

Here the essential problem is that an agent must make a decision today knowing that a better
signal will arrive in the future. In this context the agent need not make an investment decision
now, but can wait and see how uncertainty is resolved. The problem then becomes one of
optimal timing of investment accounting for the fact that both investment (e.g. adaptation)
