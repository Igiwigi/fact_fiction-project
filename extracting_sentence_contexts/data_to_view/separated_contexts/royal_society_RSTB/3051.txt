account for the concentration of the chalazal nuclei, and it is quite possible that their
somewhat smaller size may be associated with the same fact. As in Gnetum, there
is a fundamental difference in the future behaviour of the nuclei of the two ends of
the prothallus with which it is natural to connect the differences seen at this early
stage ; but it must be regarded as possible that these are of physiological signifi-
cance only. Very little starch is present in the cytoplasm of the embryo-sac
or in the cells of the nucellus.
