It was then assumed that the strain was becoming degenerate, and a number of
fertile wild females were caught, from which arose broods 37-42. Among these
broods a large number of pairings were made, while there were also matings into
which individuals from broods 33-36 entered, and others with insects reared from
captured larvee. In all, 34 pairings were recorded, and of these only 15 were fertile,
so that the percentage of sterile matings exceeded 50 per cent., in spite of the fact
that the individuals concerned were unrelated. Of the 15 fertile matings, 4 were discarded and the remainder produced broods 43-53 ;
13 matings were made in this, the F, generation, in captivity,* and all were fertile, a
very marked contrast to the preceding generation. In the F; generation, 17 matings
were made, of which 2 were sterile, 1 pair escaped, and the remainder were fertile,
giving broods 67-78.7
