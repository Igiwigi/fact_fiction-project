Such an achievement as this is beyond all eclipse precedent,
and was only rendered possible by the help of a large staff of highly trained men. Of
the 150 engaged in the operations only three originally formed the expedition. It is, therefore, quite inappropriate that I, on the part of the expedition, should
here tender thanks to Captain Barren, the officers and men of H.M.S. “ Melpomene ”
for their assistance, for as matters turned out we assisted them; but we are anxious
to place on record the kindness we received from them both afloat and ashore, and
since the great success of the recent observations is due almost entirely to Captain
CutsHotm-Barren and the ship’s company of the “ Melpomene,” I trust that the
President and Council of the Royal Society may be pleased to communicate this fact

to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. 3. Among those to whom thanks are specially due are the following, representing the
Indian Government :—

E. Gites, Esq., Director of Public Instruction, in charge of arrangements made by
Bombay Government.
