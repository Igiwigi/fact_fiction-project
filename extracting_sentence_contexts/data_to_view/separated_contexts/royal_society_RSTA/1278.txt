Part Il.â€”Tue Accuracy or tHe Exvectrican Tank. (13) The position of the stagnation point for.an inviscid flow around the aerofoil has
been determined indirectly in the electrical tank,} in view of the fact that a direct deter-
mination was not possible. To establish the value of this work (given in Part III) an
investigation was undertaken to determine, firstly, how closely the flow mapped out in
the electrical tank resembled the flow of an inviscid fluid, especially in the region of the
stagnation point, and, secondly, whether it was possible to estimate from the flow pattern
the pressure distribution around the surface. This investigation will now be described.
