S There is no very striking difference between the two plots in the relative proportion
s ff the different species making up the gramineous herbage ; but whilsb with the potass
£ there was'a very marked tendeney to form stem and seed, without it there was much
DL less of this character, the herbage being more leafy, less dense, and having much less
Ss tendency to mature, some of it, indeed, appearing to dry up from exhaustion rather
£ than to ripen.
© Of leguminous herbage, there was a decline of both Trifolium repens and Trifolium
pratense in the later years, both with and without the potass ; but the reduction
was greater without than with it. Of the deep-rooting and hardy Lotus corniculatus
there was the more without the potass. But of the comparatively surface-rooting
Lathyrus pratensis there was very much less without the potass. In fact, it was to the
greatly increased growth of this with the potass, and to the greatly reduced growth of
it without it, that the great difference in the amount of total leguminous herbage on
the two plots was chiefly due.

Among the miscellaneous 8pecies those of Ranuncutus thrived rather more without
the potass, as als did Pimpinella sazifraga, Centauria nigra, and Plantago lan-
ceolata,; and in a greater degree Achille millefolium. Conopodium denudatum was
