The thin outer rim of
the ereseantic process does not recaive the insertion of any of these fibres, as the
latter simply cross its ventral surface on their way to the thickened imner rim,
which is consequently the only portion of the trips that can be seen imbedded in
the dorsal wall of the bladder after the removal of the tunica internw (fig. 69,
Aire.) The unusual length of the crescentic process seems to be associated with
“the relatively large size of the anterior chamber, and also with the fact that
28 the process not only receives the insertion of the fibres derived from the antero-
2 Jateral and lateral walls of the anterior chamber, but also from the outer wall of
Athe contiguous lateral compartment, The absence of any marked curvature in
S the process may also have conditioned its somewhat exceptional length. At the
5 S junction of its anterior and crescentic processes a thin, flexible, and highly elastic,
Perlangular lamina of bone is given off from the dorsal surface of the tripus and
Sat right angles to it (fig. 63, tr.ar.), The surfaces of the lamina look almost directly
@ backwards and forwards respectively, and the inner margin, from its junction with
3 the body of the tripus to the pointed dorsal extemity of the lumina, is confluent with
5 the neural areh of the complex yertebra along a line which is slightly oblique from
8 3 below upwards and forwards. This lamina undoubtedly represents the articular process
@ of other Siluroids, from which, however, it differs in beme directly continuous with the
g 2 neural arch instead of articulating with the lateral surface of the centrum at the bottom
3 ofa deep pit-like socket.
