However, this constraint can be lifted for the exact quantum study, as, in fact, the metric tensor
is neither constant nor diagonal. The constrained metric tensor along the Tors coordinate (figure 7)
shows that, as a function of the Tors coordinate, the variation amplitude of each component is
relatively small. Furthermore, all components are symmetric with respect to the trans geometry
(Tors = 180°), except GBLATors and GBLAHOOP, which are antisymmetric (see the right panel of
figure 7).

In the present study, two metric tensors are compared: the constrained metric tensor, ce
(figure 7), and the metric tensor obtained directly from the exact contravariant components of
the metric tensor, ct) (figure 8). The comparison shows, as expected, that ot), shows fewer
oscillations than ct (see also ref. [26]), although the amplitude of GHOOP,HOOP and GTors,Tors are
larger for rele than for ce. From a computational point of view, the numerical calculation of
