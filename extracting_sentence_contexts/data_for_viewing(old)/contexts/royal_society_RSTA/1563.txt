(a) Similarities and differences of stochastic resonance in triple and double cavities

In the past decade, SR in confined cavities has been studied and many interesting results have
been presented. However, most studies fix the confinements as structures with two channel units,
only pay attention to influences of boundary properties, noise properties and particle shapes, and
rarely extend the results to cavities with more or less units except for a brief analysis in [43]. In
fact, n versus D in these cavities also shows an interesting trend. Therefore, in this part, a double
cavity +w(x) = (0.3x4 — 0.6x2 — 0.06) with the same scale as the triple cavity (2.2) for a given set
of a2, a4 and ag is constructed, as shown in figure 1. 7 in both cavities is calculated to indicate the
similarities and differences of their SR.

Figure 3 depicts relations between 7 and noise intensity D for different values of G, Fo and
Q in the triple and double cavities. We find that, firstly, for all the results in figure 3, under
the same condition, 7 for the triple cavity is much larger than that for the double cavity. This
can be understood by virtue of the jumping event occurring in the two cavities (see electronic
supplementary material, figures S1-S4). For the same moderate D (such as D = 0.1 in electronic
supplementary material, figures S2-S3), particles in both cavities keep a regular jump between
different units. However, in the double cavity, one particle jumps to the widest position (near :
+1, as shown in figure 1) of a unit and moves in a small range left and right. After a period of 1
