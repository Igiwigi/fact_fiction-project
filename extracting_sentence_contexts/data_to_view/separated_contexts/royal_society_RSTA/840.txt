The other essential component of international
justice, as indicated earlier, is financial and technological transfers that enable the reduction of
emissions elsewhere to the extent of each nationâ€™s remaining unfulfilled responsibility. If such
transfers are targeted to replace fossil fuel with non-carbon energy affordable by and accessible to
the poor, they will mitigate in a manner that enhances, even if it is not fully adequate to, poverty
alleviation. When we turn from principle to fact, the picture is if anything even clearer. The absence of
any necessary conflict between ambitious mitigation and poverty alleviation could be shown at
a time, such as 2009 when Chakravarty et al. did their illustrative calculations, at which it was
tacitly assumed that the cheapest sources of energy were fossil fuels, so that any reduction in
energy poverty by the poorest would have to mean increased carbon emissions by them. They
would be able to afford only carbon energy, it was assumed, so any alleviation of their poverty
would necessarily require additional carbon emissions.
