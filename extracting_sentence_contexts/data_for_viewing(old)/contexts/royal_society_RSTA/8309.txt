The heights of the waves given in the above table have been taken from KriimMMet’s
‘Handbuch der Ozeanographie,’ vol. 2, p. 73, and they agree with those given by
equation (9).

The calculated values given in the above table give the amplitudes of the microseisms
produced at the bottom of the sea by the water waves. When travelling over an un-
disturbed region the amplitudes will undergo diminution with distance, and conse-
quently the amplitudes recorded at an observing station will be of much smaller order
than those given in the above table, according to its distance from the disturbed region.
The fact that the amplitude of the microseisms recorded in the Colaba Observatory on
November 12, 1927, became 8 microns, when a storm was crossing coast between Bombay
and Ratnagiri some 30 miles south of Bombay, certainly testifies to the correctness of
the figures given in the above table for the disturbed region. The law of diminution of
amplitude during the travel of these microseisms over an otherwise undisturbed region
can be taken, for all practical purposes, to be as given in fig. 5.

The observed amplitudes of microseisms at Bombay in the different months of the
year are given in the following table :—
