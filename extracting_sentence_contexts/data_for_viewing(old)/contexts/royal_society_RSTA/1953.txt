of numerical stability (local Mach number of Ma~ 1.9), which roughly corresponds to the
convergence limit of the Newton-Raphson solver (figure 4). Qualitatively speaking, the influence
of Ma seems to be correctly reproduced by our model. More precisely, for the present values of Ma
and Re, all flows are steady, a bow shock forms at a distance L; from the sphere, and its curvature
increases with the Mach number. In addition, the shock stand-off distance L; decreases when Ma
increases, as observed by Nagata et al. [90]. The latter quantity is studied in more detail in figure 11
where it is compared against a large set of data based on experiments (Sugimoto ef al. compiled
by Hida [91] and Heberle et al. [92]), models [93] and numerical simulations [90]. Despite a slight
overestimation, the right tendency is obtained with the present method. This is very promising
considering the fact that a relatively coarse mesh and the very simple halfway bounce back rule
were used.

5. Implementation and efficiency

Common LB schemes are characterized by a separation between a local collision step, which
characterizes the physical properties of the model, and a generic, non-local streaming step.
The collision step is usually carried out by manipulating the component of the populations that


deviates from equilibrium, through a linear term, as in the straightforward BGK model [49], or
a more general expression, as in multiple-relaxation-time approaches [4]. A crucial importance
is therefore attributed to the explicit calculation of the equilibrium term, as a function of the
