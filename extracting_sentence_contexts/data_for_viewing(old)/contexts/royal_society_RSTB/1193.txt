sented in the excitable cortical areas of each hemisphere. The question, therefore,
narrows itself down to that as to whether the highest, 7.e., purposive, movements of
the limbs of both sides of the body are represented in the cortex of one and the same
hemisphere. Theoretically, we are compelled to admit (following the teaching of
Hvextiwes Jackson) from the evolutionary standpoint such bilateral representation
of the limbs. The important point for experiment to decide, however, is whether such
bilateral cortical representation exists in more highly differentiated animals to a suffi-
cient extent to cause movements. The opinion of most authors is evidently that it
does so exist. We feel, however, very strongly that the methods hitherto adopted by
hese authors are not definitive, and do not establish the positions claimed. We are led
% this conclusion from the consideration of certain facts now to be discussed which have
Bme under our notice in the present research, as well as of others previously dis-
dvered, the importance of which has of late become more recognised. By welding
fhe fresh information, which the use of our method has given, to the old, we hope to
Bplp forward the solution of this apparently simple but very complex subject.

§ (1.) Narcosis.—As is seen from the foregoing retrospect, some authors have employed
BArcosis to a greater or less degree. The statement that a narcotised cortex could in
any way “completely discharge” is always, of course, open to objection, and hence
pservations in animals narcotised to unconsciousness have been held by some to be
®complete. The answer to this objection, however, is simple and, we believe,
sufficient ; it is included in that of the next paragraph, in which “complete discharge”
g the efferent apparatus of the cortex is seen to be effected even in unconsciousness.
