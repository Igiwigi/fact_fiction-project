The occurrence of chromosome constrictions constant in position in the univalent
elements which form the bivalent chromosomes suggests the possibility of tracing the
orientation of paternal and maternal chromosomes which possess such constrictions
or appendages as they come out of the general spireme complex. In plants, where the
weight of evidence is in favour of the origin of the bivalents by an end-to-end arrangement
of the univalents, a differentiation within the chromosome would bring out more clearly


232 NESTA FERGUSON: THE ALOINA. the fact that each homologous pair must lie in such a position that the ends bearing like
“genes”? are together. If, in the paternal chromosome, the characters A, B, 0, D, E
are arranged in that order—the homologous maternal chromosome bearing the characters
A’, B’, CO’, D’, E’—then the arrangement of these on the spireme which gives rise to the
bivalents must be E, D, C, B, A, A’, B’, C’, D’, E’ or A, B, C, D, E, Ei’, D’, C’, B’, A’,
the next pair of chromosomes being similarly adjusted. If a “ telosynapsis ” interpre-
tation of the method of evolution of the bivalent chromosome in plants is correct, and
if “ crossing over ’’ of factors occurs in any such plants, then it would appear that the
above arrangement must hold (‘‘telosynapsis”’ and “crossing over” shown for Lathyrus.
