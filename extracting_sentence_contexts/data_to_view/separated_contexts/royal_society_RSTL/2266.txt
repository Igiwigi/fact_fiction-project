18 be examined and compared with fig. 19, the latter may be admitted as repre-
senting the former in its simplest condition ; for the cups 1, ii, and iii of the former,
with their contents, are represented by the cells i, ii, and iii of the latter, and the
metal plates Z and P of the former by the similar plates represented Z and P in the
latter. The only difference, in fact, between the apparatus, fig. 18, and the trough
represented fig. 19, is that twice the quantity of surface of contact between the metal
and acid is allowed in the first to what would occur in the second.

nected metallically through the galvanometer g, then the whole represents a battery
consisting of two pairs of zinc and platina plates urging a current forward, which has,
however, to decompose water unassisted by any direct chemical affinity before it can
be transmitted across the cell iii, and therefore before it can circulate.
