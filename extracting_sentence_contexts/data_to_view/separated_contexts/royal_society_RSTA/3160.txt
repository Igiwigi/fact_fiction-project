From this equation & may be calculated if an approximate value of it is known and
is substituted in the hyperbolic functions which involve it. In the experiments to be
described these functions have values not differing greatly from unity. A sufficiently
close approximation to the value of k for this substitution may, in fact, be found by

The effect of temperature on the dimensions of the rods is neglected, as it does
not appear likely to influence the value of the conductivity found by so much as
1 part in 300.
