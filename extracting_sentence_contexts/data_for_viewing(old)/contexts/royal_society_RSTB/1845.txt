is divided, I propose to leave the Hydropterideze for the present on one side, and
discuss first the sub-class of homosporous Ferns.

In a previous paper (‘Annals of Botany,’ vol. 5, p. 109), I have advanced what
appear to me to be good reasons for the opinion that the Eusporangiate Ferns represent
a more primitive type than the Leptosporangiate. Accordingly, I propose first to
take into our detailed consideration the sori of the Marattiaceze, and it is to them
that the present Memoir will be devoted.

I shall assume that those who are interested in this subject will have already made
themselves acquainted with the general theoretical position which has been disclosed
in the two earlier Memoirs of this series, and I shall not, therefore, recapitulate my
views here. But in stating in detail the facts relating to the Marattiaceous sorus, I
shall endeavour so to state them as to avoid theory, and reserve the theoretical
treatment for separate sections of the text, apart from those which are descriptive.

Dana.

Though various writers have contributed to our knowledge of the development of
the sori in other genera of the Marattiacese, Danea has been left almost untouched :
doubtless, this is mainly due to the difficulty of securing suitable material ; but it is
