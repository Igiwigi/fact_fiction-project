distribution and general form they are quite indistinguishable. What has been said of dye-
positive cells therefore applies without qualification to Langerhans’ cells. Langerhans’
cells are invariably unpigmented; they are present in all epidermal epithelia, whether
pigmented or not, in which melanocytes may also appear; they are absent from the tongue
of the guinea-pig, the neck of hair follicles, and (Redslob 1922) the cornea.* Their dis-

* They are, however, present, together with melanocytes, in the pigmented conjunctival epithelium that
forms a ring round the cornea, and Redslob expressed the view that the Langerhans cells were degeneration
products of melanocytes. The corneal epithelium, it should be added, may become pigmented as a con-
sequence of injury. If this pigmentation were due to the migration of melanocytes between corneal stroma
and epithelium, it would be most interesting to determine whether Langerhans’ cells made their appearance

in the latter; but in fact it is due to the mass migration or ‘slide’ of the limbal conjunctiva as a whole over
the corneal surface (Maumenee & Scholtz 1948).

tribution therefore corresponds exactly with that of the dye-positive cells of superficial
strata.

At still more superficial epidermal strata than those figured in figures 18, 19, plate 10,
the gold-impregnated cells are found to be smaller and to become rather more densely
impregnated ; processes are lost or are represented only by thin spines, and it is sometimes
difficult to distinguish cytoplasm at all (figures 20, 21, plate 11). The occurrence of inter-
