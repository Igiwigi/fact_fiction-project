Over
these timescales, geomorphic uplift can provide a record of magma injection. These geomorphic
observations complement the shorter duration geodetic observations spanning years-decades,
but are limited to areas where geomorphic features are created (e.g. shorelines, river and coastal
terraces) and preserved. In fact, uplift of tens to hundreds of metres has been recorded in
some volcanic areas over the past centuries to millennia and have been related to magmatic
unrest without eruption (e.g. Laguna del Maule, Chile; loto (Iwo Jima), Japan; Socorro, New
Mexico) [42-44]. There is at least one example of 20m of uplift being related to non-magmatic
unrest in the Gulf of Naples [45].
