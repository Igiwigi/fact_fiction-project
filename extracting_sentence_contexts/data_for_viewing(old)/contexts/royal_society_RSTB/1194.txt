'= IL. Excitation of Cortex.—Effect in Cord after previous Hemisection.

26 The next step was to ascertain the effect of a previously performed hemisection of
“the cord between the encephalon and the observed region, the experiment being made
“with the view of eliminating any presumably crossed discharge from the cortex
Sspposite to that excited.
3 The following experiment was made : In a Cat (225) the right half of the cord was
Alivided under antiseptic precautions at the level of the lower border of the 9th dorsal
Srertebra. In this case there was well-marked motor paralysis in the right hind limb
with rigidity, and diminution of perception of sensory stimulation of the same limb.
she right knee jerk was exaggerated. When partly etherised the right hind limb
became flaccid and the left somewhat rigid, the knee jerk then on the right side was
“greatly exaggerated and marked clonus present. These facts were noted just before
“ghe experiment now to be described. Eighty-four days later the cord was exposed
= divided below the lesion, and the central end of the whole cord connected with
he galvanometer electrodes. (See fig. 9.) The two cortices were then exposed and
excited with an intensity of stimulus indicated by coil 8000 for 5 seconds.

The following definite results were obtained :—

In the first place excitation of each hemisphere evidently produced unilateral
epileptic fits. The effect in the descending (lower limb) fibres of the cord was as
follows, it being remembered that the right half of the spinal cord had been divided.
Excitation of the right cortex which produced unilateral fits on the left side of the
body, gave a variation of 82 degrees in the galvanometer, whereas excitation of the
