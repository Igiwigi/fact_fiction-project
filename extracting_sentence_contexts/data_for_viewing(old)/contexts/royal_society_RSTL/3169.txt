PtrpeCT as is the manufacture of glass for all ordinary purposes, and
extensive the scale upon which its production is carried on, yet there is scarcely
any artificial substance in which it is s0 difficult to unite what is required to
satisfy the wants of science. Its general transparency, hardness, unchangeable
nature,andyaried refractiveand dispersive powers, render glass a most important
agent in the hands of the philosopher engaged in investigating the nature and
properties of light ; but when he desires to apply it, according to the laws he
has discovered, in the construction of perfect instruments, and especially of the
achromatic telescope, it is found liable to certain imperfections, not essentially
existing, but almost always involved during its preparation, and fatal to its use.
These are 80 important and s0 difficult to ayoid, that science is frequently
stopped in her progress by them ; a fact fully proved by the cireumstance that,
Mr. Dorxoxp, one of our first opticians, has not been able to obtain a disc of
flint glass four inches and a half in diameter, fit for a teJescope, within the last
five years, or a similar disc of five inches in diameter within the last ten years.

It must be well known to the scientific world, that these difficulties have in-
duced some persons to labour hard and earnestly for years together, in hopes of
surmounting them. GuiNnaxD was one of these : his means were small, but he
deserves the more honour for his perseverance and his success. He com-
mencet the inyestigation about the year 1784, and died engaged in it in the
