Thus, approximately,
W = ‘64 (H, — 6°2)'B,.

This expression would naturally fail to represent facts when H, < 6°2.

The value of W for zero stress, recorded in § 54, is given closely over the whole
range by W = °57H',B, —1800.

§ 67. We now take the experiments on the effect of tension upon a soft iron wire
described in § 52. The curves connecting W with B, are shown in fig. 17 along with
the W — B, curve for zero stress. Each of the curves, which shew the effects of stress,
is again made up of a straight part and a hook, the straight parts radiating from the
point B, = —600, W = —9590, For the slope of the lines we have
