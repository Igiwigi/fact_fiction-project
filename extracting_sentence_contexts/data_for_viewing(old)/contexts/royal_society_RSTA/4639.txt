the number of fatalities, as people believed that they did not have to evacuate immediately, even
though these maps indicated the uncertainty of estimations based on past events and state-of-the-
art computer simulations.


3. Response to the 2011 event

(a) Tsunami warning

The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), which is responsible for issuing tsunami warnings/
advisories and for estimating tsunami height, employed a new system in 1999 [18] and updated
it using Earthquake Early Warnings (EEWs) in 2006 [19]. Japan believed that JMA’s tsunami
warning system was using the most advanced technology in the world. In fact, its tsunami
forecasting technologies and numerical models were exported to many foreign countries that
needed support, such as Indonesia, Thailand, Mexico and Peru. JMA prepared a pre-conducted
tsunami propagation simulation database for over 100000 earthquake scenarios around Japan.
The contents of the warning were classified into three categories, according to the estimation of :
tsunami height: ‘Major tsunami’ (estimated more than 3m), ‘Tsunami’ (estimated 1 or 2m) and a
‘Advisory’ (0.5m or less). 13

When the 2011 event occurred at 14.46 JST on 11 March, JMA’s initial estimate of the magnitude [3
(Mjma) was 7.9, which is a combination of the magnitude based on ground displacement :
for relatively large earthquakes and the magnitude based on ground velocity for relatively Da
small earthquakes [20]. Based on the promptly estimated magnitude 7.9, 3 min after the quake Dw
(14.49 JST), JMA issued a Major tsunami warning to the coasts of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima :
