Only for the lowest ¢ value was a decrease in excitability
seen to clearly increase propensity for re-entry, as this proportion of obstacles was no longer
guaranteed to generate the required block through structural effects. On the other hand, block
susceptibility does directly inform at which point re-entries will fail to develop due to a complete
inability to propagate through the heterogeneous tissue. As such, high amounts of hyperklaemia,
in fact, protect against re-entries situated in regions of heavily damaged tissue. There are also several limitations to our study, that we address here in detail. Firstly, concerns
of computational feasibility allowed us to only simulate a small number of realizations for each


combination of ischaemia parameters and obstacle proportion ¢.
