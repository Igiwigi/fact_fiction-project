sort of greenish gray tint, which belongs neither to that nor to any other part of the
true spectrum. In experiments on absorption, if instead of receiving the light
directly into the eye it be found convenient to form a pure spectrum on a Screen of

light, the scattered light forming any part of the spectrum cannot be cut off or
weakened without at the same time cutting off or weakening the dispersed light coming
from the same part of the screen. But if the absorbing medium be held in front of
the eye, its effect on the spectrum will s0metimes be very sensibly different from what
it would be were the screen to send back none but scattered light.

It is true that the quantity of light dispersed by white paper is.s0 small that this
substance may very well continue to be used as a screen, without any danger of the
observer's being deceived, if only he be aware of the fact of dispersion, s0 as to be on
his guard. Still, it is not unreasonable to seek for a substitute for paper, which may
be free from the same objection.

bited no perceptible sensibility, even when examined by a linear spectrum. However,
the translucency of the substance gave the spectrum a blurred appearance, and the
fixed lines were not shown 80 well as on paper.
