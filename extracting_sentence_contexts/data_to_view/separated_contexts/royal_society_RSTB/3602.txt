The Pre-Crag men of the Icenian area had the finest flints in the world to
serve as their material—nowhere else are such huge nodules of fine unflawed flint
accessible in such abundance. The men who made the flat amygdaloid and the
large triquetro-hastate flint implements (usually referred to by the unmeaning
term “coups de poing”) of the river gravels of the south of England and north of
France probably had access to good-sized flint nodules from the chalk. Though
these are not such fine masses as those of East Anglia, the fact that there is no
trace in the river-gravel industry of the “ rostro-carinate” type of implement, and
no trace in the Pre-Crag horizon of the flattened or “ foliiform” type, whether
amygdaloid or hastate, makes it clear that the men of these two industries were
independent and separate. Whether they were separated in place only, or also by
geologic time, remains for discussion. We cannot attribute the difference of their
types of implement to a difference of material.
