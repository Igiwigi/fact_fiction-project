The uncertainty
relations are an experimentally confirmed law, independent of any theory. In Bohrâ€™s and the
present view, as correlative to complementarity, the uncertainty relations are understood not only
as the impossibility of exactly measuring both variables simultaneously, but also the impossibility
of simultaneously defining both. Commonly, non-commutativity is seen as relating to the fact that,
if one measures two physical properties involved in one order and then in the other, the outcome
would in general be different, which is not the case in classical physics. However, the present
understanding of quantum measurement, as first a creation of quantum phenomenon, unique
each time, offers a deeper view of this non-commutativity and the difference in the outcomes in
reversing the order of measuring complementary variables, as discussed in [1] (pp. 118-122). This
view is as follows.
