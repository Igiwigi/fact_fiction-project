in 1829, 1830, and 1831. This fact will relieve HumBorpr from some of his diffi-
culties in his reasoning on the tides.

With respect to the tides in general, I have to state that in many thousand obser-
vations made by myself there was not a solitary instance in which the barometer
was not higher at 9—10 a.m. than at sunrise, lower at 4—5 p.m. than at 9—10 a.m.,
whatever the indication of the thermometer or hygrometer might be: nor was there
a 80litary instance in the year 1830 in which the maximum night tide was not higher
than the 4—5 o'clock day tide, although it rarely, if ever, rose 80 high as the 9—10
A.M. day tide. The nocturnal minimum tide occurring at 4—5 a.m., from three to
four hours after my usual time of retiring to rest, my oþbservations of it were very
limited in number ; nevertheless the accompanying 'Tables will furnish some direct,
and ample indirect, testimony of its existence, since the fact of the rapid, constant,
and considerable rise of the barometer from sunrise until 9—10 a.m. justifies the
inference that there must have been a considerable previous fall to have admitted of
such rise: the commencement of such fall was necessarily observed by me in my
labours during 1830 to determine the limit hours of the tides, as I was obliged to
continue observing in each case until the tide had turned. Moreover, at different pe-
riods I devoted forty-nine nights to the investigation of the minimum a.v. tide.
Dr. Warker at Mahabuleshwar, at 4500 feet above the sea, bestowed eight months'
labour upon the tides ; and Mr. Daimanoy, on the Neelgherry mountains, was simi-
larly employed for four or five months. HumBoLpr in his narrative mentions the
determination of the extent of the diurnal oscillations, the duration of the stationary
state of the barometer at its maxima and minima, and the exact periods at which it
becomes stationary and is in action again, as desiderata. I shall take these snbjects
