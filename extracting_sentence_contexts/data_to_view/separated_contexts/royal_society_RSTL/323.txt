That
the black matter produced is really charcoal, the author has
proved by adequate experiments. The inference, however, does
not appear to me to be just, that the charcoal and phosphoric acid
are the necessary result of the agency of the affinities, as stated
by Mr. TexxanTt. For the well known fact, that phosphorus
cannot be produced from bone-ashes by the application of char-
coal and heat, I think, only proves that the powers of affinity
between respirable air and phosphorus, together with the affi-
nity between the compound formed by their union (namely,
> phosphoric acid,) and quick-lime, are not inferior to the joint
affinities between the respirable air, in the phosphoric acid, and
charcoal, and between the compound of respirable air and
charcoal (namely, carbonic acid) and quick-lime. Hence, from
the principle referred to, it could not be concluded, that car-
bonic acid, combined with quick-lime, would be decompounded
by phosphorus attracting its respirable air, and the phosphoric
: acid, thus formed, attracting the quick-lime. Experience only
could determine the result of these affinities, but no proof has
been given, from the examination of the mixture, after apply-
ing phosphorus to red hot marble ; such as finding that car-
bonic acid was really decompounded, because there was a defi-
ciency of this elastic fluid, and that the charcoal and phosphoric
acid corresponded to this deficiency.
