directions in isotropic hyperelastic materials, the form (1.1) leads to particularly lean expressions
for the principal stresses, which facilitate comparison of the model response under ideal
homogeneous loading conditions with standardized tests for mechanical characterization, such
as simple tension, equibiaxial extension and pure shear. Ogden’s model shares this beneficial
property with earlier developments of principal stretch-based formulations of the strain-energy
density functions, such as those by Carmichael & Holdaway [6] and Valanis & Landel [7].
The latter proposed a strain-energy density function for incompressible isotropic hyperelastic
materials as the sum of a single scalar function evaluated at the three principal stretches, a
representation that has become known as the Valanis—Landel hypothesis. Ogden’s model (1.1)
hence belongs to the group of Valanis—Landel-type materials.

The argument of simplicity may have lost significance relative to the argument of robust
numerical implementation with the advent of computational finite element techniques. In fact, it
is well known that the computation of derivatives of the eigenvalues with respect to strain tensors
and thus the determination of tangent tensors pose their own challenges under generic non-
homogeneous loading conditions when the principal stretches change order and travel through
coalescing values. However, algorithmic solutions (see e.g. [8], §5.6), closed-form expressions for
the tangent tensors [9-12] and invariant-based reformulations [13,14] or approximations [15] have
helped to overcome these problems so that Ogden’s model can efficiently be used with finite
elements and is available in various software packages for mechanical analysis.

In addition to the advantage of compact mathematical form, the use of principal stretches in
general and the Valanis—Landel hypothesis in particular allows an interpretation of the model
in terms of the molecular statistical theory of rubber elasticity, which was not in the scope of the
developments by Ogden [1]. To this end, the three eigenvectors of the right stretch tensor and their
