MR. J. LISTER ON THE EARLY STAGES OF INFLAMMATION. 651

seconds, the corpuscles will be all cup-shaped, and will exhibit no disposition to
te. But no effect is produced on the formation of the rouleaux by stirring a
of blood in the same way for a much longer time in an atmosphere free from
chloroform. The aggregation of the corpuscles is not prevented merely by their
becoming cup-shaped, and therefore unable to apply themselves to each other as usual.
For the vapour of caustic ammonia, while it renders the corpuscles cup-shaped, seems
rather to increase than to diminish their adhesiveness and aggregating tendency, and
a temperature of about 32* Fans. has similar effects with the alkali*. Even in the
mixture of blood and gum many of the corpuscles are cup-shaped, though adhering
together with peculiar tenacity.
8 Whether or not it will ever be possible to explain these curious facts upon chemical
Sprinciples seems very doubtful ; but in the meantime, what appears most striking about
Sthem, and what most concerns the present inquiry, is that great effects may be pro-
Hluced upon the adhesiveness of the red corpuscles, both in the way of increase and
inution, by very slight changes in the chemical qualities of the plasma.
5 The galvanic current produces no effect upon the aggregation of the red corpuscles,
Sither of man or of the frog, as I have ascertained by placing the fine platinum wire
tremities of the poles of a powerful battery a short distance from one another between
two slips of glass beneath the microscope, then completing the circuit by shedding a
op of blood between the plates, and immediately observing the result. In several
Sch experiments I invariably found that aggregation took place as usual, and the only
Se≈øfoct produced by the galvanisxm was a chemical change in the blood, dependent on
Bdlectrolysis, gradually developing itself in the immediate vicinity of the poles, and
