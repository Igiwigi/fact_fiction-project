Subject to a certain condition of convergence, if we adopt the mean as our estimate,
then whether the normal law is true or not the uncertainty of the true value, given the
mean, is found from the standard deviation and nothing else. If the average residual
is used instead, there will usually be little difference beyond a slight increase of the
uncertainty if the normal law is true; but if the normal law is true and there happen,
in a particular case, to be a few exceptionally large residuals, or if it is untrue and there
are residuals beyond the range predicted by it, the average error will lead to an under-
estimate of the uncertainty of the true value as estimated from the mean. In fact, the
case where the use of the average error is recommended is precisely the one where its
use is most undesi

rable. The large residuals, in this treatment, have already received
full weight in estimating the mean, and if they have led to error in the mean they must
also be given full weight in estimating the standard deviation. If the normal law is wrong, on the other hand, neither the mean nor the standard
deviation is the best estimate to use in finding the true value and its uncertainty, and
we should try to find out in what respects it is wrong and correct the postulate of the
arithmetic mean accordingly.
