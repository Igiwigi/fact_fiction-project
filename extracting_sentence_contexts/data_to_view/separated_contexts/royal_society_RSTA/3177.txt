Another local computation shows that all crossings along [1 have the same sign (lemma 3.4). This means, in particular, that Mas(I>,,D) is equal to the number of crossings along I>, counted
with multiplicity. Combining the above results with the fact that Mas(J7,,D) vanishes, we arrive at the desired
formula

Mor(H_) = # crossings, with multiplicity, in (â€”0o, L) (1.9)

relating the Maslov index of the boundary value problem and the Morse index of the
corresponding differential operator. This result is summarized in theorem 3.1. We then show in
theorem 4.1 that the Maslov index of I), is independent of L for all L large enough, and thus can
be viewed as the Maslov index for (1.1) posed on the whole line.
