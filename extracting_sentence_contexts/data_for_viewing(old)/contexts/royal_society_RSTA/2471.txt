of the tokamak size and the magnetic field. In case tritium breeding at the high-field side is
needed, the distance between the inner leg of the toroidal field coil and the plasma (made up
of thermal shield, vacuum vessel, breeder and neutron shielding, first wall and scrape-off-layer)
cannot be much smaller than 1.7 m. The development of tritium breeding concepts is complicated
and the first results of the various concepts will only become available when ITER reaches its
high-performance phase. A fusion reactor that is claimed to come into operation before ITER
reaches high performance will, therefore, miss this input and might not be able to breed its own
tritium, but instead use tritium from external sources.

7. Safety and environment

DEMO and the future Fusion Power Plants are nuclear devices. This implies that safety is an issue
in all sub-projects from the first day of conceptual design onwards. Despite the fact that a fusion
reactor is inherently safe, everything possible should be done to protect the workers and the
people living in the environment from any risk. To obtain a license to operate the device it must be
demonstrated to the nuclear regulator that all aspects of the reactor are safe and that there are no
hidden pitfalls [26]. Having the present negative public opinion in mind about the employment
of nuclear fission plants it is important to convince society that the risks associated with the
operation of a fusion plant (e.g. the handling of tritium, the handling of short-lived nuclear waste,
etc.) are well under control. Safety should not only comprise safe operation of the fusion reactor


but also safe remote maintenance procedures. Care should be taken that the volume contaminated
by radioactive material (including tritium) is as small as possible. The extraction, handling and
storage of in-vessel components (activated and T-contaminated) are complex operations requiring
