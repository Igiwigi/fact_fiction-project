Moreover the next link 959°49 is just as much displaced one way
from ¢ as 377414 is in the other from e, for 3774°144+959°49 = 4933°63 = 3771°00
+962°63. Thus the line 18744°28 is exactly e+d+e above S,(2). In fact we have
a case of “ series inequality.” The link—966°09 to the next is excessive, but it is
entered because (see list Nos. 3, 4, 5) the displacement (—38) in (3) is destroyed in (4)
by adding a é to it, thus making it normal, and then another 4 on the (4) and on the
—e link reproduces (5).
