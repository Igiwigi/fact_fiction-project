solution of sodium hydroxide
has far less action on glass than a dilute solution. Its density did not alter by a
single unit in the fourth place when stored during ten weeks in a glass bottle. A
further advantage in the use of concentrated solutions is found in the fact that the
carbonate is almost insoluble, and, if produced by exposure to air, separates as a
precipitate at the bottom of the bottle, producing a small change in the concentration
of the solution, but hardly any depreciation of its purity. CONDUCTIVITY OF SODIUM HYDROXIDE IN AQUEOUS SOLUTION. 265
