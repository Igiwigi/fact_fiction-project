near the temperature of consolidation, or may even in part have solidified already.
These may all have been powerful factors in determining it to assume the form of
a dust cloud as soon as the retaining pressures were relieved, and the vast quantities
of steam and other gases it contained were free to expand. }

But the chemical aspects of the problem must not be neglected; they may be of
eyen greater importance than the physical. Both magmas are andesitic, but the
analyses and microscopic investigations which have already been published make it
certain that they are not exactly the same, so that it does not appear likely that the
dust-avalanche type of eruption is a consequence merely of the presence of a magma
with a certain narrowly-restricted chemical composition.

On the other hand, it is a significant fact that many of the most terrible instances
of disastrous and sudden volcanic explosions have been furnished by volcanoes
emitting hypersthene andesite. Krakatoa and Bandaisan are two examples of quite
recent date. This group of rocks is, of course, a very diverse one, and includes many
important variations ; but as contrasted with the basalts, which in so many cases give
rise to floods of liquid lava quietly welling out of craters or fissures, they seem
predisposed to violent and disruptive activity. The rarity of dykes in St. Vincent,
and the abundance and thickness of the sheets of coarse agglomerate, point to the
same conclusion,

What influence the nature of the gases present in such quantities may exert is a
problem equally interesting and obscure. â€˜Till we know more of what these gases are,
and in what proportions they exist in the magma, it is premature to enter into a
