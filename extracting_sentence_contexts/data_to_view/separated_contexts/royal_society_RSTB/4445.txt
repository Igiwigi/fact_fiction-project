Fic. 7. It will be seen that, in spite of the fact that the work had already lasted for a
total of seven minutes, and that there had been, in addition, an interval of four
minutes between the two periods of work, the CO, output is still above the oxygen
consumption, and the respiratory quotient above unity, when the determination of
the respiratory exchange waS made just before stopping the work. In the first minute afte√©t the stop of the work, there is only a comparatively small]
drop in the respiratory exchange, though there is a big diminution in the succeeding
minute and a-half, and a considerable further fall in the next three minutes. The

figures show clearly how greatly the fall in the CO, output lags behind the fall in
the oxygen consumption during these three periods.
