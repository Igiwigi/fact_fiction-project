§ 1. Introduction.

Our attention was directed to the action of the excised Mammalian heart in the
course of experiments relating to the electromotive action of various tissues, by our
observation of the fact that the electromotive variations indicative of action outlast
visible contractions ; secondly, that the contractions of the excised organ are of an
extraordinarily prolonged character.

We consequently pursued our observations (1) by the galvanometer, (2) by the aid
of the graphic method, (3) by the capillary electrometer (Lippmann). By the
galvanometer and by the electrometer we observed the electrical changes consequent
upon spontaneous or provoked contraction, and in the absence of visible contraction.
By the graphic method we determined the duration of spontaneous and of excited
beats, and, with regard to the latter, the length of the latent period at various times
after excision, Incidentally we also observed the time during which the rhythmic
beat persisted after excision and the character of that beat under varying conditions
of temperature. By both methods we were able in favourable cases to follow the
