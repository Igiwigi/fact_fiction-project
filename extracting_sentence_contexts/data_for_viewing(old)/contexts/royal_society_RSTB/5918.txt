in lamplight, it became clear that this phenomenon had no connection with temperature,
but was due to the low intensity of the light under the bench. Such an interpretation
can be established with absolute certainty by comparing the response of intact with
that of blind animals in any given situation. It is inconceivable that the chromatic
reactions of blind animals with respect to temperature should differ in any way from
the reactions of normal ones. Blind animals on the cement floor under the bench

were quite pale. It thus appears that the reversal is due to low intensity rather than
to differences in the spectroscopic quality of the light, as might have been inferred
from the fact that the response was first observed in lamplight.

The phenomenon can be most strikingly demonstrated in the following way: the
experiment is performed in a room whose windows are in one wall, along the whole
length of which there is a laboratory bench just under the windows. A chameleon
is put into a white enamel dish. The dish is placed on the bench. After a few minutes
the animal is pale. The dish is put on the floor under the bench. After a few minutes
the animal has become dark. The observation can be repeated an indefinite number
of times. The degree of darkening, however, is greater with some individuals than
with others.

BrUckKE (1852) quotes an observation of long ago, which can now be interpreted in
the light of the present conclusions. The quotation is from â€œ Voyages de Monsieur
