Thus, the turbulence cannot be any
more two dimensional than allowed by the critical balance because fluctuations in any two planes
perpendicular to the mean field can only remain correlated if an Alfvén wave can propagate
between them in less than their perpendicular decorrelation time [1,39]. In closing, it is worthwhile pointing out the common misconception that plasma turbulence
in the solar wind must be weak because the turbulent magnetic field fluctuations 6B are small
compared with the mean magnetic field magnitude Bo, or 5B/By <1. In fact, the strength of
the turbulence, estimated by the nonlinearity parameter x ~k 6B, /(kjBo) as the ratio of the
nonlinear to the linear term in (2.1), depends not only on the normalized amplitude of the
fluctuations, 6B/Bg but also on the anisotropy of the fluctuations, k, /ky. Direct multi-spacecraft
measurements of turbulent magnetic field fluctuations at the small-scale end of the inertial range
find k, /ky 2 10 [7,103,104], so even the small amplitude magnetic field fluctuations measured at
that scale, typically of magnitude 5B/Bp ~ 0.1, lead to strong nonlinear interactions.

(f) What is the nature of the compressible turbulent fluctuations? In addition to the incompressible dynamics of Alfvén waves that dominate turbulence in the
inertial range of magnetized plasmas, plasma turbulence also contains a small fraction (typically


10% or less) of energy in compressible fluctuations [105].
