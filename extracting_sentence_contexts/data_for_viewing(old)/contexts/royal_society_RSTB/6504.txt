typical and two mut. linearis. Although not strongly viable, this linear-leaved
trisomic has therefore reappeared in three successive generations with a frequency
which is in accord with the 50 per cent expected, but it is not clear why the later
specimens should have been so much more extreme than the original mutant.

This trisomic mutant is very similar to the mut. graminifolia obtained by RUDLOFF
and Srusse (1935) in the offspring of O. Hookeri after X-raying the pollen. It also
had smaller flowers and mostly bad pollen. They class it with a number of others
as a gene mutation. This conclusion is based on an examination of the pollen
grains and the fact that when selfed they breed almost true, no count of the
chromosomes being made. These reasons are, however, inadequate, and it
appears more probable that mut. graminifolia was a trisomic. It is unfortunate that
no cytological examination was made. Mucwaeuts (1930) obtained 60 per cent
heteroploid offspring from O. Hookeri by subjecting the plants to high temperature.
These included plants with 15 and 13 chromosomes and others with a fragment, but
unfortunately there is in this case no description of the phenotypic characters. By
X-raying the pollen of O. blandina, Catcuesme (1935) obtained a number of F,
variants. Four of these were called “ willow leaf’? and one “ bootlace”. The
latter had rolled leaves about 1 cm. in diameter. Both types showed seven pairs
of chromosomes and were probably due to deletions. On selfing or back-crossing
to normal they gave all normal offspring. It thus appears that very narrow-leaved
mutations may be (1) trisomic, (2) due to deletions, or (3) perhaps due to gene
