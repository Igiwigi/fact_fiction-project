WILLIAMS ON THE BLOOD-PROPER AND

No feat in anatomy is more practicable than in any s8pecies of Sipunculus, to
bring under direct view in the field of the microscope, the blood-vessel which reposes
on the cesophagus. Although more perfectly formed as a vessel, more defined in its
parietes, than the circular vessel of the Asteriadze, it may be placed beyond doubt
that is interior als is lined by vibratile epithelium ; that its contents are chemically
and morphologically identical with those of the visceral cavity of the same animal. It may be mentioned here as a remarkable fact, that in the Sipunculidz (at Jeast
such is the result of my examinations repeated with the utmost care upon many scores
of living specimens) the vessel which rests upon one side of the cesophagus is not
accompanied by a venous correlate on the opposite aspect of the cylinder, nor by
one parallel to itseIf on the same side. It is a single channel, which cannot be traced
to a distal system of capillaries. In the Sipunculide there are no © Polian vesicles” attached to or developed from
this vessel, The appearance of © vesicles” arises from the bulged knots into which
the vessel irregularly contracts under the stimulus of the air at the moment of laying
open the general cavity.
