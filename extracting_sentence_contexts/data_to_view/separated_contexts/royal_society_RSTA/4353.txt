The energy
of a given data symbol launched into a particular spatial channel consequently spreads
out into adjacent symbol time slots as a result of mode coupling and modal dispersion,
rapidly compromising successful reception of the information that it carries. To mitigate these
linear impairments, DSP-based adaptive equalization using multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) processing is required at the receiver. MIMO signal processing is in fact already
widely used in current commercial coherent optical transmission systems to enable PDM. Correcting for polarization mode-coupling as needed for PDM requires a 2 x 2 matrix MIMO
realization with four finite impulse response (FIR) filters. For an MDM system with M modes,
the respective algorithms need to be scaled to 2M x2M MIMO, requiring 4M? adaptive
FIR filters.
