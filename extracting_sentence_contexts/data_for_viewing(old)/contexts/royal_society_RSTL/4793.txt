= The imperfect development of the calcareous elements of the latter scale contrasts
3 Strongly with that of the kosmine in some other portions of the fish. Three very
SI large dermal spines project from its dermal covering, like those which give the name
= to Ostracion cornutus ; one of these proceeds forwards from the upper anterior angle,
= immediately above and between the eyes, whilst the other two occupy the respective
S posterior inferior angles on each side of the tail. Throughout the greater portion
S of their extent they are cylindrical, and have their surfaces ornamented with numerous
> longitudinal ridges and interyening sulci. At their bases, where they are depressed
2 vertically, the ridges terminate in rows of small tubercles, like those which stud the
Â© snrface of the scale.

Z The internal structure of this spine is highly interesting, partly from the fact that
= it is merely one of the ordinary scales in which the superficial element is dispropor-
S tionally developed and drawn out longitudinally, and partly because it explains the
B= true nature of some well-known fossil ichthyolites. It contains a hollow pulp(?)-
6 cavity, which exhibits no appearance of having been occupied by a cellular pulp, but
S is partly filled by a membrane composed of reticulated fibres, like those found in the
5 ordinary scales. Around this is placed the calcareous portion of the spine, which
= wholly consists of kosmine, and includes the homologues both of the horizontal canals,

206, and of the more superficial tubuli, 20 a. The former of these are seen in the
thicker portions of the spine, running parallel with the pulp(?)-cavity, and give off
small kosmine tubes; the latter enter from the onter surface.
