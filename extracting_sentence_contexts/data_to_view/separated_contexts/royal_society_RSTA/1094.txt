This significance is not necessarily evidence for phase
synchronization of the two oscillatory modes, but indicates any coherence of their phases, or
intermittent episodes of phase synchronization. The most striking area of phase coherence in the
symmetric picture of figure 2a is the association of the phases of the annual and biennial cycles. In fact, the area of the phase coherence extends around the biennial cycle from the period 19 to 26
months. The area around the annual cycle includes also the oscillations with the periods 8-10 and
14-16 months. The latter oscillatory mode is also coherent with the annual cycle.
