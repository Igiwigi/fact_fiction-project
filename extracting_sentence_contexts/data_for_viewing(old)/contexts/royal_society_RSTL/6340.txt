spherical masses, like the mineral Wavellite; they are very thin, and have a great
resemblance to caffeine. ;

In several instances during the earlier stages of its purification, or when dilute alcohol
is employed for its solution, it was noticed that the substance did not deposit in crystals,
but the transparent liquid congealed to a jelly. This jelly, however, after 8ome time
became crystalline, the crystallization commencing in several points of the mass, and
extending gradually throughout the whole; ultimately a crystallization was obtained
of the same appearance as occurs under other circumstances.

In the determination of the rational formula of this substance, we took cognizance of
the fact, that, besides acetic acid, it was the only other product obtained in the decom-

< Poxition of the original compound which we have denominated acetate of sycoceryl, and
S the analysis of which led to the empirical formula C,, H,; O,.

2 From the nature of this compound, we inferred that it contained the radical of acetic
acid in a similar state as acetic ether does; that in fact we had to deal with a compound
= containing acetic acid minus one atom of hydrogen and a radical. According to this
WD view the empirical formula C,, H,, O, would have to be doubled, whereby we obtain
