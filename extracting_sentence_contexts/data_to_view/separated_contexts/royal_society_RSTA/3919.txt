This is certainly below the last, or D’, halt on the cooling curve, a point marked in
the cooling curve of this alloy by a somewhat sloping flat. A lens now shows massive
bars and curved bands of » dark on a light ground. A slightly higher power brings
out the fact that this ground is full of paler bars and of lace bars, the effect being even
better seen in fig. 61. Thus the crystallisation has taken place in at least two stages:
at first the massive » bars formed, and, secondly, the mother-substance broke up into
