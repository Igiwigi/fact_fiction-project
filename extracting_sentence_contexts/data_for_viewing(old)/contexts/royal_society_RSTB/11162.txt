[5] and the logician Kripke (S. Kripke 1992, unpublished data).
Why think that numbers are numerals? Berkeley [4] noted that
large numbers within the range of performable calculations
defy precise sensory representation; so when we think of 201,
what introspective awareness reveals is not an image of 201
items but an image of the numeral. To conclude without
further argument that the number itself is the numeral ‘201’
is to confuse the representation with what is represented—a
quite common mistake. Berkeley did have further arguments,
but they are unsound.

Numeralism has the advantage that it appears to escape the
problem of cognitive access: people are satisfied with the fact
that we can see written numerals. But a serious disadvantage
is that a common core of basic arithmetical information can
be expressed using different numeral systems or natural
language number words:

12+9=21 (base 10).
1100 +1001 = 10101 (base 2).
Twelve plus nine equals twenty-one.

Another disadvantage in the same vein is that many truths
about finite cardinals are independent of numeral systems.
An example is the truth that every finite cardinal number
