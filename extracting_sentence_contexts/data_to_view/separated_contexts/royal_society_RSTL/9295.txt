where the left hand side is in fact = log Cv, or this second derived function of the

theta-function Cu is given in terms of the quotient-function —_ hence integrating
twice, and taking the exponential of each side we obtain Cu as an exponential the

Pan, of a squared quotient-

function. This in fact corresponds to Jacopr's equation
