holds with considerable accuracy. It may be mentioned that the ranges of speeds
obtained by Osporne REYNOLDS in his experiments on 0°62 and 1°27 cm. pipes were

not large, viz., from 48°0 (the critical velocity) to 469 cm. per second in the 0°62 cm. pipe,
and from 23 (the critical velocity) to 705 em. per second in the 1°27 cm. pipe, and
further, that the difficulties in maintaining a uniform speed in these experiments,
owing to the fact that the water was drawn direct from the Manchester mains, were
such as to render any small variation from the index law, such as would exist over
such ranges of speeds, almost impossible to detect. In Froupr’s experiments* on
towing flat boards the range in speed was not greater than from 50 to 500 em, per
second, so that no deviation would be apparent.
