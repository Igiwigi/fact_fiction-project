As the ganglia become defined
in form, their position tends to become irregular. While one may lie in the interval
between two vertebra, the next may be seen opposite the vertebra itself. Again, two
ganglia may be co-terminous, not by fusion, but from the fact that separation is
incomplete. This arrangement is shown in Plate 29, fig. 18, taken from a sagittal
section of a Rat embryo at about 22 days.
