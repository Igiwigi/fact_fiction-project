The dimensions of these hydatids are given in Table IV; they are little bigger than
the smaller of the normal hydatids. In general, too, their histological appearance is
not different from the normal.

(d) Oe6strone

Oestrone stimulates considerable growth in the hydatid,* as can be seen both in
the obvious increase in size (Table V) and in the frequency of mitotic figures in
histological preparations. Of the fourteen normal rhesus hydatids listed in Table III,
only three have a size index greater than 6, while only two of the twenty hydatids
from monkeys that had been injected with oestrone for a period of 14 days or more

* This fact was referred to elsewhere in connexion with a suggested interpretation of the changes
induced by oestrogens in the male reproductive tract (ZUCKERMAN 1936).

had a size index less than 6. The abnormally large hydatids found in two normal
specimens, O.M. 20 and O.M. 89, raise the mean size index of the normal hydatids
to 12:5. The mean size index of monkeys that had been injected with oestrone for
14 or more days was 24-5, and as noted above (p. 154) the greater size of the hydatids
removed from animals that had been injected with oestrone was often apparent under
