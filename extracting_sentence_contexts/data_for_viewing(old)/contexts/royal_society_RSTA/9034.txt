Tue above arbitrary division is due to the fact that the experimental work does not
include an examination of the vapour phases.

EXPERIMENTAL.

The solubility determinations were carried out in thermostats of
an ordinary pattern. Glass bottles similar to those used by vAN’rT
Horr (* Ozeanische Salzablagerungen,’ p. 9) were used for solutions
weak in sodium hydrate. Silver bottles, as shown in fig. 1, were
used for the strong sodium hydrate solutions.

The composition of the solid phases in equilibrium with saturated
solutions was determined by ScuREINEMAKERS’ “ rest” method—
