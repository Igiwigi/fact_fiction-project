of lime and mica, and afterwards analysed with a prism of
calcareous spar, they exhibited the most beautiful comple-
mentary colours. Without knowing what had been done by
M. Anaco, the same discovery was made by me in 1812 ;
but though the general fact which each of us discovered was
the same, yet I had the good fortune, by a peculiar mode of
observation, to examine the phenomena seen along the real
or apparent axes of crystals, and have thus been led to the
results contained in the following paper,—results which, as
will be seen in the sequel, could not possibly have been
obtained by the mode of observation employed by M. ARaco,
and afterwards by M. Bior. The last of these philosophers has examined this class of
phenomena with singular diligence and ingenuity. By a
series of fine experiments, he has established many funda-
mental points in the science, and has associated his name
with this branch of physics, as one of its most distinguished
and successful cultivators.
