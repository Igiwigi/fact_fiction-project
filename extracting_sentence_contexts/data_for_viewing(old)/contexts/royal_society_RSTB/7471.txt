operation often revealed a strip of tissue beginning to grow up from the tissue of the apex
immediately above the wound, that is, on the apical side of the wound. It is thought that
this strip of tissue, which will be called the ‘reuniting zone’, formed a bridge between. the
halves of P,. It was usually narrow, showed the wound scar on its outer face and lacked
a median vascular strand, as seen in figures 4 and 5, nos. 6, 7 and 8. There was, however,
one experiment, no. 4, figure 3, in which the wound scar was seen on the inner face of the
reuniting zone also. Here it seems that this zone must have been formed from tissues
internal to the wound and not from the undamaged tissue above it.

Concerning the nature of this reuniting zone the most probable interpretation is con-
sidered to be that it was formed by an extension of the flanks towards the original centre
of P, through tissue lying to the apical side of the wound or internally to it. This possibility
is supported by the fact that at a higher level each of the flanks usually formed a small and
roughly symmetric blade; for this suggests that each flank had been partly reorganized to
form a symmetric whole, though in the experiments of group I only one of these structures
showed a thickened central region and enlarged median strand (experiment no. 8, figure 5).
The reorganization of the flanks was thus usually incomplete, but may have been sufficient
to enable each flank to extend round the apex towards the original position of the centre
of P;. For such an extension, though in the abnormal direction relative to the centre of
P,, would have been away from the centre of the reorganized flanks, and so in the normal
direction relative to those new centres. Again in no. 3, figure 4, the uniting zone was
unusually thick radially and unusually high; it also had a median vascular strand and
a large axillary bud. In this experiment, therefore, it seems probable that the centre of
