Thus I
procured an infusion of bark, which I poured on the second part
of the bark, and this strengthened infusion again on the third
part, and $0 on, to the fifth. But, as a certain portion of the
infusion will remain attached to the wood of the bark, after the
infusion is poured or drawn off, I added a third pound of water
to the first part, and then followed up the infusion on the several
parts, till the three pounds of water, or 80-much of them as could
be separated from the bark, were united in the fifth vessel;
from which I generally obtained about one pint of strong infu-
son of bark:*

"To a certain quantity of this infusion, I added a given mea-
sure of the s0lution of glue; which formed an immediate preci-
pitate,that may be separated from the infusion by filtering paper. When dried, it is a substance formed by the chemical union of
the matter of skin with the tanning principle, and is, in fact, a
powder of leather. By saturating the infusion with the solution
of glue, the whole of the tanning principle may be separated
by precipitation.

gradations are inverse to those of a spirit hydrometer.


tanning Principle, and gallic Acid, in the Bark of Trees. 261

FOR THE GALLIC ACID. To the pound of bark left in the earthen vessels, and already
deprived of its tanning principle by these quick infusjons, I added
a given quantity of water, to procure a strong infusion of the
gallic acid, which requires a longer time, (say 48 hours.) This
infusion, when obtained pure,* affords little signs of the pre-
sence of the tanning principle, when tried by the test of the
solution of glue; but, with the solution of sulphate of iron, it
gives a strong black colour, (the common black dye,) which
differs in density, according to the quality of the bark : this may
be further proved, by boiling a skain of worsted in the dye, by
which the gradations of colour will be very perceptibly demon-
strated.
