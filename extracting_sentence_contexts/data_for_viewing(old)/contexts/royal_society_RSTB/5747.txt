It may be noted here that 191°6 gm. of calcium gluconate were actually isolated from
one-third of the metabolism solution, so that it seems reasonable to suppose that the
amount of calcium gluconate actually present is considerably higher than this. On
the other hand, if it is assumed that all the carbon present in the balance sheet in
Table IV as non-volatile acids is present as gluconic acid, only 176-2 gm. of calcium
gluconate should be present in this volume of metabolism solution. The explanation
of this discrepancy is almost certainly the fact that gluconic acid is present in the
original metabolism solution, partly as the free acid, which is then precipitated as the
calcium salt in 80 per cent. alcohol, and partly as the lactone, which is not precipitated
as the calcium salt, but which is shown as “carbon unaccounted for.” Further
support for this view will be given later, when it is shown that, in spite of the high

figure for “ carbon unaccounted for,” only relatively small amounts of products other
than gluconic acid could be isolated.
