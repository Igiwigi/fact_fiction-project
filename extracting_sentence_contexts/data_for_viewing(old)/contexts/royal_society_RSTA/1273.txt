]. Introduction

Machines and devices that exert vibration on materials are widely applied in various fields of
industry [1-5]. Excitation and sustainability of useful vibrations are among the main problems
in the design of such machines. The most widespread devices of this kind are inertial vibration
exciters, which consist of unbalanced rotors driven into rotation by electric motors. Typically,
the design implies that the rotors rotate uniformly with a certain frequency of w and the body
performs forced small harmonic oscillations with the same frequency.

In this work, we draw the reader’s attention to the fact that this is true only in the first
approximation. In fact, the rotor rotation rate changes periodically, which leads to the emergence
of higher harmonics in the driving force and in the device oscillations. We obtain these oscillations
in the second approximation when solving the system of nonlinear equations of the joint motion
of the exciter rotor and the oscillating body. These oscillations may be essential and yield in
some undesirable effects, in particular, for devices with self-synchronization vibration exciters.
We describe such a phenomenon, observed in industrial conditions, in this work. At the same
time, such oscillations can be enhanced on purpose and used to design new types of vibration
exciters, in particular, vibrational resonance exciters [6-17].

From the physical point of view, the effects described above can be explained by the periodic
exchange of kinetic energy between the rotating rotor and the excited system. The oscillations in
the rotor rotation rate may be estimated with sufficient accuracy via energy relations. We obtain
such estimates for several schemes of vibration devices of practical importance. The available
