In the thyroid gland of full-sized Frogs the vesicles are usually large. In smaller
Frogs their size is generally less. They are occasionally branched.

The gland-vesicles of the Conger Eel are often of large 8ize and more or less
branched. In the Skate the vesicles are also often large, and branched ones are some-
times 8een.

In all these animals the exact age was unascertained.

Whilst, therefore, branched vesicles may occur in the thyroid gland of adult animals,
they do not, as far as I have seen, communicate with one another to any extentâ€”
a conelusion which, it appears to me, is strongly corroborated by the fact that in the
course of a large number of interstitial injections in the glands of different animals
I have never 8ncceeded in injecting any system of branched tubes. I cannot think
with Zeiss that the viscid contents of the vesicles would have the effect of preventing
the injecting fluid from entering them, when we know that the viscid contents of the
Iymphatics has no such effect.

The exact shape of the vesicles is of course of minor importance. My chief object
in drawing attention to this point has been to show that in the adult state the vesicles
form elosed cavittes, and do not consist of a system of tubes traversing the substance
of the gland as BotcHAT suggests.
