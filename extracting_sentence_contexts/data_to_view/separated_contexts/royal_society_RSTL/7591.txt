described is simply due to the suddenness of the development and application of physical
force. The following are some of the more important facts of this kind ;â€”

1. The circumstance that the explosion of mercuric fulminate accomplished the deto-
nation of gun-cotton, whereas explosive agents less sudden in their action failed to
furnish this result, appeared to render it probable that silver-fulminate, which explodes
more suddenly and with much more powerful local force when applied under the ame
conditions, would accomplish the detonation of gun-cotton more readily than the mer-
cury-compound, 7. 6. it was anticipated that a larger amount of the latter would be
needed, than of silver-fulminate, to produce the desired effect. This proved, however,
not to be the case; though apparently not inferior, the slver compound is in no way
superior to that of the mercuric fulminate.
