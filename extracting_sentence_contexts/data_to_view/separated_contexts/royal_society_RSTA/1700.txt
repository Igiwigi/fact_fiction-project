Let t>0 and ze LP(Rt,X). The fact that ||U(z,0)|| <Mel¢! for any t <0, and some
constants M>1 and w€R, imply that ;:E,— X is linear bounded for any t> 0. Let us now
prove that for any t,o > 0 we have

Pr402(-) = S() oz + $iz(- +0). (4.6)
In fact, using the same calculus as in [48], for t,o > 0, and t < 0 we have

~ U(t,0)z(t +t+o0), t+t<0,tT+t+oa0 20
(siz) (r= FEF)
0, t+t+o<0. On the other hand,

U(r, 0)z(t+t+o), t+t+o>7+t>0,

Get += {f t+7<0. Thus (4.6) follows.
