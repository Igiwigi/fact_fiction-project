1. INa paper, which I communicated to the Royal Society in 1839, and which was
honoured by insertion in the Transactions of the following year, I described a series of
experiments made with some powerful voltaic batteries, for the purpose of determi-
ning the possibility of obtaining a spark before the completion of the voltaic circuit. I was therein enabled to establish a few facts respecting polar tension, or rather
respecting the absence of any notable degree of it in the batteries I described* ; for
instance, I proved that, with 320 series of Professor DaN1ELL's constant battery, polar
tension was not evinced adequate to the striking distance of z7;5th of an inch ; nor
was I more snccessful in obtaining it with a water battery of 1024 seriesF, constructed
by the same gentleman. I also stated that, according to the present theoretical
views of the action of the voltaic battery, with the apparatus I then used, it ought to
have taken place ; and that, if by a still more powerful apparatus it could not be
obtained, the theory must, in some way or other, be incorrect. 2.
