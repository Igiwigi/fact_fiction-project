The approach with trace element
ratios has the advantage of being very simple (no calculus involved), but unlike box modelling,
it does not provide an estimate on crustal recycling. Collerson & Kamber [31] used Nb/Th,
whereas Campbell [32] used Nb/U. In fact, Collerson & Kamber [31] tried Nb/U as well, but
they discounted the corresponding growth curve because it indicated greater continental mass in
the past. After the net growth model of Campbell [32], an interest in creating a new growth model
with the mantle-based approach seems to have faded away. Instead, the evolution of continental
crust has been studied mostly through the crust-based approach using the global databases
of detrital zircon.
