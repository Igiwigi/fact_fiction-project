The caudal branch
descends in a straight line under the peritoneal lining of the abdomen, and
under the spinal nerves, without giving off a single branch till it reaches the
tail, in the muscular substance of which it is lost. T have not yet been able to discoyer any connexions of the electrical neryes,
besides those pointed out. It is an interesting fact that the gastric nerves are
derived from them. Perhaps superfluous electricity, when not required for the
defence of the animal, may be directed to this organ to promote digestion. In
the instance of a fish which I had in my possession alive many days, and
which was frequently excited to give shocks, digestion appeared to have been
completely arrested ; when it died, a small fish was found in its stomach,
much in the same state as when it was swallowed ;â€”no portion of it had been
dissolved.
