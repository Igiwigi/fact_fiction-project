normalization by viscous scales; for example, (uv)*+ = (uv) /u2, and I+ =1/(v/u;). Also, since we
intend to evaluate the lengths of the zero-crossings in the uv signal, which is susceptible to noise,
we have filtered all the wv signals using a second-order Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency
of 1/(v/u2).

3. Geometric features of negative uv motions

The time series of the uv signal is converted into a binary signal, with —1 for negative uv
magnitudes and +1 for the positives. The length (or the time period) of the —1 portion of the
signal divided by the total length of the signal is the negative time fraction. Figure 1a shows
this time fraction for different Reynolds numbers (presented by different symbols) as a function
of the normalized wall distance yt /V5* =y/ /5(v/u;). The normalization (by \/6(v/u;), the
intermediate length scale) is to highlight the fact that in boundary layers the beginning of the
inertial region starts at ~3V5*. The averaged time fraction within the inertial region (ending
near 0.155) is presented in figure 1b for increasing 5*, where it is evident that the time fraction
approaches a constant ~1/ = 0.618... with increasing Reynolds number. Here, we note that
the start of the inertial layer may be different for boundary layers than in pipes and channels.
That is, earlier results that are largely based on channel flow analyses put the onset of the
inertial domain at y* ~ 2.6/5* while our more recent measurements (in [18]) for the boundary
layer (used herein) indicate that this onset is near y+ ~ 3.6/5+. Furthermore, we point out that
the precise values of the constants 2.6 and 3.6 are obtained empirically from the experimental
data, even though the theory predicts these constants to be O(1). Although a slight difference in
the beginning of the inertial region is noted for the two flows, the analysis of the uv motions,
however, is plausibly similar in both flows, especially in the inertial regions, where we expect to
see self-similar behaviours.
