F-BAR proteins
(FBP17, CIP4 and Toca-1) are recruited to the basal cortical
waves in mast cells [42]. This recruitment is surprising because
basal surface waves are the least likely to involve membrane
shape changes. An additional puzzling fact is that these F-
BAR waves are faster than some other basal cortical waves or
protrusive waves that also involve changes in membrane cur-
vature. It turns out that F-BAR proteins can drive shallow
inward membrane bending [89]. Changes in curvature have a
non-local effect in recruiting curvature-sensing proteins and
driving wave propagation.
