The python gzip package was then
used to output a compressed file using Lempel—Ziv compression. Behavioural sequences that compress to a higher degree suggest
that behaviour was more repetitive, while those that are less com-
pressed suggest stronger exploratory behaviour. Importantly, the
compression measure incorporates the fact that ‘repetitive play’ 25 50 15 10.0 12.5
may be non-trivial. For instance, a child who selects objects A, B age (years)
and C in sequence ABCABCABC.... will appear maximally
random to a model that tracks only unigram statistics, as A, B and
C are equally frequent. This sequence will be very predictable to a
compression scheme, like the one we use, that can capture inter-
action dependencies.
