Fosult of the over-balance of the spinal tonus of the extensors of hip and knee by that
@f the flexors. The normal tonus of the skeletal muscles when the nervous system
& intact has, doubtless, spinal, cerebellar and cerebral factors, which are in it
“Algebraically summed. In the spinal experiments now under consideration of these
“Zeveral factors, only that of the cord itself is effective, the transection having cut off
the others, and in these contracture experiments necessarily only that of the lower
‘Balt of the cord. That remnant of the normal tonus I refer to as spinal tonus, in
gontradistinction to the tonus described at p. 174 in this paper, ensuing on ablation of
Bho cerebral hemispheres, which I term decerebrate tonus, also in contradistinction to
hat tonus which I term decerebellate ensuing on removal of the cerebellum. The
te rigidity of paraplegia i in the Monkey is an expression of the upset of balance of
Bhe spinal tonus in antagonistic muscle-groups. I look upon its origin as of reflext
pature, and this is borne out by the fact that in my Monkeys it could, in its earlier
“Stages, i.e., before structural changes in the muscles set in, be set aside by chemical
sinesthesia, and by applying an Esmarcu bandage to the limbs. The unequal degree
f spinal tonus, idem aliter of spinal reflex action is, in my view, of prime importance
Fn the production of late rigidity.

This view appears to me consonant with, although widely removed from, that
advanced by H. Munk. It harmonises with his view, in so far that confinement in
a cramped cage might still further reduce the opportunity for extension of the knee
or hip, even when that movement occasionally arose. It may be objected that if, as
I urge, there is a considerable and constant difference in spinal excitability between
the motor spinal centres for flexors and extensors, ¢.g., at hip and knee, such should
