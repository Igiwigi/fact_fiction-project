apparently been assumed that they must also correspond with the Apes and Insectivora
in the possession of a disk-shaped placenta. The observations of M. ALPHoNSE MILNE-
Epwarps have, however, clearly proved that the placenta in the Lemurs is not disk-
shaped; and though he applied to it the name bell-shaped, he yet concluded that it
had affinities to the zonary placenta of the Carnivora.

From the description which I have given in this Memoir of the arrangement and
structure of the maternal and foetal parts of the placenta in the several genera examined,
it will T think be at once admitted that not only is the placenta in the Lemurs not
discoidal, but that it cannot be regarded as a modification of the zonary form of placenta.

Both in form and structure the placenta in the Lemurs is without doubt a diffused
placenta. To make this important conclusion clearer, I shall summarize the facts
which prove this to be the character of the placentation.

a, By gentle traction the ridges and villi of the chorion can be drawn out of the sulci
and crypts of the uterine mucosa 80 that the fatal and maternal parts of the placenta
can be readily and completely separated from each other, as can be done in the diffused
placenta of the Pig, Mare, or Cetacean, but as cannot be done either in the discoid
placenta or in the zonary placenta of the Carnivora.

b. The chorion is prolonged from the tip of one cornu, through the corpus uteri, to
the tip of the opposite horn, as in the uniparous Mare and Cetacean, and is not, as in
the uniparous Sea], limited to the side of the uterus in which the foetus is developed.
