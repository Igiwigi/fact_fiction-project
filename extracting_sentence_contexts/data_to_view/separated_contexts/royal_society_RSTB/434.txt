This delimitation of what we consequently call the anterior limb
can be easily seen, and it is from this point that in this group of sections we have

commenced the measurement of the capsule, continuing the same as before along its
outer margin, 7.e., contiguous to the lenticular nucleus, as far as the hinder end of
the outer zone of that nucleus (see fig. 1). The remnant of the anterior limb above described is bounded on its inner aspect,

i.e., along the middle line of the cerebrum by a narrow (1-2 mm. wide) strip of
inexcitable tissue. (? Septum lucidum and anterior perforated spot, grey matter.)

Summary and Application of the Anatomical Facts. It remains to connect these anatomical data with the facts observed upon
excitation. In the first place discrimination must be made betw√©en the effects of exciting
fibres in their continuity and on their transverse section respectively, since it is
plain that the identity of result might otherwise lead to an undesirably extended
view of the limits of the efferent tract.
