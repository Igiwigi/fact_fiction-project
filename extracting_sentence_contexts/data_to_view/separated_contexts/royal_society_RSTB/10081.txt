small (e.g. short sequences) [97,98]. This advantage is due to
the reduction of the noise/signal ratio by considering together
all the phylogenetic information. The accuracy of non-
supermatrix approaches is strongly depleted by loci with low
phylogenetic signal (usually short genes) due to increased
gene tree error.
