Subsequently, he found that free nitrogen was brought into combination by
argillaceous soils, when exposed in their natural condition, but not when they were
sterilised. He also found gain when the natural soils were enclosed. He considered
the results showed that there was gain of nitrogen quite independently of any absorp-
tion of combined nitrogen; in fact that there was fixation of free nitrogen due to
living organisms. He further considered that such gains, not only serve as compensa-
tion for exhaustion by cropping, &c., but explain how originally sterile argillaceous
soils eventually become vegetable moulds. He also made experiments on the fixation of free nitrogen by vegetable earth
supporting vegetation ; and he found that there was a gain about equally divided
between the soil and the plant, the latter having taken it up from the soil, which he
considers is the true source of gain.
