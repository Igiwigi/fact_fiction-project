been due to an accidental fracture which seems in the figure to form a natural
boundary to the bone.

Owen,* although he suspected the presence of the coronoid, was unable to convince
himself of its existence.

Fraas,t who like his predecessors studied the structure in cross-sections, made some
curious errors in identification ; thus he applies the synonymous terms splenial and
operculum to different bones in the same section. That which he terms splenial is in
fact the surangulare.

The admirable account given by ANDREws of the lower jaw of Ophthalmosaurus
leaves little to be desired, but it is evident that some differences in detail distinguish
this jaw from that of Ichthyosaurus. In Ophthalmosaurus, for instance, the surangulare
is represented as bearing a facet for the coronoid (goniale), while in Ichthyosaurus the
coronoid (goniale) does not come into contact with the surangulare.

In our specimen the lower jaw is not quite complete at its posterior end and the
articulare is missing. The right ramus, which is the better preserved, has lost the tip
of its posterior end and a part of the lower edge in the middle, between Secs. 220
and 320.
