In the condition of its air-bladder Botia exhibits a similar

29 developed than in Cobitis and Nemachilus,

‘Q jiosvessor in two families so well defined and distinet, both in general characters aud
& the structure of the air-bladder and Weberian mechanism, as the Cyprinide and
3 ~ Silurides, can only be due to the operation of similar causes in both instances, and in
4 ol opinion is strongly confirmatory of the conclusions we haye already arrived at in
2 ~ the cuxe of the latter family. But although the modifications which the air-bladder
%  wnhrlergoes in the abnormal forms of botli farsilies are substantially similar in principle
= and in result, and have no doubt been evolved in each ease ta bring the organism
€ into harmony with practically similar external conditions, there are certain minor
sl iifferences between the two as to the precise means employed. Encapsulation of the
3 nibladder in the Cyprinids appears invariably to result from the actual ossili-
FE tation of the walls of the air-bladder itself, the modified transverse processes tuking
2 iftle, if any, share in the process, This may possibly be explained by the fact that
QA in these Cyprinids with a normally-developed air-bladder, the transverse processes,
though greatly developed in size and otherwise modified, are never so expanded or so
closely moulded to the anterior and dorsal sarfices of the anterior chamber as is
flwuye the case in the normal Siluride, and hence, insteod of encapsulation being
elfiscted, as is wenerally the case in the latter, by a slight extension of « modification
alrewly existing, it has been bronght about in the former by the actual ossification of
the outer coat of the air-bladder itself The completeness of encapsulation in the
Cyprinids we associate with the general integrity of the rest of the air-bludder and
Weberian mechanism, for reasons previously urged in the case of certain Siluride
