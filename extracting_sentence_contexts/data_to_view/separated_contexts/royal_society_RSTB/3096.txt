F ig. 18 is taken from material in which the nucleolus, as
also the chromatin, shows a much stronger basophile affinity ; it represents a still
younger egg, in which a stream of spherules is in the act of being discharged
from the nucleolus, though the latter is so intensely basophile that extraction has
not sufficed to differentiate a less intensely basophile internal region. The special
interest of this section lies in the fact that, owing to the eccentric position of the
nucleolus and the outward direction of the discharge, the stream of spherules already
lies well in the cytoplasm, while still retaining its obvious spatial relation to the
nucleolus. The fact that this appearance of a discharge of spherules from the nucleolus should
be so rarely seen in the growing oocyte admits of very simple explanation. In the
growing egg the intermittent discharges must be separated from one another by a
considerable interval,* while the time occupied by the actual discharge must be very
brief. The chances, therefore, against the moment of discharge coinciding with that
of fixation are very great.
