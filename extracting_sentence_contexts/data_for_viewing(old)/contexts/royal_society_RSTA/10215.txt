2 gave the change of concentration brought about by the electrolysis.

In order that an experiment should be successful it was necessary that the foregoing
= procedure should be strictly followed. Identical values for the original concentration
2 and that of the middle portion have never been obtained unless the whole solution
was first placed in the apparatus and all three portions were taken from it.

At least half-a-dozen other methods have been tried without success. Fortunately
2 it is easy at the close of an experiment to see if any mixing has taken place, from the
fact that bromine is liberated at the anode, where it forms a deep red solution in
the hydrogen bromide. If the experiment has been successful, this solution remains
as a very clearly defined layer surrounding the anode, and the coloration does not
extend more than about 1°5 centims. up the tube. On the other hand, if mixing has
taken place, as may happen either if the current is too large or if the temperature of
the bath is allowed to vary, the bromine is distributed throughout the solution and
no clearly defined layer is seen at the anode.

Experimental Results.

The results of the experiments are contained in the following table, in which the
concentration of the various solutions is expressed under N, which gives the number
of gramme equivalents of dissolved substance per litre of solution, the percentage also
