the existence of a feeble pumping action in the living wood, and render it incapable
of detection by direct experiments on living and dead pieces of stem. Section 14.—The Changes of Conductivity in Cut Stems,

The gradual blocking of cut stems placed in water is well known, as is also the
fact that the conductivity can be restored by removing a slice from the cut surface
under water. When water is forced through a cut stem which has been actively
transpiring, the conductivity usually rises at first, if the blocking is not too rapid. In the following instances the rates and amounts of flow per hour are given, the
head of water being 3 metres in all cases :—
