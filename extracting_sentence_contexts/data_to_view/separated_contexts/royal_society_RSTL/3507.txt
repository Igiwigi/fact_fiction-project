But no such general and @ priori
reasonings would, I think, lead us to many of the conclusions actually arrived at ;
as, for instance, that one and the same spectrum thrown on papers differently pre-
pared, shall indicate by the impressions photographically left on those papers, the
most capricious differences in the scale of action, whether estimated by the extent of
the discoloration in the direction of the length of the spectrum, or by its intensity at
different points of that length. We could hardly have predicted, & priori, for example,
that, acting on one description of paper, the chemical spectrum (as indicated merely
by the length of its photographic impression,) should include within its limits the
whole luminous spectrum, extending much beyond the extremest visible red rays on
the one hand, and on the other to a surprising distance beyond the violet ; while, if
another paper be used, all action should appear definitively cut off at the orange; if
another, at the commencement of the green ; and if another, at that of the blue rays:
that, in the case of one description of paper, the maximum of apparent action should
lie beyond, jn that of another within the visible violet; in a third far in upon the blue;
while in a fourth several successive maxima should appear. Still less would any


RAYS OF THE SOLAR SPECTRUM ON PREPARATIONS OF SILVER, ETC. 17

& priori conclusion prepare us for differences in the kind of action at different points
of the spectrum, as manifested by differences of colour produced, or for what at first
sight appears yet more singular, the shifting upon the spectrum itself of the points
where these differences of action commence and terminate, Nor, lastly, could any
penetration enable us to anticipate a fact s0 totally at variance with all our ideas, as
that two rays of different refrangibilities, (and therefore of different lengths of undu-
lation) acting at once, should produce an effect which neither of them acting sepa-
rately is competent to produce at all; a fact which seems difficult to deal with on
any theory of light. These are but a few of the many singular resalts which promise
to render this field of research, hardly yet entered upon, as replete with novelty, va-
riety, and interest, as any other department in the vast field of physical optics.

Spaces (if any) in the chemical spectrum, analogous to the dark lines of WoLLastoN
and FraUNHoFER in the luminous one.
