and distortion in the peak energy of the beamlets observed in the experiment. The fact that this 4

effect is not observed in figure 5c indicates that it is not dominant in the interaction under study. —
We explored the B-III process at the threshold of beam generation through OSIRIS simulations i.

in 2D cylindrical geometry. In addition to observing the variation in the physical processes

involved (i.e. ionization and injection), a primary goal was to investigate the properties of the

injected beam across this threshold to observe whether a beam with multi-coloured features

similar to experiment emerged (due to multiple injection cycles) from this process. Simulations

were performed with the drive beam parameters being mostly the same as those described in

§2, except oz was varied between 30j1m to 601m.
