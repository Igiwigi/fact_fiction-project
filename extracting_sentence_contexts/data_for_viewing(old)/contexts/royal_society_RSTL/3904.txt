action ; for it involves much of the source of controversy between the contact and

, chemical theories ; and I was naturally anxious to discover whether simultaneously
with these s/atic effects, or perhaps antecedently to them, any chemical action took
place in the cells of the battery ; and if 80, to what amount.

22. Farapay}, in the course of that branch of his experimental researches which
introduced into notice the voltameter, established the most accurate means of mea-
suring the amount of chemical action in the battery cells, by the equivalent amount
of chemical decomposition exhibited in that instrument ; he has also directed our
attention to the fact, that this amonnt of electro-chemical decomposition depends
essentially on the current as denoted by the galvanometer. There was every reason,
with these facts before us, to expect that the battery, which did not produce a current,
would not evince any degree of chemical decomposition. Recourse was, however,
had to the test of experiment ; and, instead of introducing the galvanometer, I snb-
stituted for it a small piece of bibulous paper, saturated with a soJution of iodide of
potassium ; the gold leaves of the electroscope diverged as before, but, however long
the duration of action, not the least indication of the liberation of iodine was per-
ceptible. The inference I make from this is, that no definite chemical action took
place in any cell of the battery, and consequently that the electric effects above
shown, and which are termed satic effects, take place before or independently of the
actual development of the chemical effects.

23, I am aware that, in some form or other, this fact has been acknowledged by the
most strenuous adyocates of the chemical theory. BzcquereLy thus adverts to it :â€”
