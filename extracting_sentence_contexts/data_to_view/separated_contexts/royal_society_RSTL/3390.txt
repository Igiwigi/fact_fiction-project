I have now to state, that facts observed in the pre-
sent © Series” confirm the view then taken. Thus the germinal vesiele-like objects
in Plate XXVIII. fig. 245. « and S certainly correspond to those just referred to; and
they are situated i that which had been the nucleus of the cell.

388, Now $hould it prove that I am right in considering the germinal vesicle-like
objects of my © Second Series,” and those in Plate XXVIII. fig. 245. of this memoir,
as corresponding to the pellucid cavity in a nuclens, it will be obvious that, the relation
of such an object to a cell, is not © the same as that of the ordinary nuelei of cells.”
And since I cannot but regard those germinal vesicle-like objects as corresponding
also to some of the © hollow,” * pellucid,” and © cell-like nuclei” of Scawanxx, I ven-
ture to believe that some light may have thus been thrown upon one of the difficul-
ties left by that observer for future explanation.

389. From these remarks, however, it will be seen that I cannot adopt the opinion
of Scuwany, that the pellucid object in epithelium-cells is a © eytoblast.” And facts
made known in the foregoing pages show that the germinal vesicle itself cannot be 80
considered.

390. Scuwaxx conjectures that the contents of the cell (* zellen-inhalt”) may con-
tribute to the secondary deposits observed to take place in plants on the inner surface
of the membrane of the cell; and which, according to VatexTIN, always occur in
spiral or other lines. Scawaxy had not observed snch secondary deposits in animal
cells; yet from the correspondence he has pointed out between elementary structures
in the two kingdoms, I think the following may perhaps be worthy of considera-
tion.
