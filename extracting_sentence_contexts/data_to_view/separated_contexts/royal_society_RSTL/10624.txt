In the paper on Toroidal Functions several examples were given of the deter-
mination of the potential function $ when $ is given over a tore; but when the
variation of $ along the normal to the surface is given, the determination of the

Ro-efficients becomes more difficult, and one case only, for the motion of a tore
erpendicular to its plane, was given. It will be well, therefore, to consider here

=the general theory for this class of 8urface conditions. The co-efficients are to be

Sletermined from the fact that $ is (1) finite in the space considered, and at infinity,

Zand (2) dþ/dn has a given value over the surface of a tore u*, Here I consider only

She case where the motion is symmetrical about the axis, and therefore the normal

Felocity given by a function of v only, say /(v). Condition (1) is satisfied by space
