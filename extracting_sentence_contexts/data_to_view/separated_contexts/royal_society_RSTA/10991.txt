My answer to this is that these cases should really be considered as limiting cases. If, instead of considering a section where the keyway is actually a straight line, we
consider a hyperbola with a very sharp bend, we can easily ensure, provided the
angle of torsion be not too great, that the physical conditions shall not be violated,
and, on the other hand, the values of the torsional rigidity (since they tend to a finite
limit) will differ but little from the values obtained above. The very fact that the
torsional rigidity tends to a finite limit shows that, even in the extreme case, the area
where the physical considerations are violated is infinitesimal. Finally, in drawing conclusions from such results we shall only be following the
example of Sart-VENANT and of THomson and Tart, who have not hesitated to use
results found in a precisely similar way for such keyways cut into a circle.
