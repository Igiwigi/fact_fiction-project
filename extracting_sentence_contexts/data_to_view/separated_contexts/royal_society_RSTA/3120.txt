There is consensus for p < p;, and pluralism otherwise.

(ii) Two populations of zealots

We now suppose that each opinion has an equal number of zealots, p = q (the problem with p 4 q
is considered in [29]). This is also what will be assumed when we consider a two-city model in §4. For p > 0, the continuation of the fixed point G, 4) is

1-2p —*)
bo) = | ———, ——— }.
(a0, bo) ( 3073

This follows from the fact that the fixed point equations (2.3) collapse to
m=a ~ 1-—2a—-2p=a ~ a=}(1—2p). Clearly, the fixed point is only physical for 0<p< } The limit p=q= 3 corresponds to each
opinion having only zealots. Regarding the stability of this fixed point, we have the following
proposition.
