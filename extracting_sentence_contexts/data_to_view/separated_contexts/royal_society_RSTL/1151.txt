The latter, however, seems rather to act
on the sulphur than on the molybdzna ; but the former com-
municates oxygen to both, 80 as to convert the one into sul-
phuric and the other into molybdic acid,

The rapidity with which nitric acid oxygenates molybdzna,
even to supersaturation, resembles the effects produced by the
same acid on some other metallic substances, particularly tin ; ©

for in both cases the acid ceases to act as s0on as the supersa-
turation with oxygen is effected ; and on this account the nitric
acid is unable to dissolve the molybdic acid. Before I proceed, I'must obserye that whenever a solution of
the molybdic acid becomes blue, or tending towards that co-
lour, it is a certain sign that the molybdic acid has sufftered a
diminution of oxygen. A. variety of facts which prove this, v
have been already brought forward in the different experi-
ments contained in this paper ; and I shall soon have occasion
to mention others. Sulphuric acid can dissolve a considerable quantity of mo-
lybdic acid; and the $olution. is always more or less of a blue
colour according to the quantity which is dissolved ;. and the
blue colour proves that the molybdic acid has parted with a
portion of oxygen ; but if the solution be heated, the blue co- [
lour disappears, and returns again when the liquor becomes
cold;* .

© The cause of this I believe to be a change produced by heat
in the respective degrees of affinity which prevail between the
metallic base and oxygen, and between the base of the acid
menstruum and oxygen ; $0 that when the solution is heated,
the affinity between the blue oxyde of molybdazna and oxygen
is increased, and a portion of oxygen therefore quits the acid
menstruum and combines with the blue oxyde, which then
becomes molybdic acid ; but as s0on as the heat is dissipated,
the cause of, this augmentation of affinity ceases, and the acid
menstruum receives again the portion of oxygen from the mo-
lybdic acid, which then returns to the state of a blue oxyde;
or if the heat is continued until the solution is distilled to dry-
ness, the residuum is the molybdic acid exactly in the same
state as it was before the solution was made, for the continua-
tion of the heat enables it to retain the portion of oxygen re-
quisite to constitute a metallic acid. F

I do not therefore believe that the total quantity of oxygen
in the solution suffers alteration any further than that it is dis-
tributed in different proportions between the two acidifiable
bases, sulphur and molybdzna, according to the temperature
of the s0lution,

As the affinity between azote and oxygen is comparatively
weak, the metal molybdzna effects a decomposition of the
nitric acid, and acquires a sufficiency of oxygen to become
molybdic acid, But as the affinity between sulphur and oxy-
gen is greater than that of azote, and also under certain cir-
cumstances superior to molybdzna, the latter requires the
aszistance of heat to be able to retain a full portion of oxygen,
and this jncrease of affinity lasts no longer than during the
continuation of the heat,
