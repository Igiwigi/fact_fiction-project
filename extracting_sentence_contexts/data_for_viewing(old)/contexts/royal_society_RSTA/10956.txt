If we take the particles of the cathode stream to be at least as great as molecules,
2d, the thickness of pulse, is small compared with the wave-length of visible light
(see THomson’s paper); d/ky may be taken as yolg9, where A, is the wave-length of
yellow light, say. In the scale of fig. 1 27/A) is very near to 0. It appears that long
waves have the greatest amplitude; practically the same amplitude is maintained
onwards through the visible spectrum, and in fact till we approach to wave-lengths
comparable with the diameter of the molecules.

§ 33. The measure with which we are concerned, however, is not amplitude, but
integral energy through ranges of wave-length. Considering this, we see at once
that the short waves are all-important. The total energy of the pulse is of order E*d.
The energy contained in waves of length from infinity to dy is of order E?d. (d/A9).
Remembering that the visible spectrum includes an octave, we may say, roughly,
that yee of the energy of the radiation will reside in the visible part of the spec-
trum ; and, of the rest, practically the whole in waves of length comparable with
the diameter of the molecules. It is noteworthy that waves of length equal to the
thickness of the pulse or sub-multiples thereof will be excluded from the spectrum.
