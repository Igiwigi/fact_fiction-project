The Siberian iron has globular concavities, in part filled with
a transparent substance, which, the proportional quantity of
oxide of iron excepted, has nearly the composition of the glo-
bules in the stone from Benares.

The iron from Bohemia adheres to earthy matter studded
with globular bodies.

The Senegal iron had been completely mutilated before it
came under my examination.

From these facts, I shall draw no conclusion, but submit the
following queries.

18t. Have not all fallen stones, and what are called native
irons, the same origin ?

2dly. Are all, or any, the produce or the bodies of meteors ?

And, lastly, Might not the stone from Yorkshire have formed
a meteor in regions too elevated to be discovered ?

Specimens of the Benares and Yorkshire stones have been
deposited, by the President, in the British Museum.
