The variations from unity are irregular and obviously may be the result of
observational or experimental errors, The maximum variation of 19 per cent. is
small considering the number and nature of the experimental determinations involved. Apart from a quantum theory, the range of possible values is so enormous in com-
parison with the variation observed that the emission of one quantum of characteristic
X-radiation for each electron in the associated corpuscular radiation must be regarded
as an experimentally established fact. It is a fact of some significance. Less accurate experiments on other substances lead to a similar conclusion approxi-
mately if not accurately. There is no, reason to think the results would be less
convincing.
