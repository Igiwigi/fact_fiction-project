There are five stout metatarsals, which increase in length from the first to the
fourth, while the fifth is but little longer than the first. They do not decrease in
stoutness, as is the case with Crocodiles. They are more elongated than among Lizards,
though Scaphewosaurus* has similar bones, but shorter than in Compsognathus and
some Ornithosaurs, like Dimorphodon. No near parallelism is possible with Dinosaurs,
because the bones of the digits are so greatly elongated in Protorosaurus, for this
condition gives a Lacertilian character to the hind-limb, though the stoutness of the
phalanges and metatarsals is more Dinosaurian. From the shortness of the first and
fifth digits, and especially of the metatarsals of those digits, the foot has a suggestive
aspect of degeneration, which, when the metatarsals came to be carried in an elevated
position, might result in the development of such a foot as is seen in Allosaurus,
though the fact that the fourth metatarsal is the longest seems to offer some difficulty
in the simplification of the Protorosaurian foot. The digital bones are ossified on the
Dinosaurian type.

The shoulder-girdle and fore-limb.â€”The shoulder-girdle is less perfectly
preserved than the pelvis. Bones which I regard as the coracoid and scapula ave
preserved in the Munich specimen. If these are traced off and articulated, they show
that the coracoid was relatively large, but, like the scapula, is suggestive of Dino-
saurian or Ichthyosaurian form, though the coracoid is not without some resemblance
to the bone in Plesiosaurs, and Plesiosaurs always want the narrow anterior notch,
Only a trace of these bones is seen in the Vienna specimen, where the very
imperfect coracoid and seapula appear to have had similar forms; but there is no
evidence whether the coracoids met in the median line, or whether other bones
