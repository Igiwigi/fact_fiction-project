has been considered by Bower* and Scorrt, among others. It is, therefore, only
necessary to consider in what degree they lend support to the theories of antithetic
or homologous alternation. The relation of the nuclear differences to normal alter-
nation are in such natura] accord with the view that the sporophyte is an interpolated
stage in the life-history, that Srraspurcer was led on these grounds to adopt a
theory of alternation, essentially the same as that previously arrived at by Bowzr, by
comparison of development and structure.

As to the nuclear changes which take place in apospory and apogamy, no facts
have yet been ascertained. The only aspect of the question which can be considered
is how far these departures from the normal are inconsistent with the assumption of
the fundamental importance of the nuclear distinction between the two generations.

Apospory presents no special difficulty on either theory. For a reduction in the
number of chromosomes, which is known to take place in the spore mother cells, may
be supposed to take place in vegetative cells. As in the former case this is associated
with the capacity of the cells with the half number of chromosomes to develop into
the gametophyte, so in the latter case the same result would presumably follow.
The cells being still in continuity with the tissues of the sporophyte, their further
growth results in the aposporous development of a prothallus. It is more difficult,
however, to see in which manner apogamy can be dependent on a nuclear change.
