4 In the original literature the results obtained are expressed in a variety of ways. For
_ conyenience all the data will here be reduced to give the values of o?. Transitions in simple
systems (i.e. systems with a single electron outside closed shells) and transitions in complex
systems (i.e. systems with unclosed shells) will be discussed separately.

3-2-1. Simple systems
The information collected on simple systems is shown in table 7. For the lighter systems
the excellence of the agreement between the results are given by the Coulomb approxima-
tion, and those given by the other methods is at once apparent. Attention may be drawn to
the fact that in many of the cases (for example, in all but the resonance transition of the
principal series of the alkalies) gross interference occurs in the transition integral, the
<t positive and negative contributions almost exactly cancelling each other.t That even in
S these cases the results are so satisfactory is very striking. There would seem little doubt that
& the wave functions obtained by using term value as energy parameters are extremly accurate.
& The Coulomb approximation would appear to compare favourably with the other
& theoretical methods. Thus, inspection of the table shows that it is not appreciably less good
‘o than theory A; it would seem to be much superior to theory B (i); and judging from the
g relative success in reproducing the experimental data for the transitions there is even some
suggestion that it is rather superior to theory B (ii)—but perhaps this should be treated with
op reserve at present.
‘= —- For the 4s—5p and 4s—6p transitions of K1 the results obtained by the Coulomb approxi-
5 mation and by theory A are essentially identical, but they do not agree very well with the
