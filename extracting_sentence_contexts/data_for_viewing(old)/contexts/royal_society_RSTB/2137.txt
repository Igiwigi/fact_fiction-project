The indices which were found are given in Table XXI. ; the sexes and “sides” are
mixed.

It would appear, however, that the mixture of sexes is not wholly justifiable, as
may be seen from Table XXII. Here the means are higher inthe female than in the
male, indicating a greater proportional breadth to the scapula in woman than in man,

Table XXIIT. gives the details as to the correlation between the infraspinous
length and breadth in 44 scapule. There is seen to be a distinct, though not a very
strong, correlation between these two dimensions.

It is a rather remarkable fact that length and breadth seldom appear to be closely
correlated. We found it so in the sacrum, it is also the case in skulls, and I feel satisfied
by observation that such will be found to be true for the long bones.

The mean of the scapular index is 65°9, and of the infraspinous index 89°4, These
results are surprisingly close to the mean values given for Europeans, which are 65°3
and 87°8 respectively.

We have seen that the question of sex ought not strictly to be neglected ; it
