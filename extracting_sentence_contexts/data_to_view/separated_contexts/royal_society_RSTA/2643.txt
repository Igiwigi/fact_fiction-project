This value is slightly larger than the value found with the back-
projection method. This result requires careful verification and could be linked to the fact that we
do not know the exact structure of the material contained between the position of the detector and
the Gran Cava. In fact, we have already identified some tunnels near the detector’s location that
cannot be easily accessed due to the collapse of material from above. The observed effect could
then be due to some cavities still present below the Gran Cava floor. Apart from these comments,
which could be important for the optimization phase of the technique, the result is positive for the
test of the methodology, which seems to also work in the case of very large volumes and bodies
with respect to the case presented in §3a.
