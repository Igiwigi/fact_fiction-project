Let {qn}n C PC({0, b]; E) and {yn}n C PC({0, b]; E) satisfying y, € F(qn) for all n and qn — q,
Yn — y in PC([0, b]; E); we will prove that y € I'(q). The weak convergence of {qn}n to q in PC([0,b];E) implies its boundedness and the weak
convergence of {qn(t)}n to q(t) for a.a. t € [0, b]. Moreover the fact that yn € I’(qn) means that there
exists a sequence {fi}, fn € PE(qn) for every n, such that for every t € [0, b],

Hence, by proposition 3.9 we have the existence of a subsequence, denoted as the sequence, and
a function f € Pr(q) such that fy — f in L1((0, b]; E). By proposition 3.11 we have that G(f;n) + G(f). Thus, we have

implying, for the uniqueness of the weak limit in E, that yo(t) = y(t) for all t €[0,b], ie. that
