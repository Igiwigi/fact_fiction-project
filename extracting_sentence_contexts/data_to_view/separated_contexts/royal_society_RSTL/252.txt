If the spectra were produced by the
ordinary dispersive force of the body, then the dispersion ought
to be least in gum Arabic, greater in wax, and till greater in
realgar and the metals, whereas in all these cases the quantity
of colour appears to be the sxame. The extraordinary spectra
have no resemblance whatever to those which are the effect
of inflexion ; and even if we could suppose that the light was
inflected by the grooves, the cause would be inadequate 'to
explain the continuance of the colour when the plane of inci-
dence coincides with the direction of the grooves, and when
there are manifestly no angles to bend the passing light. But whatever be the cause of the phenomena of mother of
pearl, the facts themselves are peculiarly instructive, and
naturally lead us to the following conclusions.

1. Besides the ordinary forces which reflect and refract
light, there reside without the surface of mother of pearl, and
of all bodies to which its superficial configuration can be
imparted, new forces which reflect light, and separate it into
its component colours,

2. The lines which bound the space of reflecting activity in
all surfaces which possess this configuration, are straight, and
are not parallel to the grooved structure of the surface.
