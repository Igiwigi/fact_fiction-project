logous results, in which different rays of the spectrum were extinguished by
effecting (as far as possible) an equilibrium between the two opposite actions
exerted upon them by the solid and the fluid media. When the blue light
is extinguished, the colour of the reflected pencil has a yellow tinge ; and it is
obvious that the resulting pencil can never have a decided colour, but must,
always be bluish or yellowish.

As the indices of refraction remain the same for all obliquities of incidence,
the tint of the reflected pencil, though it varies in intensity, can never vary in
its colour; 80 that we cannot obtain any succession of tints or coloured rings
from this partial decompoxsition of the incident rays.

These obseryations establish it as a general fact, that in all cases of reflection
from transparent surfaces, the reflected pencil must necessarily have a different
tint from the incident pencil, excepting in the extreme case where the two bodies
in contact have mathematically the same refractive and dispersive powers.

I was now anxious to observe the effect of an approximation to this last
condition, or to a perfect equilibrium of all the forces which affect the incident
rays; as it is often in extreme cases, and at a limit such as this, that nature
delights in the development of new phenomena. This experiment, however,
was attended with more difficulty than I expected ; but amid the numerous
