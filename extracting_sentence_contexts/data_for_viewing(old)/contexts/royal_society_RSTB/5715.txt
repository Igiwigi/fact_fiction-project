THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACK, GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS. 257

The fish taken for the experiments were some which had lost the secondary sexual
characters about two weeks before the experiments were made. The extracts were
injected into the epiaxial musculature of the fish.

The experiments did not show a high order of uniformity. The testicular extracts
gave in one or two cases out of ten fish a transient redevelopment of the secondary sexual
characters. The injection of the extract of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gave a
redevelopment of the secondary sexual characters lasting for about three weeks in five
cases out of eight. A second injection prolonged the fully developed state for ten days.

The most significant result of these experiments is the fact that the injection of the
extract of the anterior lobe of the pituitary caused a redevelopment of the interstitial
tissue of the testis.

Artificial Fertilisation of Gasterosteus.

Methods.—The method used in the artificial fertilisation experiments was essentially
the dry-sperm method used at most fish hatcheries. The eggs of a “ripe” female were
stripped into a clean watch-glass, and the testis, removed from the male, by dissection,
was broken over and the contents mixed with the eggs. After removal of the remains
of the testis 1 to 2 c.c. of water were added to the dish. The watch glass was placed
in a bowl containing clean tap-water at the required temperature, 10 to 15 minutes
after the experiment was begun. The water in this bowl was aerated with a very
