percentage hatched is roughly proportional to the number of eggs dealt with, the method
set forth in the table of obtaining the tinal mean percentage seemed best for comparing
A with B, since it results in each separate percentage being “ weighted ” in the final
mean in proportion to the number of eggs set.

It is true that if the numbers of eggs set on each side of the table are not identical for
each separate hatch a source of fallacy may be introduced, but in the present case the
differences are so small that they have no appreciable influence on the result.

It thus appears that the eggs which were five times turned hatched better than the
twice turned by 70 -2-59 -7, or 10-5 per cent. ; and, asin five out of the six hatches the
sign of the difference is the same, there cannot be much doubt of the significance of this
result. The further fact that the five-times turned eggs hatched on the average 1 -2 hour
earlier than the others is, moreover, consistent with their better hatching, but an hour
is not long enough to carry much weight.


404 DR. A. P. CHATTOCK ON THE PHYSICS OF INCUBATION.

As a hen moves her eggs night and day, and more frequently than five times in the
24 hours, it seemed desirable to try the effect of more frequent turning, and this was
facilitated when, three years ago, the Crowcombe farm was given up and the work
transferred to the Physical Department of the University of Bristol. Six small incubators
were there constructed, of about 30 egg capacity each, and heated electrically by some
of the ordinary units employed in electric fires, fastened under their lids above the egg
