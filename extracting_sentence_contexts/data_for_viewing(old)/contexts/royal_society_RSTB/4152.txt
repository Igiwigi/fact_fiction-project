inside the body of the animal. Nothing in the nature of the trichocysts found in
many of the Infusoria’ has been observed in the Foraminifera, but in the small
observation-tanks, on the glass sides of which I have followed the behaviour of
living Foraminifera by means of the Zeiss-Greenough tank microscope, it has been
a matter of almost momentary occurrence to see a tiny Copepod blunder against
the fully extended pseudopodia of a robust Miliolid, and instantaneously fall to the
bottom of the tank apparently dead. The Copepod is, however, only stunned, or by
some unidentified means terrified, for at the end of, at the’ most, two minutes,
it seems to stretch itself and dart off once more upon its apparently gay and

? CLAPAREDE and LACHMANN in 1858 established the fact that Lieberkuehnia Wageneri was affected by
a transition from darkness into light (C. and L. 1858, E.I.R., p. 465).

* At the same time I do not lose sight of the possibility that, the spot of light having attracted swarms
of monads (as it always does), perhaps the Gromia crawled into the circle in pursuit of them.

* Regard being had to the insistence in this paper upon the highly functional “behaviour” of
Foraminiferal protoplasm, it is perhaps desirable at once to point to the fact that no suggestion of any
specialised sensory constituent is here put forward. In unicellular organisms there is little room for
doubt that all parts of the protoplasm are sensitive to stimuli, without development of any sensory
constituent. (Cf. D. 1912, E.B., p. 188.)
