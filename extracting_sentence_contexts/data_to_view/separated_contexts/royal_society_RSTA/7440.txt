possible forms to be considered are obtained from those enumerated in §12 by merely
suppressing the extreme factors a,, 6, and replacing them by (abu). The effect of this is that
the forms denoted by accented symbols do not arise for separate consideration, since they arise
from the corresponding unaccented forms by a change of sign. We may denote the forms
so arising by the same symbols as those used in § 12, remembering that now we have the
additional relations $+.S’ = 0, where S is any one of the sixteen forms A,, ..., H).
