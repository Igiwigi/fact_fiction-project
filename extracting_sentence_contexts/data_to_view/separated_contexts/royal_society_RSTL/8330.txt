thence carried through its narrow axial channel to its 8ummit, where this has become
attached to the plasmodium just liberated from the female gonophore. When once
arrived there the spermatozoa may make their way through the terminal tissue of the
clasper, and be thus brought into immediate relation with the plasmodium, whose
investing membrane 3s at this time exceedingly thin and weak, a process which will be
obviously facilitated by the exceptional minuteness of the spermatozoa. We $hould further bear in mind that it is not until after the seizure of the plasmodium
by the claspers that we have any evidence of the phenomenon of segmentation—a fact
which renders it highly probable that the act of fecundation also takes place subsequently
to the seizure. Spermatozoa, if searched for in the cavity of the clasper, would probably
be found there ; but, short, of their detection in this situation, we have a combination of
facts about as strong as could be desired, all tending to the conclusion that the function
of the claspers is that here suggested, and offering a case in many respects parallel with
that of the hectocotyle in the Cephalopoda, or with certain phenomena of fertilization
among the Alge. EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.
