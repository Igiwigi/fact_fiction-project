Previous discussions express implicitly a question: What do we do from a philosophical viewpoint : *&
when we propose a model, precisely a mathematical model in mechanics? Summarizing some notions .
already discussed here helps us at least in delimiting the scenario. A body, we know, can suffer
recoverable and/or permanent strain. It can be damaged, the statement making sense once we
define a state that we decide be the undamaged reference. Damage can localize up to form
macrocopic cracks (the adjective referring to the human average perception without instruments).
A body can move with respect to an observer.

Constructing mathematical models of the mechanical behaviour of bodies means describing
qualitatively and quantitatively at least part of the processes listed above. A model is in fact a
representation of a phenomenon, or a class of phenomena, addressed by data but going beyond them.

To build up a model, we do not need to be an arid reporter of a single phenomenon, but
it is necessary to have sufficient imagination to evidence the possible essential aspects of the
mechanical process under scrutiny, and to connect them each other.

The construction of a mathematical model of natural phenomena has something to do with
the craftsmanship and, in its highest expressions, with art for the quality and the density of the
aesthetic content of the model itself.

The process determining a ‘vision’ from which a mathematical model emerges follows a path
strictly analogous to what we traditionally consider an artistic creation. It has its roots in the
