For example, it will be the same for sin ¢(t) and exp[sin ¢(f)], as well as
for the respiration signals as simultaneously measured by belt and by thermistor, whereas the
corresponding Hilbert phases will differ. Figure 2 shows typical phase and frequency results extracted by this method in comparison
with the values extracted by other methods. The advantage over Hilbert phase extraction is
clearly evident in figure 2c,d; in figure 2c, we illustrate the well-known fact that Hilbert phase
extraction is inapplicable to the ECG, whose phase is usually obtained using the ME method. For clarity, the ME phase is not shown, but the difference is clearly visible in figure 2e,f, where
the frequencies extracted by SWT and ME are compared. It should be noted, however, that one
might apply the Hilbert transform to the signal after bandpass filtering in the region where
the first harmonic resides, and also obtain a well-behaved phase; but the frequency calculated
from it will not, in practice, be accurate.
