region of the sorus appear to be all of the same age. Baver’s drawings suggest a
regularity of orientation, which is not, however, to be recognised as constant in
herbarium specimens.

The sporangia are not adequately represented in Baver’s drawings. In obliquity
of the annulus they compare with those of Dennstedtia. The annulus itself is almost
longitudinal (fig. 92), but with a slightly oblique course it passes behind the attach-
ment of the stalk; it is, however, variable in its induration towards the base; the
thickening sometimes stops short of the stalk, though it oftener is continuous behind
it. The stalk itself consists of three rows of cells, and it is attached as in Denn-
stedtia, It is interesting to note that the very slight obliquity of the annulus goes
along with an irregularity of orientation of the sporangia in the sorus, and it will be
subsequently shown (p. 104) how these two facts are related to one another.

Diacalpe.

In the ‘Synopsis Filicum,’ p. 45, Hooker remarks that “this genus seems more
appropriately placed with the Cyathee than with the Dicksoniex,” and in the
‘Genera Filicum’ (pl. xcix.) Diacalpe is described as “a genus very closely allied to
Spheropteris or Peranema, and differing only in the absence of the stipes to the
sorus.”

The sori were examined in herbarium material only. I am therefore unable to make
precise statements as to development; but the succession of sporangia is probably
basipetal, and there is no evidence to hand of a mixed condition of the sorus. I have
