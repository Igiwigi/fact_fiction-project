s, 31 to 36 are taken from various uteri during Stage VIIL., to illustrate. the

re-formation of the epithelium. The nuclei marked d are undergoing

division.

= shown, the two being in fact continuous there.
(932. A section through the growing point of epithelium, showing the amitotic
5 division of the terminal cell.
1.33. A section showing the flattened epithelium seen in fig. 9, and the scattered
stroma nuclei with long protoplasmic processes, below. Blood corpuscles
