'= The comparative retardation of light caused by equal numbers of molecules of

“gthe inactive gases compared with that produced with air is given by the figures on
=p. 84; on dividing by the atomic weights the retardation for equal quantities of

Amatter is arrived at :—

Helium. Neon. Argon. Krypton. Xenon.
0°0309 0°0118 0°0242 00177 0°0184

It is remarkable that if, for example, krypton be submitted to such a pressure
that its density is equal to that of xenon at atmospheric pressure, it offers nearly
equal opposition to the passage of light, a fact which is highly suggestive, when
the ultimate nature of these gases is considered.

Somewhat similar relations are found with the neighbouring series of elements if
their values are reduced to the scale of air as unity. The refractivities are far less
certain, and the results must be accepted with caution ; but the figures are ;—
