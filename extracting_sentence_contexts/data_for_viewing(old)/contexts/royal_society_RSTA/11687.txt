Thus the interval between two lines ruled ggtpp inch apart corresponds to the
passage of two interference bands in red hydrogen or cadmium light, past the reference
spot in the centre of the field of view of the interferometer telescope, a very con-
venient fact. The lines themselves are almost as sharp as the spider-lines of the eye-
piece micrometer, and there is no trace of roughness of edge; they are also narrower
than the white interspaces between the lines, so that the width of a line is less than
half a wave-length,

With the j;-inch dry objectives, specially constructed under the direction of
Mr. Conrad Beck, the resolution is excellent, and the working distance so relatively
great for so high a power as to leave a clearly visible air film between the cover glass
and the objective, quite a safe working distance, in fact, for all traversing and .
adjusting purposes. With an oil immersion objective of the same power the definition
is simply surprising.

The lines at 60,000 to the inch are not so satisfactorily resolvable without an
immersion lens, which would be inconvenient for the purpose in view ; and the rulings
50,000 to the inch are still a little subject to the same criticism. But the 40,000
rulings to the inch are perfect for the purpose, their apparent separation being so
considerable that one of the spider-lines of the micrometer eye-piece can readily be
placed between two adjacent ruled lines and still leave a clear white space on each side
of the spider-line. The sharpness of the edges of any particular line thus ruled on
speculum metal is quite comparable with that of the edges of the spider-line itself.
All these considerations, combined with the fact that 40,000-to-the-inch rulings are
