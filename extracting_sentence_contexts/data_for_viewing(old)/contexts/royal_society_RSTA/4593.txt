Like the tobacco and fossil fuel industries in later years, the electricity industry made an argument a]
that was both empirical and ideological. Empirically, the industry claimed that publically ae
generated electricity was more expensive. Ideologically, the industry claimed that government [3
involvement in the marketplace was socialistic and un-American, and that what was at stake [G
was nothing less than freedom and the American way of life. The expressed aim of the NELA ,
project was not simply to fight or support a particular piece of legislation, but to alter the
way Americans thought about private property, capitalism and regulation. To this end, they had
to persuade people that certain facts about electricity generation and its costs were not what
technical experts claimed they were, and that their own ideological claims, by contrast, rested on
factual foundations. Uncertainty created opportunities for such persuasion to occur.

To use the term ‘factual foundations’ is not to invoke a positivist conception of those
foundations nor a realist conception of scientific theories, much less to endorse an absolutist
vision of scientific truth. (David Bloor, in his recent book, The Enigma of the Aerofoil, is eloquent on
these distinctions [36].) It is rather to point out that it is in the character of propaganda to create
arguments that one knows are untrue, or at least misleading. But what defines a technical claim as
misleading? The answer necessarily involves a comparison with the conclusions of independent
experts. In this case, the dubious claims were that public electricity was more expensive than
private electricity, and that the industry had not engaged in questionable practices—claims that
experts at the time and in later years concluded were untrue.

In his ‘insider-speaks out’ narrative about propaganda in the health insurance industry,
