Remnants of the Miillerian duct are as a rule found more caudally on the testis and
epididymis than are the hydatids themselves (which the duct sometimes traverses to
open into the sac of the tunica vaginalis). In a few instances, however, the opposite
condition held, and a fimbriated hydatid covered by ciliated columnar epithelium
was situated distal to a blind duct embedded in what we have termed the Miillerian
ridge of the epididymis (e.g. O.M. 82R, p. 160). This fact raises an interesting problem. The hydatids found on the human testis and epididymis have always been regarded
as derivatives of the extreme cranial end of the Miillerian duct, and their external
covering of ciliated columnar epithelium has been easy to understand on the basis of
the direct homology of the hydatids with the fimbriae of the Fallopian tube. The
occurrence of such an external layer of epithelium would normally appear to be
restricted in both male and female to the specific region where the Miillerian duct
opens into the coelomic cavity.
