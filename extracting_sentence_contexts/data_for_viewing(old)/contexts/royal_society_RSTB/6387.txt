260 N. J. BERRILL ON STUDIES IN TUNICATE DEVELOPMENT

At the same time viviparity alone is a very great asset, but accumulation of yolk
in unprotected eggs is, if anything, detrimental. The former results in an enormous
decrease in the rate of elimination of the developing larvae, although often at the
expense of their degree of dispersion. The latter implies a decrease in egg-number
without any compensating decrease in rate of elimination.

Supporting the contention that viviparity precedes marked accumulation of yolk
are the facts that such accumulation above the average for the genus occurs among
