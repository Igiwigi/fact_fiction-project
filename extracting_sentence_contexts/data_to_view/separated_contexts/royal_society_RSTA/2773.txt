Adam et al. [97]
undertook an experimental study of tonalite from the Nuvvuagittuq belt in Canada and Johnson
et al. [98] studied TTGs from the East Pilbara. A key observation of both studies is that the
identified protolith basalts had arc-like signatures (e.g. negative HFSE anomalies) and, due to the
large extent of partial melting required [97], this is efficiently transferred to the resultant TTGs. Thus, if the question is ‘Were these TTGs formed by subduction?’, the answer is no; but if the
question is ‘When did subduction occur?’ then in both cases, the answer must be significantly
before the age of the TTGs and in fact when their protoliths were formed. The Coucal basalts


from the East Pilbara are 3.5 Ga in age, suggesting some form of subduction in this region at that
time. The age of the Nuvvuagittuq mafic rocks may be more debatable, but because these are cross-
cut by tonalites and gabbros of approximately 3.8-4.1 Ga age, 4.1Ga is arguably a minimum age
for these mafic rocks [99].
