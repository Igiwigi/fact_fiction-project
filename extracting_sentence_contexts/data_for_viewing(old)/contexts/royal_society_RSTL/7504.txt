more decided manner by Professor M11Ne-EpwarDs of Paris,

In Miles © Archiv” for 1843, p. 224, Professor HyrrL, at that time of Prague, but
now of Vienna, has a paper entitled © Veber die Caudal- und Kopf-Sinuse der Fische,
und das damit zusammenhiingende Seitengefiiss-System,” in which he refers to Dr.
MarsHALL Hall's discovery of the caudal heart of the eel, and describes his own exami-
nation of the pulsations of the organ with the naked eye, in the tail of a large eel held
against the window-pane, but says nothing in opposition to Dr. MARsHALL HALL'S
opinion of the nature of the organ.

Professor MiLXE-EpwaDs, in his © Legons sur la Physiologie et Anatomie compare,”
vol. iv. (Paris 1859) p. 476, correctly views the pulsating organ in the eel's tail as a
lymphatic heart, but adduces no facts, either anatomical or physiological, to prove that
the organ is of this nature. Te merely refers to Professor MULLER as having recognized
the organ to be a lymphatic heart.
