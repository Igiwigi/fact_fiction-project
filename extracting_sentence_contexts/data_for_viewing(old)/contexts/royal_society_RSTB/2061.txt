elements. The phloem, and even parts of the cambium, are in good preservation.
The phloem-groups are evidently placed between the angles of the xylem, so that the
structure is typically that of a root. The thin-walled, tabular cells of the phellogen
lie so close to the phloem as to leave no doubt that the periderm arose in deep-seated
tissue, and probably in the pericycle.

Direct proof of this fact is afforded by a still smaller rootlet (with a mean diameter
of scarcely a millimetre), shown in transverse section in Plate 12, fig. 19. This rootlet
retains its primary cortex, while the formation of periderm has already begun. The
xylem, though slightly deformed, is evidently triarch, and agrees well with that of
the other specimens, but in this case no secondary growth had yet taken place.
Immediately beyond the phloem, which is partly preserved, is a zone of larger cells
which were evidently undergoing active tangential division. This zone, in fact,
represents the periderm at an early stage of its development. Adjoining it, on the
outside, is a single layer of large cells, which do not fit on to those of the periderm.
We can hardly interpret this layer otherwise than as an endodermis, though I could
not satisfy myself as to the presence of the characteristic marks on the radial walls.
Beyond the endodermis comes the primary cortex, which resembles that of the root
of Lyginodendron Oldhamium in its lax, lacunar structure, the presence of ‘ secretory
sacs,” and the definite double layer of cells at the periphery.

The rootlet might, in fact, be taken for a young triarch rootlet of Lyginodendron,
if it were not for the very distinct formation of periderm, which I have never found so
well marked, even in the oldest roots of the latter plant.* The specimen, on the
other hand, agrees so closely with the Medullosa roots now described, that there can be
