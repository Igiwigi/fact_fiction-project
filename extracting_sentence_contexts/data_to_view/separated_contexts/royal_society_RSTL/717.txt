For the
balsams are defined as bodies composed of resin and benzoic acid ; consequently the
latter, when obtained in a separate state, is considered as an original ingredient or educt. I am however inclined to a contrary opinion, for I consider the balsams as

peculiar substances, which, although nearly approaching to the nature of resins, are
nevertheless different in respect to the original combination of their elementary prin-
ciples, which combination however is with much facility modified by various causes,
and especially by a certain increase of temperature, so that a new arrangement of the
elementary principles takes place, part being formed into resin, and part into benzoic
acid. ,
Many facts appear more or less to swpport this opinion ; for whether benzoic acid is
obtained by simple sublimation, or by merely digesting benzoin in boiling water, accord-
ing toGeoryroy's method, or by the addition of lime, as recommended by Scnzt1e,or
by employing alkalis in a similar manner, nothing positive can be inferred from any
of these operations to prove that benzoic acid is obtained as an educt, but rather the
contrary, when we reflect on the affinities which are most likely to prevail under the
circumstances of the different processes, and on the yariable proportions of*the benzoic
acid ; and although benzoic acid has been discoyered in the urine of infants, in that
of many adults, and constantly in that of graminivorous quadrupeds, such as the
camel, the horse, and the cow, ( Sys!eme des Connoissances Chimigques, par FourÂ»
coy, 4to edit, Tome IV. p, 158) yet all this certainly appears to be in fayour of its
being a chemical product,

but oxalic acid when formed in any considerable quantity,
seemed absolutely to prevent the formation of this substance; for
whilst abundance of the former was obtained from gum arabic,
tragacanth, manna, and guaiacum, not any of the latter could
be produced. Common liquorice appears at first to be an exception, but
from the smallness of the quantity and the colour of the
precipitate which it produced with solution of isinglass, I am
almost convinced that the tanning substance was formed by the
action of the nitric acid on a portion of uncombined carbon,

in sulphuric acid, that a great quantity of beautifully crystallized white benzoic acid
was sublimed during digestion ; and as it is produced in $0 yery pure a state by this
single and simple operation, I would recommend a trial of the process to those who
prepare benzoic acid for commerce; but I am not certain whether this mode may prove
more economical than those which at present are employed.
