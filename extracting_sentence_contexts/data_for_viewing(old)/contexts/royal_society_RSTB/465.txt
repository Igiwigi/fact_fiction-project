ganglia (in Elasmobranchs) are at first simply swellings on the main branches of the
spinal nerves, some way below the ganglia. . . . I have been unable to find a longi-
tudinal commissure connecting them in their early stages, and I presume they are at
first independent, and become subsequently united into a continuous cord on each
side.‚Äù He also derives the suprarenal bodies of Elasmobranchs from the sympathetic.
Other observers, Brunn (16), K6nniker (17) and Braun (18), have shown that the
medullary parts of the suprarenals are derived from the sympathetic, the cortical parts
from undifferentiated mesoderm.

Scuenck and Brrpseit (14), working with Chick, Dog, and Human embryos,
came to the conclusion that the ganglia are derivatives of the central nervous system,
and are pushed out from the spinal ganglia. Their paper is not, however, convincing ;
the illustrations do not clearly express the meaning of the text ; and the facts adduced
do not appear to justify the generalisations at which they arrive.

Onopt (15) has given the most complete account of the development of the sympa-
thetic. His researches cover all the classes of vertebrates. In fishes he studied the
question in Scyllium vanicula, Mustelus levis, Seymnus, and Torpedo. In the first
only he describes the earliest appearance of the sympathetic ganglia. as thickenings on
the ventral ends of the spinal ganglia. These thickenings are composed of large cells,
which stain deeply, are arranged in rows, and are sharply marked off from the pale
mesoderm cells, By the further growth of this bulbous expansion the sympathetic
ganglion is formed, remaining in connexion with the spinal nerve by a double row of
cells. In the other examples, the commencement of the gangliated cord was not
discovered ; in the youngest specimens examined the ganglia were fully formed, and
