The foregoing theory of the harmonic relation shows that if we have a point-pair

(a, 6, eXw, y)*=0,

the equation of any other point-pair whatever can be expressed, and that in two different
ways, in the form (a, 8, eXz, y)*+(lx+my)'=0;

the points ({/7+my=0) corresponding to the two admissible values of the linear Zune:
tion being in fact the harmonics of the point-pair in reaper to the given point-pair
(a, 6, eX#, y)*=0, or what is the same thing, the sbiconjugate points of the involution
formed by the two point-pairs (see Fifth Memoir, N 0. 105), The point-patr represented
by the equation in question does not in itself stand in any peculiar relation to the given
point pair (a, 6, Xx, y)*=0 ; but when thus reprezented it is Said to be inscribed in the
given point-pair, and the point {x+my=0 is said to be the axis of InSorlÞtion. ; And the
harmonic of this point with respect to the given point-pair (that is, the other SIbiconjugate
point of the involution of the two point-pairs) is said to be the centre of inscription *.

inscribed point-pair in the form
(a, 6, eXw, y)* (a, b, eXw, y')* 8in? 8—(ac—tH#)(ry'—a/yY=0,

where we have for the axis of inscription and centre of inseri

ption respectively, the
equations
ay'—oy =P,

(a, b, eXw, yXw', y')=0. Or in the equivalent form,

(a, b, eXw, y)\(a, b, eXw', y)* cos? 8— {(@, 6, cXz, yXu', y')}*=0,

where we have for the axis of inscription and the centre of inscri
equations

ption respectively, the
(a, 6, cXw, yXw, y)=0,
ay—a'y =0:
The equivalence of the two forms depends on the identical equation
(a,b, Xa, yY(a, b, Xe, yY'—{(a, b, cXr, 9Xw', y)}*=(a0—V*)(ay/ —a'y);
which is in fact the equation mentioned, Fifth Memoir, N
(a, b, cX#, y)*=00,
(a, 6, Xx, yLwx', Y)=01=10,
