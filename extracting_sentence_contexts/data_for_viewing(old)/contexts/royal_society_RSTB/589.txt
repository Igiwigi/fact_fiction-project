the posterior cornu and extends to the tip of the central white matter of the occipital

Sregion, its fibres presenting the appearance of points, 7.e., cut across (fig. 34, C.f.).
a In all these sections (figs. 23-34) the cut-across iil lies behind the cornu
mmonis or hippocampus major (C.A.), and as we descend in the sections this becomes
more developed, and at the same time the cingulum becomes flatter in appearance.
t is in contact posteriorly with the tract of calcarine fibres (C,f:) which are here
ontinued along the inner wall of the posterior ventricular cornu; on the outer side
Sof the cingulum is the forceps major (#'.J/.), from the splenium corporis callosi, which
Bas now sanched the posterior surface of the cornu Ammonis (fig. 29) ; its inner end
rojects into the cortex of the gyrus hippocampi, where it comes into contact with
‘the superficial fibres of this gyrus (S,f,, fig. 29). In the above arrangement the forceps
‘Gnajor is readily distinguished from the cingulum by the fact that its fibres are
gso much more deeply stained.
‘2 In fig. 35 we have the superficial fibres (Sf) of the gyrus hippocampi very well
“dnarked, situated along the posterior edge of the dentate or hippocampal sulcus (H.S.)
Sind with a horizontal direction, which later becomes descending. They lie just in
Aront of the cingulum, arching round it, but no definite connection can be made out
between them at this level.
g The principal axis of the cingulum (as seen in these sections), which had been trans-
"gverse, how assumes more of an antero-posterior direction, the external end cine |
“the more posterior (figs. 34-38).
The calearine fibres prolonged backwards along the inner wall of the posterior cornu
ave now (fig. 35, Cf) a more horizontal direction, namely, outwards and backwards,
and at right angles to the fibres of the forceps major, which is now (fig. 37) beginning
