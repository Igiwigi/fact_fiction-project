On referring to Table V. it will be seen that at this stage occurred the first
great fall in the percentage of phosphorus. It had sunk to half the normal. Further evidence that not only dissociation of the lecithin molecule into its
constituent parts, but also removal of the products of'such change had begun to occur,
is derived from the fact that at this date most choline was found in the blood (see
tracing, fig. 9). Up to this point increase in the nuclei of the neurilemma had been looked for
without success. It was now seen very well (see fig. 22).
