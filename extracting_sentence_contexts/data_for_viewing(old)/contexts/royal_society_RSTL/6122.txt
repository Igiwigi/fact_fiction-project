Tn the figure I have given the general aspect of the bands, but not their number.
Thirteen of them exist on the Glacier du G6ant. I may add that the bearing I have
assigned to this glacier differs from that assigned to it on the map which accompanies
Professor ForBrs's © Travels on the Alps,” and which I had with me at the Montanvert.
The reason is, that on the map the true north is drawn on the wrong side of the mag-
netic north, thus making the * Declination *” easterly instead of westerly. I have since

I learned that this error is corrected in the smaller work of Professor ForBrs.

S It has been affirmed that the dirt-bands cross some of the medial moraines of the Mer
2 de Glace, and they are thus drawn upon the map of Professor Forses. Were this
= correct, my explanation would be untenable ; but the fact is, that the bands are confined
to the Glacier du Geant from beginning to end.
