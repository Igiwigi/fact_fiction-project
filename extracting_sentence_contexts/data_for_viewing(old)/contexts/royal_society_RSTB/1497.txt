st, it was necessary to note the volume of the diluted water in which the impreg-
tion was performed which was poured in each jar, and calculate and allow for the
ase in the size of the larve thereby produced. The variation in the size of the
urye due to the effects of impregnation alone are given in the last column of the
ab le. As the values are not very consistent, it is not possible to come to very
efinite conclusions as to the effects produced, but it will be seen that, as a rule,
regnation in diluted water exerts a harmful effect, whilst impregnation in con-
sentrated water exerts a beneficial effect upon the subsequent development. The
ean decrease produced by the diluted water is 1°5 per cent., and the mean increase
the concentrated water, 1°6 per cent. As the corrections due to the dilution of
e water of development are so large, it is possible that the apparent effect produced
impregnation in diluted water is only due to experimental error, and does not
ist in fact. In two out of the six observations with concentrated water, a decrease
the size of the larvee was produced, but as both of them were made in the same
ertilisation, viz., that on September 25th, they have not much more weight than a
5 single observation. It may thus be looked upon as highly probable that a favourable
eflect upon the subsequent growth of the larvae is produced by impregnation in con:
trated water. This seems a curious result when it is remembered that. concen-
> trated water acting during the whole period of development produces no effect at all,
‘or else a slightly harmful one.
_ As slight changes in the salinity of the water produce such considerable effects
npon the growth of the larvee, it may be of interest to examine to what extent the
ecific gravity of sea-water varies at different times and places in nature, The
ific gravity of the water used in these observations was determined several times,
md found to be on an average 1°0271 at 15°56 C. From the determinations by
