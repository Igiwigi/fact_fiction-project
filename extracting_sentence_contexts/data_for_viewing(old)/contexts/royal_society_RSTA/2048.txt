Here, subscript 1 denotes the fact that at X=0, the concentration is equal to 1. If Co(t) is an
arbitrary function, then the concentration of the contaminant in the fracture can be obtained by
using Duhamel’s formula [31]

The explicit presentation for the function C(t, X), when at the fracture’s inlet the concentration
of the radioactive solute reduces exponentially, ie. Co(t) =e~“4t, can be obtained by analogy with
the derivation of the formula (3.35). It can be readily shown that
