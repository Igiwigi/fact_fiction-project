6. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS. If now the conclusions from the facts ascertained in this research may be shortly
reviewed, they are as follows :â€”

1. In any case of facial paralysis due to division or compression of the facial nerve,
the best procedure, should spontaneous recovery fail or be deemed impossible, is to
attempt restoration of the damaged nerve.

2, Should efficient restoration of the nerve be impossible, or be deemed impossible,
anastomosis with the spinal accessory or hypoglossal holds out most favourable
prospects of recovery, given that the facial muscles are still recoverable from the
point of view of duration of complete severance from the nutritive influence of the
central nervous system.

3. Of the two substitutes, spinal accessary and hypoglossal, when the latter is used
the restoration appears to commence sooner, but there does not seem to be a great
difference in the ultimate result of the two substitutions, as far as the recovery of
the face is concerned,
