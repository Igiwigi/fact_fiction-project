points of both axes. Further, if we suppose the mean of the two characters to be the
same, this 45° line will pass through that mean, and will serve for the line AB of the
above investigation. In this case we must take tan y = 1, and consequently (1xi.)

We can even, when the mean is a considerable way off the 45° line, get, in some
cases, good results. Thus, the correlation in stature of husband and wife worked out
by the ordinary product moment process is 2872. But in this case E, = 382-062
E, = 806°425, and this gives the correlation ‘2994. On the other hand, the actual
ratio of variabilities is 1°12, while (lxix.) makes it 2°76! This arises from the fact
that the errors in E, and E,, due to the mean being off the 45° line, tend to cancel in
EK, + E,, but tend in directly opposite directions in the ratio of the cosines. Similarly
the correlation between father and son works out ‘5666, which may be compared with
the values given in Illustration V. below, ranging from ‘5198 to °5939. Again,
correlation in eye-colour between husband and wife came out by the excess process
‘0986, and by the process given earlier in the present Memoir ‘1002. But all these are
favourable examples, and many others gave much worse results. We ought really only
to apply it to find o,/0, when the means are on the 45° line, as in the correlation of the
