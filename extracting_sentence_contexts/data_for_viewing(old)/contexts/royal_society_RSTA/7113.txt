for different lubricants and it has been shown earlier in this paper that such differences
do in fact exist. Similarly the amount of tearing that occurs between the surfaces
will largely depend on the extent to which the lubricant film has broken down during
sliding, and as has already been mentioned, marked differences are observed in the
appearance of the track for different lubricants. According to this view the frictional
behaviour and the wear between the lubricated surfaces are largely determined by
the ability of the lubricant film to prevent metallic contact.

Further experiments with different combinations of metals should afford confirma-
tion of this theory. The more plastic the metals, the smaller will be the pressures in the
region of contact and hence the less the extent of breakdown of the lubricant film. The
position is complicated by the fact that the strength of the adsorbed film will vary for
different metals, and also by the fact that at the points where the film breaks down
three distinct types of metallic junction may occur, depending on the nature of the
metals. Nevertheless, in general, we might expect that as metals of greater plasticity
are employed the protection afforded by any lubricant would become greater, the
frictional behaviour tending more and more to resemble that shown by long-chain
fatty acids on steel.

It has been shown that the extent of the wear varies for different substances but that
even with the best lubricants some tearing of the surfaces is observed. The sliding effects
are therefore not confined to the adsorbed layers of the lubricant but penetrate deeper
and cause abrasion and distortion of the underlying metal. In addition, elastic inter-
action of the surface irregularities must be taking place continually during sliding and
this may be an important factor determining the frictional force. As in the case of
