faint but appeared to have an objective reality, while Beriey describes the effect as
that of “an irregular film of pink jelly.”

It appears that extremely thin films of gold are, by surface tension, drawn up into
green patches, leaving larger areas covered by an almost transparent, but faintly red,
film. The effect on the unaided eye is that of a transparent green.

The silver leaf used by BernBy was over 300 pp thick. It therefore comes well
inside the range for which the analysis of § 10 applies. Now Table VIIL, or fig. 9,
shows that, for amorphous silver of normal specific gravity (u = 1), nx/d is least for
the more refrangible rays. Again, Table IX., or fig. 11, shows that, for » = 1, M, is
greatest for the same rays. It follows therefore, from equation (23) above, that, on
both these accounts, the light transmitted by silver leaf should be blue; and, in fact,
silver leaf transmits.a deep blue light. The approximately equal values of the
reflecting power, Ry, shown in Table IX., or fig. 13, for » = 1, correspond to the
almost colourless reflection from polished normal silver.

Consider now the colour changes which, according to figs. 8 to 18, deduced from
the calculations of § 10, should accompany a diminution in the density of gold and
silver films from its normal value (4 = 1) to zero (u = 0). This diminution of density
may be conceived either as an increase of the distance between adjacent molecules or
as due to the aggregation of groups of neighbouring molecules into small spheres.
For geometrical considerations show that so soon as two spheres form adjacent to one
another in an otherwise amorphous mass of metal, the density of the mass must begin
to diminish. And it has been shown that the calculations in question are applicable
