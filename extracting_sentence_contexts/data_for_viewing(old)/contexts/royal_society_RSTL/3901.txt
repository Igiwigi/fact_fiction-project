papers:—* The two theories between which philosophers are divided with respect to
the origin of voltaic electricity, are still the subject of lively controversy ; when we
are adyerting to the pile itself and to hydro-electric currents, we cannot deny the
superiority of the chemical theory ; the recent labours of Faravay have, moreover,
added powerful arguments in favour of this theory ; but it must be acknowledged
that it is not easy to defend it when we advert to electricity of tension developed in
the contact of two heterogeneous bodies, especially if the two bodies are solid.”

FarapayF, who has recently instituted a series of elaborate researches in support of
the chemical theory, writes thus of it :—< The theory assumes that the particles of the
di-electric (now an electrolyte) are, in the first instance, brought by ordinary induc-
tion into a polarized state, and raised to a certain degree of tension or intensity before
discharge commences, the inductive state being in fact a necessary preliminary to
discharge.” Again, © One point is, that different electrolytes or di-electrics require
different initial intensities for their decomposition. 'This may depend upon the
degree of polarization which the particles require before electrolytic discharge
commences }.”

Grove, in a recent communication to the Royal Society, in allusion to the action
of the gas battery, says, © If, indeed, the contact theory assume contact as the efficient
cause of yoltaic action, but admit that this can only be circulated by chemical action,
I xee little difference, save in the mere hypothetical expression, between the contact
and chemical theories; any conclusion which would flow from the one would like-
wise be deducible from the other; there is no observed sequence of time in the phe-
nomena, the contact or completion of the circuit and the electrolytical action are
