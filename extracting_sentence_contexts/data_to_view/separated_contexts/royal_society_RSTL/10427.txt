The
first is that a speed indicator of this kind may be placed in any part of the ship and
communication made electrically, as was done in the above cage. The second is that
the slight and irregular variations in velocity which in most speed indicators, such as
the strophometer of HEARS0N and the tachymeter of Buss, necessitate special arrange-
ments of springs to diminish the oscillations of the index hand, are nob recorded with
this kind of instrument. This latter fact is the result of the gradual action of the
screw, which may, however, be 80 arranged as to cause an indication of any required
degree of sensitiveness. It is nob necessary to further describe the instrument, which
suffers from the inherent defects of the disk and roller, and the principle of which the
author found had previously beer suggested by two correspondents in © Engineering,”*
and very possibly by others. Quite recently (May 24) a speed indicator of this kind
was exhibited before the Physical Society by Mr. W. Gorpex and Sir A. CAMPBELL,
in which the disk was replaced by a cone, and on the same occasion Mr. N. BAILEY
described a speed indicator of his own which was no other than the 8imple disk and
roller applied in-this way.t

Enough has been 8aid to show that a great many attempts have been made to
employ for practical purposes the invaluable principle of the disk and roller in two
distinet ways, one of which is the converse of the other.
