No such adhe-
8ive property is ever found in crystalline surfaces, 0 far as I am aware. Tt is gu@ colloid
that ice appears to be adhesive. The discovery of Farapar's, of the adhesive quality of
ice, is the fundamental fact of the glacier discussion, The name *regelation ' applied
to it may, however, be objected to, being quite speculative, and implying, as it appears
to do, that two pieces of ice come to be cemented together by the freezing of a film of
water between them, instead of simply adhering perfectly and uniting as two pieces of
plate glass might do. The great fact, however, remains, and the name is but a trivial
matter.” T also thought it right to inquire of Mr. GRanam the exact meaning he intended to
attach to the word ** demonstrated ” in the last sentence of the above quotation from his
memoir.
