identical lipid compositions, the bilayer architecture strongly
influences folding rates and efficiencies as demonstrated by
the observations that small unilamellar vesicles support more
efficient folding of uOMPs than LUVs [14,22,32-34]. And
more recently, folding acceleration was observed to be
catalysed by bilayer defects created within a single lipid com-
position and architecture [35]. Danoff & Fleming conducted
folding of OmpAj7; in DMPC LUVs from just below (20°C)
to just above (26°C) the phase transition temperature. Over
this minute temperature range, folding was dramatically accel-
erated at the lipid T,, while extremely slow both below and
above this temperature [35]. The significance of this result lies
in the fact that gel and fluid phases of a lipid bilayer coexist
at the T,, with a heterogeneous boundary where they meet.
Membranes are well known to be more permeable to solutes
and to contain defects at the T,, [36-39]. Notably, the accelera-
tion of uOMP folding in vivo may represent a previously
unrecognized role for this membrane conformation.

A physically sensible mechanism for the BAM complex
would be one that capitalizes upon the physical conditions
that are known to accelerate the intrinsic folding reaction for
OMPs. From the large body of work described above, the cre-
ation and/or stabilization of membrane defects would be one
such mechanism. Remarkably, when the structure was
