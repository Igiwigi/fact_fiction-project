or exclusively, made up of epidermal cells, and occur for the most part in cells which
have been derived from the epidermis (figs. 17-19).

Intumescences made up wholly or chiefly of epidermal cells resemble the spherical
type in consisting entirely of thin-walled cells (mostly colourless and of epidermal
origin) which contain oil, but differ from them by their broad insertion, which involves
greater injury to the leaf.

In Gmelina hystrix (fig. 9) sections of the small outgrowths mentioned above
(see p. 236) show that they also consist chiefly of epidermal cells which have become
enlarged, with little or no cell division.

No oil or starch was observed in the enlarged cells. This fact seems to indicate
that the disturbance of the normal metabolism caused by the formation of these
small intumescences was only slight, but it is possible that, under other conditions,
the outgrowths might become larger and their contents different. In the formation
of most intumescences the mesophyll plays the chief part.

epidermis and palisade were both affected, the latter only slightly, the cells being a
