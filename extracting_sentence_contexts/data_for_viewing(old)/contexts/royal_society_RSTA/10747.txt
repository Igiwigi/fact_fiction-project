Now the increment of current dC contributes to X a quantity proportional to
(dB/dH). dC/dt. Thus although, for a given value of C, dC/dt is much greater
during the fall than during the rise of the current, because dB/dH for the iron of
the choking coil is much smaller during the first than during the second stage, yet,

for specimens of high permeability, (dB/dH)? is enormously greater during the
second than during the first stage. Thus, for a given value of C, the product
(dB/dH)?. dC/dt during the first stage is small compared with its value during the
second stage. Hence by far the greater part of the eddy current loss occurs during
the rise of the current. In fact, if the choking coil have a core of the same iron as
the specimen and be similarly wound, and if the current be reversed in the manner
described in § 15, the eddy current losses during the fall and subsequent rise of the
current are proportional to RX area adb and (R + T) x area ac‘b’e respectively, the
areas being shown in fig. 1. Thus the main part of the eddy current loss occurs
during the rise of the current ; this part is very nearly proportional to E. The eddy
current loss during the fall of the current is indeed only roughly proportional to E,
but it is small in comparison with the loss during the rise of the current. Hence the
total eddy current loss during a semi-cycle is nearly proportional to E, and thus can |
be determined approximately by the formula X = (U’ — U) E/(E’ — E), as explained
in § 15, since Y is now negligible, and X is thus sensibly equal to Z.

As illustrations we now give two examples kindly furnished us by Mr. R. L. Wits.
