+ The photograph of the upper face of the Breslau specimen shows that this fragment also contains as
much as the stele as the Chemnitz fragment, which is contiguous to it.

differs in the absence of the long spidery arms so characteristic of that genus, and in
the much greater development of the “ mixed pith.”

As stated, the final form of the petiolar trace is decidedly like that of Clepsydropsis.
There is not the least sign of a curvature, and the peripheral loops are so placed that
the strand has two planes of symmetry, one radial (anteroposterior), the other tangential.
In view of these facts, it is surprising that the leaf-trace at its origin is a solid or nearly
solid strand, and the peripheral loops usually do not make their appearance till after
the protoxylem has bifurcated. There is thus no stage quite corresponding to the
flattened ring of “ C.” australis, nor is there at any time the remotest sign of a curvature
in the leaf-trace. The different stages in the formation of the leaf-trace can be followed
in a single cross-section of the trunk by comparing strands more or less removed from
the stele. As we have seen, some of these stages recall the condition in Asterochlana,*
but the details will be described later. The supply to the appendages of the primary
rachis arises in very much the same manner as that described for ** C.’’ australis ; the
structure and mode of branching of the aphlebiz is also very similar.

The roots in the central region of the trunk are mostly seen in more or less oblique
longitudinal section, only a few being cut transversely. They take their origin in the
