Moreover, since any distortion of the main-
chains implies a contraction, the primary fold alone will reduce the average length of
an amino-acid residue to something shorter than the 3-5 A. found in silk fibroin, in
which, on account of the insignificance of the side-chains, — H and — CHs, the primary
fold is negligible. For @-keratin we may conclude that the primary fold reduces the
average length of an amino-acid residue to 3-38 A. The gross fold in the main-chains which appears when 6-keratin contracts to
a-keratin we may term the “secondary fold”; its orientation follows from the fact
already pointed out, that the “side-chain spacing,” 9-8 A., is found in both the
a-and the 6-photograph, though the latter shows in addition the “ backbone spacing,”
4:65 A. It seems clear, therefore, that the secondary fold is formed in a plane transverse
to the side-chains, the general direction of which is kept more or less unchanged during
the transformation. The most reasonable stereo-chemical change to satisfy the
quantitative requirements of the transformation, viz., an intramolecular period of
5-1 A. in the folded chains of «-keratin, an average residue length of 3-4 A. in the
extended chains of 8-keratin, and a resultant increase in fibre length of approximately
100%, has been given above in the section on General Interpretation.
