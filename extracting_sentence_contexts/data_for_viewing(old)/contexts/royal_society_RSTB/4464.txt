This means that, for a pair of muscles weighing 0°16 grm., 1 mm, deflection is given when 0-4 grm.-cm.
of work is absorbed by the muscles and degraded into heat. A full deflection of 6 cm. could be produced,
therefore, by the absorption of mechanical work to the extent of 24 grm.-cm. This is a more expressive
way of stating the sensitivity, as it is clear that 24 grm.-cm. is of the same order of size as the work done
in stretching the muscle 1 cm. with a load (say) of 100 grm., whereas 0:0036 calories has at first sight no
obyious relation to the same quantity.

In most of the experiments the thread connecting the muscle to the lever was free
in the tube ; in a few of them, however, the narrow part of the tube (about ? mm.
diameter) was filled with vaseline and the thread moved in the vaseline. The vaseline
had the effect of reducing the irreversible rise of temperature following the reversible
fall of temperature caused by unloading the muscle. This fact is of interest in
confirming the theory as given here, and will be discussed below.

(3) Discussion or THERMAL EXPERIMENTS.

Since the phenomena described are susceptible to some degree of an exact treat-
ment by the methods of thermodynamics, it may be well to put on record here a
deduction of the equations for a finite extension of an elastic string. We have
thought it better to employ the conception of “free energy,” rather than that of
“entropy,” as being more intelligible to the average reader. The principle involved
is to calculate A, the free energy, 7.e., the maximum work which could be done by an
extended string, and then, by the second law of thermodynamics, to equate dA/dT
to Q/T, where T is the absolute temperature and Q is the heat absorbed in the
