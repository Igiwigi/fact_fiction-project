a rate of 1.12 x 10-5 cm*s~!. However, this only increased the CHO concentration by 27% and
decreased the CH3OH concentration by 42%, which is not the order-of-magnitude change needed
to bring the model into quantitative agreement with the measurement. However, it did improve
model accuracy significantly, and deserves further exploration.

Another explanation for the disagreement may lie in the methyl peroxy submodel.
Consumption of methyl peroxy radical has not received nearly the same degree of attention as
the initial methyl] radical reactions. Reaction (4.11) has only been estimated [67], whereas (4.12)
and (4.13) were each measured once [68]. In the model, all three rates are those suggested in
[67]. If (4.11) is decreased, the reaction flux shifts towards the production of methoxy radical,
which will increase the relative concentration of formaldehyde when compared with methanol.
The model was recomputed with a factor of 5 decrease in (4.11), but the relative concentration
of formaldehyde to methanol was minimally affected owing to the fact that most of the methoxy


is recycled to methyl radical, which loops back to the production of methanol (figure 7). Thus,
changing (4.11) has a non-monotonic effect on the formaldehyde to methanol ratio. In the original
paper measuring (4.12) by Slemr & Warneck [69], the reaction is suggested to proceed through an
alternative reaction pathway that results in the direct formation of formaldehyde

CH30) + Hâ€”> CHO + H,O (4.15)

which is dominant over the channel recommended by Tsang ef al. [67]. Tsang et al. determined
that surface reactions in the Slemr & Warneck measurement were responsible for the observed
formaldehyde concentration, and thus dismissed any contribution from (4.15). However,
