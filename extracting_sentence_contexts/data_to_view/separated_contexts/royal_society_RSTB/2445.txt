This is still more marked in the Bears and common to a
number of the lower Mammals. The Coati, like the Bears, has a Membrana nictitans,
which it only uses when sleepy. The resemblance of the Racoon to the Polecat and
of the Coati to the Bears, as well as the fact that all through the Mustelide, Pro-
cyonidee, and Ursidee we find the erystalline appearance of the pigment in the
fundus, and the concentric arrangement of the lens fibres already referred to, shows
that, with the exception of the Canadian Skunk, the classification according to the
eye agrees with that of Gapow which I am following.

7. Urside.—The Syrian (Ursus syriacus), the Black (Ursus americanus), the
Malay (U. malayanus), and the Sloth Bear (Ursinus malursus) have practically the
same fundus; a central area covered with yellow patches and a purple or purple-
brown densely-pigmented peripheral area. In the Black Bear and the Sloth Bear,
orange pigment is distributed on the border line between the two zones, and in the
Malay Bear the peripheral pigment extends into the green in the form of light
purple patches.
