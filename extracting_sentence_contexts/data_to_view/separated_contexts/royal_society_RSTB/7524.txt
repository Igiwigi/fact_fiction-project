In the earlier stages of development of man the internal maxillary artery lies medial to
the mandibular nerve, but later a secondary vessel is formed lateral to the nerve and this
finally becomes the main artery. The lateral relation of the internal maxillary artery to the
mandibular nerve is seen in the artiodactyls, but in the cat, although there is a smaller
vessel lateral to the nerve (the vessel arises from the inferior dental artery), the main artery
lies medial to the nerve. The fact that the stapedial artery has no connexion with the internal carotid artery at
a level corresponding to the position of the intracranial rete indicates that the development
of the rete must occur at a relatively late stage. Tandler (1906) showed that the rete in the
