A. ABEL ON FIRED GUNPOWDER. But although certain minor points may, as we have said, require considerable cor-
rection, we have little doubt that the main theories upon which we insist—confirmed,
as they are, by experiments made or facts obtained under an almost infinite variety of
cireumstances—must, be accepted as very approximately correct. Tt is satisfactory to
find that the laws which rule the tensions and temperatures of gases under ordinary
ciremnstances do not lose their physical significance, but are till approximately applic-
able at the high temperatures and pressures we have been considering. At all events, whether we are right or wrong in taking this view, it appears to us
certain that the rules and tables we have laid down, based on our analyses, experi-
ments, and calculations, may for all practical purposes be accepted as correct, and may,
bearing in mind the restrictions to which we have referred in this memoir, be applied
to nearly every question of internal ballistics,
