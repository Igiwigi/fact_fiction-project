In another similar experiment the cross difference changed, in a series of 32 exci-
tations, from —0'011 D. to +001 D., the second phase (positive deflection) diminished
from +210 scale to +90 scale, while the first phase (negative) increased from —15 to
—220. (6) When (3) was repeated with the difference that the lengths of wire were
respectively 3 feet and 5 feet, instead of 1 foot and 2 feet in two series @ and b, 80 that
the currents conducted through the leaf were, in series a, only sufficiently strong to
produce the effect (2), viz. : a single positive deflection, whereas in series b they were
sufficient to give rise to an excitation, it was observed that in series « the electrical
relation between the upper and under surface remained unaltered, but that in sories b
the diphasic variation was followed by an after effect which 8ubsided with the usual
increase of the cross difference already described and exemplified,

The preceding facts may be summed up as follows :—The closing of a voltaic current
directed from the upper to the under surface of the leaf of Dionzwa produces different,
effects according to its strength. Very weak currents give rise to feeble polarization,
Currents of moderate strength produce a transitory increase of the cross dif ference,
that is, make the under surface more positive to the upper surface than it was before.
Strong currents produce this transitory increase of the cross dif ference, but, in
addition, produce an excitation which is followed by a lasting increase of the cross
difference. In the 8uccessive deflections observed, these two effects are 8gurmmed ; 80
that the negative phase is diminished and the positive phase increased.

The explanation of these phenomena depends on the meaning to be assigned to the
remarkable modification of the electrical state of the leaf produced by moderate currents,
On this point we can only express ourselves negatively. It is not analogous to an exci-
