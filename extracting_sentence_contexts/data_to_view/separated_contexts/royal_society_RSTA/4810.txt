I observed in 1887 that an electro-deposit of iron on a clean copper plate wiil adh
so firmly to it that when they are severed by force a copper film is actually strip
from the copper plate and remains on the iron, thus affording clear evidence of
interpenetration of metals at the ordinary temperature. I found that this interpe:
tration of copper and iron will take place through films of electro-deposited nickel
Mytivus and Fromm have shown that metals interpenetrate and form alloys when
are precipitated by electrolysis from their aqueous solutions.t
The diffusion of metals in each other must be closely connected with the evaporati
of solid metals or alloys at temperatures far below their melting points, and it will b
well before describing the new experiments on diffusion in solid metals to briefh
recall the facts which are already known. It is not necessary to go further back ft
definite views on the subject than to the time of Boyix,{ who thought that “even sue
(bodies) as are solid may respectively have their little atmospheres,” . . . “for”
he adds, “ no man, I think, has yet tried whether glass, and even gold, may not in
length of time lose their weight.”
