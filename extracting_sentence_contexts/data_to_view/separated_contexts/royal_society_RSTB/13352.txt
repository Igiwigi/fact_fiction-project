The results for mean relative errors in table 1 allow us to
propose a hierarchy of methods and baselines, as follows:

BTF, md < RBF, BTV, RBV, BRW, Div < rand, centr

To construct this hierarchy, we first ordered the methods and

We first look at results for the different methods as distances sequently, we applied a pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum
in km (as the crow flies) from the true to the inferred home- significance test to assess the differences between neighbours
lands. For the Bayesian methods, we initially ignore the fact in the hierarchy and replaced the smaller-than sign by a
that they provide a set of plausible homelands, i.e. inferred comma when neighbours were not significantly different at
areas rather than single locations—for the purposes of a the 0.05 level. This step caused BTF/md, RBV/BRW /diversity
quantitative performance comparison it is necessary to oper- method (Div) and rand/centr to merge. We then iterated this
ate with a single location whose validity can be assessed as a procedure, also replacing the less-than sign with a comma
number.
