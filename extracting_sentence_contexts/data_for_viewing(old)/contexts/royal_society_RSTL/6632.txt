really mean the same thing as regelation? It can only be answered, I think, by saying
that, whatever might be the intended meaning of those expressions, they failed to convey
to the minds of others the most remote idea of regelation as a property of ice at a
particular temperature. No better proof can be given of this than the general con-
viction which appeared to flash across the mind of every glacialist when he first heard

of Dr. 'TyxpaLlL's experiment, that the recognition of the property of instantaneous
regelation was a well-marked and important discovery, which had at once completely

removed a great stumbling-block in glacial theory. In fact, the viscous theory assigns
no physical cause for the reunion in question, All we could do, before the publication
of those experiments, was to infer from the observed facts that ice did possess ome
property which facilitated the reunion of separate pieces in contact ; but this was like
the attempt to define viscosity by an appeal to the phenomena which that property was
intended to explain.

6. An imperfect plasticity in ice has sometimes been spoken of. The fact is, all solid
bodies might be said to have an imperfect plasticity, if we chose to admit this vague-
ness in scientific language, since all are capable of greater or less extension or compres-
gion. As to the apparent plasticity inferred from the motion of glacial masses, and
arising from the crevicing of the ice, I have explained that it has no relation whatever
to real plasticity, Such crevices are the necessary consequences of the external forces
