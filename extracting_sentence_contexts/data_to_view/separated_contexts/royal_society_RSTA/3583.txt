By focusing on Eveny and Inupiaq peoples, we pay attention to Arctic vulnerabilities (social
and ecological) which bring small-scale (alternative) and large-scale (industrial) processes into
mutual view. Callison [16] recently noted the relative infrequency with which ‘the Arctic’ was mentioned at
COP21. In fact, it was not mentioned in the final Paris agreement at all. If one considers (as the
authors do) that the Arctic is an uncontroversial planetary driver of environmental conditions—
and that as a minimal ecosystem its particular vulnerabilities render changes impactful at
dizzying speeds, this is worrying; if one regards the region as the potential source of (ever-more)
tantalizing resource riches in an ice-free future, there is considerable interest in toning down what
is often dismissed as sensationalist rhetoric.>

made the same point in a more general way.

they thought the Arctic was a recipient rather than a driver.
