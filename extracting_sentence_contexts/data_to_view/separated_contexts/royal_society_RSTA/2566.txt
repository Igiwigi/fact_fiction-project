For me, Mathematics is also largely driven by observation
and experiment. In Physics, you can afford speculations, mathematical guesswork usually stays very concrete and specific. Before becoming mathematical theorems such things as the asymptotic law of distribution of primes, or Dirichlet’s theorem
on primes in arithmetic progressions, and thousands of other similar results were experimental facts. It is exactly the possibility
of instantly switching the register, and checking weird speculation against irrevocable facts of life, that makes Mathematics
so unique. I am not trying to question the uppermost historical significance of Euclid’s book, which
questioned the standards of proofs accepted before that time, and which set new standards for
many centuries to come.
