that is, make the under surface more positive to the upper surface than it was before.
Strong currents produce this transitory increase of the cross dif ference, but, in
addition, produce an excitation which is followed by a lasting increase of the cross
difference. In the 8uccessive deflections observed, these two effects are 8gurmmed ; 80
that the negative phase is diminished and the positive phase increased.

The explanation of these phenomena depends on the meaning to be assigned to the
remarkable modification of the electrical state of the leaf produced by moderate currents,
On this point we can only express ourselves negatively. It is not analogous to an exci-
tatory effect, for it is not capable of propagation : it is not identical with the after effect
for it is transitory : i is not a polarization effect, for its direction is always the game as
that of the cross difference whatever the direction of the current which produces it.
This fact also makes it impossible to identify it with Kuxker's currents. The
utmost that can be stated with reference to it is, that it indicates the occurrence of a

local change in the path of the current, which is probably of the same nature as that
which, when stronger currents are used, excites a propagable explosion,

By the experiments already related it has been shown that when a leaf is traversed
by a voltaic currenb in a direction vertical to its surface for a short period (one-tenth
of a second to a second) from the upper to the under surface, excitation follows as
500n as the difference between the two electrodes applied to the two surfaces of a leaf
