The paper by Siegel e¢ al. (this issue) showing REM sleep in the platypus may also be said to stem from
early observations: George Bennett (1835) kept two nestling platypuses for some weeks, and during that
time he noted that when they were asleep they often appeared to be dreaming of swimming ‘their forepaws
in movement as if in the act’. Juvenile platypuses would, therefore, seem to be ideal subjects for the study of
REM sleep in monotremes, rather than the adult, possibly elderly, echidnas I supplied for Allison et al.
(1972) whose research results proved to be negative. This present paper dispels that notion that monotremes
do not have REM sleep: in fact the platypus have more REM sleep than is known in any other amniote, be
it reptile, bird or mammal. Other factors that favour the use of juvenile platypuses are that they are easily
caught in the water in February and that they go to sleep readily. Two papers in the collection are from disciplines new to platypus research: palaeontology, and relation-
ships based on DNA.
