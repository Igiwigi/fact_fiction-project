'= In a considerable number of pipes the internodes are divided longitudinally by
g plain bands bounded by fine lines that extend along the whole length of the internodes.
& The intermediate patterned bands are divided by transverse spaces or bands, which
Â© usually are plain; thus a patterned band contains a longitudinal row of separate panels. s The distinction between longitudinal and transverse bands is due to a different
5 conception in the lay-out of the decoration which usually is more clearly expressed in
A pipes from other areas. As a matter of fact this real distinction is not very obvious in
many pipes from the Rigo district, as in both groups the patterned bands in most
pipes are broken up into panels and the panels may be decorated in a similar manner. In some, but not in all, pipes the bounding lines of the median dorsal plain band
diverge at the fore end to accommodate the dorsal hole. In some pipes the dorsal hole
bears no special relation to the decoration.
