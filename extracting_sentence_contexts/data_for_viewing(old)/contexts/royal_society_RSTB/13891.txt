the figure, we see that the expectations are, in fact, overesti- a

relative to the true value is substantial, resulting in an esti-
mate twice as large as that which would have been
obtained using an accurate estimate of Fsy. For high mutation

By deriving a similar second-order Taylor approximation for
the expectation on the right-hand side, as we did earlier with

rates, this bias decreases rapidly as Dxy increases. For a low E((dx + dy)/dxy), we get
