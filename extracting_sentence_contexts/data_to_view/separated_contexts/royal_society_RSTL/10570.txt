The two simplest surfaces which can be formed with swch an apparatus are the

Sylinder and the sphere. The fact that if they change their shape they become

-pnduloids or nodoids has, of course, made the mathematical theory of the experiment

505 complicated. The justification of the particular method adopted is, however, to

Se found in the fact that liquid eylinders offer such much greater facilities for

Sbtaining a completely black film than any other geometrical form, that every other

_—_— has been made to give way to this, which, for reasons to be detailed
ereafter, we conceive to be of prime importance. Tn the following pages we shall deduce from the aesumption that films of different
thicknesses bave different surface tensions the conclusions to which it leads, and shall
then 8ubmit to the test of experiment the question as to whether these conclusions are
in accord with the observed facts. On the Sensitiveness of the Methods of measuring Changes in the Surface Tension
of a Film.
