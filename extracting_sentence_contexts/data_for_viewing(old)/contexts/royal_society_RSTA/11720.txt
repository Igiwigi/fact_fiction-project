waves: it may be represented, as in Part II., § 11, by the formula

C€=k(m' d/dt+o)D;
K’ = 1+ {3 + (d/dt)" ©} /B,

thus simply adding to the formula for the square of the index of refraction the terms
— (kiv’ + kp e'r)/(m"p* + 0”), which satisfactorily represent the general features
of metallic propagation as was shown in Part IL, § 11.*

It is noteworthy that as the period becomes very rapid the effective index ot
refraction always approximates to unity; so that very short waves will not suffer
sensible reflexion, refraction, or diffraction even while their length may include many
molecules of the material medium. In fact when the period of the radiation is
sufficiently high, the free periods of the polar molecules are not quick enough to
enable them to respond,t while the comparatively free ions are prevented by their

we now have

(* For example, it explains why the real part of «? is negative for metals. In Part II. the generally
received contention (based on a narrower theory) that x? cannot be negative for purely elastic, that is
dielectric, media was admitted without examination: but it is obviously inconsistent with the discussion
above. As a concrete illustration, for a stretched thread weighted with equidistant particles, the
square of the velocity of propagation of transverse waves of sufficiently short periods is negative: yet
no inference follows as regards instability. ]
