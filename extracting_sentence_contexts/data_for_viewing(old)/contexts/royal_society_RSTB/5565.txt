stomata were absent from the spines. These negative observations are confirmatory
of views that have been expressed by previous investigators (HALLE, 1916; Epwarps,
1924) that these structures were not specialised organs of assimilation and should be
regarded as ‘‘ emergences”’ rather than “ leaves.”

Some other facts give further support to this view. One is the apparent irregularity
of position of the spines, and especially the way in which examples of the most diverse

sizes may be found attached close together on the surface of the stem. Another set of
facts concerns the terminal region. It has been pointed out that there are features
which render it possible, or even probable, that the tip of the spine was in some way of a
glandular nature. If this were so, we should be dealing with an axis clothed with secretory
emergences. The facts given in the body of the paper do not amount to a demonstra-
tion of this presumption, but they all appear consistent with it, and it is difficult other-
wise to account for the occurrence of spines with open tubular tips, not due to accidental
fracture. Whatever the ultimate decision as to the physiological nature of these
structures may be, the objective features shown by the tips of the spines, such as
dilation at or just behind the actual tip, presence of dark resistant material within the
tip, opening of the tip, and the presence of a clear, empty, cuticular or epidermal tube
in this region, are highly peculiar and characteristic. They afford definite points for
comparison with other remains, where these are sufficiently known.
