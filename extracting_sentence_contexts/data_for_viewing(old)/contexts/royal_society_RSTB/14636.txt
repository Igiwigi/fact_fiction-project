This, I would like to suggest, is the qualitative marker of
the transition to the human condition: the emergence of col-
laborative computation. It was a transition in computational
individuality. The uniqueness of our cultures—the fact that
they are innovation-based and cumulative, and the fact
that they rely on shared values, norms and _identities—
should be attributed to this revolutionary change. Social
learning, cooperation and mind reading are not enough:
they are still solitary capacities. To stabilize a way of life
based on the inheritance and further development of the
collective wisdom of past generations, our ancestors had
to begin to connect their nervous systems on networks of
collaborative computation.

We usually think about the collective capacities of the
apes as the precursors to ours—which they definitely are—
but now we can think about them in another way: as
