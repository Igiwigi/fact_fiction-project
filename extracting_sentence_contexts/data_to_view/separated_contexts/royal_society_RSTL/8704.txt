Now, referring to the equations (4), (6), and
(7) of Q 3, and to the process there used for the elimination of the quantities relating to
the quadrie V (7.0. 6, 12, 13,..), it appears that, when the contact subsists for a single
point only, we have available for the purposes of elimination the relations

0=01: 0=1=02: 0='2=.. ,

0=10:1*0=12: 159 —Xe
Consequently we cannot eliminate, in the manner there effected, the quantities relating
to the quadric V from any of the six equations derived from the forms U=0, oOVvV=0,
OU=0. We may, in fact, by means of these equations, determine six out of the nine
constants of V, but that is all. When, however, P is a quartitactic point, we have the four additional equations, 8ay

ten in all. From one, or two, or three of these we may, by means of the equations
04,U=0, OiVU=0, 0 2U=0,

eliminate one, or two, or three of the quantities 0: 23, 0: 31, 9: 12, and obtain conditions
of the form
