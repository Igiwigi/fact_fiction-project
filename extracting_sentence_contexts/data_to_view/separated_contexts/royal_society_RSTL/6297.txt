ON THE FORMATION OF THE EGG IN THE ANNULOSA. 623

© In describing the s0-called © winter-ova” of Lacinularia 8ocialts, Professor TLUXLEY
8$ays®, © It will be observed that all these authors consider the winter-oya, or .ephippial
ova, and the ordinary ova to be essentially identical, only that the former haye an outer
case. The truth is that they are esxentially different structures. The true ova are
single cells which have undergone a special development. 'The ephippial ova are aggre-
gations of cells (in fact, larger or smaller portions, sometimes the whole of the ovary)
which become enveloped in a shell, and simulate true ova.” This aggregation of seyeral
cells (one of them putting on the appearance and fulfilling the functions of a Purkin-
jean vesicle, and the whole becoming enveloped in a shell) is, however, the ordinary and
ly method of egg-development in many animals. In the Trematode and Cestoid
Avorms, and the greater number of the Turbellaria, the yelk and the Purkinjean vesicle
re formed in two separate organs. In Piscicola, according to Leyp1G, the mature egg
Fontains, besides the Purkinjean vesicle and the ordinary yelk, a number of nucleated
Scellsf.
5 In the Mites and Spiders, in Chelifer, Obisium, the Phalangide, and, 80 far as I know,
zl the Arachnida, the egg is the product of a single cell.
