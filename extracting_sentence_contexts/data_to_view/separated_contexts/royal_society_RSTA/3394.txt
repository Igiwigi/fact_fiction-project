Appendix A. Relationship between lattice points and binary strings :z
The approach we follow here requires to find a binary description of paths: we provided such : S
description by choosing a suitable binary encoding in equation (3.3) which also simplifies : -
the evaluation of functions involving products of matrices giving the general formula of :y
equation (3.7). Then, we also need to obtain a criterion telling us which paths have the same : ~
endpoints x’ and x; in order to do so, we employ the fact that the BCC lattice is Abelian: each path : 3
is described by a quadruple (n+1,2,n43,n+4), where ns) counts the number of steps in direction : &
h,) and thus each path must satisfy the system : ES

Ss

Ya - n_))hi =x —y! I

(Al)
and Ya +n_})=t. I

The binary encoding and the quadruple (n41,n+2,n+3,n44) are then related by the following
constraints:
uw) =n_1+n2+n3+n_4,

ow) = 1 + 1g +13 +14 (A2)
and uw®)) =n +n3+n_2+N_4,
where (w) := yet wx denotes the set-bit count of the string w.
