5°292, 97161, 8°918, very close to those determined from the displacements. The
individual deviations from the mean are quite small for F,(), considerably smaller
than for the others. It is, therefore, the more reliable. The mean deviation in
magnitude is ‘28 and the maximum is —‘97 in m=7. We may take it therefore
that the. true value of the F, limit is 30725°30 within a few decimals. The
separations given by the deduced limits above are 1864710 and 829°64.

These very accurate values afford a means of testing as to their source. If the
limit were known to be a single number there could be no doubt as to its belonging to
the d sequences, or as to the series being of the F type. But there is just the
possibility that it may be a composite number, comprising one or more links—say, p or s
terms—and that the separations may be due to oun displacements in one of them.
The suspicion that this may be the case is aroused by the fact that the triplet 17615,
18447, 20312, which would be the origin of the d or F() term, and in which
therefore the first two lines should behave as satellites do not show complete sets with
the separation 1778, 815, as they should do if normal satellites. Moreover, the
intensity order with the middle line much more intense than the other is not normal.
There is no test for the composite nature of 30725, but if it be really so, the most
probable source would be p=S(), or some near collateral of this. We will
therefore test this as 51025°26+¢, where € may be considerable, so as to include near
collaterals, and also test 30725 as a d sequent. We will take the latter first.

At the start it may be noted that it is an argument in favour of 30725 being
directly the source, that displacements by small multiples of the oun have fitted in so
remarkably closely and frequently in the formation of the list of lines above.
