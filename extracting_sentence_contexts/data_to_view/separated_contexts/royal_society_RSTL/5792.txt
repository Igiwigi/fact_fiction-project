The rock is dense and compact in its lower part, but vesicular towards the
surface, from which a covering of pumiceous scoriw appears to have been washed away. The width of the
lava is 200 feet, and it was traced for about 250 feet down the lope of the cone. Dips of 15? and 25* were
5een in the 80lid continuous layer, which is very modern with reference to the Peak and the uppermost of
all the layas on the ridge where it occurs ; but powerful streams of till later date, having an aggregate depth

© After reflecting on these and other analogous facts, T was desirous, before publishing
in detail the observations which Mr. HarTuxG and IT had made in Madeira and the
Canaries, to revisit Vesuvius and Etna, which T accomplished in the autumn of 1857. Tn studying Mount Etna, my attention was principally directed—Lst, to the lithological
character of those modern lavas which have consolidated on steep slopes; and 2ndly, to
the question whether any proofs can be found, in the position of the ancient lavas and
tuffs of the great volcano, in favour of the doctrine that the upheaving rather than the
eruptive force has exerted a dominant influence.
