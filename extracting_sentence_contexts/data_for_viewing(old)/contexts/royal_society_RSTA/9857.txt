The Local Circulation.

When it first became possible to obtain correct observations of the temperature up
to 5 or 10 km. height, it was supposed that a few years’ observations would show the
mechanism of a cyclonic storm, and enable us to say to what it was due. This
expectation has not been fulfilled.

There were two theories to account for these storms—one, due to FrrReEn, that a
cyclone consisted of a current of warm ascending air at the centre, which current
drew in the air from neighbouring districts and, aided by the directive force of the
earth’s rotation, produced the characteristic whirl; the other, due I think to
Dr. Hann, was that they were eddies in the general circulation, just as small water
eddies are formed in a swiftly flowing stream. The facts brought to light by
registering balloons do not, so far as Europe is concerned, favour either hypothesis.
The cyclone is cold, not warm, and the strong upper westerly current in which the

eddies were supposed to be formed is often non-existent, for balloons after rising to a
great height frequently fall near to their starting point or to the westward.

It must be borne in mind that the velocity of the air in a vertical direction, save
over small areas as in thunderstorms, is very small. It is more conveniently measured
in feet than in miles per hour, and the principle of the equation of continuity shows
