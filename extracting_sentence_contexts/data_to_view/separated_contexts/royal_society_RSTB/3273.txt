Again, it might be contended that the original phyllotaxis was alternate and that
the shortness of the alternate internodes of the main stem of alternate-leaved Cheno-
podiaceze is merely a case of correlation, and represents the necessary transitional
stages between the opposite insertion of the cotyledons and the alternate insertion of
the foliage-leaves. Against such a view may be urged: (i) The various
considerations and facts cited in Part I of this paper. (ii) The similar nature of the
internode and displacement sub-curves of branches, where no such transition is
indicated. (iii) The agreement of the displacement sub-curve with that concerning
the displaced branches of the Boraginaceze or displaced leaves in Scrophularia.
