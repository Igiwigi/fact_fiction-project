Tue experiments described in this paper arose from the desire of Sir ARTHUR
W. Ricker to obtain, in connection with his researches on the nature of the Earth’s
magnetic field, further data concerning the properties of such magnetic materials of
natural origin as may be present in appreciable quantity in the Earth’s crust. Tron of cosmic origin contains nearly always an appreciable quantity of nickel, and
the magnetic properties of this material, especially their variation with temperature,
have received very little attention. Most of the published data are qualitative only,
and from them no very definite conclusion can be drawn beyond the fact that meteoric
iron appears to be of very variable permeability. It was, therefore, thought desirable
to make a careful quantitative study of a typical example ‘of such material. §2.
