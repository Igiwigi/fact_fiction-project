The series however in Kr is not nearly so well developed as in
X. As has been already seen there are only three sets of observed pairs (m = 2, 3, 4)
and these give for F (0) respectively values of 30674째77, ...7'27, ...7째16. Since a
displacement of }, produces a*change of 2째03 in F() the first may be due to the fact
that the line taken for F (2) is really (3d,) F(2), when the true mean would be
30677째81. It is natural to seek further as to the existence of summation lines
corresponding to our last three examples. The result shows a most remarkable
agreement.
