While the case of Znotheru is comparable with the inheritance through one parent
in Echinoderms, the direct influence of the mother on the form of the seeds is a
phenomenon of another nature. Referring to the latter cases BavrEson (5) says:
“This group of cases introduces us to several points of interest. We have first the
remarkable fact that the mother plant can impress varietal characters on her offspring
by influences which are not heredity in the ordinary sense. Seeds are in botany what
larvee are in zoology, and no example is yet known in which the maternal impress
extends beyond the seed stage. But without any serious stretch of the imagination
we may suppose that a maternal impress may be such as to produce a lasting effect,
at least for the life-time of the immediate offspring.” We would rather say, however,
that seeds in botany may perhaps be compared with embryos in zoology, but not
with larvee.
