6. B-cell-related cancers often have stereotyped
B-cell receptors

As many as 30% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukae-
mia (CLL) have stereotyped BCRs of various types [51]. As
early as 1989, it was appreciated that multiple individuals
could have CLL with BCRs encoded by the VH1-69 gene seg-
ment. Later, the Chiorazzi laboratory [52] and independently
the Burrone group [53] found that the entire VH gene and
CDR3 junction were highly conserved between multiple
people with CLL. Restriction for the light chains encoding
the BCRs in CLL was also noted [54]. In fact, approximately
1% of CLL patients express essentially identical tumour-
associated immunoglobulins [55]. Another study found
restriction for VH4 genes, including the autoreactive VH4-
34 gene in CD5 + IgG + CLL B cells [56]. As described in
ยง5, VH4-34 is well known for encoding autoreactive BCRs
that bind to polylactosamine [42-44]. A critical observation
was that discrete subsets of patients would have stereotyped
receptors, suggesting that various CLL tumours would have
occurred in an antigen-driven manner [57-60]. For example,
subsets of CLL patients had lymphomas restricted for similar
VH3-21/Iglambda-encoded BCRs [59], or for the VH4-34,
VH4-39 or VH1-69 stereotyped receptors, each with similar
