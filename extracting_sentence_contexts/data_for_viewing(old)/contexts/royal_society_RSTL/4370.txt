like reasoning is in all cases applicable.

27. It may be remarked, that for any given partial differential equation, or 8ystem
of such equations, there will be always a finite number » such that given y inde-
pendent integrals every other integral is a function (in general an irrational function
only expressible as the root of an equation) of the y independent integrals; and if to
these integrals we join a single other integral not. a rational function of the » integrals,
it is easy to see that every other integral will be a rational function of the »+1 inte-
grals; but every such other integral will not in general be a rational and integral
function of the »+1 integrals ; and there isnot in general any finite number whatever
of integrals, such that every other integral is a rational and integral function of these
integrals, 7. e. the number of irreducible integrals is in general infinite; and it would
seem that this is in fact the case in the theory of covariants.

28. In the case of the covariants, or the invariants of a binary quantic, A, is given
(this will appear in the seque]) as the coefficient of a” in the development, in ascend-

ing powers of x, of a rational fraction = where fx is of the form

(1=2)*(1—a**,,(1—a*)*%,

and the degree of gz is less than that of fr. We have therefore
1+Ar+Ag?+ =
and consequently gx=(1—a)*-*(1—a%*%,,(1—a*)%-*%#(1—a#*1)-%+1,,,
