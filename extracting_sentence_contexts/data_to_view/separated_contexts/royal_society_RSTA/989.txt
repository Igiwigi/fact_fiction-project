The SP particles (figure 2a) show their typical rod-like or fibre shape with
a high aspect ratio: the particle length/diameter is around 1 ym/0.1 1m, although both length
dimensions present a great polydispersion. In the composite particles (SM, figure 2b), spheroidal
granules of magnetite nanoparticles appear attached to the surface of the SP particles. In fact, the
EDX (electron dispersive X-ray) microanalysis carried out in the same SEM microscope clearly
demonstrated the presence of significant amounts of iron atoms: the peaks of Fe had practically
the same intensity as the Si ones. The pictures of the SMA particles (figure 2c) show that the
alginate layer favours a more smooth surface texture than that in the SM particles. More interestingly, for the goal of the present work, figure 2d shows the microstructure of
the magnetic hydrogel (Ferrogel-1).
