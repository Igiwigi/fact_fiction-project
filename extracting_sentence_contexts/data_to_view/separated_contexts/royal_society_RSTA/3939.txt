To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that
showed a distinct temporal trend of atRAL and A2E between dystrophic and healthy eyes.

(e) The quantitative effect of stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium transplantation

At present, no treatments are available for photoreceptor degeneration in AMD patients although
preclinical studies have shown that transplantation of viable stem cell-derived RPE cells can
mediate anatomical and functional photoreceptor rescue in RCS rats [6-9]. While we would expect


to observe increased levels of photoreceptor-specific long-chain PCs, PEs and PSs in eyes injected
with stem cell-derived RPE, the effects on other classes of metabolites are more difficult to predict. In this study, the results showed that DHA-lipids can in fact be rescued by RPE transplantation. Figure 4e is a pNLC that extracted the neutral loss of 141.018 Da from MS/MS spectra of all
selected precursors in the MS/MS analysis. The loss of fragment 141.018 Da is a characteristic
neutral loss in MS/MS fragmentation of PE species and this identification method has been
described previously [18].
