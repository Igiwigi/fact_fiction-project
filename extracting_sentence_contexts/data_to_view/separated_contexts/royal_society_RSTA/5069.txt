Comparing it with ferro-manganese, we have band for band belonging to manganese,
2 and line for line in the iron spectrum, exactly reproduced. There can be no doubt
whatever that both iron and manganese are freely volatilized from the slag. Con-
sidering the small proportion of manganese in hematite pig, and the fact shown
in Diagram I, that the manganese in such metal is all converted into slag during the
first five or six minutes, it is evident that the continued brilliancy of the manganese
spectrum during the “boil” must be entirely due to its vaporization from the slag. In order to connect the disappearance of this spectrum with the chemical change
: involved in the decarburization of the iron, we must consider the falling off in intensity
of the line spectra during the close of the “ fining stage,” before the final drop of the
flame, and it will be seen that this can clearly be due to no other cause than a fall of
temperature, consequent upon a reduction in the quantity of carbon burnt. The
thinness, transparency, and want of brilliancy in the flame at this period is due to
the comparatively small quantity of carbonic oxide in the issuing gas; the final drop
being caused by an escape of oxygen into the vapours and gases within the converter,
which is signalized by a cloud of fume, ‘The removal of the carbon from the metal
causes the disappearance of the manganese bands.

Let us now consider the case of the Dowlais “ blow.”
