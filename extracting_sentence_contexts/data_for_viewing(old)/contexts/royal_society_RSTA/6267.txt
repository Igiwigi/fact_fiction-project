huge privilege. Much has been said about Adrianâ€™s extraordinary, game-changing contributions
to statistics, especially to Bayesian statistics. What may be less well known is that Adrian is also
a genuinely nice guy, with a warm heart and a wicked sense of humour. He made a profound
and lasting impression on many of us who had the good fortune to interact with him early in our
professional journey. We are forever grateful!

]. Introduction

The United States has the highest rate of incarceration among developed countries. According to
official national statistics, about 630 per 100000 persons were behind bars in the United States
in 2021. By contrast, the proportions were 214, 130 and 70 per 100000 in Australia, England
and Germany during the same period, respectively. The reasons behind mass incarceration in
the US are many and complex, and beyond the scope of this work. One salient fact, however,
deserves mention. Incarceration at this scale is bound to result in a high number of wrongfully
convicted persons. While the exact number is unknowable, innocence organizations estimate that
there are between 20000 and 200000 persons in prison today for crimes they did not commit.
In the last three decades, over 3200 innocent persons were exonerated [1], but not everyone
has been so fortunate. Several wrongfully convicted individuals have been executed before their
innocence could be established [2]. A leading cause of wrongful convictions is the use of ad hoc,
subjective methods to evaluate evidence, and the exaggerated claims by expert witnesses during
trial (e.g. [2]).

Highly publicized failures in the application of forensic technologies including microscopic
hair comparisons, the analysis of bullet lead and forensic bitemark analysis in the early part of
the century [3] led to the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM)
