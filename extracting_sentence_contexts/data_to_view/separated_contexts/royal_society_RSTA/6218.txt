Spherical plots of the chain stretch for each reference orientation in the N;—N) plane (a) and N>—N;3 plane (b). The angle variable 6 is an extension of 6 to the interval 0 < @ < 2zr, in order to uniquely represent all unit vectors in the
¢ = 1 /2planewitha single variable. Note that the scale in (6) is three times larger than that in (a). (Online version in colour.)

a special case (6 = 1), reads
dr =M-UPM. (3.4)

Moreover, introducing a r-norm-like operation with r > 1 a real number, the latter expressions can
be unified as
dy =(M- UP M)"’” (3.5)

In fact, relation (3.5) includes the models (3.2)-(3.4) and the one in [35] for r=2, r=2/f, r=1

and r= f = 1, respectively, which differ in the general case of arbitrary M. However, for chains

oriented along the Lagrangian principal directions, i.e. for M = Nx with k = 1,2,3 referring to the

eigenvectors of U, the relations (3.2)-(3.5) coincide independently of the values of f and r, and
give

Apts AC = |EN;|P 3.6

rh> Ay = |ENg| (3.6)

for any of the three directions Nx. Any of these four non-affine definitions of the chain stretch
could thus form the basis of a molecular statistical interpretation of Ogden’s model provided in
[16].
