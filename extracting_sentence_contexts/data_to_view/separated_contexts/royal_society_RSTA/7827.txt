Since D is very small, these quotients tend to a constant value (2.e., B) as J decreases. D was then calculated for each vibration state in the following manner. The value, D,.
appropriate to the equilibrium state of the molecule was first obtained from the expression

D.=— 1 D, was then calculated from the formule

where the symbols have their usual meanings in band spectrum notation.*

Some difficulty was occasioned by the fact that in this case neither B, nor «, are
accurately linear functions of v, as assumed in the definitions of « and a,, with the
consequence that neither of these quantities is strictly constant. The correction to
B which is in question is so small, however, that it appeared to be quite satisfactory
to use mean values for « and «,. D, having been determined, it becomes possible to calculate the term involving it,
subtract this from the observed combination difference and thence derive an improved
value of B.
