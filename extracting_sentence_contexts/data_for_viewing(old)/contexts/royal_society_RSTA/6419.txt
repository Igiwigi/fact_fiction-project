(c) The second law as a law of disorder: the mechanical world view gets life support with
Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of the second law

(i) Boltzmann and the ‘infinite improbability of order’: the world as a gas in a box

The active macroscopic nature of the second law presented a direct challenge to the mechanical
world view that Boltzmann tried to meet by reducing it to a law of probability following from
the random collisions of mechanical particles. Following Maxwell, modelling gas molecules as
colliding billiard balls in a box, Boltzmann noted that with each collision non-equilibrium velocity
distributions (groups of molecules moving at the same speed and in the same direction) would
become increasingly disordered leading to a final equilibrium state of macroscopic uniformity and
microscopic disorder, the state of maximum entropy. The second law, Boltzmann argued could be
reduced to the fact that in a world of mechanically colliding particles disordered states are the
most probable. Because there are so many more possible disordered states than ordered ones, the
system will almost always be found either in a state of maximum disorder, the macrostate with
the greatest number of accessible microstates, such as a gas in a box at equilibrium, or moving
towards it making transitions from disorder to order ‘infinitely improbable’ [13]. Molecules, wrote
Boltzmann,

2In a revisionist move most modern texts have changed Clausius’ word ‘strives’ to ‘tends’ making it seem to conform to
Boltzmann/s statistical view of the second law, a view which Clausius did not share.
