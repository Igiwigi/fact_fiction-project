reversion to a simian character, for the pilastric femur is essentially human. Here, then, we appear to have a character which is produced by the direct action
of use, and probably any hardy race of hunters would exhibit the flattening to a
greater or less degree, A tibia assumes its platyenemic form only after puberty,
and it would be exceedingly interesting to know whether this character, which seems
to be purely “acquired,” could be inherited. Some years ago, Mr. ArtHuR THomson* drew attention to the fact that in many
savage races a facet could be found upon the anterior margin of the articular surface
of the tibia with the astragalus. He also noticed that, in the tibiee exhibiting these
facets, the external condyloid surface was frequently flattened, or even convex. These characters he attributed to a frequently-assumed squatting posture.
