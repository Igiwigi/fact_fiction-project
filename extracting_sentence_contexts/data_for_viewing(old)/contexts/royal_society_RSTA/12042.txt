tions which have been taken at several stations of the survey from Cape Comorin wu
to the table lands of the Himalayas, and also at islands in the ocean and points on
the coast Jines; they have been connected with pendulum observations in England
Russia, and America.

Full details of the principal operations of the Survey, as completed as a whole fi
all India, and finally reduced, are given in the “ Accounts of the Operations of th
Great Trigonometrical Survey,” which are published in the Survey Office at Deh
Dun, in Northern India. These volumes give the measurements of the base-lines _
and of the principal angles, the astronomical latitudes, the electro-telegraphic longi-
tudes, and the pendulum determinations ; they also show the steps which have been
taken to make the triangulation consistent throughout with the smallest possible
disturbance of the facts of observation, and they give the final results which have
been obtained in each instance. Of these volumes, sixteen have now been published —

in large quarto, the tirst appearing in 1870. They contain both the work which has
been done by the Survey as a contribution to geodesy, as well as what has been —
executed as a basis for the topography of India, But they are thick, bulky volumes,
and are not very readily accessible, though they have been widely distributed to
public libraries. The results of the geodetic operations may, however, be summarized —
and capitulated in a comparatively small space; it seems desirable that this should -
be done, in order to place them within convenient reach of all mathematicians wishing —
to investigate the figure of the earth. I have therefore extracted from the published —
volumes all that is of essential importance in relation to geodesy, and added to it
several latitude determinations which I have recently received from the Survey and —
