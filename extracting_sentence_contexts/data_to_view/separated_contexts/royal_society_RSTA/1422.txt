The final deter-
minant for the evaluation of A,, Ag, etc., and B,, Ba, etc., is therefore as shown in
Table X.

This determinant appears to be soluble, for there are twice as many unknowns as there
are calibrations and also twice as many equations as there are calibrations. But it has been shown that any determination of the relative position of the points on
the bar can be represented by a graph which still possesses two degrees of freedom. Hence, the above determinant must possess two redundant equations, and, in fact, if
the coefficients of any term such as Ay or By be summed either in the « equations or
the @ equations, it will be found that all the sums are equal to zero. In other words,
one of the « equations and one of the $ equations are not independent. For example, take the coefficients of Ay in the « equations.
