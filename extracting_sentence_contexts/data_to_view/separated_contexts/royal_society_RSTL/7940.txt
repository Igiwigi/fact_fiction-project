degree, the equations above written (52) cannot be satisfied except on the conditions
3V=0, 2V=0, .. 33,V=0, .., which are in fact the conditions for superficial contact.

' There is another more general way in which the subject may be regarded. In fact if
&, Þ, y (or, if we prefer s0 to state it, if A, B, C) no longer have the significations
originally given to them, but represent the differential coefficients of an auxiliary
surface W ; ay, if .

d,W=u, d,W=v, ©,W=w, ©,W=k, . . . , ._. (64)

then the equations

V=0, (ud,+13, +w#,)V=0, (ud, +v3,+w,V=0, . . . . . (55)

will no longer express the conditions for two-, three-, . . pointic contact of the curves of
section made by the plane («, 3, y) or the plane (A, B, C), but the contact of the
curves of section made by the surface W, And as the surface W is perfectly arbitrary,
the formule will apply to any curve drawn at pleasure from the point P on the s8urface U. It is to be borne in mind that in expanding the expression for three-pointic contact we
shall obtain
(us, + ..Y=(ud, + . .Jud,V + (43, + ..)v8,V + ..
+(0}+V3+ .. 2uv8,8,+ ..)V ;

but in the only case which possesses much interest, viz. when the two-pointic contact at
the point P is superficial, we have 3,V=0, 3,V=0, 3,V=0 ; and consequently

(ud, + ..)V=(u3+v3Z+ .. 2uv3,3,+ ..J)V, «31 i= +1 </ lege) IBN

which is of the same form as the expression derived in the case of plane sections.
