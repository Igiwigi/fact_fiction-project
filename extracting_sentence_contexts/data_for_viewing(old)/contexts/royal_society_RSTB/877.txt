section of the iridocyte itself is entirely obscured. The internal structure of the
iridocyte itself is not merely finely granular or homogeneous, but appears to consist of
parallel plates passing obliquely from the outer to the inner surface.

When the iridocytes are examined in a slice of skin cut parallel to its surface, so
| that their outer surfaces are seen, a small circular aperture is seen in them. Some-
times it is in the centre, sometimes near the edge, sometimes it is on the edge, and
_ then it is no longer an aperture, but an emargination. Occasionally the emargination
_ of one iridocyte is opposite to that of a neighbouring one, as though the two had
recently been formed by the division of a single parent element. All these appear-
= ances suggest the idea that the circular aperture is really a nucleus—the nucleus of
a the original cell in the body of which the opaque substance has been deposited.
8 Povcuer, in fact, speaks of the appearance of the circular aperture as due to a
ig § spherical nucleus ; he is describing the iridocytes in the skin of the upper side of the
By Turbot. In the Flounder the iridocytes measure about 10 by 20 » in breadth and
3 length by 5 p in thickness.

F The section of the iridocyte shows a narrow elongated central space surrounded by
faite opaque substance, which is transversely striated as though consisting of thin
plates placed parallel to one another, and vertical to the surfaces of the element. In
z superficial aspect the opaque substance is seen to form groups of parallel lines, the
ES direction of each group forming angles with those of other groups. Presumably these
iE lines or rods are the edges of the plates seen in section. Poucuer’s description of the
-2 same appearance in the iridocytes of the Turbot is as follows :—Within the cells are
