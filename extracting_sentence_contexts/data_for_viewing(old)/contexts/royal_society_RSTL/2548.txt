*tember, and the maximum monthly range 8? in June and September. In October
the mean dewing-point fell to 65*83, temperature 78*13. The maximum diurnal
range inereased to 26*, and the extreme monthly range was 33%. In 1830 the ob-
servations are only complete for 9—10 4.v.: the mean dewing-point was 61%9, mean
temperature 784, and a cubic foot of air contained 6351 grains of water : the ex-
treme range of the hygrometer was 47*, and the lowest dewing-point 31*, tempera-
ture 50?, in December. An inspection of the tables Nos. 17—21 will show the gradual
increase of moisture in a cubic foot of air from the most dry month, February, until
June or July. Hence the moistness remains nearly stationary until the beginning of
October, when it diminishes, s0mewhat rapidly and regularly, until February.

It might be supposed that the hottest months in the year, March, April, and May,
would also be the driest ; but such is not the fact. The powerful action of the sun
on the ocean in the middle of March raises a large quantity of aqueous vapour, which
continues to.increase in the ratio of the sun's progress north. The westerly winds
waft this aqueous vapour into Dukhun : much of it is arrested by the Ghats and
hilly tracts eastward of those hills; accounting for the sensible moistness of the air,
the frequent night-fogs, and deposition of dew on this line in the end of March and
in all April and May. The supply of moisture diminishes in proportion to the
distance eastward from the sea to the limits of the Coromandel coast monsoon : we
in consequence find the Ghats, Poona, Ahmednuggur, and the Bala Ghat, all with
very different dewing-points in the hot months.

My visits to Bombay on public duty in successive years, in the hot and cold
months, enabled me to determine, in the most satisfactory manner, with the aid of
