X, dS/dS’ = t,,. cos (x, v’) +t,, cos (y, »’) +#,, cos (Z,’),

which is in agreement with the first of the three boundary conditions given in equations
(14-1).

Ina similar manner it can be shown that the remaining two boundary conditions given in
equations (16-1) are equivalent to the remaining two boundary conditions given in
equations (14-1).

19. EQUATIONS OF MOTION AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR AN INCOMPRESSIBLE MATERIAL

In deducing the equations of motion and boundary conditions for an incompressible
material, we must again take account of the fact discussed in § 8, that the allowable choice
of the components du, dv, dw of the virtual displacements is restricted by the incompressibility.

If dr is a small volume element, measured in the undeformed state, we have

S (7) 8 =f(1) or,
