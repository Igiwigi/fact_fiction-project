Its anterior part (Interhyoideus) is attached laterally to the
Keratohyale. Its front edge just overlaps the posterior edge of the Intermandibularisâ€”
by eight 5-y sections = 0-04 mm. In a 9-3-mm. embryo the conditions are similar but for the fact that the overlap of
the Interhyoideus part of the Constrictor hyoideus ventralis and the Intermandibularis
is greater. It amounts to 23 sections = 0-115 mm. In a 75-mm. embryo the Interhyoideus and Hyohyoideus have become separated.
