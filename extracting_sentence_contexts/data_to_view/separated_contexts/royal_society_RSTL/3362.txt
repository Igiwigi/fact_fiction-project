Sometimes, however, the fibrillz project
in considerable numbers, as a lash, from both extremities of the fracture, many de-
taching themselves completely, and floating separately around. Here their lateral
adhesion is exceedingly slight, and seems to be diminished by contact with water. The best specimens of this kind are from birds, which also afford the most character-
istic transverse sections ; and the one fact is strikingly confirmatory of the other, for
1 conceive it to be owing to the slightness of the connexion between the fibrillz, that
in the latter case these appear 80 isolated and distinct. On the other band, it is not
uncommon for the fasciculi to evince a disposition to split in the direction of the
strize, 80 that occasionally they break off quite square, or when pulled at their ends,
crack partially across at several points, in lines corresponding to the striz: this is
Seen in the case of the Pig (fig. 21.). Or several contiguous strizz may be thus sepa-
rated from one another, as Mr. Skxey has well represented*, and as I have not un-
