The tail was flaccid, and unmoved on the application of stimali. OF THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA AND SPINALIS. 645

This experiment affords evidence of many important facts in physiology. It
proves that the presence of the medulla oblongata and spinalis is necessary to
the contractile function of the eyelids, the sub-maxillary textures, the larynx,
the sphineters, the limbs, the tail, on the application of stimuli to the cutaneous
surfaces or mucous membranes. It proves the reflex character of this property
of the medulla oblongata and spinalis, and the dependence of these motions
upon the reflex function.
