Hence it at once foll
that the number 2m -+ 1 possesses in all 2" inversely conjugate composit
Otherwise, we may say that the number of inversely conjugate compositi
2m + 1 is equal to the number of compositions of m + 1. It will be observed that the number 2m + 1 has precisely the same number, 2!
self-inverse compositions. There is, in fact, a one-to-one correspondence between the compositions of 2m 4
which are inversely conjugate, and those which are self-inverse.
’ To explain this, take the graph last represented. Read according to the bl
nodes we obtain the inversely conjugate composition

(23121) of the number 9.
