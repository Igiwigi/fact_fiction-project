most advantageous to the people. This is reflected in the
Variability Selection Hypothesis. The producers of the lithic
artefacts types (i) heavy-duty core tools (mostly bifacial arte-
facts), and (ii) microliths in West-Central Africa exploited a
wide variety of environments and resources in the Pleisto-
cene of West-Central Africa. However, certain human
behaviours, exhibited in the form of technological modifi-
cation as an adaptation strategy, do not seem to have been
determined or controlled by the prevailing climatic (and veg-
etation) changes. Examples include the persistence of lithic
tools characteristic of the MSA from the Pleistocene into the
Holocene in Senegal and Central Africa despite contrasting
climatic conditions during the two periods.
