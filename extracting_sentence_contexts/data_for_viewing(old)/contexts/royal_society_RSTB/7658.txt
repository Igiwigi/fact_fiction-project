more striking extracranial carotid rete in this animal. It was his view that an extracranial
carotid rete was extremely unusual and obviously present only in certain Lemuridae,
where it was situated at the beginning of the internal carotid artery in its cervical portion.

In all species in which it is present the carotid rete communicates with the circle of
Willis by means of a short trunk of large calibre which is formed by vessels leaving the rete.
In the cat, this trunk, which is occasionally double, is the distal part of the arteria anasto-
motica, but in the sheep, goat and pig, the connecting trunk is the only persisting portion
of the internal carotid artery, the segment proximal to the rete having degenerated.
Evidence in support of the identity of the vessel in these artiodactyls was provided by the
calf, in which it was found that a similar trunk joining the rete to the circle of Willis was
continuous throughout the body of the rete with a still persisting but relatively narrow
proximal portion of the internal carotid artery. It was, in fact, the distal portion of a com-
plete internal carotid artery, which had increased in calibre during its passage through
the carotid rete as a result of receiving vessels from this structure (figure 9d).

The main vessels which may supply the carotid rete are the internal maxillary artery
(usually via the ramus anastomoticus and the arteria anastomotica), the ascending pharyn-.
geal artery, and the occipital artery. The internal maxillary artery provides the greatest con-
tribution in the cat, sheep, goat and ox, but in the pig the major vessel supplying the rete
is the ascending pharyngeal artery; the latter vessel is also of some importance in the cat
and in the mature foetal lamb. The occipital artery plays a significant part in the blood
supply of the rete only in the ox. When the rete is intracranial, the internal maxillary
