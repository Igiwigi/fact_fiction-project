2 The beds in which the spicules of amorphous silica ave inclosed, also frequently
Soontain an important quantity of silica in the colloid state, amounting in the case of
Sthe malm at Farnham, recorded by Messrs. Way and Parxs,t to as much as 75 per
Scent, In ome instances, however, whilst the spicules are of colloid silica, the in-
Selosing matrix is of chalcedonic and even partially of crystalline silica, and calcite is
Zalso present.
bt The presence in the same beds of silica in an amorphous condition, with the siliceous
Sspicules in a similar state, taken in connection with the fact that the beds are filled
jovith empty spicular casts from which the spicules have been dissolved, and that many
Sof the spicules are residuary forms which have lost all their soluble silica, points to
the conclusion that the colloidal silica in the beds has been directly derived from the
breaking up and dissolution of the sponge-remains.

The colloidal silica of the sponge-beds occurs in the form of minute granules, similar
to those in the spicules, and also in a globular form, that is to say, in very minute
bodies with circular outlines, though not strictly of a spherical form. The siliceous
bodies can be examined in thin microscopic sections from the harder portions of the
malm of Godstone and other places ; but their characters are still better shown in the
