The ratio o/(Pm).-1 can be taken as a

constant k (<1), say, so that pp/(Pm)e<1 = kG («) (e/k)*-*. As « increases from

1
zero, G (a) decreases, and (e/k)3-% increases, so that there is a possibility of a maximum
value for p,/(Pm).—-1 in the range 0 to 1. The following tables illustrate this fact.

The value of & is much more likely to be near 3 than 4, so that in general the
assumption of a linear law of burning leads to an under calculation of maximum pressure. To determine the effect on the calculated muzzle-velocity of adopting a mean linear

rate of burning is impossible without reference to a specific gun, but calculations for a
series of guns show that muzzle velocities, corresponding to the linear law, are found
to be considerably lower than those determined using an index law. These facts
illustrate the great importance of determining the burning law as accurately as possible
if correct ballistic predictions are to be made.
