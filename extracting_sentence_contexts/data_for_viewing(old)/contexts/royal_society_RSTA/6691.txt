TueoreM L’. Suppose that every critical lattice of K is fully critical. Then K is fully reducible.

Proof.+ Suppose K is not fully reducible. By theorem K’, there exists a critical lattice A
of K and an infinite sequence A,, A,, ... of lattices for which (a), (b) and (c) hold. We assert
that A cannot be a fully critical lattice of K. For if H is any bounded part of K, then H will
be contained in K for all large r, and A, will be arbitrarily near to A and will be admissible
for H. Now (6) asserts that d(A,) <d(A), and (a) asserts that A, is not a critical lattice of K.
Thus, by definition D’, A is not a fully critical lattice of K. This contradiction proves the
theorem.

In all those cases, specified on p. 313, in which Mahler proved K to be boundedly reducible,
the same argument, with theorem L’ in place of theorem L, shows that K is also fully reducible.
Mahler’s proof is, in each case, based on the fact that every critical lattice of K is of the form
QA,, where Qis an automorphism of K and A, is a certain special critical lattice. His argument
proves the existence of a bounded star body K* contained in K with the property that every
lattice A*, which is admissible for K* and which is sufficiently near to Ag, is either a critical
lattice of K or has determinant greater than A(K). Thus A, is fully critical, and so every
critical lattice of K is fully critical; consequently it follows from theorem L’ that K is fully
reducible.

A further investigation is needed, however, in the case of the three-dimensional star body
a alas a | @f-+98) <1, (18)
since Mahler’s proof that this body is boundedly reducible is incomplete. It was proved by
Davenport (1939) that A(K) = 4,/(28). (19)
