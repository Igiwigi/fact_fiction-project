34. The experiments last mentioned (L.), (M.) are instructive ; they show that it is
not only from the absence of electricity upon the interior surface of a charged shell
that we fail to electrify a small insulated body placed within it, but that this result
may also arise from incapacity of the given body itself to take up electricity under
certain cireumstances. Pursuing therefore these facts, unfettered by any hypothetical
view of electricity, we are immediately led to examine under what conditions one
body can receive electricity by communication from another, as in the case of touching
a charged conductor with a small insulated disc of inconsiderable thickness ; since
