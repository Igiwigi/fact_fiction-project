OVUM LEAVES THE OVARY.

(These are represented in Plate XXIII. The ova there een were of periods varying
from 54 to 10 hours, and they measured in diameter from 45" to about 7'5".)

Changes in the Position, Form, and Internal State, of the Germinal Vesicle immedi-

germinal vesicle returns to the centre of the oyum, it is not possible to learn the

the oyum in any of its future phases.

341. In Plate XXIIL. fig. 169. is an ovum of 54 hours, in which the germinal
vesicle was apparently undergoing this change of place; a change which appears to
mesufficient in itself to show that an ovum bas undergone fecundation. The vesicle
had begun to regain its globular form. The point of fecundation, however, was till
visible at the periphery; whence, and from the unclosed state of the fissure in the
