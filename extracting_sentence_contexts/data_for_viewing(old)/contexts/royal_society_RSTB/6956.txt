technique, but to the discovery of fortunate specimens.

The flower has a peduncle 2-4 cm. long thickly covered with hair, especially in its upper
part. The bragts, probably 20-30 in all, are also hairy and form a perianth of more than
one layer. Though probably not forming two distinct whorls—the lower ones indeed arise
at slightly different levels—the outer bracts differ from the inner ones in being stouter.

The bracts are succeeded by a whorl of 12-14 microsporophylls which arched over and
protected the gynoecium in bud. The gynoecium is of normal Bennettitalean structure,
but the axis projects above the seeds to form a characteristically moulded body, the
‘corona’, against which the tips of the microsporophylls pressed in bud.

Comment is made later on the fact that nearly all the flowers are immature.

PARTS OF THE FLOWER
(a) Floral axis

The peduncle shows the clean-cut base and longitudinal ribs described by Thomas. The
ribs do not continue the whole length but die out and are replaced by others and are more
likely to be subepidermal fibres than vascular bundles. The fine hairs which cover the
