When, however, the vacuum is sufficiently high for the dark 8pace round the
negative pole to have s8wollen out to the dimensions of the tube, there is little dif-
ference in the phenomena of green phosphorescence and projection of the shadow of c
on b, whichever is the positive pole, provided e be made the negative. The appearances
are almost the ame, and the shadows projected from the negative pole e are just as
harp and intense whether T make F or Ã¾ the positive pole. The positive pole, in fact,
seems to have little or nothing to do with the phenomena. (519, 527, 549.)
