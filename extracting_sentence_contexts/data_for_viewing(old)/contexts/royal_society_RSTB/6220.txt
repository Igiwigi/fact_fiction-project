Several of the earlier workers on Glossina realized the possibility that the insect’s
climatic limits might be capable of study in the laboratory (see, for instance,
Rovusaup, 1909, a, b, c, 1910; Macrre, 1912; Srun~mann, 1907). But they had
little technical equipment and an insufficiency of flies for their purpose. Since
those days the experimental method seems to have fallen into disuse.

Entomologists who work upon tsetse flies are principally engaged in endeavouring to
understand the seasonal and geographical fluctuations in their numbers, in devising
methods of control, and in attempting to evaluate the effect of these methods. Such
work relates to populations of wild flies. But there is a secondary group of problems,
which may become more and more important ; they centre round the maintenance
of a supply of clean flies in the laboratory at all times of year, for purposes of
transmission, etc. It is thought that the facts here recorded will be of value to those
who wish to carry out work of this nature. Our work was much hampered
because so little is recorded about the biology of these insects in the laboratory.

The work here described was performed at the laboratory of the Tsetse
Investigation at Gadau in the north of Nigeria (12° N., 10° E.). Gadau is only
about 15 miles from Sherifuri, where Ltoyp, Jonson, and others worked for several
years, and there is no essential difference in vegetation, altitude, or climate between
the two places. It isa matter for congratulation that the information from the
field should be so complete, and the laboratory accommodation so good. Descrip-
tions of the surrounding country may be found in the series of papers published by
Lioyp, Jounson, and their collaborators. Climatological data have been published
in several of these papers, particularly by Lroyp, Jounson, and Rawson (1927) ;
