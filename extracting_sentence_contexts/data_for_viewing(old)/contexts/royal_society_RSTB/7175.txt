the adjacent meristem ensues, it should be possible to observe (i) if the existing leaf primordia
undergo further development, (ii) if new leaf primordia are formed, (iii) if buds develop on
the apical meristem itself, and, if so, in what positions, i.e. close to, or remote from, the
damaged apical cell.

In order to puncture the apical cell a very sharp finely tapering needle was used, the
apex being observed under a binocular microscope at a high magnification. The perforation
was made with the lightest touch of the needle point so that there was only a slow exudation
of liquid. But even in those specimens where the apical cell was punctured with minimal
disturbance, a considerable area of the meristem became necrosed (figures 62, 63, plate 27).
It may accordingly be inferred that the system of stresses at the extreme apex is such that
a release of pressure in the apical cell has a marked effect on the neighbouring cells. The
superficial cells adjacent to the apical cell are, in fact, very susceptible to injury. In
numerous operations the writer has not found it possible to destroy the apical cell alone.
On being perforated, some apical cells freely exuded a liquid which dried to a brown scab.

The perforations neither became extended nor compressed. In some specimens bubbles
of gas were observed to escape. Where, by accident, the apical cell was very slightly
injured, e.g. on being brushed with a shred of blotting paper, the cell contents did not
immediately become discoloured nor did they exude; but after some time—24 hr. or more
—the pattern of the apical cell and its neighbours could easily be observed because of the
development of a necrotic brown colour in the cell walls. In the writer’s experience even
