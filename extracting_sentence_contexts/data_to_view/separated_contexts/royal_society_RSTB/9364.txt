It is natural to think—and my
impression is that many forensic practitioners do think—that
forensic science is inherently good, bad or indifferent, as the
case may be, irrespective of its historical, geographical or insti-
tutional context. This assumption is underpinned by robust
scientific norms of objectivity, validity, replicability, ‘consensi-
bility’® and so forth. However, from a legal perspective, the
value and quality of forensic science are always contextually
variable, in the sense that what may constitute good evidence
for justice in some places or cases would be useless or
unacceptable in others—depending on legal definition, local
procedural traditions, broader social expectations and the
material facts in issue in any particular case. This pervasive
sensitivity to institutional context threatens to turn any gener-
alization about forensic science or other expert evidence into
indefensible dogma. Expert evidence of all kinds, even
the testimony of an expert astrologer or magician,” could
conceivably be relevant and epistemically well-warranted in
criminal proceedings.
