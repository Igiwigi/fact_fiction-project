and quasi-neutral mutations [3-5] and the fact that partial functionality is better than no
functionality at all [6]. Actually, molecular complexity might be relatively straightforward to
achieve.

Molecular function is highly redundant. The same molecular phenotype can be obtained
from an astronomically large number of different genotypes, as revealed by computational
and empirical studies of complete genome spaces for short sequences [7-9]. Such genotypes
are organized as networks-of-networks [10,11], a non-trivial topology with important dynamic
consequences [11] that also points to the need for an updated metaphor to represent adaptive
landscapes [12]. The abundance of phenotypes is not homogeneous in sequence space [8,13-
16], since most sequences are mapped into a small fraction of very large phenotypes. This
fraction, however, suffices to guarantee a spectrum of different and efficient enough functions
so as to sustain life as we know it. The high dimensionality of genotype spaces and the fact
that the networks of abundant phenotypes percolate the space of sequences under very general
conditions [17] further ensures that different functions may be awaiting just a few mutations
apart [18,19].

The genotype-to-function map is redundant in several different ways beyond neutral and
quasi-neutral mutations. The many layers of expression from genotype to function [20] act
towards increasing the ensemble of possible genotypes coding for comparable phenotypes [21,22].
Further, function is flexible, so phenotypes admit a range of variation, and phenotypes are plastic,
so their expression adapts to different environments [23,24]. Beyond multiple inconsequential
variations in genotypes, also changes in molecular structure or composition might be irrelevant
for the functionality of a phenotype.
