We describe briefly the approach which was used in [49] to establish the global validity
of (2.2) in solving (2.12); other geophysical scenarios were addressed in [50,51]. Firstly, from
examining its Jacobian matrix, and applying the inverse function theorem, it can be proved that
the mapping (2.2) represents a local diffeomorphism from the Lagrangian variables to the fluid
domain. Additional analytical considerations establish that it is, in fact, globally injective. To
complete the proof, as was first implemented in [3] for Gerstnerâ€™s wave, we employ the following
degree-theoretical result, the invariance of domain theorem [52,53], which we state as Theorem 3.1. Theorem 3.1.
