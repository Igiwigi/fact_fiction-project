Remark 3.3. Let us briefly comment on the assumptions.

(i) The structural assumption that K is an £-retract is necessary in a sense. It has been
thoroughly discussed in [5], where examples of neighbourhood retracts and tangent maps
without equilibria were shown. It is moreover clear that without tangency condition
(which, in fact, prescribes directions of values taken by F) no equilibria of F exist.

(ii) The resolvent compactness of A is the only compactness condition considered in this
paper. As it seems if E is a Hilbert space, K is convex, w <0 and F is a set-valued map
being locally Lipschitz with respect to the Hausdorff distance, then the construction of an
ivariant detecting A-equilibria is also possible.

(iii) Recall that A-equilibria, i.e. solutions to (1.1), correspond to stationary states of the
evolution process governed by A and perturbed by F. It is, therefore, reasonable to
assume that the ‘unperturbed’ evolution determined by A is viable in K, ie. if u € K, then
Sa(t)u € K for t= 0, where {S,(t)};>0 is the (nonlinear) semigroup generated by A. The
viability condition (i.e. the semigroup invariance of K) is slightly weaker then resolvent
invariance (due to the so-called Crandall-Liggett formula). The invariance of this type is
