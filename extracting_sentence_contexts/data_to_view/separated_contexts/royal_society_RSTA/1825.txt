Discrepancies between Chl derived from backscattering measurements, Chljpp), and
fluorescence measurements, Clg, increased for very low and very high chlorophyll
concentrations (figure 7b). At high Chl, Chlpy, tended to be higher than Chly (area A, figure 7b). This was attributed to the fact that Chly is likely to underestimate true chlorophyll concentration
due to fluorescence quenching. High Chl values are found in surface waters in this region
and at this time of year (see later). At low chlorophyll concentrations, Chlpyy, was found to
be higher than Chl_ which could potentially be due to unresolved background particles (not
associated with Chl), a residual offset in the bpp-to-Chl relationship, or limitations in the dynamic
range of the backscattering sensor (area B, figure 7b).
