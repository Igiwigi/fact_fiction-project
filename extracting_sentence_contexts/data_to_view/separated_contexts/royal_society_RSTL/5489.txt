MS 1047 a little broader.
8 16 48 Slight black in the point of conta&,,
” and the edges a little broader,
True black in the point of. contaQ,
and the edges a little broader,
Here I concluded with my-
ſelf, that obſervers would
differ in their judgments
about the moment of con-
ta, ſome ſeconds of time,
or that ſome would eſti-
mate the conta&t ſooner
{ than others.

thread of light in the point of contadt was ſo obſcured;
as to be undiſcernible at 8" 16” 46/7; and that true
black did not ſucceed in the ſame point, till 4// after,
namely, 8* 16” 49//; and from * both of theſe pro-

perties,

* As the ſix feet Newtonian teleſcope magnified four times as
much as that of the two feet Gregorian teleſcope, and the va-
niſhing of'the thread of light, from its leaſt degree'of duſkiſhneſs
to:w true black, was-about 3'ſeconds of time by the ſix feet-te-
leſcope, the time. in which the thread; of light was vaniſhing
from the leaſt degree of duſkiſhneſs to a true black, by a two
feet Gregorian refle&tor, may be ſuppoſed to have. been 4. times..3
= 12 ſeconds of time; and hence an error, or rather difference,
of pronunciation, but not of judgment, may. have ariſen among
good obſervers, if ſome eſtimated the contaC by'the inviſibility
of the thread of light, and others by an apparent blackneſs in the
