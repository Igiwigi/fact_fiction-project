Thus although sequences of earthquakes in any island of the Lesser Antilles have
not in general been followed by volcanic disturbance in that island, yet in several
instances seismic disturbance at one point has been followed by volcanic disturbance
elsewhere. The limited history of which we have record therefore suggests that the
occurrence of earthquakes in large numbers should be regarded as evidence for the
existence of unstable conditions in a common magma underlying the whole group
which may or may not lead to volcanic disturbance at some point or points in the
island chain.

b—Origin of the earthquakes

It has been shown from the observations made with the various seismographs that
there are a number of focal regions under Montserrat at which a large proportion of
the earthquakes have occurred. The fact that there are such large changes in the
distribution of amplitude among the different stations suggests both that the foci of
individual earthquakes are regions of limited extent and that they are in many
instances close to the surface of the earth compared with the distance between stations,
i.e. within 1 or 2 km. of the surface. Otherwise, if the foci were all deep seated, we
should expect to find the amplitude for all stations nearly equal for all shocks. These
conclusions are strengthened by the fact that in estimating the position of the foci it
has been necessary in some instances to assume that the distribution in amplitude is
affected markedly by certain surface features (cf. § 9).
