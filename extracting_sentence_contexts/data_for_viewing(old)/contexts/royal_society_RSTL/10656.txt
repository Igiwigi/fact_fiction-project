tactile anzsthesia. Some extension of the primary lesion occurred secondarily, but
whether any anzsthesia resulted was not observed. The fact of importance is that
the primary lesions were without discoverable effect, on tactile sensibility.

In Experiment 26 also, though the lower temporo-sphenoical region was destroyed,

the hippocampal region only partially involved, there was only slight and transitory
pairment of tactile sensibility on the opposite side.

These, as well as other similar facts narrated, 8erve to show that the lesions of the
Jower temporo-sphenoidal region which are necessarily made in attempts to destroy the
hippocampal region from the external aspect of the temporal lobe are negative or
unimportant in the causation of the anzsthesia.

Where the hippocampal region was reached through or from the under surface of the
occipital lobe, and particularly in the former case, where the meduVary fibres of the
whole of the posterior lobe were invaded, tactile anzsthesia was complicated with visual

Ito eliminate the visual defects and assign them to the lesions inflicted on the occipito-
