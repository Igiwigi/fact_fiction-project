While, if the leaf as a whole is examined,
I believe that it is not easy to distinguish partial from complete closure. These
considerations suggest that the divergence between the conclusions arrived at by
Lerrars and ScHELLENBERGER depends in part on the difficulties of the microscopic
method. On the other hand, certain facts tend to show that Lerrers’s observations
are correct. Thus among the common plants which Lerrers found to have open
stomata at night are Cyclamen persicum, Viola odorata, Eranthis hyemalis,
Erythronium, R. Ficaria, all of which oceur among those which I have found clearly
open at night. This being so I have little right to throw doubt on Lerrexp’s results,
or on the microscopic method generally.
