“” 38. A large number of the fibres of the anterior commissure continue as a well-
S defined bundle across the central plexus, to form part of the anterior nerves. Or, in

‘The identification which has been made above of certain elements as the afferent
‘6 and efferent mechanisms of the nervous system of Branchippus finds further support
5 if we turn to the structure of the circumoral ganglion, or ganglion of the stomodeeum
-2 and second pair of antenne. A complete description of this ganglion would lengthen
2 this communication unduly, and, moreover, would be mainly of morphological interest.
> The facts which lead to the identification of the motor and sensory elements may,
3S however, be briefly set down.

£ The circumoral ganglion consists of a double ring of nervous matter enclosing the
cesophagus and uniting the nerve cords, The double ring is displaced so that it lies
¢ at a considerable angle with the horizontal plane of the body, this displacement
g being due to the very great hypertrophy of the upper lip and the continuation of the
= esophagus as a horizontal and posteriorly directed tube which ends posteriorly in the
g mouth. The double ring is especially developed posterior to the cesophagus, where
© it lies stretched as a double commissure between a ganglionic enlargement on
each nerve cord. In this, the commissural portion of the ring, the outer part runs
across from nerve cord to nerve cord, as a bundle of regularly arranged parallel
fibres, resembling the commissures of the typical ganglion. The fibres of the
