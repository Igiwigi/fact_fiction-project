secured in positions which fall within the outer struts of the beam. The practically
perfect rigidity of such a beam is proved by the fact that the sensibility of the
instrument remains, so far as can be demonstrated by actual experiment, quite constant
for all loads varying from 0-200 gr. The knife-edge blocks and the planes they
engage are of agate ; beam, pans and stirrups are highly gilt. The beam is enclosed
by one of the author's protecting inner cases which effectively excludes all disturbances
which would otherwise be produced within the beam during the time the ordinary
case is open for the loading and unloading of the pans, &e. By means of a platinum
wire bolometer placed within the beam case, we were at any time able to test the air
temperature in the immediate neighbourhood of the extremities of the beam; the
bolometer was capable of detecting temperature differences so small as 1/10,000° C.
The actual temperatures of both the interior and exterior of the beam case were
noted by means of delicate mercury-in-glass thermometers; with these instruments
we were able to read to 1/100° C. The sensibility, S, of the balance, was set
