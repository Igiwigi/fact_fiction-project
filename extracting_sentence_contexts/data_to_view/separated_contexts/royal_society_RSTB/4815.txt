If then the valve did represent a
nephrostome, the Ostracods would present the anomalous case of the nephrostome
arising before the nephridial duct. It has already been indicated that, in the opinion of the author, the valve system
should be considered as a specialised part of the endoskeletal system. The fact just
mentioned that the valve arises before the duct, fits in with such a view. Probably
originally the valve cells only supported the base of the end sac just as do those cells
that connect the end sac posteriorly to the endoskeletal plate or like those cells that
support the antennal gland end sac. Later, while retaining their supporting function,
they became incorporated into the excretory mechanism.
