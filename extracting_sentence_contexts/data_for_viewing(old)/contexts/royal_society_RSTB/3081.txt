Introduction.

Iv was noticed in 1901 by R, Maenus and Scndrer* that intravenous injection of
pituitary extract may be followed by a marked increase in urine flow, accompanied
by expansion of the kidney. This appeared the more remarkable, since the effect of
the extract is to cause contraction of the systemic arteries, including those of the
alimentary canal, a contraction only inferior to that produced by the active material
of suprarenal extract; and it was to have been anticipated that the same effect
would be produced upon the kidney vessels, leading to a diminution or suppression
of urine. As will appear from the sequel, this effect does, in fact, sometimes occur
as a primary result of the injection of pituitary extract, but even when this is the
case it is, in the majority of instances, succeeded by prolonged dilatation of kidney
vessels accompanied by marked diuresis.

It has been our aim in the present investigation to follow up the line of research
indicated by the observations of Magnus and ScuArer, and to endeavour definitely
to determine how far this diuretic action is constant, with which part of the pituitary
body it is related, whether it is a function of the substance which raises the blood-
pressure and is only an indirect effect of this rise, or whether it is due to a substance
which exerts a specific effect upon the renal blood-vessels and kidney cells, and in
the latter case whether it is possible to isolate this material and exhibit its action
independently.
