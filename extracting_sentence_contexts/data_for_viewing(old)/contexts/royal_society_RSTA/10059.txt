Secrion I.—Descriprion OF THE MATERIALS OF WHICH THE ‘THERMOMAGNETIC
PROPERTIES WERE INVESTIGATED.

$1. Tue experiments described in this paper arose from the desire of Sir ARTHUR
W. Ricker to obtain, in connection with his researches on the nature of the Earth’s
magnetic field, further data concerning the properties of such magnetic materials of
natural origin as may be present in appreciable quantity in the Earth’s crust.

Tron of cosmic origin contains nearly always an appreciable quantity of nickel, and
the magnetic properties of this material, especially their variation with temperature,
have received very little attention. Most of the published data are qualitative only,
and from them no very definite conclusion can be drawn beyond the fact that meteoric
iron appears to be of very variable permeability. It was, therefore, thought desirable
to make a careful quantitative study of a typical example ‘of such material.

§2. The meteoric iron used in the experiments was bought from the firm of
Dr. A. E. Foors, and the mass from which the sample was cut is described by
A. E. Foor in the ‘American Journal of Science’ [4], vol. 3, p. 65, 1897. The
whole meteorite weighed about 237 kilogs. and was found in the Sacramento
Mountains, Eddy Co., New Mexico. A careful analysis of some fragments yielded
the results :—

Fe = 91°39
Ni= 7°86
