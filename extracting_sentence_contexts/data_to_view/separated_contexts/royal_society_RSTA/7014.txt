The solution in the scrubber was drained off at the end of the run and examined
immediately in the case of peroxides; aldehyde solutions, on the other hand, were quite
stable and were analyzed in a batch at the end of the test. Types of peroxide and aldehyde present in the samples

There is very little direct evidence to offer on this subject. Owing to the necessity for
using an acid trap solution, hydrolysis might account for the fact that the peroxide behaved
in the analyses in exactly the same way as does H,O,. The engine peroxide had more affinity for water than had t-butyl hydroperoxide. This
was shown by the fact that a CO, scrubbing procedure left the former in the solution (
did H,O,), but easily removed the latter from solution.
