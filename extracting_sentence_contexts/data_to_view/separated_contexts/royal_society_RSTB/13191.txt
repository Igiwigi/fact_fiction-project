reproduction for all members of the generation. Many com-
ponents of the RNAi pathway, including RDE-1, RDE-4, SID-
2, SID-3 and the WAGO proteins [111], are required for this
pathogen-induced diapause formation, showing another poss-
ible link between these well-studied pathways and an adaptive
environmental response.
