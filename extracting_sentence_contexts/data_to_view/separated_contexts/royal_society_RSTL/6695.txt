And first, T would remark that I do not think that they can be reconciled
with the supposition of definite galvanic currents or definite magnets, suddenly pro-
duced, in any locality whatever, as sufficient to explain the disturbances observed here. On that hypothesis, it would seem necessary to believe that such sudden currents or
magnets would produce simultaneous disturbances in the three co-ordinate directions,
that, if the long period of a wave permitted some deviation from this rule, yet the short
period of an inequality would admit of no such deviation, and that, on any suppoxition,
the number of disturbances in the three directions would be approximately equal. Yet
in fact we find that neither in Waves nor in Irregularities is there the least appearance
of simultaneity, and that, though there is close equality of numbers between the
Westerly and Northerly Forces, yet the Nadir Force (in which the Irregularities are as
strongly marked as in the Westerly and Northerly, and the Wave-disturbances much
more strongly marked) exhibits less than half the number. These considerations appear
to me quite conclusive as showing that the observed disturbances cannot be produced
by the forces of any suddenly created galvanic current or polar magnet. 25.
