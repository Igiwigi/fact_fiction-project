In order
to obtain the corresponding free-energy density for a network with n chains per unit reference
volume that contributes to the strain-energy density of the rubber-like material, a suitable average
needs to be formulated according to (2.3), such as the arithmetic mean over a number M of
representative chains with directions M; (cf. e.g. [16,25,44]),
1
van > oF, M)). (3.17)
i=1
The average over M=3 chains aligned with the three principal directions of strain Nx may
be seen as one particular realization of this average and has implicitly been used in the early
developments of rubber-elasticity theory [45]. It has been noted [16,35] that this choice is in
agreement with the additive decomposition suggested by Valanis & Landel [7],

VW = G(C) =H (4, 2,43) = o(A1) + @(A2) + (As), (3.18)

and similar arguments can be found in the original work [7]. In fact, this agreement holds
if and only if the free energy of a chain aligned with Nx is completely defined through the
principal stretch A; so that @(F, Nz) « a(x), and o =nAw/3 in this case, in view of the relations
(2.2) and (2.3).

(e) Statistical representation of Ogden’s material parameters

The Valanis—Landel-type ‘average’ (3.18) over the three principal directions applied to the
additive representation of the free energy (2.2), the non-affine chain stretch (3.5) considered in
(3.11) and the constraint contribution (3.16) yields the reconciliated form of Ogden’s model [16]
