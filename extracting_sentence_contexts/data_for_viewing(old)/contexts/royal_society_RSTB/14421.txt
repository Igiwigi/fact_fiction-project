by observation alone (e.g. by seeing others rejecting things or
finding a container to be empty). Once these meanings have
been mapped onto negation words, children may notice that
the same words are also used when the speaker wants to
express denial, and that the mere function of this word is to
flip the truth value of a proposition. This observation—
which is linguistic in nature—could potentially be contributing
to the representation of logical (truth-functional) negation in
children’s mind.

Similarly, epistemic meanings of modal verbs might be
developing from the ‘easier’, root meanings, which are
acquired earlier. In fact, ambiguity between root and episte-
mic meanings in a single class of modals is a widespread
cross-linguistic phenomenon [68,89,90]. Some semantic the-
ories argue that epistemic meanings of modals are related
to root meanings through metaphorical extension [91,92].
For example, the root meaning of may (e.g. You may go now)
expresses the existence of a potential but absent barrier in
the ‘physical world’, while its epistemic meaning (e.g. He
may be at work) expresses a barrier of reasoning in the speak-
er’s ‘mental world’ [92]. On such views, children may be able
to learn root meanings of modals though observation, and
then they can extend these meanings to the more abstract,
epistemic domain, through metaphorical mapping. Thus,
