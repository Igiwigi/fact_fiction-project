Figure 3. Superposition of filtered time traces detected by D, corresponding to switch-on events at two injected wavelengths;
(a) 1500 WB pulses at 2. = 975.93 nm, 15 of which were successful as detected by D.; (b) 500 WB pulses at A = 975.56 nm, 257
of which were successful as detected by D2. Acs = 975.95 nm. The writing pulse energy is about 3 pJ and is very astigmatic: 1.5
times the LS diameter in the horizontal dimension and 0.3 times the LS diameter in the vertical dimension.

We conclude that the blue detuned perturbation is more efficient, in agreement with
observations reported in [34,35]. We interpret that this detuning corresponds to the detuning
between the CS wavelength and the absorber cavity resonance. In fact, we have observed that
the most efficient perturbation is at the wavelength of maximal absorption when applied on the
absorber device in the absence of coupling with the amplifier device. In order to increase the
success rate, the perturbation has been amplified via an optical tapered amplifier (TA in figure 1)
for the following measurements. Other than the TA, the perturbation beam is so astigmatic
that it has to be corrected. After a cylindrical and spherical lens, the perturbation beam has a
diameter of about 10 1m and a circular geometry when it reaches the semiconductor microcavity.
While the previous measurement shows that orthogonal polarization can be used, its efficiency is
much lower, as shown by the comparison of figure 4a,c with figure 4b,d. Both experiments have
been realized for the optimal wavelength (Awp = 975.82, whereas 4cs = 976.02nm). The power
reaching the absorber (figure 4a,b) in the case of S-polarized perturbation (figure 4b) is four times
larger than the power reaching the absorber in the P-polarized case (figure 42). In spite of this large
difference, the S-polarized perturbation has a success rate of 90%, whereas the P-polarized one
