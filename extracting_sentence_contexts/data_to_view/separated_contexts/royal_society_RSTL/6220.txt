Although the spines usually radiate
Z nearly in the. equatorial plane, yet it becomes obvious, when their connexion with the
S central disk is examined, that they originate at different levels (Fig. III. s, Ãž); this will
E presently be found to depend on the fact that the form of the spire is not nautiloid but
= turbinoid. Besides the ordinary radiating spines, an extraordinary growth of short pointed
spines is sometimes seen, either partially or completely covering one or both surtaces of
the central disk (Fig. II. 6); and examples occasionally present themselves (Fig. I. 4), in
which the development of these seems to have altogether superseded that of the ordinary
radiating spines.
