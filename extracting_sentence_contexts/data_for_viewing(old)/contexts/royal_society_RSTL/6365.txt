eoftness of pitch, has the elasticity and tendency to rend seen in colloids. In the pro-

ies last mentioned, ice presents a distant analogy to gum incompletely dried, to
glue, or any other firm jelly. Ice farther appears to be of the class of adhesive colloids.
The redintegration (regelation of Farapar) of masses of melting ice, when placed in
contact, has much of a colloid character. A colloidal view of the plasticity of ice
demonstrated in the glacier movement will readily develope itself.

A similar extreme departure from its normal condition appears to be presented by a
colloid holding 80 high a place in its class as albumen. In the 80-called blood-crystals
of FUXKE, a oft and gelatinons albuminoid body is seen to assume a crystalline contour.
Can any facts more strikingly illustrate the maxim that in nature there are no abrupt

Itransitions, and that distinctions of class are never absolute ?

SJ ; 8. Osmose.

E Little has been said in the present paper respecting osmose, a subject closely con-
Snected with colloidal septa. It now appears to me that the water movement in osmo08e
big an affair of hydration and of dehydration in the substance of the membrane or other
Zcolloid septum, and that the diffasion of the saline s0lution placed within the oxmometer
Has little or nothing to do with the osmotic result, otherwise than as it affects the state
"of hydration of the septum.
S Osmose is generally considerable, through membranous and other highly hydrated
