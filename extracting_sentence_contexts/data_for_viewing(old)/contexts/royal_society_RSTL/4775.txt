AMONG the many discussions to which the subject of madder has given rise among
chemists, there is none which is calculated to excite 80 much interest as that concern-
ing the state in which the colouring matter originally exists in this root, and there is
no part of this extensive subject which is at the same time involved in such obscurity.
It is a well-known fact that the madder root is not well adapted for the purposes of
dyeing until it has attained a growth of from eighteen months to three years, and
that after being gathered and dried it gradually improves for seyeral years, after
which it again deteriorates. During the time when left to itself, especially if in a
state of powder, it increases in weight and bulk, in consequence probably of absorp-
tion of moisture from the air, and some chemical change is effected, which, though
not attended by any striking phenomena, is sufficiently well indicated by its results.
There are few chemical investigations that bave thrown any light on the nature of
the process which takes place during this lapse of time, and in fact most of the at-
tempts to do s0 have merely consisted of arguments based on analogy. It has been
surmised that the process is one of oxidation, and that the access of atmospheric air
is consequently necessary. We are indeed acquainted with cases, in which substances
of well-defined character and perfectly colourless, as for instance orcine and hema-
toxyline, are converted by the action of oxygen, or oxygen and alkalies combined,
into true colouring matters. A more general supposition is, that the process is one
of fermentation, attended perhaps by oxidation, and in confirmation of this view the
formation of indigo-blue from a colourless plant, by a process which has all the cha-
racters of one of fermentation, may be adduced. What the substance is however on
which this process of oxidation 'or fermentation takes effect, what the products are
which are formed by it, whether indeed the change is completed as s00n as the
madder has reached the point when it is best adapted for dyeing, or whether further
