the Anabathra of Wirnan, having had in his possession a number of that distinguished
obseryer's original specimens. In this plant, as T haye already mentioned in the pre-
ceding memoir, we have the inner medullary cylinder and the outer ligneous zone of
vessels arranged as in BROXGNIART'S Sigillaria and in Diplozylon ; only, as in the latter
plant, it constituted a continuous instead of an interrupted ring. Professor KixG calls
attention to the large lenticular openings, seen in the tangential sections of the woody
zone of Anabathra, figured and described by WITHAM as medullary rays. He says
respecting them, * Mr, Wremax described these openings as containing the medullary
rays, which is not the case, because what has probably been mistaken for cellular tisxue
is, in reality, a bundle of small vessels, similar to those which occupy the outer part of
the medullary sheath. Although the longitudinal sections do not exhibit any of these
bundles springing from the vascular cylinder, their proximity in some transyerse sections,
together with the fact just stated, leave no room to doubt their having constituted the
Jeaf-cords of the plant.” This writer further adds, * from these passages being in part
vacant, it may reasonably be supposed that the cords were accompanied in their course
with a portion of cellular tissue”F.

It thus appears that all three of the above writers inclined to the idea that the foliar
vascular bundles arise from the vessels of the yascular medullary sheaths of the plants
which they severally describe. In the previous pages I pointed out that whilst in some
Diploxylons the line of demarcation between the medullary sheath and the ligneous
zone was a crenulated one, in others it appeared to be straight. Having recently pre-
pared and examined a large number of additional sections, I find that even in 8ome of
the examples in which I thought the line was a straight one I can detect a series of
small crenulations. This I have especially found to be the case with the specimen
