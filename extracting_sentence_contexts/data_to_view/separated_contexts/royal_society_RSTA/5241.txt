For example, it can be observed that multiscale ig
problems do not typically have a closed solution (except for some idealized situations when a : s
single-scale model at the finest level, e.g. a solution of the time-dependent Schr√©dinger equation 1B

in quantum mechanics, can be used as a first-principles direct solution method). To simulate
a large enough system with multiple scales at the level of detail required, one has to combine
models at various scale resolutions and invariably deal with different physics. Multiscale systems
can be characterized by the fact that there is a form of approximation or coarse graining involved
in the multiscale modelling, corresponding to an error below some threshold scale of interest. The
specific terminology used for coarse graining and scale bridging in multiscale systems varies in : =
different subject areas. For instance, terms such as projection, upscaling, model reduction and physical :3
analogy could be used to describe the procedure of reducing the full complexity of the multiscale
problem to an insightful, but tractable, representation.
