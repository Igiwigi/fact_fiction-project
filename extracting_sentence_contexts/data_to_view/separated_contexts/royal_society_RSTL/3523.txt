on Mr. Tarsor's principle) the maximum of ac-
tion was not beyond the violet, as I had always understood it to be, but rather about
the confines of the blue and green, nearly where Frauxnorrr's ray F is situated. 2ndly, That the extent of the chemical spectrum beyond the visible violet light far
surpassed any idea I had previously formed of it. For, in fact, the visible termination
of the violet rays nearly bisected the photographic image impressed on the paper. 3rdly, That # the visible violet rays there occurred a sort of minimum of action,
about one third of the way from Frauxnorer's ray H towards G. 4thly, That the
whole of the red, up to about Frauxnore's line C, appeared to be inactive. And
5thly, That where the orange-red rays, or the less refrangible half of the portion from
C to D in Frauxnorer's spectrum, fell, there was communicated to the paper a sort
of ruddy tint, a dull brick red.
