3:46. The total hydrogen extracted exceeds that required for charging by 0° 26 eu
centim. This is due to the fact that a slight leakage into the pump occurred at the pressu
264°5, so that the quantity pumped off at this pressure (0°59) is certainly too high,
The platinum black exhausted at the ordinary temperature gave off 13°14 cub. cen
= 35°13 volumes of hydrogen when heated to dull redness. We are, therefi
in a position to draw up the two following tables, which show the effect of diminish
pressure on the absorption of hydrogen by platinum black.
