The former of these values is rejected. The
values for concentrations less than one-fiftieth normal are also rejected, since the large factor by which the
observed value of n must be multiplied to get the equivalent refractive power greatly magnifies any error. These discrepancies are partly due to the fact that DINKHAUSER has combined his own results with those
of other observers. THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS. 151
