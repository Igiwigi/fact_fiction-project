looping under the oviduct, is joined by the lateral nerve and the lateral branch of the
corono-lateral.* The combined nerve then extends upwards to the surface of the peduncle
on either side of the rostrum and spreads around the middle and upper regions of the
peduncle (figure 17). I have named it the ‘upper peduncular nerve’.

The antennular nerves, after giving off the lateral branch, are in close contact with the
oviducts and extend with these structures through the occlusor muscle ring (figures 13 and 17).
The nerves soon leave the oviduct (figure 9) and spread laterally to supply the lower parts
of the peduncle. I have therefore called this nerve the ‘lower peduncular nerve’.

One of the most interesting points about this nervous system is the absence of a nerve
of any size to the adductor muscle—a muscle far and away the largest in the body. I have
had to exaggerate the size of the nerve supply in figure 17. The nerve is, in fact, no larger
than one of the minute nerves which can be traced from the visceral system to the small
dilator muscles of the oesophagus. It consists of only two or three fibres at the most.
It clearly cannot be a normal motor supply. A motor nerve such as those that supply the
solitary muscle of the cirri (figures 5 and 17) or the nerves which run to the large swimming
muscles of a cypridinid ostracod (Cannon, 1931) are large and massive structures. It
would look, therefore, as though the adductor muscle in Lithotrya is without a motor nerve
control, that is, it is an independent effector system.

The hypothesis that I am putting forward is that the adductor muscle is stimulated to
contract by being stretched. This is brought about according to my explanation by the
contraction of all the peduncular musculature. This forces apart the scuta and so stretches
the muscle joining them. When the muscle is stretched beyond a certain point it tends to
