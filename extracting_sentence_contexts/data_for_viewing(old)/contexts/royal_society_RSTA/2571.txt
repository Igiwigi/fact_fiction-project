2. Qui dit Mathématiques, dit démonstration

The most striking hallmark of Mathematics is the presence of proofs. A mathematician, as such,
is someone who can discover, invent or construct proofs. The treatise of Nicolas Bourbaki even
starts with the following exalted declaration:

“Dépuis les Grécs, qui dit Mathématiques, dit démonstration; certains doutent méme qu’il se
trouve, en dehors des mathématiques, des démonstrations au sens précis et rigoureux que ce mot
a recu des Grecs et qu’on entend lui donner ici. On a le droit de dire que ce sens n’a pas varié, car
ce qui était une démonstration pour Euclide en est toujours une a nos yeux.’

It is indeed a fact that for many centuries nothing outside of Mathematics and exact
(=mathematical) Sciences could even remotely compete with the stringency of a mathematical
proof, in terms of general credibility and power of persuasion. However, over the last decades,
quite convincing arguments of a mathematical nature are encountered in Theoretical Computer
Science and even in many areas of Theoretical Physics (such as Quantum Field Theory,
Gravitation, Statistical Physics, String Theory, etc.), and also in some Engineering Sciences
(such as Control Theory, Information Transmission or Cryptography). Of course, Bourbaki could
justly raise an objection that all these fields are Mathematisierung = mathématization, activités
mathématiques, rather than Science and Engineering in the traditional sense.

In the opposite direction, in Mathematics itself, with alarming frequency, one discusses the
issue of the changing status of mathematical proof and our fading certainty in the reliability
of mathematical results. Such censure and scepticism are most stridently, repeatedly and
