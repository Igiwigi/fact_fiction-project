from the theoretical end-point. But the amount
of this difference is much more sensitive to the actual value taken for the upper limit
E,, than is the corresponding quantity for the /,-spectra. This fact makes it almost
impossible to estimate a? from the K-spectra, except as regards order of magnitude. However, the value 10a?
