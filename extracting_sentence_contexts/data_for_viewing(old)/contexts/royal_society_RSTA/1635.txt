Then, for every positive integer k, there exists 4 =A(k,q) such that, for each 0<2 <A, there is Ro =
Ro(A) > 0 sufficiently large such that Rot(zo;[a, B]) <k for all zp with ||zo|| = Ro.

Proof. The proof follows, basically, the same scheme as that of lemma 3.1, with some variants.
For this reason, we do not provide here all the details, but we point out which are the main
differences.

First of all, we observe that all the solutions are globally defined. In fact, h, g have at most linear
growth at infinity, namely, there are constants which bound |h(t,s)|/|s| and |g(s)|/|s| for |s| large.
Next, we note that for each ¢ > 0, there is a constant M; > 0 such that, for all t € [0, T],

S(X)H(E) < Goo + €)x()* +Me, H(t, yD) y(t) < (loo + €)y(t)” + Me. (3.7)
Using again the modified rotation number as in (3.4), we find the following inequality
