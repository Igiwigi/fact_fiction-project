The facts relating to the nitrogen bring out more strikingly the characteristic effects
of the mixed mineral manure in fayouring the development of leguminous species. The


EXPERIMENTS ON THE MIXED HERBAGE OF PERMANENT MEADOW. 311

figures given on page 309 show that whilst the percentage of nitrogen in the miscel-
laneous herbage is not much higher than that in the gramineous, the percentage in the
leguminous herbage is very much higher ; in fact, not far from twice as high. The
result is that, although there is by the mineral manure a greater increase in gramineous
than in leguminous hay, a larger proportion of the increase of nitrogen is due to the
leguminous than to the gramineous herbage ; whilst the miscellaneous herbage con-
tributes practically none of the increased yield of nitrogen. Again, whilst in the
unmanured produce the.
