such as displacement transducers, pyroelectric detectors, piezoelectric actuators, etc. [1-11]. This
has been due to the fact that the ferroelectric phase may be induced in these compositions
by application of an electric field or stress or by varying the temperature, which brings
about large strain and pyroelectric coefficient [1-7]. However, MPB PLZST compositions are
characterized by large electrical hysteresis and high phase transition temperature, which may
limit their uses for some applications. Several attempts have been made to overcome these
limitations by introducing dopants within the PLZST lattice. In particular, the doping of
PLZST with barium (Ba) has been demonstrated to reduce electrical hysteresis and bring down
the paraelectric-antiferroelectric and field-induced paraelectric—ferroelectric phase transition
temperatures towards room temperature [12,13]. Yet, only a few works have ever addressed
the study of Ba-doped Pbo 9gLag,92(Zr,Sn,Ti) bulk [12,13]. In the present work, we selected
the Pbo g7Bao,1 Lag,92(Zro.6Sn9 33 Tip.97)03 composition (abbreviated herein as PBLZST) in which,
according to Liu et al. [13], the paraelectric—antiferroelectric and field-induced paraelectric— : =
ferroelectric phase transitions occur near room temperature, a very attractive feature for many 3
