electrons are liberated only as a result of the chemical action between the products of
electrolysis of the material of the filament.

It has been mentioned that the emission from the material heated upon platinum
was, at first, considerably less than that from the platinum alone, and that this emission
gradually increased up to a steady value in the course of three or four hours’ heating.

290 DR. FRANK HORTON ON THE ORIGIN OF THE

The fact that the negative emission from a Wehnelt cathode often takes some time
before it reaches its full strength is considered by FrepENHAGEN to support his view
of the action of these cathodes. An investigation of this effect was therefore made in
the case of the Nernst filament material heated upon platinum. For this purpose a
strip of platinum foil was welded on to the platinum leads of the discharge tube and
was covered with the material ofa Nernst filament in the manner which has already
been described. The temperature of this strip was determined by means of a thermo-
junction welded on to it, and the thermionic emission was tested under different
potential differences and with different gas pressures in the apparatus. At a low
pressure and with 40 volts applied potential difference the negative emission was, at
first, very much smaller than that from platinum alone; the measured current at
1440° C, being 10-* amperes cm.’, and at 1500° C. 3°2x10-* amperes em.*—values
which remained fairly constant during two hours’ heating.
