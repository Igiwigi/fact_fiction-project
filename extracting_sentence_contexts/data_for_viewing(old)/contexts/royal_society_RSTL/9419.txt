meteorites, this rotation would necessarily result.

In Section 23 it is shown that the tidal friction due to the earth's action on the
moon must have been enormous, and it must necessarily have 800n brought her to
present the same face constantly to the earth. This explanation was, I believe, first
given by HezMmorLTz. In the process, the inclination of her axis to the plane of her
orbit must have rapidly increased, and then, as she rotated more and more slowly,
must have slowly diminished again. Her present aspect is thus in strict accordance
with the reults of the purely theoretical investigation.

It would perhaps be premature to undertake a complete review of the planetary
system, 80 as to 8ee how far the ideas here developed accord with it. Although many
facts which could be adduced seem favourable to their acceptance, I will only refer
to two. The atellites of Mars appear to me a most remarkable confirmation of these
views, Their extreme minuteness has prevented them from being snhbject to any per-
ceptible tidal reaction, Jusb as the minuteness of the earth compared with the gun has
prevented the earth's orbit from being perceptibly influenced (se Section 19); they thus
remain as a standing memorial of the primitive periodic time of Mars round his axis.
Mars, on the other hand, has been Subjected to solar tidal friction. This case, however,
deserves to be submitted to numerical calculation.

The other case is that of Uranus, and this appears to be 8omewhat unfavourable to
the theory ; for on account of the suppozed adverse revolution of the zatellites, and of

the high inclinations of their orbits, it is not easy to believe that they could have
