This would move it way off the S Doradus instability strip on
the HR diagram (figure 1). This is potentially a big problem for the traditional view of LBVs as
massive single stars in transition to the WR phase. While the Gaia DR1 distances to these LBVs
are still considered tentative [36], one may anticipate that the second data release from Gaia might
shake things up even more.


(c) An alternative evolutionary view ls |

The fact that LBVs are more isolated than WR stars, plus the fact that some stars appear to

remain in an LBV phase until death as SNe IIn, suggests an entirely different picture. Instead 3
of the monotonic evolutionary scheme for single stars, the spatial distributions of LBVs suggest 1s

that massive star populations and especially LBVs are dominated by bifurcated evolutionary
trajectories:

WN WC-=SN Ibc_ (donor)
LBV/B[e] > SN IIn (gainer). O star >

In this scenario, O-type stars evolve off the main sequence, and through binary interaction the
majority of massive stars either (i) lose their H envelope through mass transfer to a companion, :
become WR stars and die as stripped-envelope SNe, or (ii) gain mass from a companion, become :2
blue supergiants (BSGs), sgB[e]s and LBVs, and then retain their H envelopes until they die as 3
SNe IIn or other varieties of SNe II.
