San,
£ From the period of the establishment of the British Colonial Obseryatories in 1841, however, we may date the
existence of a more full and systematic investigation of the phenomena of the Decennial Magnetic Variation, not
limited to a single element, viz. the Declination, as in the cage of M. Araco's observations, but including also the
-Sphenomena of the Horizontal and Vertical Forces, observed or recorded by suitable methods. From the con-
current testimony obtained from localities widely separated from each other, such as Toronto in Canada, Hobarton
= in Tasmania, Munich in Germany, and Girard College in the United States of America, we have learnt that
1843-44 was an Epoch of Minimum, and 1848-49 an Epoch of Maximum Disturbance in each of the three
Magnetic Elements, The further evidence contained in this paper, derived from the Automatic Records of the
Horizontal and Vertical Forces at the Kew Observatory, shows that 1858-59 was also an Epoch of Maximum,
and 1863-64 an Epoch of Minimum.

The facts thus brought together exhibit an accordance (too close to be regarded as accidental) with the
Decennial Variation in the phenomena of the Solar Spots observed by Horzara Scuwapr, Hon, F.R.S., as
announced by himself in the following words :—* The numbers in the accompanying Table leave no doubt that
from 1826 to 1850 the occurrence of 8pots has been 80 far characterized by periods of ten years, that its maxima
have fallen in 1828, 1837, 1848, and its minima in 1833 and 1843,” [Huxzoror's Cosmos (Loxexax), vol. iii.
