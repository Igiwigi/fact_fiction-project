Spatial patterns of biases in reconstructed surface pCO, (average 2009-2018) as calculated from the two pCO,
products minus the original FESOM-REcoM p(0,, for MPI-SOM-FFN (left) and CarboScope (right) in the sampling schemes SOCAT
(top) and bgcArgo (bottom).

varying between —4 and +1 atm in MPI-SOM-FEN and between —4 and —1 patm in CarboScope
(figure 7). The maps of the mean pCO, bias (figure 8) illustrate that the pCO, biases are only partly
co-located with the CO flux biases (figure 6). In fact, CarboScope pCO, biases (outside of the
Arctic) stem mostly from the Weddell and Ross Seas and a small region in the northwest Pacific. These Southern Ocean regions are usually ice-covered and it is unlikely that pCO, biases in these
regions lead to substantial biases in CO2 flux. In MPI-SOM-FEN, the negative pCO, biases are
more equally distributed in the Southern Ocean, but are also not co-located with the CO) flux
biases (figures 6 and 8).
