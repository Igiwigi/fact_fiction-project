1002 ON THE SINGLE AND DOUBLE THETA-FUNCTIONS. and then operating with d on the equations A=wok,/ab, &c., we have for instance

AdB—BdA=o%yk;\ (wu +pr)(/adiv/b—1/Dd;i/a)
+(ou'+7v)(1/adz/b—=1/Ddgr/a)},

which is one of a system of 120 equations, the A, B being in fact any two of the 16
functions. These are in fact nothing else than the foregoing system of 120 equations giving the
values of the differential combinations 9,09; — 9,d3,, &c., each as a gum of products of
pairs of functions, only on the right-hand sides we haye expressions snch as
1/adix/b—1/bd,x/a, &e., which present themselves as perfectly determinate functions
of &, y/ : 80 that regarding wu'+pv', ou'+7v' as given linear functions of the arbitrary
quantities u/, v, there is no longer anything indeterminate in the form of the equations,
