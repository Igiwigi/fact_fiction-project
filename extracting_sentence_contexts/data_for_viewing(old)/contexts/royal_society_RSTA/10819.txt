The conclusions arrived at are the same in each case. In the first place the
distribution of energy which is given by Bonrzmann’s Theorem is the only distri-
bution which is permanent under the conditions postulated by this theorem. And in
the second place, this law of distribution may break down entirely as soon as we

admit an interaction, no matter how small, between the molecules and the sur-_
rounding ether. That such an interaction must exist is shown by the fact that a
gas is capable of radiating energy. In fact, BottzMann’s Theorem rests on the
assumption that the molecules of a gas form a conservative dynamical system, and
it will appear that the introduction of a small dissipation function may entirely
invalidate the conclusions of the theorem.* Thus we may regard the BorrzMayn
distribution as unstable, in the sense that a slight deviation from perfect conserva-
tion of energy may result in a complete redistribution of the total energy, and it
will appear that this new distribution of energy will lead to values for the ratios of

g the two specific heats which are not open to the objections mentioned above.
¥ § 2. A second difficulty, of a mathematical rather than physical nature, may be
FE mentioned here, as it will occur incidentally in the course of the analysis. It is
