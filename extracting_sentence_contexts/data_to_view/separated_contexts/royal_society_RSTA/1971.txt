Nevertheless, in a previous work the macroscopic
velocity gradients approach has been used for its stability in a wide number of conditions [60]. In this application, special treatment has to be used at interface where there is no possibility to
correctly evaluate the velocity gradient. In fact, at every interface node there is at least one gas
neighbour (not resolved as stated in §2c), thus, in this condition, velocity at neighbour gas node is
assumed to be equal to the value at donor interface cell—assuming a zero gradient approximation. GAS (light)
