Similarly, more than 90% of rivers
in part because they may occur along a continuum of time exhibit elevated nitrogen and phosphorus levels in most
scales. For example, provisioning can cause relatively rapid regions of the USA, and the annual economic costs of eutro-
changes in animal foraging behaviour and movement patterns phication in the USA exceed $2 billion [27]. Here, we leverage
that can lead to host aggregation and thus increased contact the fact that resource supplementation is a near ubiquitous
rates as a result of resource provisioning [10]. After these aspect of the Anthropocene to identify the unifying and
resources are consumed, they can drive substantial increases unique effects of supplementation on disease across eco-
or decreases in parasite production and virulence through logical contexts. Thus, we define resource supplementation
physiological responses of hosts and parasites [15-17].
