As s0on as these
[muscular fibres] appear in the fibrous form, there are seen in them round, very pale
nuclei, which lie near together. From this it may be inferred, that here the cells
arrange themselves likewise longitudinally, but coalesce immediately with one another
without being drawn out into fibrillee. This conjecture is confirmed by the fact that

fibril with a nucleus in each cell. This pectinate object, however, I haye not hitherto
