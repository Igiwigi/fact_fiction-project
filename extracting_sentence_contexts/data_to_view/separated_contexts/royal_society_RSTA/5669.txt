The point is that all the other relaxation
times of the spectrum are of the order of 1, irrespective of temperature and field strength;
therefore, the corresponding modes do not play any significant role in the magnetic response at
wt <1. The behaviour of interwell relaxation time 11, as shown above, is qualitatively different. The exponential growth of 11(0,q) with the increase of o leads to the fact that this time in a
certain range of values q becomes much greater than the period of the field. In this case, the
system has no time to relax to an equilibrium state, and in result the relationship between the
average magnetization m and the field q is no longer single-valued: dynamic hysteresis arises. In the frequency range wt) <1, a necessary condition for that effect is the change of m when
the AFM vector switches between two energy wells.
