lost in the concentration of the swarm from a condition of infinite dispersion, until it
possessed its actual arrangement. In such a computation the rotational energy of the
system is negligible.

Suppose the Sun’s mass to be concentrated from infinite dispersion until it is
arranged in the form of a homogeneous sphere of radius @ and density p. Then let
the sphere be cut up into as many equal spaces as there are meteorites, and let the
matter in each space be concentrated into a meteorite. When the number of
meteorites is large, the potential energy lost in the first process is very great compared
with that lost in the subsequent partial condensation into meteorites.* Thus, the
energy lost in the partial condensation is negligible.

* It depends, in fact, on the square of the ratio of the diameter 2a to the linear dimersion of one of
the equal spaces.

If » be'the attractional constant, the lost energy of condensation is well known to
be $4M,2/a. But on the hypothesis that there is no loss of energy at each encounter,
this must be equal to the sum of the kinetic energies of all the meteorites, If, there-
fore, v’ be the mean square of velocity of a meteorite, we must have 4 My? = 3pM,*/a,
so that v? = $y M,/a.

But homogeneity of density and uniformity of kinetic energy of agitation are
