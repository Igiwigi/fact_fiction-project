The question then arises as to the
mechanism of these movements of the digestive tract. How are they initiated, and by
what means are they carried out ? The experimental data available indicate that the
thythmical movements of smooth muscle are myogenic in origin, and this fact,
originally demonstrated by ENGELMANN, has received confirmation from many workers. Bayuiss and Srariine found that a solution of nicotine of sufficient strength to paralyse
the ganglia abolished the myenteric reflex and left the rhythmical contractions unaffected. FiercHer (26) confirmed this statement when he showed that the retractor penis
muscle of the dog and cat, which is said to contain no nerve cells, undergoes rhythmical
movements when removed from the animal, and further confirmation is afforded by the
investigations of Gunn and Unprrutt (27), ALvaAREzZ and Manonry (2).
