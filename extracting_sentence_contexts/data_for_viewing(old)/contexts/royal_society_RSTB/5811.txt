drainage system appropriate to this farm: thus, the big impermeable area round
105n-270e might be drainable into a sump at that point which penetrated to permeable
soil below, but we do not know how deep the sump would have to be; it might be
13 m., as at 10s-510e. Collection to a central drainage pump would necessitate the
use of water-tight drain pipes when passing through permeable areas, otherwise the
drained impermeable areas would be back-filled with infiltration water in the autumn.
Any attempt to arrest water from the canals by trap drains, which was actually tried
by the senior author in 1912, is evidently entirely futile; the true-scale section of
fig. 29, p. 362, exemplifies this.

In spite of all the evidence obtained from this area, it is clear that any attempt to
fit a drainage scheme to it would still be largely a process of trial and error, on account
of the fact that we have merely scratched the surface with one observation at 13 m.,
one series at 6 m., two dozen at 3 m., and 200 at 14 m. In any intelligent planning
a knowledge of the “ surface-geology ” to much greater depths would be needed, and
herein we see no hope except from geophysical methods. The one thing quite clear is
that a lining to the canals would deepen our available soil appreciably.

A little more can be extracted from our data with respect to the direction of water-
