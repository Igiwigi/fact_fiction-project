Thus, the absolutely reduced
model (focusing on area III, figure 3) is also reasonable. In this case, one has to think about the
assumption seriously that fibres are adapted to void geometry as a sinusoidal curve, as shown
in other publications [4,26]. Owing to the fact that interlaminar voids hardly affect the fibre
orientation, an estimation of the compressive strength based on fibre orientation alone would
be inappropriate. In general, the specimens were manufactured by using glass fibres and rovings, respectively. This allows the investigation of stress-strain conditions in the matrix around a unique void by
using optical evaluation methods such as light transmission microscopy, photoelasticity and DIC.
