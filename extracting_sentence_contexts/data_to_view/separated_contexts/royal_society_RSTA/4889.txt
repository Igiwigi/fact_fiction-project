The internal radius of the helix was fixed by the dimensions of the jacket. sur-
Bounding the tube, and preliminary experiments showed that for the jacket to be
Bilicient the internal radius of the helix had to be at least 2°5 centims. @ From the fact that in most liquids the rotation is much smaller than in carbon
Bisulphide, in order to obtain sufficiently accurate readings in the case of such liquids,
felt it desirable that our apparatus should be designed to give with carbon
Bisulphide a double rotation of at least 40°. For the electromotive force and
“aximum current at our disposal (90 volts and 5 amperes), and for « tube of infinite
@ngth, we calculated the number of turns of wire which would give the above
a and from considerations of the weight of the helix and the heating effect due
the passage of the current, we chose No. 18 8. W.G. wire as being the most suitable.
