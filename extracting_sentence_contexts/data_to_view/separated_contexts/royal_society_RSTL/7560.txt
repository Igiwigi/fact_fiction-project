CLARKE ON THE INTIMATE STRUCTURE OF THE BRAIN. 315

sible to 8ay how far it might have been dependent on the numerous and extensive
alterations which were found in other parts of the brain, particularly about the nuclei
of the vagal and hypoglossal nuclei. 'The same objection may be made to SCYRODER
VAN DER IKOLK'S cages, when they are adduced as proofs that the olivary bodies are the
central organs of articulate speech.

(81) Neither are the anatomical points which SCHRODER VAN DER KOLK brings forward
in support of this opinion exactly as he states them to be. According to his theory, the
olivary bodies effect the bilateral movement of the tongue by their action on the hypo-
glossal nuclei, because the actions of these nuclei are unilateral ; © for the greater part
f cach nucleus,” he says © seems to be isvlated in its action, and not to be connected
ith that of the other side.” Now it is not true that the hypoglossal nuclei are scarcely
onnected with each other other; for, as may be seen, especially in longitudinal and
orizontal sections along the fourth ventricle, at different depths of the nuclei, there is
yery evident, decussation of fine fibres; and at the upper end of the nucleus, the com-
Snissural fibres between the anterior groups of cells are particularly striking, as may be
S>zeen at J, fig. 57, Plate XIV. VULPLAN speaks almost in derision of SCHRODER VAN DER
FKoux's theory of the action of the olivary bundles; but, nevertheless, there are not
nting anatomical facts in favour of the opinion that these bodies are subservient to
ticulate speech. In this process, the tongue, the lips, the jaws and the expiratory
_ are simultaneously combined in action. Now I have already shown that the
Zonnexion of the olivary bodies with the hypoglossal nuclei is yery striking.
