My results are, therefore, in accord with the opinion expressed in BUNGNER’s
recent paper, that the nuclei and protoplasm of the interannular segments must be
viewed as neuroblasts, their function being to produce new nerve fibres. And,
taking into account the observations of 8. Meyer (100, 108, 125), it would appear
that the exercise of their function is not reserved for accidents such as nerve section,
but occurs normally, the fibres undergoing a normal degeneration and regeneration.
The bundles of young fibres were seen by HowrLt and Huser (156) in the
peripheral end of nerves which had not united, but having failed to stain the axis-
cylinder they call them “ embryonic fibres,” and find that they receive axis-cylinders
only by growth of the latter from those of the old fibres in the central end. That
these fibres observed by Howet and Huser were really nerve fibres, is shown by
the fact that when the peripheral segment, containing only such, was mechanically
irritated, a low degree of irritability and conductivity was found.

4, Characters of the Young Fibres.

The young fibres appear with a central axis-cylinder, with a protoplasmic surround-
ing zone, having a well-defined outline, and with spindle-shaped nuclei attached at
short intervals to their sides. It is evident, therefore, that the nuclei do not form
the axis-cylinder as described by Bowxpy (146), but that in the formation of the
fibre only the central portion of the primitive protoplasmic thread becomes developed
into the axis-cylinder. In many fibres, both in the central and peripheral ends, the
protoplasmic zone contains a granular deposit which takes on the characteristic tint
of myeline by treatment with Wetcrrt’s method (Plate 8, fig. 6). It is, therefore,
