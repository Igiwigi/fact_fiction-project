& form a sheath to the lower edge of the nasal septum. At the same time the process

5 is not really similar to that which must have occurred in mammalian ancestors, if the

view that the mammalian vomer is the homologue of that of the reptiles be correct,
é because in each case it is associated with a very great reduction of the paraseptal
5 cartilages and of Jacobsen’s organ. Judging from the large size of the paraseptal
g cartilages in Monotremes, Marsupials, and Insectivora, this region was well developed
3 sin ancestral mammals.

3 This view of the mode of development of the mammalian vomer is supported by

a the fact that in Echidna and Mus (Gaver) and the Guinea-pig (PARKER) the
a mammalian vomer is developed as a paired bone.

The alternative view of the homology of the mammalian vomer is that of
Bianp-Surron as developed by Broom. According to this theory the mammalian
yomer is not homologous with the prevomers of reptiles, but is developed from the
reptilian parasphenoid, J

Tn specimen 8 of Ornithorhynchus the paraseptal cartilages are well developed, as
shown in the model which Prof. Wrrtson has already described. The shape and
relations of the two splints which support them and which by their fusion form the
dumb-bell-shaped bone are adequately expressed by the following quotation from
Prof. Gaurp, “ Entsteht in der Umbegung der Cart. paraseptalis, diekt mit seiner
