he was mistaken according to Soxms (Joc. cit., p. 184). He admits the

er denies the last facts (‘ Bot. Zeit.” 1873, p. 92), and GorBEL agrees
initial cell is not present. He maintains, however, that the synangium is of
st origin on the sporangiophore, and describes the sporogenous tissue of each
referable to a single archesporial cell, but this single cell he has not

ous tissue. The above are the chief results obtained by previous inyesti-
the internal details of early development in Psilotwm.
tailed study of the synangium of Psilotum by means of sections is more
l€ than that of Tmesipteris on account of its tri-locular character. In radial
wxthrough the terminal bud, the young sporangiophores are found to present a
Jsputline and structure similar to those of Z’mesipteris (compare figs. 134, 136).
aa shows one such: the cell (x) is believed to represent the organic apex of
Ban giophore, though it is doubtful whether it be this initial which gives rise
