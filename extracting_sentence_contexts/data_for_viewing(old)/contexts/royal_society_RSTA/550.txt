of the permittivity, nspp > /€eq. The transformation distorts the four arcs of the circle into
straight edges of a square. The resulting effective permittivity distribution is shown in figure 6a.
The background permittivity when extracting the material tensors is appropriately selected to
provide a desired range of graphene conductivity values. From the effective permittivity (or
impedance), the corresponding imaginary conductivity values can be calculated, as shown in
figure 6b, using the fact that ngpp = €eq. The chemical potential is then computed assuming that
Ir =0.43 meV, T = 300K and f =30THz. Then, from the chemical potential, designers have the
choice of numerically solving for the required substrate permittivity, thickness or bias voltage
using equations (7.6) and (7.7) to achieve the desired GRIN profile. In this case, we solve for
the required substrate permittivity distribution, shown in figure 6c, assuming d=50nm and
V;, = 25 V. This range of values can be effectively reduced by clipping the extreme regions at the
corners without significant performance degradation. Here, the graphene layer can be designed
to be supported on SiO} (€; = 3.9).
