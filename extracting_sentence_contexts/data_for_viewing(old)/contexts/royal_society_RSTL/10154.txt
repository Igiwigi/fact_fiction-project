powerful refrigeration. I close these references to misb and haze by mentionin,
most, striking observation made by WELLs on the 186 January, 1814. *T found,”
says, * during a dense fog, while the weather was very calm, a thermometer lying
grass thickly covered with hoar frost, 9* lower than another suspended in the
4 feet above the former.”* Here, as before, low temperature implies scanty vapo
the absence of which enabled the grass to pour its heat even through the interstices
a dense fog.t

I could draw still farther on this admirable Exsay in illustration of the thesis which
have 80 long defended. As a repertory of valuable facts and penetrative argument
it probably stands unrivalled in the literature of meteorology. One point remaing
which cannot be passed over. Tb has reference to the part played by clouds in arrest>
ing and returning the radiation from the earth. *No direct experiments,” yg
WzLLs, © can be made to ascertain the manner in which clouds prevent, or occasion
to be small, the appearance of a cold at night, upon the surface of the earth, greater
than that of the atmosphere ; but it may, I think, be firmly (fairly ?) concluded from
what has been said in the preceding article, that they produce this effect, almost
entirely, by radiating heat to the earth, in return for that which they intercept in its
progress from the earth towards the heavens.” } WELLs had the strongest analogies
to adduce in favour of this view. He placed boards and sheets of paper above his
thermometers, thus screening them from the clear sky; and in that beautiful passage
where he speaks of * the pride of self knowledge,” and refers to the simple devices which
