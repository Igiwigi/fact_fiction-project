where 73 = diag(1, —1), 6 = diag(o, —oyaoy) and ‘*’ denotes a 4 x 4 matrix in Nambu spin space.
The lesser (<) propagators can be obtained as @< = 5(¢K — g8 + 4). The itinerant electrons
generate a spin transfer torque which gives a contribution to the torque in equation (2.1) as
t =f. — ie

The spin independence of §°(¢) and the form of the hopping elements simplify the time-
dependent problem. This simplification can be made due to the fact that the Keldysh-Nambu
spin matrices can be factorized in spin space into generalized diagonal matrices, Xa, spin-raising


matrices, X, and spin-lowering matrices, x ,. In general, a matrix factorized in this form has the
time dependence

X(t.) = (22)! [as eX a(e, op) + eX) (e, op) + el! X (e, or). (2.8)

The matrices Xa, Xx} and X y are still Keldysh- Nambu matrices and, in addition, obey the usual
algebraic rules for spin matrices, i.e. Xx ° Y= = xX ° Y= =0, X, ro Ys, | xZq and Xyo Ys, mea
