MUMMERY ON SOME POINTS IN THE

porated in the bundles (Plate 37, fig. 2), reminding one very much of the oe |
in developing membrane-bone, where osteoblasts are seen applied to, and lying
between, the bundles of osteogenic fibres. ;

In the last preparation referred to (Plate 37, fig. 2), which is cut in the plane of
the odontoblasts, their nuclei are seen in the interspaces of these bundles although
the outline of the cells cannot be made out. A section which is not cut in the exact plane of the odontoblast cells exhibits the
fibrous trabecule with greater distinctness than one cut in that plane, although they
can readily be seen among the odontoblasts in the latter preparations. I think this
is accounted for by the fact that the stained odontoblasts lying among these fibres
hide them to a great extent, but when cut obliquely, the odontoblast nuclei are seen
end on, and the regular layer of cells not being conspicuous, the connective tissue
bundles are more clearly seen. Many of the cells which are in contact with the processes above described, especially
those which appear to be involved in the bundles, are distinctly smaller than the
odontoblasts, and seem too closely applied to these bundles to be interpreted as
odontoblasts. Associated, therefore, with these latter cells are other cells which, I
believe, play an important part in dentine development, but they are destitute of
processes, and not arranged in a definite layer.
