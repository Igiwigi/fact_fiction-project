of weight 49 which showed up in the last two proofs will be generated but deleted before it has
a chance to be selected as given. If all goes well, PROVER9 will find a proof that bypasses that
clause. Here is the result.

% Length of proof is 192.

% Level of proof is 33.

% Maximum clause weight is 41.

Note that we had a very significant drop in the proof length, and in fact, the maximum clause
weight dropped well below our cut-off of 48. PROVER9 was forced to search among clauses of
smaller weight and it paid off.

Let us try again, reducing the maximum clause weight to 40. As before, we keep using each
proof as a sketch for the next proof.

% Length of proof is 216.

% Level of proof is 35.
