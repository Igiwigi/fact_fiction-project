It was difficult to visualize a mechanism of growth which could lead to a radiating
fibrous appearance, a tangential disposition of the molecules and an ‘onion-like’ structure. In the case of crystals growing in polymers the crystallizing units are segments of long
molecules and the addition of segments to the crystal phase is very much conditioned by
what has gone on before and the state of order in the segments of the chains near the
crystallizing surface. An isolated small crystal growing in a randomly arranged long-
chain polymeric system can in the first place be expected to have a faster rate of growth
along the direction of the chain owing to the fact that in this direction there are far more
chains already in suitable juxtaposition for propagation of the crystal growth. Growth of
radiating fibrils from the nucleation point on this picture of the mechanism of the growth
will not on first sight result in a tangential disposition of the molecules. One possibility is
that at an early stage in the development of the spherulite, sheaf-like growth develops into
layer growth after the ends of the sheaves meet at the equator of the structure.
