An unsatisfactory feature of the approximation must be pointed out at this stage. The
general nature of the wave function is doubtless reasonably well represented by (51). But what
is actually required is that a refined property of it should be given accurately. Thus to yield the
1/r, term of the integral in (48) precisely, the multiple of y;,(r,) contained in Y’ must be

H,(r,)+G,(r,)- (53)

In fact with the adopted ‘V" the value of this component is

(Jexp (tym, 12) ¥ (C2) dra) p(t), (54)

which is clearly incorrect. The similarity of the 1/r,, term suggests that it is also poorly
determined. In view of this it is best to retain the second integral in (52) as given, in the

t The vital difference between the Born and Oppenheimer approximations is that between equations
(17) and (51) rather than that between (11) and (45) (which is formal only).
