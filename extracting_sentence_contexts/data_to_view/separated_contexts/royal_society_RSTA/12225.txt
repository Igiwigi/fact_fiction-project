Are they not solid ?
a As regards the assumed constancy of p, a more complete theory must, to be correct,
feduce to one assuming constancy of p, because, as Lord Rayiercn* has shown, the
umed law has a limited range of validity, and is therefore justifiable as a preparation
dpr more complete views. Theoretical requirements are not identical with those of
he practical engineer.
i But, for quite other reasons, the dynamically determined stress might be entirely
srong. Electric and magnetic “force” and their energies are facts. But it is the
otal of the energies in concrete cases that should be regarded as the facts, rather
hen their distribution ; for example, that, as Sir W. THomson proved, the “mechanical
‘Balue” of a simple closed current C is }LC*, where L is the inductance of the circuit
oefficient of electromagnetic capacity), rather than that its distribution in space is
given by SHB per unit volume.
