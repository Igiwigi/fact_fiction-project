This extra handle through the
barrier width w (absent in thermal escape probability) can help in its vanishing limit. This has
led to some important clues (see e.g. the discussions in this regard in [8]). In fact, the recent
rigorous study [9] on the transverse SK spin glass provides some support for this aspect in the
low-temperature limit, implying the possibility of quantum annealing (see also [10]). In parallel
the adiabatic quantum computation in the same context of such NP-hard computational problems
was developed [11]. The quantum annealing technique was finally launched through the paper by Kadowaki &
Nishimori [12] and its experimental demonstration by Brooke et al. [13].
