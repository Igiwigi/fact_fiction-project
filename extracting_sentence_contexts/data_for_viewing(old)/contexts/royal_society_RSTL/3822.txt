either general or local.

It may be objected, that the membrane lining the viscera of graminivorous animals
is less snsceptible than that which performs the same office in man ; but as, on trial,
liquids which irritate and inflame the human organs, act in the same way, and with
the same rapidity on those of the sheep, I see no reason to believe that the one is
less snsceptible of such impressions than the other. Experiments of a personal na-

conviction, that no evil could accrue from the continued introduction of saturnine

+ I refrain, for obvious reasons, from entering into particulars as to the general effect of solutions of the
salts of lead in various morbid states of the bladder ; although I may be allowed perhaps to direct attention to
the property these salts possess of coagulating mucus,—a property they do not fail to exercise on the secretion
from the living organ, independently of their decomponent effects on the phosphate of lime which that secre-
