He observed that the Nauplius eye was composed of two
halves, and also fixed the position of the anus. Max Scrunrze (11), in 1853, observed in the heliotropic
Chthamalus the Nauplius eye, consisting of two halves, and restin

Nauplii of Balanus and
g directly on the
brain. Kroun (13), in 1860, figured a Balanid (Balanus ?) and a Lepad (Lepas?)
Nauplius, and correctly but briefly described and figured the brain and sub-
esophageal ganglia connected together on each side of the cesophagus in Lepas
anatifera ; he also recognized the alimentary canal, and drew attention to the fact

that the anus was dorsal.

* These were also seen and figured by Stareer,
