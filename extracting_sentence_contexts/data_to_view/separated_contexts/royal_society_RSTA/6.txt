The evaluation of the stress object on the
derivative of the generalized velocity, as represented by the jet of the corresponding vector field,
is equal to the power of the force functionalâ€”a generalization of the principle of virtual work
in continuum mechanics. Just as one would expect, without any constitutive information, a force
does not determine a unique representing stress. On the other hand, it is emphasized that the
significance of the representation of forces by measures stems from the fact that measures are the
most irregular objects that may be naturally restricted to sub-bodies of the body. As such, a stress
induces a force system in the body. In spite of the advantages of the Lagrangian point of view, the notion of a material point,
which is conserved in all configurations of a body, is not general enough (e.g. [15]).
