(a) Non-vanishing of the polynomials defining B,,

Proposition 4.1. Given a non-zero polynomial a€F,[x] with dega <n, the function ar
Res(6¢(#), 5¢4a(t)) is not the zero polynomial, that is, the polynomial function

R(a) = Resi(8y(0), 5p 4a(t)) € Pala (4.1)
is not identically zero.

We note that the proof of the analogous proposition in odd characteristic [1, proposition 3.1]
did not in fact rely on the characteristic being odd. We may follow the same arguments to see again
that R(a) cannot be identically zero. More accurately, the proof in [1] referred to the polynomial
Res;(Dr(t), D¢+a(#)), which, in characteristic 2, is equivalent to Res,(57(#), 5 “pa (f)) = R(a)*. The main
observation behind the proof was that the roots of D¢(t), which are the same as the roots of df(t),
are exactly those f for which there exists some p (in some fixed algebraic closure of Fy) that satisfies
f'(p) =0 and t = —f(p). This observation is just as valid in characteristic 2 as are the calculations
that followed. This completes the proof of inequality (3.20).

(b) Non-vanishing of the polynomials defining A,

We wish to show that the algebraic condition for being in Ay, i.e. Res(6f, =F) =0, is not always
satisfied. We will demonstrate this by giving explicit examples of f that do not satisfy the
equation.* We will construct two generic examples, depending on the parity of 1. The relevant
