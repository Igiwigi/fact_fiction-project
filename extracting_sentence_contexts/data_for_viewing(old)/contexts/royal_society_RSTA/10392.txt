We may now briefly review the principal results of the foregoing investigation, so
far as they may be expected to throw light on the propagation of seismic tremors
over the surface of the earth.

Tt has been necessary to idealize this problem in various ways in order to render it
amenable to calculation. In the first place, the material is taken to be compact and

“

homogeneous, to have, in fact, the properties of the “isotropic elastic solid” of
theory. Moreover, the curvature of the surface is neglected. Again, instead of a
disturbance originating at an internal point, we study chiefly the case of an impulse
applied vertically to the surface. Under these conditions the disturbance spreads
over the surface in the form of a symmetrical annular wave-system. The initial form
of this system will depend on the history of the primitive impulse, but if this be of
limited duration, the system gradually develops a characteristic form, marked by
three salient features travelling with the velocities proper to irrotational, equi-
voluminal, and Rayleigh waves, respectively. As the wave-system, thus established,
passes any point of the surface, the horizontal displacement shows first of all a single
well-marked oscillation followed by a period of comparative quiescence, and then
another oscillation corresponding to the epoch of arrival of equivoluminal waves.
The whole of this stage constitutes what we have called the “minor tremor” ; it is,
