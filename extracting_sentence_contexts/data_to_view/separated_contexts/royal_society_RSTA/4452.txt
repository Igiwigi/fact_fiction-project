The pertinent numerator can be regarded as a kind
of ‘distance’ between two contiguous probabilities. Thus, a different ordering of the pertinent
summands would lead to a different Fisher information value. In fact, if we have a discrete PDF
given by P = {p;,i=1,...,N} we will have N! possibilities for the i ordering. The question is, which is the arrangement that one could regard as the ‘proper’ ordering? The answer is straightforward in some cases, a histogram-based PDF constituting a conspicuous
example.
