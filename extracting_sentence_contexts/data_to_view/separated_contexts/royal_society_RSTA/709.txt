It is convenient to state here that the results obtained with
the various seismographs show conclusively that the great majority of the shocks do
arise from foci under the island. The most severe earthquakes occurred at times of most pronounced seismic activity
as measured by the daily number of tremors. They produced considerable damage to
buildings but no loss of life resulted, owing to the fact that most of the population
dwell in light wooden structures. The few buildings of reinforced concrete were
unaffected, but even the most massive masonry structures, such as the windmill tower
on the Gages estate, were severely damaged. At the time of the departure of the members of the expedition from England the
latest news from Montserrat was that of the very active period in November 1935.
