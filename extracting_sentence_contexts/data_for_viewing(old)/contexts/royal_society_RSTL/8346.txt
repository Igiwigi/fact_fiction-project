The bulbs and tubes were prepared in the following manner :—They were first drawn
out, at the lower ends into capillary points (fig. 3, b, 6) and sealed in the flame; the
upper ends were plugged at a, @ with cotton-wool.

t The avoidance of air-contamination is important for another reason. The air is admitted, by most
observers, to be highly charged with fungoid germs, and the growth of fungi has appeared to me to be anta-
gonistic to that of Bacteria, and vice vers4, I have repeatedly observed that liquids in which the Penicitium

mlaueum was growing luxuriantly could with difficulty be artificially infected with Bacteria ; it 86emed, in fact,
as if this fungus played the part of the plants in an aquarium, and held in check the growth of Bacteria, with
their attendant putrefactive changes. On the other hand, the Penicilium glaucum 8eldom grows vigorously, if
it grow at all, in liquids which are full of Bacteria.

It has further seemed to me that there was an antagonism between the growth of certain races of Bacteria
and certain other races of Bacteria,

On the panspermic theory it may be assumed that what takes place when an organic liquid is expozed to the
contamination of air or water is this :—A considerable variety of germinal partieles are introduced into it, and
it depends on a number of conditions (composition of the liquid, its reaction, precedence and abundance of the
8everal germs) which of these shall grow and take a lead, and which shall partially or wholly lie dormant and
unproductive. There is probably in such a case a struggle for existence and a survival of tho fittest. And it
