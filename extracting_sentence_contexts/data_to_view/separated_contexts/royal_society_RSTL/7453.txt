In the eggs of Gasterosteus it 8eems certain that
the water mainly enters to fill the breathing-chamber through the micropyle, and under
-ordinary cireumstances, not by imbibition through the yelk-sac. It is s0mewhat difficult
to conceive how the passage of such a minute body as a spermatozooid through the tube
of the micropyle, closed as it seems to be only by the viscid secretion of the oviduct,

* This is only ascertained to be the fact in Gasterosteus. In most other osseous fishes water enters freely
through the yelk-sac, and the breathing-chamber may probably commence simultaneously at all parts of the
surface, In frogs I believe that T have witnessed its commencement, as in Gasterosters, first near the micropylc. 3q2
