It may be noticed that there would be considerable uncertainty as to the nature of
the contacts between bar and crystal unless some special precautions were taken,
Lopce proposed to use pads of tinfoil to obviate this difficulty, but this method is
not satisfactory. The difficulty has, however, been completely overcome by using
bars of a material which would amalgamate, and making the contacts by means of

mercury. Description of Apparatus. (Fig. 1.)

The bar used in the experiments was one of brass, which presents several advantages.

(1) Tt readily amalgamates, and therefore enables good contacts to be made.

(2) Its conductivity is not so high as to make comparison between it and that of
crystals, &c., impossible.

(3) Its conductivity, according to Lorenz, increases with the temperature, a fact
which, as will be seen later, partly neutralises the deviation of the cooling from
Newron’s law,

The diameter of the bar was 1:93 cm., and its length 67 em. To each end of the
bar was soldered a can, through one of these cans steam was sent and through the other _
water, The whole was arranged in a wooden frame, so that the bar was horizontal and
exposed to the air over a covered tank through which a current of water could be
sent to keep the temperature constant. The apparatus was surrounded by ae
sereens to protect the bar as far as possible from air currents in the room.
