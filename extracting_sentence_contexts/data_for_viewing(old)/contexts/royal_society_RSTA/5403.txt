almost equivalent. We have found that they all give the same result in terms of significant
WPC peaks.

Figure 4 shows the results for all subjects, but we have found that the same considerations
apply to males and females separately. In the respiration-IHF phase coherence (figure 4a), there is
a highly significant peak in the respiratory frequency range, corresponding to the well-known
respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). It was also observed previously in the cardiorespiratory
coherence function, although the corresponding significance levels were not always estimated
reliably (see [53] for discussion and references therein). We have observed a decrease with age


in the respiratory peak WPC (not shown: p = —0.38 for males and p = —0.35 for females with
p < 0.001 for both). Coupled with the fact that the respiratory frequency and its standard deviation
do not depend on age (figure 1b), this suggests that RSA becomes more unstable with age.

In the respiration-IHF WPC, there is also a significant peak at the cardiac frequency, which
could not have been observed using the earlier ME- or IPFM-based methods of IHF extraction.
It suggests that IHF and respiration share a cardiac component. Nevertheless, it is actually a
measurement artefact, because the apparent cardiac component in respiration is attributable to the
direct influence of heart beats on the respiratory measuring belt, which is not removed completely
by the smoothing procedure (see appendix B). However, the presence of a cardiac component in
the IHF is something new and interesting. It is clearly evident in the wavelet and SWTs of the IHF
(not shown), but will not be discussed further here.

We find no significant coherence at all between the IHF and IRF (figure 4b). This implies that
