explanation would seem to me to involve a greater uniformity and a higher angle on
the slopes than actually exists.

I cannot, in fact, see that any theory of wave action will enable us to explain the
phenomena. If the original slope «, b, of the hillside were, as in fig. 8, B (p. 696), less
than that of the angle of repose of the detritus, the wear of it by wavelet erosion
would, as the materials were gradually removed, give rise to a slope at m greater than
that which existed above beyond the reach of the fall, while the debris falling from nm
into the lake 7, would equally, as they were carried over the shelf Rr, form at 7 a s8lope
which would also be that of the angle of repose ; and that being the same in water as
in air, the slope of m would be the same as that of n, and greater than that of the

line a, b. But with one or &wo local exceptions, no such indent as m exists, and

nowhere does a ridge such as formed by n occur on any s8ection of the parallel roads.
If, on the other hand, the line a, b (fig. 10) had been that of the angle of repose of
