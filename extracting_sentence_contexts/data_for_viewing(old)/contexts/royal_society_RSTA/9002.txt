The O-—C values for these are given in the above list before the wave-numbers,
They are larger than we should expect the observation errors to be. If, however, the
limit be reduced by ‘40 and yp, a calculated from the first two, the O—C for m = 4
is —°04 and zero for all the others, m = 5...8- For m = 9, using L.D. 23168+3—167
as the observed for the first of the pair the O—C is 2. The agreement for all is
therefore exceedingly close except for m= 4. The calculated wave-number for this is
1967750 which makes the separation 166°72 and more in step with the others. The
uncertainty in the limit 24104'67 must therefore be very small.

The doublet separations show a tendency to converge with increasing order, but this
is clearly due to the fact that the constant separation must be taken between the
strong first line and the weak second. After m= 3 the weak is not seen and the
observed separation is not the true one but that between the first and the second
strong one. The separation in the second series is somewhat larger than in the first,
that for the first being 167°17 and for the second 168'25+04 (mean for m= 2, 3).
These require limit mantissee changes of 7354 in the first where 30843 = 7354°1, and
of 47°79+1°76 extra for the other where 3)= 46°41. The separation 1°73 between
the four satellites in the first doublet must be due to displacement in the sequent. It
requires a mantissa change of 209 and 1446 = 209°8.

These considerations point strongly to the conclusion that the series are of the
F type. Fortunately, owing to the fact that the first line of the first series has been
very accurately measured by B.M.M., as \ = 8495°380 I.A., it is possible to test if the
