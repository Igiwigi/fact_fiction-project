This disadvantage, however, is off-set by the general uniformity and, for the present
purpose, any chromosome which can be completely seen at any stage, will be used
as a basis of comparison. An element of uncertainty is admittedly introduced by such
interchange, but for the moment this is immaterial, since many of the more difficult
measurements only admit of approximate evaluation in any case. * Without quoting the literature fully, the most important papers on the cytology of Osmunda may
be enumerated as: 1894, Strasburger’s demonstration of different chromosome numbers in sporophyte
and gametophyte and the fact of numerical reduction occurring in the spore mother cells; 1900,
Strasburger’s first figures of the reduction process including various stages from diplotene to the second
division in Osmunda; 1904, some very excellent figures of prophase stages in Osmunda by Farmer and
Moore, but misinterpretation of the ‘early spireme”’ led to the unfortunate conception of telosynapsis;
1907 and 1910, some very good figures by Grégoire, correctly interpreted, of zygotene and pachytene
in this plant with consequent re-emphasis of idea of parasynapsis; 1919, paper by Digby giving detailed
interpretation of Osmunda in terms of telosynapsis; 1927, paper by Szakien repeating Grégoire’s
interpretation in terms of parasynapsis; 1932, announcement (Manton) of chromosome numbers in
polyploid material derived from aposporously produced prothalli (Lang 1924); 1936 (Manton),
demonstration of spiral structure. AND CHROMOSOME PAIRING IN OSMUNDA REGALIS 183

A morphological detail, the effect of which should be understood, is the position
of the attachment constriction. This is in no case median but is terminal or subterminal.
