where 6, is the angle so denoted in § 2.6, so that it is the analogue of 8. Hence it follows
that, at such a point,

When b/a ~ « the formula (4) reduces to that for a long rectangle, but, if a/b > ~ it
reduces to the form for ge in (2).

The fact that, as P approaches M,, the limits of the stress-components depend upon
0, which defines the direction of approach, is in accord with the theorem of the indeter-
minacy of stress at the bounding curve of the pressed area (§ 1.4), the pressure on the
bounding plane of the solid changing discontinuously from the constant value p to
zero in crossing this curve. A particular case of this indeterminacy is that the stress-
component 92 = 0 if 0 =0 or x, but 62 = — p/x if 0 = 4x. That is to say, if first
z is made to tend to zero, and afterwards ¢ is made to tend to a, the value 0 is found ;
but, if first e is put equal to a, and afterwards z is made to tend to zero, the value — p/x
is found. This point was noticed by Boussrivesa.*

§ 3.8. We shall postpone further discussion of the stress produced by uniform pressure
over an area bounded by a circle, and observe here that results already stated or obtained
are sufficient for finding the displacement. For V is known from § 3.4 (4) and all the
