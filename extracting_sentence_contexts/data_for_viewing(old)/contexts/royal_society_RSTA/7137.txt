INTRODUCTION
Since 1944, when the important book Teoriya Grupp by Kuro’ appeared, the theory of
groups has made great advances, many of them in the directions indicated by Kuroé in the
concluding section of his book. When a German translation of the book was being prepared,
it was therefore decided to add as an appendix an exposition of some of the recent advances.
It fell to me to write this appendix, and the present essay has grown out of it.

In fact the greater part of this essay is a translation of the “Anhang’ which is shortly to
appear with Kurosch’s Gruppentheorie (translated by W. Hahn: Akademieverlag Berlin;
a Hungarian translation by A. Gascalyi, also with the appendix, is to be published by
Akadémiai Kiadé Budapest). I have, however, used this opportunity to revise and supple-
ment itina number of places, to embody some even more recent results and to draw attention
to others; some of these are now in course of publication.

Free products of groups with amalgamated subgroups, which form the central theme of
this exposition, are barely mentioned in the book by Kuro’ (1944); Magnus (1931, 1932)
had early recognized their value, but they had not yet fully established their usefulness.
However, they have recently shown themselves to be a powerful and versatile tool, as well
as interesting in their own right. They are here introduced, studied and applied to a number
of problems in abstract group theory. Much of their structure theory and many of their
