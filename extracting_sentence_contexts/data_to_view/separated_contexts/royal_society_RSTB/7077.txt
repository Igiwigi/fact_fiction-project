‘The arrow
indicates the direction of the shoot apex. (x 170.) From an examination of comparable leaf primordia in transverse sections, confirmation
was obtained of the fact that the very young primordium consists, not of a single enlarged
cell, but of a group of prism-shaped cells (figure 29). These cells rise above the general
level of the adjacent cells of the meristem and in thin, basipetal, serial sections are the first
to be cut. In figure 29 the stippling indicates the outer walls of cells of the apical meristem,
the clear cells being those of the outgrowing primordium which, at the same level, have
been cut through, ‘This point is illustrated by the photomicrographs in figures 76, 77,
plate 29, A later stage, as seen in transverse section, is illustrated in figure 78, plate 29.
