On cooling the platinum wire by plac-
ing it in water, it was found to. discharge 10 double plates,
When the intensity of the electricity is very high, however,
even the cooling powers of fluid media are of little avail :
thus I found that fine wire of platinum was fused , by the
discharge of a common electrical battery under water; 80 that
the conducting power must always be diminished by the heat
generated, in a greater proportion as the intensity of the elec-
tricity is higher. It might at first view be supposed, that when a conductor
placed in the circuit left a residuum of electricity in any- bat-
tery, increase of the power of the battery, or of its surface,
would not enable it to carry through any additional quantity. This, however, is far from-being the case.,

When saline solutions were placed in''the. circuit of a bat-
tery of 20 plates, though they discharged a very-small quan-
tity only of the electricity, when the troughs-were only full,
yet their chemical-decomposition exhibited-the fact of a much

larger quantity passing through them, when the cells were
filled with fluid. And a similar circumstance occurred with respect to a wire
of platinum, of such a length as to leave a considerable resi-
duum in a battery when only half its surface was used ; yet
when the whole surface was employed, it became much
hotter, and nevertheless left a still more considerable resi-
duum,

VII. I found long ago, that in increasing the number of
alternations of similar plates, the quantity of electricity seemed
to increase as the number, at least as far as it could be judged
of by the effects of heat upon wires; but only within certain
limits, beyond which the number appeared to diminish, rather
than increase the quantity.
