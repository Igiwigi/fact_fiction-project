but the comparison shown in fig. 25, with a skull whose gnathic index is 102, would
indicate that in the Talgai skull the index would not have been very much higher
than this; probably about 105 (the range in Australians being from 96 to 108). :

The spheno-maxillary angle also cannot be accurately measured, since the basion

is not available, but it is certain that it lay somewhere between 90° and 100°,
probably between 92° and 96° (the average of Australians, measured by DuckwortH,
is 92°, European 75°), The most certain method applicable here -is the one
suggested by Knaanson, following Frareont, namely, by measuring the distance
from the glabella on the prolongation of the glabella-lambda line of the foot-point of
a perpendicular drawn from the prosthion. The distance in this skull is 22 mm., the
range in Australians being from 5 to 25. From these facts, the conclusions may be
drawn that the prognathism of the Talgai face is of a very marked but not extra-
ordinary degree.

The forehead, sloping in character, with poor supra-orbital development, pe no
significant increase in the size of the lateral angular processes of the frontal, has been
already described. In the facial aspect, these characters are combined with a
depressed nasion and wide inter-orbital distance, which are very materially responsible
for the characteristic “ facies” of the skull. i

The orbit is large, but is exceeded in size in both diameters by many modern
Australian examples. A horizontal line through the nasion cuts the orbital cavity so
that more than one-third of its area lies above this line, which is, as Kiaatscu has
