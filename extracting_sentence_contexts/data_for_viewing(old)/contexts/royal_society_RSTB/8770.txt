do suggest that the Arctic climate system is also driving syn-
chronous changes in the biology on a hemispheric scale.
From an oceanographic perspective, it has been shown that
changes in the Arctic climate system are affecting atmos-
pheric and oceanic circulation in both the Atlantic and the
Pacific Oceans, which in turn determine the thermal regime
of an oceanic region. In addition, it has been reported that
the Arctic circulation and pressure system affects ecosystems
in the North Atlantic and Pacific. Therefore, it is plausible
that these changes in Arctic climate play an important role
in driving the dynamic regime of NH marine ecosystems.

The fact that widely separated marine ecosystems respond
quasi-synchronously (at least in the late 1980s) to climatic
change indicates that there may be teleconnections between
them. We propose that the late 1980s shift could represent the
variably lagged biological response in each ecosystem to a
large-scale, NH change of the climatic system, involving
both an increase in NHT and a strongly positive phase of the
AO [91].

We believe that quasi-synchronicity in zooplankton/fish
shifts observed in many oceanic basins can have major scienti-
fic implications. First, identifying biological teleconnections
could certainly shed light on the extent of climate impacts on
