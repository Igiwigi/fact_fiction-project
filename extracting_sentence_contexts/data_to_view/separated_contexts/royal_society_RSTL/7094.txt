BRODIE ON THE CALCULUS OF CHEMICAL OPERATIONS.

the exclusion of other forms. The conclusions thus arrived at must obviously have very
different values, and while some are in the highest degree probable, others can only be
regarded as tentative and conjectural. But, nevertheless, uncertain. as such- results may
often appear, a profound distinction. is to be drawn between this order of hypothesis and
those molecular speculations which can neither be confirmed nor disproved by facts. Tn the former case experiment is constantly controlling our conclusions, and we have
the most positive evidence that the methods pursued by the chemist are in the main
correct; since. in numerous cases he has been able to anticipate the results of direct
observation, and in others even to correct by theory the erroneous regults which obser-
vation apparently afforded. It is essential to have clear ideas upon this point, that we may not over-estimate the
value of our results, since any uncertainty attached to the data must undoubtedly attend
the conclusions which are derived from them ; but nevertheless the question does not
fall within the scope of a deductive and symbolic method, the province of which com-
mences only where the task of experiment terminates; and in the consideration of
chemical equations I haye not, in uncertain cases, attempted any full discussion of the
evidence on which they rest, but have limited myself to arguments, in regard to which
the application, of symbolic reasoning afforded some peculiarity or advantage.
