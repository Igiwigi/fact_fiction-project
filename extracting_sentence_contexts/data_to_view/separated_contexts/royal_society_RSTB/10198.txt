tm-pte.org Intracellular Ca”* signalling plays central role in the regulation of the secretory

processes of the exocrine pancreas. It is a well-known fact that in the exocrine pan-
creas acinar cells secrete digestive enzymes and pancreatic ductal epithelial cells
secrete HCO; rich alkaline fluid that washes the digestive enzymes out from the
pancreas. The prompt coordination of the secretory events of the two cell types
is essential and Ca** has a central role in both pancreatic physiology and patho-
physiology. Recent studies suggest that these two cell types cannot be handled
separately since they are more likely integrated into a functional unit [1].
