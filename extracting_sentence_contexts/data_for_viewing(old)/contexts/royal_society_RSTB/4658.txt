appearance of the nucleus holds only for the usual cases in which delay has occurred
between the second and third discharges, and in which the stages of the latter
discharge are actually completed. At the completion of the second discharge, how-
ever, the prosorus is extremely sensitive to variation in external conditions, and its
behaviour varies widely according to the regularity of the water supply in particular.
Under the abnormal temperature of the greenhouse, when there is a constant supply
of water, there may be no delay between the discharges, the stages of the third may
be quickly passed over, and the prosorus may migrate before this discharge is actually
completed. In this case, the outer envelope of the organism will be comparatively thin
and still pale in colour when migration takes place. The nucleus of a prosorus which
has undergone this rapid development is shown in fig. 25. The absence of delay
between the discharges and rapidity in the carrying out of the third may be deduced
from the fact that the linin formed in the earlier discharge has not yet completely
changed from the interwoven to the reticulate condition, much less has it acquired
the final uniform appearance found in prosori developed at a lower temperature.
Moreover, the later stages of the third discharge will not be finished either slowly or
completely before the nucleus begins to move, for the cytoplasm of the organism is
already commencing to migrate (not shown in the figure). This, however, is a case
of exceptionally rapid development. As a rule, a distinct pause occurs between the
two discharges, and the envelope of the organism at the same time becomes thick and
deep yellow in colour. Then, once the third discharge has begun, the prosorus
migrates, either early or late according to the water supply, and â€˜the appearance of
the nucleus at the time of migration thus depends upon the same regulatory factor.
