First, and perhaps most important, the ionospheric simulation is for 20 April 2016
during solar minimum, in accordance with the Keck Hy observations, whereas the Galileo radio
occultation was obtained on 8 December 1995, nearly 21 years prior, also during solar minimum. It would be far more surprising if Jupiter’s ionosphere had not changed in those intervening
years than if it had, especially given the variability present in ionospheric radio occultations at
giant planets [53,73]. Therefore, the fact that the model agreement is good in both figures 7 and 8
is most likely a coincidence rather than an indication of atmospheric stability, though the fact that
the approximately 21 year separation between the two datasets is nearly 2 full solar cycles allows
some minimum of hope for a happy coincidence to be maintained. Second, the Galileo radio
occultation was at 68° W (System III) longitude, whereas the Keck observations were centred at
308° W longitude, a slightly different magnetic environment. The majority of the modelled Ht
layer is still in photochemical equilibrium, meaning that this variation should have minimal effect,
at least if solar photons are the main ionospheric driver as assumed here, though high altitude
ion drifts would be altered.
