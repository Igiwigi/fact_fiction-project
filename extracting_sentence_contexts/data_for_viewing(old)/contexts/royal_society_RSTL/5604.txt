occasionally differently-tinted papers were employed with this tube as sources of different
coloured lights.

The very oblique angle at which reflected light comes to the eye from the diffused
particles, is well seen when the lens cone, or a direct ray of the sun, is passed into the
fluid and observed from different positions ; it is only when the eye is behind and nearly
in the line of the ray, that the unmixed transmitted ray is observed. In the dark tube I
think that no reflected light arrives at the eye: for if half an inch in depth of water be
introduced, white light passes ; if a drop of the washed depoxit, to be hereafter described,
be introduced, the light transmitted is either blue or ruby, or of other intermediate tint,
according to the character of the deposit ; but if water be then added until the column
is 8ix inches or more in length, the quantity of light transmitted does not sensibly alter,
nor its tint ; a fact which I think excludes the idea of any light being reflected from par-
ticle to particle, and finally to the eye.

If a given ruby-tinted fluid, containing no gold in solution, be allowed to stand for a
few days, a deposit will fall from which the fluid may be removed by a sphon ; being
now allowed to stand for a week, a second deposit will be produced ; if the fluid be again
removed and allowed to stand for some months, another deposit will be obtained, and
the fluid will probably be of a bright ruby ; if it be now allowed to stand for several
months, it will still yield a deposit, looking however more like a ruby fluid than a collec-
tion of fine particles at the bottom of the fluid, whilst traces of yet finer particles of gold
in suspension may be obtained by the lens. All these deposits may be washed with
water and will settle again; the coarser are not much affected, but the finer are, and
tend to aggregate; neyertheless specimens often occur, especially after boiling, which tend
