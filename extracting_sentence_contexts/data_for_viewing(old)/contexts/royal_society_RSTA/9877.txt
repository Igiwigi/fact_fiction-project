where E, F, G, F, are given by equation (39) in terms of y, »’, D,, (the coefficient of
diffusion), and a constant k which depends on the particular law of action between
the molecules ; / is unknown, but may be expected to lie near or between the values
already found for it in special cases (0°60 for elastic spheres, 0°771 for Maxwellian
molecules). :

Of the above formule, that by Punvus is the only one which is perfectly explicit.
THIESEN’S expression is completely empirical, and is useful only as an interpolation
formula. Putus’s relation shares the virtues and defects of the theory on which it is
founded, and therefore prescribes a law of variation with temperature inconsistent
with the facts for most gases, THrEsEN’s law, on the other hand, does not give any

information concerning variation with temperature, and the constants A and B must
be empirically determined for each case.

The formula (34) or (53), as we shall see later, completely expresses the relation
between 4, and the temperature, but, being quite general, it specifies a different law for
each molecular hypothesis ; and while, conversely, the determination of / and the law
of temperature variation from experimental data may lead to further knowledge as to
the best molecular hypothesis, this very generality gives the formula a semi-empirical
character.

On theoretical grounds it is desirable that the success of equation (34) as an
