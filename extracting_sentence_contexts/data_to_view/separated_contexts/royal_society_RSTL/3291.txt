It will be found
that an unprepared plate requires as long again to become properly coated with iodine
as does a prepared one; and a pure plate, though carefully prepared, a third longer
time than a compound one. It is necessary, to produce iodidation readily, and to ensure the best effect from
radiation, that a semi-oxidized surface be presented to the iodine. This fact will
render obvious the superiority of the two metals; common observation will show,
that plated goods lose their lustre much sooner than silyer articles, the process of
oxidation being much accelerated by the compound arrangement.

2. If an unprepared plate be iodidated and exposed to light, it darkens, and its
superficial coat may be easily rubbed off, leaving a surface of exquisite lustre, some-
what darker than that which results from the nitric acid process, and more susceptible
of iodidation. Whether a film of oxide or iodide of silver is here produced, I am
uncertain : I suspect the former*.
