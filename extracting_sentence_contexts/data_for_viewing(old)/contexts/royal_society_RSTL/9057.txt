and permitting the uncleansed air to enter the chamber. 'The contact of the floating
matter with the infusions was invariably followed by the deyelopment of life. Numerous
examples of these results were placed before the Fellows of the Royal Society at their
Meeting on the 13th of January, 1876.

Prior to the date here referred to, great public interest had been excited, and, T may
add, considerable scientific uncertainty had been produced in reference to this subject,
both in England and America, by the writings of Dr. BasTiaN. These writings consisted,
in part, of theoretic considerations and reflections, not new, but sometimes very ably
stated, based on the general doctrine of Eyolution, and, in part, of yery pungent criti-
cixgms of those who, though believers in Evolution, declined to accept the writer's
programme of its operations*. Passing over both theory and criticism, I thought it
wise to fix upon certain well-defined statements of fact which lay at the basis of the
weighty superstructure raised by their author, and to bring these statements to the test
of strict experiment.

'Thus it was affirmed * that boiled turnip- or hay-infusions exposed to ordinary air,
expoxed to filtered air, to calcined air, or shut off altogether from contact with air, are
more or less prone to swarm with Bacteria and Vibriones in the course of from two
to 8ix days”. I resorted accordingly to filtered air, calcined air, and to infusions with-
drawn from air, but failed to discover the alleged © proneness ” to run into living forms.
It had also been affirmed that infusions of muscle, kidney, or liver, placed *in a flask
whose neck is drawn out and narrowed in the blowpipe flame, boiled, sealed during
ebullition, and kept in a warm place, swarmed after a variable time with Bacteria
and allied organisms”. LI resorted to such flasks, employing infusions of fish, flesh,
