it is to inquire into the inner mechanism concerned in the production of the phenomena.
Fill discern in the yielding of a glacier a case of simulated fluidity hitherto unexplained.

- $ 4. On the Veined Structure of Glacier 1ce.

= This structure has been indifferently called the © veined structure,” the © banded
Sructure,” the © ribboned structure,” and the * laminar structure” of glacier ice. In a
gpmmunication to the Geological Society of France assembled at Porrentruy in September
F838, M. Guyor gave the following interesting description of the phenomenon :—* Since
Ho word layer has escaped me, I cannot help recording as a subject of investigation for
ture observers a fact, regarding which I dare not hazard an explanation ; especially as
-Þ have not encountered it more than once. It was at the summit of the Gries, at a
RSeight of about 7500 feet, a little below the line of the first or high nev6, where the
ED passes into a state of granular mow. . . . . In ascending to the origin of this latter
Fthe glacier of Bettelmatten), for the purpose of examining the formation and direction
ER the great transverse fissures, I 8aw under my feet the surface of the glacier entirely
Zovered with regular furrows, from 1 to 2 inches in width, hollowed in a half snowy
Mass, and separated by protruding plates of an ice more hard and transparent. It was
Svident that the mass of the glacier was here composed of two sorts of ice, one that of the
ows, till snowy and more easily melted, the other that of the plates, more perfect,
Erystalline, glassy and resistent; and that it was to the unequal resistance which they pre-
Fented to the action of the atmosphere that was due the hollowing of the furrows and the
protrusion of the harder plates. After having followed them for several hundred yards,
