may possibly be adduced as additional evidence in favour of the generally accepted
homology between the arteria stapedialis (arteria facialis) of the Reptilia and the
arteria stapedialis of the Mammalia.

The presence of an artery piercing the stapes in many Mammalian embryos was
demonstrated by SALEensKy (1880), and although the vessel usually atrophies in
Man, it persists in many other Mammals. Goopricu (1915) records the chondrification
of the developing stapes around the arteria stapedialis in an embryo Trichosurus.

All these facts appear sufticiently conclusive to justify the assumption that the
arteria facialis, or arteria stapedialis of Sphenodon is the homologue of
the Mammalian arteria stapedialis, and I suggest therefore that the latter
name for this artery is to be preferred.

In some adult Reptilia (e.g., Pachydactylus bibronit), a branch of the arteria carotis
imterna pierces the columella (VERSLUYs, 1898), and in an embryo, Platydactylus
mauretanica, the arteria stapedialis leaves the arteria carotis interna posteriorly to
the stapes, penetrates this cartilage nearly horizontally, and passes in an antero-dorsal
direction into the temporal region (Verstuys, 1903). In the different species of
Reptilia, in which the arteria stapedialis does not penetrate the stapes, its position
relative to the latter appears to be subject to some variation. In Sphenodon,
Chameleo and Uroplates, the course of the artery is ventral and anterior to the
