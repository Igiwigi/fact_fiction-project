of sea-water of pH values varying from 5-5 to 9-0. Hatching was found to be inhibited
below pH 6-8, and to occur in 95 per cent. at pH 7-2.

The inhibition below pH 6-8 is complete and has been demonstrated in addition for
Ascidiella aspersa, Ascidia mentula and Ciona intestinalis, but transference to water of
pH 8-0 allows hatching to proceed.

The enzyme mechanism as a whole, however, seems to be very sensitive, for while
in species such as Phallusia mammullata and Ascidiella aspersa very abnormal embryos
may hatch, in others, e.g., Styela partita, and to a less marked degree in Ciona intestinalis,
slight abnormality in development is to be correlated with the failure of the digestion
method of hatching. This does not preclude later hatching by means of rupture, and,
in fact, it may be stated generally that the more sensitive the enzyme process, the
more efficient is the later rupture method.

This method is typically associated with metamorphosis. Usually about the time
the tail is phagocytosed, the larval test begins to swell and a varying number of ecto-
dermal outgrowths appear. Rupture of the egg membrane may then be brought about
in two ways, by the swelling of the larval test alone, or by the pushing out of the test
locally by the ectodermal tubes or ampullee. In some species, hatching by digestion
is the only possible way, while in others hatching by rupture alone can occur, but
species exist among which one may find every degree of efficiency of the two methods
and the various types are summarised below.
