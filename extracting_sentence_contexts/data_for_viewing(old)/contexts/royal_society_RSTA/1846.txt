Figure 2. Mendeleev’s table after the discovery of the noble gases.

Once the noble gases were discovered they were assigned to a ninth group which Mendeleev
designated as group zero (figure 2) [4].

There are some distinct advantages to these short-form tables, most notably the fact that the
group number coincides with the highest oxidation number. As time progressed, the short-form
was gradually abandoned in favour of an 18-column representation [5]. The latter representation
is usually attributed to Deming although his original version (figure 3) [6] was rather different
from the one that is so commonplace today (figure 4).

Clearly there are advantages to separating the transition metals, in the modern sense of the
term, such as the sequence from scandium to zinc from the remaining elements in the fourth
period. For example, although carbon, silicon, titanium, germanium, zirconium, tin and lead in
