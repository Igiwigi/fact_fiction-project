Table XX VIII. shows that with iron as with nickel the increase of resistance can be
represented by the formula y=a.«+b.P,* and, here again therefore, it seems as if the
alteration of resistance would go on increasing as the magnetizing force increased even
when there would be no perceptible increase of induced magnetizm. The cages of iron
and nickel, however, differ considerably in one respect, namely, that whereas with the
latter meta] the magnetizing force played the more important part in altering the

* The discrepancies between the observed and calculated values of « for the first three magnetizing
forces is, I believe, almost if not entirely dne to the fact that, unfortunately, before any exact measurements
had been made with the lower values of a, the full magnetizing force had been employed. This would
not perhaps haye affected the result, as far as the agreement between observation and calculation is
concerned, had the induced magnetiszm been measnred at the same time as the alteration of resistance,
but this was not the case,

alteration is effected by the induced magnetism,
