on the following effect. If a circuit be made with the green nitrous acid, platinum
wires, and a galvanometer, in a few seconds all traces of a current due to first dis-
turbances will disappear ; but if one wire be raised into the air and instantly returned
tots first position, a current is formed, and that wire is negative, across the electrolyte,
to the other. If one wire be dipped only a small distance into the acid, as for instance
one fourth of an inch, then the raising that wire not more than one eighth of an
inch and instantly restoring it, will produce the same effect as before. The effect is
due to the evaporation of the nitrous acid from the exposed wire (1937.). I may
perhaps return to it hereafter, but wish at present only to give notice of the precau-
tion that is required in consequence, namely, to retain the immersed wires undisturbed
during the experiment.

1849. Proceeding on the facts made known by ScaaNBEIN respecting the relation
of iron and nitric acid, I used that acid as the fluid in a voltaic circuit formed with
iron and platinum. Pare nitric acid is s0 deficient in conducting power (1817.) that
it may be supposed capable of stopping any current due to the effect of contact be-
tween the platinum and iron ; and it is further objectionable in these experiments, be-
cause, acting feebly on the iron, it produces a chemically excited current, which may
be considered as mingling its effect with that of contact: whereas the object at pre-
sent is, by excluding such chemical action, to lay bare the influence of contact alone.
Still the results with it are consistent with the more perfect ones already described ;
forina circuit of iron, platinum, and nitric acid, the joint effects of the chemical action
on the iron and the contact of iron and platinum, being to produce a current of a cer-
tain constant force indicated by the galvanometer, a little chemical action, brought
into play where the iron and platinum were in contact as before (1831.), produced a
