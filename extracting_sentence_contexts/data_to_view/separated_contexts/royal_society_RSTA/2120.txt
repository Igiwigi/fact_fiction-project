in excess of the amount given by the approximate
8 formula (4). Slowness of Air Stream and Turbulent Motion.—There seems to be no means of
subjecting these two factors to mathematical analysis; but in both cases we may
safely assume that any effect there may be will be enhanced when we increase the
rate at which water vapour is taken from the system. Experiments, the details of
which need not be given, were made in this direction, but without any variation in
the result; also a further safeguard is provided by the fact that in experiments
where there were two or more vessels (containing the solution) in series, the last
vessel scarcely changes in weight. It is as well however to point out that owing
to the irregular contours of the air passages some turbulent motion must set up,

* This is for Apparatus A ; for Apparatus D the fall of pressure is about 0°00] mm.
