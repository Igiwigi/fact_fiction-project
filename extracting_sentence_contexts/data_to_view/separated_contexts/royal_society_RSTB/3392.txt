As a result
of these cell divisions, the lower part of the sac enlarges, passing through the stages
outlined in figs. 89, F-H. This primary growth, which occurs before fertilisation,
ceases at about the stage of 89H. A more considerable secondary growth commences
after fertilisation. The endosperm-tissue, both primary and secondary, is characterised
by a marked irregularity in the size of its cells. This seems to be due to the fact
that when division occurs the daughter-cells are smaller than those from which they
originated, and with successive divisions the difference becomes more marked. Consequently throughout its life the endosperm consists of cells, large and small and
of intermediate sizes, irregularly intermingled (fig. 88).||
