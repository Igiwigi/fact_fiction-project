well to all the years since 1774.

Having ascertained this fact, I felt I had the means, to a certain extent, of deter-
mining the quality of the instruments which have been used, as, for the most part,
different instruments were used in the morning and in the afternoon observations,
and also the correctness of the observations generally ; and thus the means of ascer-
taining the value of the results which could be deduced from them.

I need not mention all the tests to which I have subjected the observations, but
briefly state that the results were, a conviction on my mind that the instruments had
been uniformly good, that the observations had been faithfully recorded as read from
the instruments, and that very great care had been taken in reading at the times
stated ; the latter circumstance was most satisfactorily proved from the fact of the
results being the Â«ame when the times of observation have been such that the changes
were rapid, and consequently a small error in the time of reading would have entailed
a considerable error in the results, :

I found however that during the time the maximum and minimum thermometers
were in use, their readings were frequently in defect or excess respectively as com-
pared with those of the other thermometers made during the day, and this was found
to be more frequently the case in the later than in the earlier observations. On ex-
amining farther and bearing in mind that a self-registering thermometer, whose read-
ing is taken once a day only, merely registers the extreme reading which has taken
place in the preceding twenty-four hours, many of the apparent discrepancies vanished,
yet still s0me remain for which I cannot account. I know it has been said that at
