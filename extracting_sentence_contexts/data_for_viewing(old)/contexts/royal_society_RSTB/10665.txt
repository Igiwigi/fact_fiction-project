in layer 2/3 ending around P50 in the mouse [46] and the ani-
mals described in this study were deprived of whiskers and
underwent depression of whisker responses within this
period. In the visual cortex, LTD shows developmental down-
regulation [47] and heightened sensitivity during the critical
period for ocular dominance plasticity, which is thought to
be owing to a peak in mGluR5 expression, as this receptor
mechanism potentiates NMDA-dependent LTD [48].

Evidence that EDD in the barrel cortex is mechanistically
similar to LTD comes from studies showing that both depend
on the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor in the somato-
sensory cortex [30] and the fact that LTD can be occluded
by whisker deprivation patterns that cause EDD [5,6]. Cru-
cially, EDD requires cortical activity [49], consistent with an
anti-correlation mechanism of depression in barrel cortex
[50]. Evidence that an LTD-like process operates during
visual cortical depression of the closed eye response comes
