c—Absorption in the Far Infra-Red—We shall confine ourselves mainly to the question
of the difference tones. As outlined above, it seems that as long as the frequency
branches are separate, we have a lower limit to the difference vibrations and hence
after a certain point the absorption should go to zero. Of course, the terms of higher
order will again modify this conclusion, as will the fact that combination between
similar branches is allowed ; but it seems justifiable to expect an appreciable drop
