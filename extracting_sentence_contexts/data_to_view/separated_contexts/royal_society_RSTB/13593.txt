According to him, based on the capacity of music to promote
social cohesion, and because music is overwhelmingly a
social phenomenon, the survival value of music is not
apparent at an individual, but only a group, level. A somewhat similar hypothesis is that language evolved
as a form of ‘vocal grooming’, to maintain social bonds in
increasingly large groups [137-139]. In fact, when phylogen-
etically controlled, vocal repertoire size strongly predicts
group size as well as grooming time in non-human primates
[140]. Social bonding is maintained primarily via grooming in
primates, but in increasingly large groups this behaviour,
which tends to be a one-to-one activity, is less effective. While this theory is presented in relation to the origins of
language, it suggests a stage of communal chorusing, lacking
propositional meaning, which replaced grooming.
