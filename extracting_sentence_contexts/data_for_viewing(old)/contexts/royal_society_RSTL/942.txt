nor in any way forming regular cavities, but having irre-
gular interstices: they vary in‚Äù size considerably in dif-
ferent parts of the same body. It is into these interstices
that the blood is occasionally received from the termination
of the small arteries which are every where branching upon,

_and supported by, the elastic plates of which the trellis work

is composed ; as in Pl. XVIII, Fig. 1, PI. XIX, Fig. 1.
Pl. XX, Fig. 1.

The circulation of the blood in these parts being different at
different times, is a most beautiful illustration of the fact, which
upon a former occasion I communicated to the Society; namely,
the great influence the nerves have upon the action of the
smaller arteries, as well as on their larger trunks. When the
nerves that supply the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongio-
sum, (and they are very numerous,) are not affected by the
$state of mind of the individual, the blood is not carried into this
trellis work, but returns by the veins, as in other parts of the
body ; but when the mind receives such impressions as excite
these nerves, the smaller arteries have their action s0 much
