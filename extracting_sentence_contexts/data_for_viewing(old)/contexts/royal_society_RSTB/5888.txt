That an extension of function involves a breaking up of a fissural pattern originally
simple, is best demonstrated by the cerebellum itself, in which the parallel position of
sulci, originally so regular, is changed to a very irregular cauliflower-like arrangement in
those animals where the cerebellar mechanism is more complicated, as, e.g., appears from
a comparison of the ansate lobe of the cerebellum in the whale and the elephant.

This much is sure that the distinction of the present human brain not only consists
in a more marked development of the inferior frontal region (the speech centres) but also
of the midfrontal region of which the strong development may also find an expression in
the fact stated by QUANJER (1912) that the midfrontal convolution is never opercularised
by the inferior frontal convolution, while the opposite occasionally occurs.

The fact that both the inferior as well as the midfrontal convolutions increase in man
compared to monkeys and apes explains another feature of the human midfrontal, viz.,
its more dorsal location* that causes, more frequently than in anthropoids, parts of it
to be taken for, or even be superposed upon, the superior frontal (¢f. also SeRai’s
excellent work on this subject : 1913, 1926).

It is clear that the tendency of the short but usually quite regular inferior
temporal sulcus of anthropoids to break up in man in various pieces (either transverse
or longitudinal fissurets) must also be explained along the same lines. Woo.Larp (loc.
cit. IL) showed that the acoustic cortex, especially the relation between the depth of the
supra- and infra-granular layers is less developed in the Australian aboriginal brain, a fact
that fits in very well with the findings of van Noort (1917) in the Madurese and with the
fact that this cytotectonic field is late in phylogeny to acquire its typical characteristics
