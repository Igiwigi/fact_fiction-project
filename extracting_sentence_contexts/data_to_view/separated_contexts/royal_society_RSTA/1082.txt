The co-ordinate surfaces U(y;,r)=const. and y; =const.
are such that VU.Vy; =0 at any fixed radial location r. Since the gradient operator shows
that e} = Vy; and VU=e,dU/dy + e,dU/dr, the choice of independent variables implies that
VU.Vy; = dU/dy; =0 in the transformed co-ordinate system. Using the fact that G(y1,1,6|x;)
in (2.7a) is implicitly related to Gi= Gin, U, ¢|x;@) via Gilly, U1, 1), 61x; w) = Gi(y1,1, |x; @),
the orthogonality condition and the chain rule in (y;, U) co-ordinates show that the mean flow
advection vector Xj; = (X1,X,) [in (2.7a)-(2.7c)] takes a more general form than that given by
Eq. (5.15) in GSA. Moreover, operator Do acting on G(y1,1,¢|x;@) in equation (2.72) may be
transformed to

. a a ~ ~ d\=x
DoGiys,7) (io Ue +y, *) Gi= (by i a) Gin, W, (11)

where we have suppressed the remaining arguments in G;, Dp =iw + Ud/dy; (here, 3/dy1 =
(8/dy1)|u) and X is given by (2.8). Since dU/dr =(8r/dU)-! and the chain rule shows that
a/0U = (dr/dU)d/dr, the i=r component of (2.7a) is transformed to the following result

Gry, = 22 4! + 26s + S,(y1, U), (2.12)
that generalizes (5.23) of GSA to jets for which ¢ = O(1).
