F(=), that when z = in we shall have f(#) = o, when
I=in-+1,f(r) =1, when z = in + 2, f(z) = 2, and 80

is such a function. I thought it right to mention this, because
the observation of this fact (s0 deduced) was among the first
things which led me to the general consideration of circula-
ting equations in the form I have here presented it.

(11). The next case I propose to consider is that of cir-
culating equations, in which the period of circulation is not
the same in all the coefficients. This, however, will not
detain us long. Suppose
