Furthermore, they agree well with values calculated for this family from the data
given by Batey (1920). Unfortunately very little appears to be known about the causes of fibre extension,
and consequently it is impossible to offer any explanation of the above phenomenon. But it is interesting to notice that in a recent discussion on libriform fibres and fibre
tracheids (BAILEY 1936; REINDERS 1935), BAILEY comments on the fact that tracheids
elongate less during differentiation than either fibre tracheids or libriform fibres. Many of the lowest values for elongation given by the present author (CHaTrAwAy
1936) occur in woods with fibre tracheids, while high values predominate in families
such as this, in which the fibres are libriform. This confirms the idea that there may be
some phylogenetic significance to be attached to the type of pitting of the fibre walls,
in spite of the overlapping of types that occurs in many families.
