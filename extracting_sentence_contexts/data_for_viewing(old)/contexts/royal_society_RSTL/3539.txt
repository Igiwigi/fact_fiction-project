blood. Those facts were of a character which led me to expect that the farther
prosecution of the subject might be rewarded by the discovery of others; although,
in a field of physiological research s0 often traversed from the days of Mayericnr and

origin, and certain changes which they undergo.

It will be remarkable if the mammiferonus ovum, which, because of its minuteness
