This pigment yielded a haemochromogen and a haematoporphyrin
indistinguishable from those of haemoglobin. Because of this, and because of the
capacity of one of the decomposition products of actiniohaematin to undergo reversible
oxidation and reduction, MacMunn concluded that the new pigment possessed a
respiratory function. Roche (1932, 1936) brings strong evidence that actiniohaematin is not in fact a
pure substance, but a mixture derived from the intracellular respiratory enzyme
systems such as occur in all animals. He relates it to the cytochromes and to Keilin’s
“free intracellular haematins’. He shows that the spectrum corresponds to a mixture
mainly of cytochrome (4) and of parahaematin similar to Keilin’s protohaematin.
