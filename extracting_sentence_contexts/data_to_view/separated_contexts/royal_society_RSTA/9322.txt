In the latter case the heat of dilution changes sign
when the solution is very dilute. The varying thermal changes observed at higher
dilutions for several substances, suggests that these solutions are more complex than
the stronger ones. :

Moreover experimental difficulties prevent the measurement of these quantities
with sufficient accuracy to warrant their use for deriving a general equation to
represent the thermal changes for all concentrations. i

An attempt is therefore made to analyse the results for stronger solutions only, and
it will be found that the relation Q=a@ log, N+bN-+e holds well under these
conditions.

(1) Sulphuric Acid. From Tuomsen’s values of Q for N = I,N = 2 and N = 5 respectively, the equation
is

Q = 4666 log, N—196 N+6595,

The accuracy with which this can be applied is comparable with that of THomsen’s
formula—in fact the accuracy is greater if the most dilute solution is ignored. Concentration } By calculation.

Plotting dQ/dN and 1/N thus gives a straight line which cuts the axis at N = 23'8,
which is nearly H,SO,.24H,O. (Diagram II.) The suggestion might be made, there-
fore, that accepting the linear relation between Q and 1/N, the heats generated were
such as if the true solvent were H,SO,.24H,O instead of pure water.
