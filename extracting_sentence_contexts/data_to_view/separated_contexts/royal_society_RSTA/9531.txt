In Tables XI. to XVIII, pp. 161 to 169, we give the value of y (calculated) for
each group in Column VII.; the error per cent. (Column VIII.) being the coefficient
of variation obtained as above. Fig. 7, p. 150, represents the above group of experiments; the most probable point
of intersection obtained by calculation is shown by a large cross. Attention may be drawn to the fact that no “ smoothed curves” have been used in
the above reduction. CAPACITY FOR HEAT OF METALS AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES. 159

M = mass copper block +case = 3392°37 grms.,
ms = thermal capacity of oil, quartz, glass and solder = 4°898,
R = resistance of coil = 20°599,

E = E.M.F. standard cell at 15° C. = 1°01848,

f = d(0)/d (Pt) at 0° C. = 0°98480. Hence
S = 0:09094.
