the third and fourth values* of 2, which may perhaps be assumed to represent approxi-

mately the average alteration of resistance for a given moderate magnetizing force, we
find that with this wire the increase per unit of resistance produced by an absolute
electromagnetic unit of magnetizing force would be 2335 X 10-5,

It is desirable to draw attention also to the fact that with both iron and vickel there
is no change of resistance of the nature of a decrease produced by magnetization, but
that starting with a current from one Guove's cell through a total external resistance
of about 15 ohms? and with a magnetizing force nob greater than 26 times the earth's
horizontal magnetic force at the place, we find a continuous increase of reistance as
the magnetizing force is increased. Tar EFFECT OF ALTERING THE STRENGTH OF THE B.C. ON THE CHANGE OF
