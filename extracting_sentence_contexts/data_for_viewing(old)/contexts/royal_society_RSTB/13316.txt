‘Viruses are a notable exception for this claim about ‘fixed’ modes of
biological inheritance. As Isabella Sarto-Jackson (2017, personal com-
munication) remarked, with reference to Pellett et al. [34]: sometimes
genetic factors can indeed be regarded as switching modes of inheri-
tance. For instance, herpes viruses can be transmitted vertically (by
biological reproduction, from a parent to descendants) as well as
horizontally to another adult, and even at the same time. But note
that in order to really be analogous to the cultural case, the switch
needs to happen in response to new evolutionary affordances, and it
needs to be reversible to count as equally content-dependent. It
goes beyond the scope of this paper to determine whether that
applies to the case. An anonymous referee has pointed to the fact
that for viruses it can indeed happen in a responsive and reversible
manner, giving further credence to a by-now standard comparison
of ideas and viruses.

The figure has one glitch: it classifies parental effects as cases of
inheritance. Although parental effects influence gene expression
and although they can be inherited, they are not qua being parental
a case of inheritance, as Merlin [36] argues. What parental effects
qua parental effects are doing is introducing novelty into the next gen-
eration’s somatic line. This novelty can be adaptive but it does
not have to be, and it can be epigenetically inherited to the still
next generation but it does not have to.
