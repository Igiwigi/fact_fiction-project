But the metallic
and other striking colours are deposited over the outer and visible layers. Whether
these brilliant and beautiful colours are there for the purpose of attracting the opposite
sex, as is certainly the case in many species of Birds, is an open question; but, as we
can assign no other reason at present, we are justified, I think, in provisionally
assuming this to be the cause. In the case of Fishes the problem becomes still more
complicated, for, as Huss has repeatedly pointed out, fish appear to be colour-blind,*

notwithstanding the fact that all fly-fishermen stoutly maintain the contrary. (See
Section 8 on this point.)

It has been suggested that the pigmentary colours of the iris might form a selection
filter to the various colours of light. I therefore made some tentative experiments

fluorescent.
