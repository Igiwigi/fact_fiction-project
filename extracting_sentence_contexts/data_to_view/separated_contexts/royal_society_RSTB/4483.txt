He thus founded two great groups of Conifers, the Diplosporophyllous and the Aplo-
sporophyllous forms. This step has appropriately been criticised by Eames (1913, p. 33). More recently, Miss AASE (1915) has published facts which are of value in this
connection, showing that the classification proposed by THomson is not tenable. A
glance at her fig. 1, p. 283, will show that, according to THomsonâ€™s classification, the
scales in the proximal region of the cone are aplosporophyllous, while those higher up
in the same cone are diplosporophyllous.
