The product mn can be measured, but the determination of v
presents some difficulty. Assuming that in the are the carbon is at its boiling-point,
and that the carbon atoms are in thermal equilibrium with the air into which they
are escaping, #.e. ,!the carbon atom possesses the same kinetic energy as is possessed by
an oxygen or nitrogen atom at the temperature at which boiling occurs, we have for
the velocity of the carbon atom at 0° C., using the fact that the velocity of H, at
0° C. = 18°39 x 10‘ cm. per second,

v = 18°89 x 10*x /f = 7°5 x 10* em. per second.
