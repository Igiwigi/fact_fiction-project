presented by the Admiralty to the Britich Museum, having

which, (though fully aware of the weight of those arguments
you lately urged in conversation, as unfavourable to the pro-
bability of their high antiquity) I am still led to consider as
not altogether uninteresting to the geologist. The neglect of
the more recent formations of rocks was one principal cause
that the nature and origin of the older had been 80 strangely
misunderstood : it is to the more attentive observation that
has of late years been paid to the phenomena which they pre-
sent, that we are indebted for the knowledge of the important
fact, that secondary fossils are the productions and depositions
of various periods; by which happy discovery the study of
these remains, formerly a puerile and frivolous pursuit, has
become a most important branch of natural science, The
osseous relics of a later period are more particularly calculated
to furnish data for the future construction of a philosophical

Speculative geologist.
