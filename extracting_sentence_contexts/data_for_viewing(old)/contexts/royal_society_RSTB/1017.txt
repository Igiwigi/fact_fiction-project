ditions as the veins. Though, therefore, the pressure in the lymphatics was
ied, as it was in the case of the veins, there can be no doubt that there was
gon to the lymph-flow. Indeed, in several instances this was seen by the
ge to be the case, as, on dissection, they were found to be dilated, sometimes
® the size of a crow-quill. The results given in Section IV. are consequently
nerease of “lymphatic” pressure be substituted for increase of “ venous”

fore conclude that increase of lymphatic pressure in a limb for one hour is
panied by any alteration in the specific gravity of the blood or blood-plasma,
ind venous, of muscle or of skin, and also that it does not lead to any alteration
cumference of the limb or any of the ordinary appearances of edema,

ry again to draw attention to the fact that the conclusions stated are true only for the
which the increase in venous pressure lasted, viz., one hour. Such an increase in venous

as experimentally produced could obviously not exist for an indefinite period without
¢ modification other than yenous obstruction.
