The granules are variable in size and
frequently clump together as they leave the cell. The basal epithelial cells do not
possess these granules during shell secretion. In fact, the epithelium as a whole
consists of ciliated cells with an apical nucleus, about which deeply staining granules
are grouped, alternating with basal cells, which appear to be in a state of rest. An interesting example of excessive secretory activity in the apical cells is illustrated
in fig. 34, Plate 21. The darkly staining nuclei serve to mark out an area, ep, as a
distinct patch amongst the more normal epithelial cells.

(ii) Vacuole formation in the basal cellsâ€”After completion of the calcification of the
egg shell and the disappearance of secretory phenomena in the apical cells, the
basal cells undergo characteristic changes.
