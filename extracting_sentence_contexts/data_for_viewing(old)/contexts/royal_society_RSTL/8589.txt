it almost wholly off.

But though oiled silk, foreign post, and even goldbeater's skin can stop the sound,
when the film becomes sufficiently thin to yield freely to the atrial pulses the sound
is transmitted through the film. A thick s0ap-film produces a sensible effect upon the
flame, a very thin one does not. The augmentation of the transmitted sound may be
observed simultaneously with the generation and brightening of the colours of the film.
A thin collodion-film acts in the same way.


AS A VEHICLE OF SOUND. 209

Acquainted with the foregoing facts regarding the passage of sound through cambric,
flannel, baize, and felt, the reader will be prepared for the statement that the, sound-
waves pass without sensible impediments through heayy artificial showers of rain, hail,
and now.

Q$ 12. Action of Fog. Observations in London.

But the mariner's greatest enemy, fog, is still to be dealt with ; and here for a long
time the proper conditions of experiment were absent. Up to the end of November
we had had frequent days of haze, sufficiently thick to obscure the white cliffs of the
Foreland, but no real fog. Still those days furnished demonstrative evidence that the
notions entertained regarding the reflection of sound by suspended particles were wrong.
On many days of the thickest haze the sound had twice the range that it attained in
