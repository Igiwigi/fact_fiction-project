Relative frequency on the two leaf surfaces. In those leaves in which stomata are present on both surfaces, the question naturally
arises as to whether the stomatal frequency varies independently on the two surfaces
or whether there is a negative or positive correlation. The facts that plants of moist habitats tend to have stomata in the upper epidermis
more frequently than those of dry situations, that stomata in the upper epidermis are
