2 by his yaried rescarches, his large and yaluable collections, and by an indefatigable zeal
= and perseverance, discovered *, in some sand with mammalian remains from the village of
S Menchecourt, near Abbeville (Plan A, Plate X.), a flint rudely fashioned into a cutting
2 instrument, somewhat resembling the old flint weapons known by the name of celts,
2 yet having a pecuhar type of its own ; shortly afterwards two other specimens (each
=} above 8 inches long) were brought to him, and subsequently a considerable number have
Z been, from time to time, obtained from the same locality. In 1844 some excavations
2 near the hospital of Abbeville exposed a fresh section of the drift. Following up the
Zwork, M. vs Perrns discovered, at various depths of from 9 to 16 feet, in a bed of sand
3 and gravel, from which he obtained specimens of the teeth of the Flephas primigenius,
= several flints more or less worked; and on the 7th of August the workmen found at a
& depth of 14 feet 4 inches a still more perfect specimen, 64 inches long by 24 broad, —
X a fact he had certified by an official © procds-verbal” (p. 263). At the end of 1844
| similar discoverics were made at Moulin Quignon ; and at a later period M. ps PERTHES
g obtained specimens of the same character from Mautort, Marenil, Drucat, and St. Riquier,
& in the neighbourhood of Abbeville; while at Abbeville itself some excavations at the

65 Champ de Mars furnished a much larger number of specimens. An account of these
$ discoverics and of his general investigations was published by M. BoucueR De PERTHES

S in 1847, in a work entitled © Antiquit6s Celtiques et Ant6diluviennes+,” in which he
A announced his belief that the flint-implements occurred in beds of undisturbed sand and
gravel in true association with the bones of extinct animals. This work abounds in
illustrations; and sections of the beds, drawn by Dr. Ravis, a most competent geologist,
are given to show the position in which the flint-implements were found ; while the
