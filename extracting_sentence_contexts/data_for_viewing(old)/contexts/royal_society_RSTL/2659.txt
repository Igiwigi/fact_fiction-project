pears to respire much more in a given time than the perfect insect. But this is not
really the case. The observation is illusive, and arises, first, from the larva being al-
most always in a state of activity, and consequently having a more rapid consumption
of oxygen, and next because it is frequently at least two thirds larger than the perfect
insect. Thus the full-grown larva of Odonestis potatoria, STEPH., is about *26 of a
cubic inch in bulk, while the perfect insect is not more than 10. When the larva
and perfect insect of this species were confined separately in glass stoppered phials of
the same dimensions, 1:14, at the same temperature, 66* Fax., the larva became
asphyxiated in nine hours, while the perfect female was still living and vigorous at
the expiration of twenty-four hours. In this case the larya was almost constantly in
motion, while the perfect insect was quiet and resting. On a primd facie view of this
observation it would appear that the larva respires a greater quantity of air, compared
with its bulk, in a given time, than the perfect insect. It is a well established fact,
that among the higher animals respiration is at its minimum during sleep. It is
neither 80 frequent nor $0 voluminous, and consequently there is less oxygen con-
sumed. This has been long known with regard to the human species ; but, as shown
