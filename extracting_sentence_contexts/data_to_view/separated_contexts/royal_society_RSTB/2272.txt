OLTMANNS seems
to have solved the difficulty in the case of the—apparent—double process in
Floridew, by showing that while nuclear fusion occurs in the union between
spermatium and oosphere, it is absent from the subsequent unions between the
ooblastemata and auxiliary cells. But the difficulty again crops up in phanerogams,
in which observers already speak of “ double fertilisation ”—one between the oosphere
and the sperm-nucleus, and another between the definitive nucleus and the second
sperm-nucleus ; meanwhile there is yet to be explained the fusion of the two embryo-
sac nuclei to form the definitive nucleus. Do all these phenomena point to the fact that wherever nuclear substance can gain
energy by fusion with nuclear substance of slight difference of potential, this is
effected ; and are we justified in concluding that whenever such a union results in the
formation and setting aside of a definite reproductive cell—sexual spore, zygote,
fertilised egg-cell—that particular union may be termed sexual ? It would seem very probable that such is the case, and that sexual unions are only
a particular case of fusions which are always apt to occur if nuclear substance comes
near other nuclear substance within the sphere in which mutual attraction can make
itself potent. Be this as it may, it seems difficult on any grounds to reject the conclusion that
we have in this cise of a conjugating yeast, an unexpected example of a sexual
process of the simplest kind.
