(2.) The points A, B, D, and the centre of the group C, lie nearly on a straight
line. If, therefore, we waive the objection above pointed out with regard to
D, and note the fact that the group W certainly does not lie on this line,
the facts are consistent with the theory that the film consists of an interior

of different conductivity from the liquid in mass, bounded by pellicles of
different conductivity from itself, and that when it becomes thin (about
300 y.p.), new forces (presumably surface forces) modify the conductivity in
a way which can be approximately represented by supposing that the con-
duetivity of the interior alone alters. We do not, however, at present wish to draw from these observations any but two
sonclusions â€”
