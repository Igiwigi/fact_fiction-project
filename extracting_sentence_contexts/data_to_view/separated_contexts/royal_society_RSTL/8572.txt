fact already commenced *,

The development of poison-fangs in two parallel series, the teeth being arranged in
pairs of almost equal ages, would suggest that the snccession is very rapid and quite
regular; were it not 80, one would expect to find that the teeth of one series would be
very markedly in advance of their fellows in the parallel series, which is not the case. Moreover the large number of successional teeth (ten) is unusual. I know of but one
other place where more than three teeth can be found in preparation to sncceed a single
tooth, and that place is in the jaws of Ophidia, where six or seven of the ordinary serial
teeth, in different stages, may sometimes be seen.
