With an average nearest-neighbour distance, x, in three dimen-
(2.33) sions, the density is 0.7/x° [22]. For a target animal that moves


perpendicular to the line of sight of the observer, we assume that
the disturbed water volume is a cylinder with the same diameter
as the moving animal. The target pixel, which also has the diam-
eter of the target, thus defines an observed volume, which can be
approximated by the intersection of two perpendicular cylin-
ders, known as a Steinmetz solid (the visual field of the pixel is
in fact a cone, but at sufficient target distances a cylinder is a
good approximation). The target body obscures half this
volume. With the target diameter, T, this volume is (1/ 3)T°
[23].
