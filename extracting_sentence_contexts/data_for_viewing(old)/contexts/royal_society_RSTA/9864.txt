has almost always been used is the one originally devised by Crnausrus and
MAxweEt.L; MAxweE tt abandoned it later, however, as it had “led him at times into
grave error.” In spite of its apparent simplicity, numerical errors of large amount
may undoubtedly creep in in a very subtle way. Hence the theory of a gas whose
molecules are elastic spheres remains in a rather unsatisfactory state. As a
“descriptive” theory (to use Mryer’s apt term) it has, however, served a useful
purpose ; the general laws of gaseous phenomena have been developed by its aid in
an elementary way, which has conduced to a wider diffusion of knowledge of the
kinetic theory than would have been possible if the sole line of development had been
by the more mathematical and accurate methods used by MAXWELL and BorrzmMAnn.

In this paper I have applied the latter methods, with an extension of the analysis,
to the elastic-sphere theory among others. In fact, I have obtained expressions for
the viscosity, diffusivity, and conductivity of a gas without assuming any properties
of the molecules save that they are spherically symmetrical. Many known laws are
thus proved more generally than in any former theories, but the formule so obtained
cannot in all cases be put into a really useful form without a knowledge of the nature
of the molecules. The supplementary calculations required to complete the general
formule of Part I. of this paper are carried out in Part IT. for three special cases,
viz., rigid elastic spherical molecules, molecules which are centres of repulsive or
attractive force varying inversely as the x'” power of the distance, and rigid elastic
spherical molecules surrounded by fields of attractive force. In Part IIT. the general
formule are completed in these cases and discussed in their relations to the results of
former theories and of experiment.
