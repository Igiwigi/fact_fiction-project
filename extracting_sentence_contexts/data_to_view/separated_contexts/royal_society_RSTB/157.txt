It was otherwise of the same dimensions as the

preceding ones. It was immersed in hot water for two seconds, and the difference
two minutes afterwards was found to be + â€˜0192 R.

This experiment left no doubt as to the possibility of producing effects comparable
with those of thermal section by an analogous mode of injury, and it is to be remarked
that the electromotive change produced is the greater, the longer the columnar strip. This is due to the fact that the number of electromotive elements operated upon is
proportional to the length of the strip. Another experiment was made upon a strip cut from a medium-sized Torpedo, and
measuring 25 mms. in length and 3 mms.
