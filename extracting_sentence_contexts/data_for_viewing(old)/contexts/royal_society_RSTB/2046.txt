HYBRID AND PARENT FORMS OF ECHINOID LARVA. 517

On an average in the three experiments made with similar colour varieties, 70 per
cent. of the ova reached the blastula stage, and 43 per cent. the eight days’ pluteus
stage. In the six fertilisations made with dissimilar colour varieties, the numbers
were respectively 61 per cent. and 42 per cent. The differences in fertility are there-
fore not nearly so striking as in the case of the Spherechinus colour varieties. In
fact, they almost; fall within the limits of experimental error. As regards actual size,
however, the differences are more marked. Thus, on an average, the dissimilar larvee
were 4°9 per cent. smaller in body-length than the similar, an amount much too large
to be due only to experimental error. As regards individual experiments, we see
Ghat in five out of the six experiments made with dissimilar varieties, the larvae were

preciably smaller than the mean between the parental larval forms, whilst in the
ooh experiment they were of about the same size. In one case the difference in size
gmounted to no less than 11°7 per cent. The importance of the nature and quality
& the sperm is clearly evidenced by the experiments with the red-spined variety.
Thus, of the ova fertilised by this sperm, on an average only 15 per cent. became
Hlastulze and 12 per cent. plutei, whilst with sperm of the black and brown-spined
€arieties, the numbers of blastulee were respectively 95 per cent. and 84 per cent.,
