This aspect provides valuable insights into the convergence properties of the Fourier series
and, consequently, the function spaces in which a solution exists. By examining the behaviour
of 4 with respect to high frequencies, we can gain a deeper understanding of the convergence
behaviour and the appropriate function spaces for the solution. The constants cx, C2, and c3x in
(3.6) depend uniquely upon the initial data Tin, , Trin,ky Tit,ink and satisfy

Crk + 02k + 03k = Tin, ke
ALCL K + A2,KC2,k + A3,403,k = Think
d nu 13 perk +23 p03,k = TH i

Consequently, we can derive the following expression:

Trrink — Ask + A24)T rink + A2,443,kTink
(Ark — A2k)(Are — 23,4) ,

A Trrink — Ask + Aa) rink + A143,kTink

" (Azk = A3,e)(A2,k — A1,k) ,

p= Trrink ~ Aa,k + Aan) Tring + Aa,kh2,kTin ke

. (Ark — A3,)(A3,k — A2,k)

Note here that Aj; 4 Aik holds whenever i 4 j (we will guarantee this fact later on, with the result
of lemma 3.4), hence the above expressions are well defined. The roots A1,, 42, and A3,, are indeed
distinct for each value of the frequency k. To estimate the Fourier coefficient T;(t) in terms of the frequencies k € Z, we need to establish
some related estimates for the roots 41,42, and A3.
