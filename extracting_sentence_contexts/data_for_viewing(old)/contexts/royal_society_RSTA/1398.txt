partly rooted in the relative insensitivity in present-day climate as shown in figure 2b, is that
the relations are unchanged; in the case of constant scaling rates (linear in log precipitation),
this would imply that the scaling rates are a good predictor of climate change. Figure 3 shows
that this is not a valid assumption for the low-altitude region. For all three experiments, major
parts of the scaling curves in the future climate shift downward compared to present-day
climate, in agreement with Zhang et al. [14]. This behaviour is most pronounced for the lower
percentiles, but is not obtained for the highest dew point temperature range. The high-altitude
region, surprisingly, shows a (much) better similarity between present-day and future scaling, in
particular for the highest percentile where differences are very small for most of the dew point
temperature range.

We note that the two experiments based on re-analysis data, Esw and Epcw, display rather
similar scaling for the present-day climate, despite the fact that Esw is only based on a rather
limited sample of 10 summer months. Yet, because these summer months were selected on the
widespread occurrence of (heavy) precipitation, Esw is biased towards moister conditions, with
dew point temperatures approximately 2 degrees higher than Epgw (horizontal lines at bottom of
figure 3) and also higher percentiles of rain intensity (figure 5, values for 99th percentile).

To quantify the change of the scaling curves from present-day to future climate, we constructed
future scaling curves by assuming a CC and a 2CC response, and shifted present-day scaling
curves with a constant dew point temperature change (to the right) and enhanced rainfall amount
according to the CC and 2CC rates [14,30]. For the dew point temperature shift, we used ATdpo9,
which is the dew point temperature change for events exceeding the 99th percentile, representing
