An excessive focus on eye gaze
as the key element in joint attention (e.g. [56]) may twist the
scientific understanding of joint attention by underestimating
its prevalence in societies where eye gaze is less important
than in North American contexts. Rather than the narrowly Western-centric cue of eye gaze,
vocal and postural behaviours may represent a more culturally
generalizable set of cues for the study of infant social cognition
[53]. In fact, gestural, postural and vocal cues may play an
important role in Western contexts, but one that is de-empha-
sized in developmental psychology as a reflection of North
American culture. However, the plurality of methodological
approaches suggested by cultural evolutionary theory means
there is another option besides searching for single (or a set
of) cues that always indicate joint attention, across sociocul-
tural contexts. Instead, researchers should use an array of
cues, designed for particular sociocultural contexts, to compare
the prevalence and behavioural form of joint attention across
human populations.
