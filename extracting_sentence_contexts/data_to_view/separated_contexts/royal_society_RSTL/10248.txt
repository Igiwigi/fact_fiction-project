734 PROFESSOR W. M. HICKS ON THE THEORY OF VORTEX RINGS.

regard A'q, Ag as determined by (eq. 9, 10) when the cireulations are given, and

will be determined by the fact that the pressure along the free surface is zero, whils

it is IT at an infinite distance. There remain therefore 57 constants to be determin;
The conditions to be satisfied are the following :—

(1) þ, must be constant along the outer boundary of the core. This gives n equations,
viz., by equating to zero the coefficients of cos v.... cos nv along the surface,

(2) 4, constant along both the outer and inner boundaries of the core.
