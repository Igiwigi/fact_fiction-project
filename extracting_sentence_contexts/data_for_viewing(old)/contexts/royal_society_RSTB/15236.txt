apparatus [86] (see also [87,88]).

In AIF terms, active intervention and engagement are not limited to behaviours such as grasping and kicking but also
apply to perception and sensory predictions, which are adopted for sampling the environment and learning from unexpected
states. The infant, an ‘active seeker’ ([89], p. 148), makes use of its visual perception for epistemic foraging, as implicitly
acknowledged by the adoption of the violation of expectation (VoE) paradigm in studies on infants’ cognition. The VoE relies
on the eye-tracking measures of the amount of time that an infant spends observing a certain event; the longer an event is
looked at, the more it is ‘surprising’ or unexpected for the child [90-96]. In AIF terms, this ‘surprise’ signals information gain;
unexpected events are a prediction error from which the infant learns through active observation. Applied to educational
settings such as schools, this translates into a careful attention to the embedding experience of the learners through the design of
the materiality of learning (i.e. spaces and educational materials).

We chose to focus on the MM because it is based on the idea that development and learning are in fact the same process,
underpinned by the active engagement of the pupils with their learning space.’ It describes an applied educational system
aiming at ‘optimal development’, rather than academic success as traditionally understood (e.g. [97-100]; see also [101,102]).
While the MM theoretically insists on the materiality of learning as enabling and aiding cognitive functions, as other theories of


children’s development and learning (e.g. [101-106]), it is an applied ‘formal’ educational setting, essentially organized around
an indirect form of teaching, in which pupils develop and learn dynamically by repeatedly interacting with their learning

spaces and materials. Compared to today mainstream educational science that ‘has only recently started to pay due attention —S
to the significance of the material and spatial dimensions of learning’ ([107, p. 325]; see also [108]), the MM has a long-standing = =
tradition of so doing and has been deployed in a wide variety of cultural and social contexts (e.g. [109]; see also [110]). a
