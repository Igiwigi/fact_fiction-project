230 Mr. CuenEvix's Observations and Experiments

It may, be observed, that the gg,5 of the retort did not. yield
the same proportion of acid as the 5 of the: tube and receiver.
The fact is, that all muriates lose- a little of their acid at a req
heat, as I shall presently mention more particularly; and the
small loss: was, in all 'probability, owing to. a portion of acid
disengaged by the heat to which the salt was .necessarily ex-
posed during the operation.

Having thus ascertained the proportion of oxygen in hyper-
oxygenized muriatic acid, by means of its combination with
potash, a ready method occurred to arrive at the knowledge of
that contained in oxygenized muriatic acid. For this purpose,,
I disposed in the following manner, a WouLFE's apparatus, con-
sisting of three bottles, and connected with the pneumatic tub..
In the first bottle, I put a solution-of potash,* in about six parts
