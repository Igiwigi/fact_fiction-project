their muscular power, nor sufficiently attached to the coats of
the eye, to alter its form by their contraction. In birds like-
wise, the bony rim renders this impossible. That the axis of vision is really lengthened, and the lens
moved forwards, for the purpose of adjusting the eye to see
near objects, is rendered highly probable, since all the facts I
have been able to collect seem to point out these changes :
nor can the action of the external muscles increase the curva-
ture of the cornea without producing them. If the axis of vision being lengthened was believed by some
physiologists to produce the whole adjustment of the eye to
see near objects ; if the crystalline lens being moved forwards
was supposed by others to do the same thing ; and if the cor-
nea being rendered more convex appeared at the first view
equally to account for it ; all the three, when combined for that
purpose, must undoubtedly be considered as sufficient to pro-
duce the effect. EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE.
