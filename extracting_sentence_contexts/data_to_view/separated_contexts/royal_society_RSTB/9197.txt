Accord-
ingly, recent clinical, neuropathological, imaging and genetic
studies have revealed a great heterogeneity in the features of
cognitive deficits in PD patients [33-35]. An important clinical issue is represented by the influence
that L-DOPA exerts on cognitive function in PD patients. Despite the fact that L-DOPA improves motor function in PD
patients, this DA precursor can ameliorate cognition in some
patients while worsening this function in others. To explain
this apparent discrepancy, some authors [36] have postulated
that dopaminergic medications, and in particular L-DOPA,
impair the activity of those neural structures receiving dopamin-
ergic innervations, with less denervation than the striatum, and
alter the behavioural outcomes depending on these structures. According to this hypothesis, supported by imaging studies,
the regional topography of DA denervation becomes a critical
factor.
