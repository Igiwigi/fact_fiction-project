(c) ML for excited states

In many MQC dynamics applications, the QC properties of the molecular systems are usually
calculated for each time step during the simulation. Such a repeatedly large number of calls to a
QC program is the main bottleneck to run long timescale in nonadiabatic dynamics simulations.
In this scenario, ML has emerged as a promising approach to speed up the prediction of molecular
properties required for excited state molecular dynamics while still retaining the same level of
accuracy as the underlying QC method used as a reference to train the ML predictor [14,15].

The main advantage of using ML models as a surrogate for the QC method comes from the
fact that, once the ML model has been fitted to the reference data to reproduce QC properties
within the desired accuracy, the solution of the SchrÃ©dinger equation is wholly skipped, thereby
resulting in extremely fast predictions for new molecular configurations produced during the
dynamics. This type of multi-dimensional regression problem is known as supervised learning in
the ML field, where kernel methods and neural networks have become the preferred algorithms

for fitting (highly nonlinear) chemical data [52]. : 2

However, performing fully ML-driven excited state dynamics is rather challenging [14,15]. >
One crucial issue is related to the intrinsic multi-dimensional nature of the target properties : 8
required for an MQC simulation. The ML model should accurately predict the potential energy D>
of the diverse molecular configurations accessible in each electronic state (which are scalar : <
properties) and interatomic forces and nonadiabatic coupling vectors (vectorial quantities). 3
