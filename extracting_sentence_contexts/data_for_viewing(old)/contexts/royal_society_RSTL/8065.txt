mum is 4-14 years, and from the second maximum to the third minimum $:44 years,
Finally, the time from the third minimum to the third maximum is 3:37 years, and from
the third maximum to the fourth minimum 7:44 years. We see again that the second
curve, which was longer in period as a whole than either of the other two, manifests this
excess in each of its branches, that is to say, its left or ascending branch is larger as a
whole than the same branch of the other two curves, and the same takes place for the
Second or descending branch. On the other hand, the maximum of this curve is not 80

high as that of either of the other two—in fact the curye has the appearance as if it
were pressed down from aboye, and pressed out laterally 80 as to lose in elevation
what it gains in time.

Lastly, after undergoing the process of equalization which has been described, there is
ﬆtill the appearance in all the three curves of a secondary maximum in the 8econd
branch ; and this peculiarity has induced us to compare the solar curves with the curves
of brightness of two variable stars, the peculiarities of which haye been well determined.
We annex with this purpose the light-curve of R. Sagitte (Plate XXXI, fig. 1) deter-
mined by BAXENDELL, showing like the sun's spot-curve a secondary maximum in the
second branch of the curve; and we also exhibit the light-curve of Þ Lyre (fig. 2) deter-

A mined by Pogsox from the observations of ARGELANDER, exhibiting two maxima, which
