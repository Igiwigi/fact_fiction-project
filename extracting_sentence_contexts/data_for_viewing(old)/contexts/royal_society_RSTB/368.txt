glass were generally of a pale slate colour.” Concerning the former observation,
P. rape is very commonly tinged with pink, and I think it almost certain that if the
pupa was not removed from the scarlet surroundings the reflected light would intensify
the pink tinge of the ground colour, and would thus produce a simulated resemblance
between the two. I found that it was never safe to compare the colours of pup
until they had been removed from the coloured surface on which pupation had taken
place, and were arranged side by side upon white paper. Furthermore, in my experi-
ments a dark red surface did not produce reddish, but dark, pupz in P. brassice, and
(as will be shown below) I can quite confirm Mr. Bonn’s criticism that reddish pup
of P. rape are not found on red brick walls. At the same time Mr. Bonn’s objection
to the main position taken up by Mr. Woop—that the pupe of Pieride have some
general resemblance with their surroundings—is without sufficient foundation, and
the fact must now be generally admitted. His criticism that he has seen pupae of
P. rape with all shades of colour on the white painted woodwork of a greenhouse is
valueless unless he can show that the dark forms are as common as when the pupe
are found on a tarred fence. Mr. Bonp’s obsérvation that the variable pupe of
Anthocaris cardamines are not sensitive is important, but the species needs experi-
mental investigation in order to confirm his observations.

The late Mr. Ep>warp Newman also expresses an opinion adverse to Mr. Woop’s
observations upon P. rape in these words (‘British Butterflies,’ 1871, p. 162), “An
ingenious—but, as I think, futile—attempt has been made to show that the colour
of the chrysalis varies with the colour of the object to which it is attached.”
