Although laborious the method entailed no
serious difficulty, and 3-figure accuracy (at least) is claimed for the results presented in
figures 8-11.
* Cf. Binnie & Woods (1938).
+ Ofside 7/3-548. Figures 7 reproduce only about one-half of the length of our actual diagrams.

+ Full use was made of the fact that log / is plane-harmonic (cf. Part V, ยง 17), and in fact the values given
in figure 7c satisfy the requirement with 5-figure accuracy.
