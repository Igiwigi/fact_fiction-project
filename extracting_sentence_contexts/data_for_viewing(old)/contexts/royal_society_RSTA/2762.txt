with it. This is illustrated by the capacitor discharge via digital switching logic. Here our typical
speeds are sub-Gigahertz. These two forms are orthogonal but can work together, for example in
a nested way, like the second and minute hands of the clock. We could combine the TL discharge
(step-wise discretization of an exponential—inner loop) with a logic circuit switching (step-wise
discretization of hyperbolic discharge—outer loop).

This is a conjecture with which I conclude this paper. It is based on the stepwise process of
TL models of capacitors by Ivor Catt and his associates and our stepwise processes with a ring
oscillator discharging a capacitor, even a lumped one. These are two orthogonal discretization
operators. The study of their superposition is a subject of our future work. This will open up
some new dimensions for energy-modulated computing!

Besides, a potentially useful result of this paper in terms of modelling is the fact that Petri
net unfolding can be interpreted as a waveform of signals whose states are associated with some
places in the net.
