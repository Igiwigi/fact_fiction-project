492 MR. J. NORMAN LOCKYER ON SPECTRUM-ANALYSIS.

Such spectra, like those of the metalloids, are separated spectroscopically from those
of the metallic elements by their columnar or banded structure.

IV. There are, in all probability, no compounds ordinarily present in the 8un's reversing
layer. s .

V. When a metallic compound vapour, such as is referred to in I1L., is dissociated by
the spark, the band spectrum dies out, and the elemental lines come in, according to the
degree of temperature employed.
| Again, although our knowledge of the spectra of stars is lamentably incomplete, I
gather the following facts from the work already accomplished with marvellous skill and
industry by SEccnt of Rome.

= VI. The un, s0 far as the spectrum goes, may be regarded as a representative of
S class (B) intermediate between stars (Â«) with much simpler spectra of the same kind and
jE stars (7) with much more complex spectra of a different kind.

VII. Sirius, as a type of &, is (1) the brightest (and therefore hottest ?) star in our
S northern sky; (2) the blue end of its spectrum is open; it is only certainly known to
pO contain hydrogen, the other metallic lines being exceedingly thin, thus indicating a
2 small proportion of metallic vapours; while (3) the hydrogen lines in this star are enor-
& mously distended, showing that the chromosphere is largely composed of that element.
i There are other bright stars of this class.
