Reiner Kirchheim No external stress, just a very high hydrogen chemical potential. 78

Question 3 78

Dave Rugg On the subject of strength and dislocations, if I take my lovely fastener 1a
and then torque it up so you've got plastic deformation on the threads :8
or I decide to thread roll it or shock peen it, changing both the strength :s
and the dislocation density, should I worry? :&

Salim Brahimi No. Are you referring to a surface treatment which is traditionally
designed to increase the fatigue life of the material? Experiments that
we have performed, as well as other researchers, show that inducing
compressive stress on the surface in fact reduces the susceptibility of the
fastener to failure. The explanation for this is an increase in dislocation
density, which is a double edged sword but, in this case, it reduces
the concentration of hydrogen available to the high stress concentration
point.

Question 4

Alan Sturt There seems to be an awful lot of hydrogen knocking about in situations
where you wouldnâ€™t expect it, like on those bridges and so on. Hydrogen
is a small molecule that just floats away. Do you really mean molecular
hydrogen?
