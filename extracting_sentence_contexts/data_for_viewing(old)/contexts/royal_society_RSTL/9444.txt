immediately behind or on the side towards the positive terminal of the tube, and there
are the game dark intervals dividing consecutive shells as divide consecutive striz. In
fact, this segmented discharge presents to us all the familiar phenomena of striated
discharges in which the strize have rounded or conical forms. Moreover, the conical is
not the only type of striz which can be successfully produced in this manner. Tt is
equally possible to form flat or annular strizz by proper adjustments of the air-spark
interval, as explained in page 192. And as these are precisely the forms which natural

strize tend to assume when they deviate from the conical type, ib may be fairly stated
that all the forms of natural strizz can be artificially reproduced : a fact which is
strongly in favour of the identity of the two phenomena.

But it is nob only in structure that these luminous shells resemble striz. There is
also an identity of function. We know that when the positive pulses arrive at the
glass they drive off similar positive pulses from the interior of the tube, and thus form
the luminous shells. And knowing, therefore, that each luminous shell Signifies a
positive discharge, and also that no electricity passes through the glass, it is absolutely
certain that a like amount of negative electricity must be collected at the surface of
the glass within the tube, and must ultimately satisfy an equal amount of the original
positive dischargeâ€”.e., of that which comes to it from the positive terminal, or from
the shell immediately on the positive side of the one we are considering, as the case
may be. We have then a negative discharge from the side of the tube, or from the gas
