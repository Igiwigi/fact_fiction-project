The situation is very and 29% in papers using SNPs). For assessment 2, marker
similar for corals and some facultatively sexually reproducing type played a role, as only few papers that used single genes
algae, also included in this survey. In fact, the proportion of were classified as ‘structure-barrier’ (17%) compared to publi-
species that reproduce both sexually and clonally is similar in cations using microsatellites (70%) and SNPs (62%). Single
the IBO and ‘unclear’ categories (33% for IBO and 35% for gene markers used in early studies seem to contain insufficient
unclear), but higher for IBD (42%). This could reflect the fact information about recent genetic processes as the fit to predic-
that in facultatively sexually reproducing species, biophysical tions from biophysical models was generally poor.
