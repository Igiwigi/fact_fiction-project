In this study, we discuss nucleation mechanisms in ice based on post-mortem observations of aed
microstructures on columnar ice polycrystals deformed in the laboratory. Tests were performed 22
under creep at high temperature and relatively high deviatoric compressive stresses (T * —7°C : Ss
and o =0.5MPa). The polycrystalline columnar ice microstructure with large grains (1-2cm DNS
diameter) enables relatively high resolution observations for ice (down to 51m) of nuclei, sub- : Ss
grain and grain boundary structures by cryogenic EBSD (cryo-EBSD), which provides the full if

crystallographic orientation of grains. In addition, this study tries to unravel the likely nature
of the dislocations involved in these structures, aiming to improve our understanding of the
connection between strain heterogeneities, nucleation mechanisms and textures.

We keep in mind, as highlighted by Humphreys & Hatherly [49], that when observing
nucleation, one is in fact studying nucleation and the early stage of growth because nucleation is
a part of recrystallization process which is well below the resolution limit of instruments used for
this investigation.

2. Experimental set-up

(a) Creep tests on polycrystalline columnar ice

Creep tests were performed in uniaxial compression in a cold room at —7°C (+0.5°C). A constant
stress of 0.5MPa was applied through a constant load along the vertical y-axis. Under these
conditions, a minimum strain rate of about 3 x 10-7 s~! is reached at 1% strain, after about 3h.
Teflon sheets were placed between the sample and the pistons in order to minimize friction
at the contact surfaces, which could induce shear. As the macroscopic strain reached less than
