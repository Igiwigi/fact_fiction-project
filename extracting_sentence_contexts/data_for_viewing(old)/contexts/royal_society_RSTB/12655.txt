1000 humans who participated in the Human Connectome Pro-
ject [104,105]. A recent study used an author-topic model of
cognitive functions across 9208 experiments of 77 cognitive
tasks to demonstrate a strong spatial correspondence between
cognitive functions and brain network modules, suggesting
that each module performs a discrete cognitive function
[106]. A subsequent study further suggested that specific
brain regions tune the connectivity of their neighbouring
regions to be more modular while allowing for the integration
of task appropriate information across communities, in a
manner that facilitates cognitive performance [107]. Such
studies lend support to the notion that a map between cogni-
tive modularity and brain modularity does in fact exist, but
its specific form may be different from that postulated several
decades ago. The existence of such a map also suggests that
adaptible brain modules may support adaptible cognition.
Indeed, the predicted support of modularity for adaptibility
is particularly evident in recent work demonstrating that the
modules within functional brain networks flexibly reconfi-
gured over time in support of human learning [108-111],
planning and reasoning [112], and cognitive flexibility [113].
From a theoretical perspective, the relation between network
modularity and adaptible function can be understood in a
more mechanistic manner by considering the fact that network
architecture directly constrains the trajectories that a system can
