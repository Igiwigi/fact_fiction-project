A new leaf centre would then in general arise on the same side of the apex as the shorter
half of the previous leaf, as is found to be the rule in a normal apex. In terms of the
inhibition theory it must be supposed that the influence exerted by the leaf centres on the
subsequent leaves is such as to inhibit the formation of new leaf centres but to promote
the extension of their flanks round the apex. This hypothesis seems at first rather arbitrary
and improbable, but it agrees well with the facts concerning the normal plant and con-
cerning J, and J, in the experiments. Thus in the experiments nos. 1 to 8 which form group I
the removal of the centre of P, reduced the promoting effect normally received by the
kathodic flank of J,, so that the anodic flank, as described above, was able to extend
farther before meeting the kathodic flank. There remains to be considered experiment no. 3, figure 4, which was an exception to
the relationship shown by the graph, figure 10, in that the arc of the anodic half of J was
considerably smaller in relation to the angle J,|-/, than in any other experiment of group I.
