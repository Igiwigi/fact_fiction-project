- a distinct and often, if the interval of time was considerable,
a violent electrical effectâ€”the piece of metal first plunged in
being negative, and the other positive.

This result depends upon the circumstance of the produc-
tion of a new combination, which is negative with respect to
the metal; for after the formation of the sulphuret of copper,
the plate of copper that has been first plunged into the solu-
tion exhibits the same negative state with respect to polished
copper, whether introduced into saline solutions, or alkaline
or acid menstrua. "The electrical effect therefore does not
depend on so simple a condition as would at first appear,
and it may be in fact referred to the combinations containing
two metallic substances and one fluid.

The grey sulphuret of copper is negative, in solutions of
hydro-sulphuret, to clean copper, and the superficial coating
has apparently similar electrical powers to this substance.

Copper, in the state. of protoxide, is negative, not only
with respect to metallic copper, but likewise with respect to
the sulphuret; a circumstance which explains many singular
