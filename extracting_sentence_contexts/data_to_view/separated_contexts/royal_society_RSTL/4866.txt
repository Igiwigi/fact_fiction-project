NEWPORT ON THE IMPREGNATION OF

rapid as in the artificial impregnation, R5 (p. 231), in which it took place in four hours
and thirteen minutes. On the eighth day twelve embryos had been produced. These facts seemed to show, precisely as in experiments with solutions of potass,
that impregnation is commenced very quickly; and further, that it was not arrested
by the gum when applied only two seconds after the spermatozoa, but that the change
proceeds almost as uninterruptedly as in a perfectly natural impregnation, since
the number of embryos was almost as great as in No. 5 R, seeing that the fluid
employed had heen obtained and mixed with water one hour and thirty-four minutes. No. 6. p.M. 3" 22", —Seventy ova, passed on a moistened surface, were bathed with
a thick solution of gum, and 7wo seconds afterwards with some of the impregnating
fluid employed in the last experiment, and water was then added ; the whole time
occupied, as above, being only twenty seconds. This experiment was the converse of the preceding.
