way. If (regarding d and k as the independent electric coordinates) we could be
certain that we had found the full expressions for J, 1,, x, «,, both types of external
electromotive force would be zero. But we can with considerable certainty say that
we have not found these completely, so far as they depend upon k and K (electrolysis,
&e.). On the other hand, it is by no means so obvious that we have not found them
completely so far as they depend ond andc, Let us then assume that the external
force (exclusive of frictional forces, of course) of the latter type is zero. If we can
point to no experimental facts contradicted by this assumption, we may consider that
the simplification is warranted,

57. Now (§ 28) the work done per unit volume by the external forces BE, e of
equations (28), (29), § 50 above, while D and d suffer the increments dD and dd respec-
tively, is

SE dD + Sedd = SE (dd + dk) + Seda
= S(E 4+ e)dd + SEdk.

Hence, if d and k be taken as the coordinates, the forces of those types would be
E+ e and E respectively. The assumption just made then leads to
