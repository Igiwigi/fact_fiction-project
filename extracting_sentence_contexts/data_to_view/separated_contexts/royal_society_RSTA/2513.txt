An incidental advantage of regular absolute observations is the check they
afford on the working of the apparatus. They help to disclose defects such as poor
insulation, and secure more careful attention to the electrograph. One of the reasons
for observing potential at 2- as well as 1-metre height, was the fact that the discharge
x, tube of the water-dropper is fully 3 metres above ground level. There is little
& experimental information as to the differences that may exist in the potential gradient
8 at different small heights above ground level, and there is no general agreement as to
& the height interval from which the standard potential gradient should be obtained.
& §5. If V denotes the potential, and z be measured vertically upwards, the potential
© gradient (dV/dz) must satisfy the two equations
