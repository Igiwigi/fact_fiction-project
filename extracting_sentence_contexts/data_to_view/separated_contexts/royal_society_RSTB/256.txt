Each series of five plates is arranged in the form
of a horseshoe, widely open towards the ventral surface, and set obliquely to the long

axis of the larva ; in fact, each horseshoe may be described as approximately parallel to
the mesentery separating the right and left body-cavities, the basals being developed
round the former, and the orals round the latter cavity. As a consequence of the fact
that they share not only the longitudinal but also the lateral obliquity of this
mesentery, the left ventral plate of each series is distinctly nearer the anterior end of
the larva than is the right ventral plate of the same series : thus the left ventral basal
generally lies at about the same level as the dorsocentral, while the right ventral
plate of the same series lies at about the level of the posterior stem-joint. I could discover no indication that the dorsocentral, basals, and orals, were
developed in any particular order, though it is probable that all of them are developed
before the stem-joints.
