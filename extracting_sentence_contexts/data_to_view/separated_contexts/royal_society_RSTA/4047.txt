Recent
studies show that reversed micelles control the oxidation of oil. In addition, Maillard reaction
yield of key aromas can be strongly increased when using SASs. Considering the fact that
food systems contain oil, it is of prime interest to master the phase behaviour of the system
surfactant (PL or MG), triglyceride and water. The literature concentrates mainly on the binary
surfactant/water system, but there is a lack of information on a system including triglycerides. In this study, it was shown that addition of triglycerides in the MG water system is very
advantageous for the Maillard reaction, because the phase obtained at room temperature is of
low viscosity, which is much easier for processing.
