There is no model there really: no
analytics. Yet this raises issues of privacy and security (of personal information) along with issues
of the appropriateness and frequency of direct communications and marketing. In fact, the most valuable usage of the customers’ data occurs in a very different way and
is not reliant upon the customers’ personal details—merely using their unique ID (customer :
number) to string successive purchasing together and some executive descriptions of their usual :=
behaviour (their ‘segment’ and their home store/region). This topic is described in [1], and 23
includes many strategic activities (for the retailer) that are resolved by analysing repurposed
disaggregated basket/loyalty data, and in the process doing some modelling. These include mea)
customer behavioural segmentation and what type of behaviour is growing, customer behaviour :
and response to different formats of the offering, customer acquisition via different vectors, a]
customer missions (how and why do customers shop?), investment into ‘stores within stores’ and DNS
implants, pricing and promotion strategy, category ranging decisions, relative store performance, [a
vendor intelligence sharing and support activities, the value of secondary displays, activity 1D
around specific events and festivals, and so on. .
