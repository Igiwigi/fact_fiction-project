The whole length of the ovi-
duct (Plate XXX. fig. 90 c, 4) is characterized by transverse markings, evidently of
a muscular or contractile nature, and most developed at the ends where the constric-
tions (Plate XXVII. fig. 42m) occur. While the exterior of the oviduct is trans-
versely ribbed (fig. 42n), its interior is lined with large cells, distended with a dark
granular fluid, projecting into the cavity of the tube, and having all the appearance of
secreting cells. That these cells do secrete s0me $ort of fluid, is proved by the fact that they
become turgid when the Ascaris has been feeding, and are, on the contrary, almost
invisible from flaccidity when it has had no food. While the ovary is filled with an almost solid mass of ovules (Plate XXX. fig. 90 b),

the oviduct (fig. 90 c,d) contains a transparent, finely-granular fluid with only an
oyule here and there.
