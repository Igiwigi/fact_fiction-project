continuous-mixture method is undoubtedly preferable to either in this respect,
since it permits a wider range of variation of the flow, and a greater reduction in the
heat-loss. The agreement of the values of the heat-loss deduced from the different
flows by means of formula (10) is closer than might have been expected, because 1 in
the last figure of the heat-loss corresponds to 0°°001 C., or 1 in 30,000 of the heat-
exchange for the large flow. It may be said that formula (10) is verified to at least
1 in 5,000 for the ratio of the mean specific heat from 69° C. to 100° C., where it
differs most widely from Lispry’s, to the mean specific heat from 25° C, to 56° C.
Formula (10) gives 10050 for the ratio. Lipry’s formula gives 10104, differing by
0°54 per cent. If Lispry’s formula had been employed for the reduction, the heat-
loss, instead of being nearly the same for the different flows, would have appeared to
vary from 3°38 for the largest flow to 1'79 for the smallest flow. The heat-loss
should, as a matter of fact, have been slightly less for the large flows than for the
small, because the rise of temperature of the jacket J with the smallest flow was
rather more than sufficient to compensate for the fall of mean temperature of the
thermometer-pockets.

Seeing that the results of the continuous-electric method have now been so closely
verified by the continuous-mixture method, which is independent of electrical energy
measurements, it would appear to follow that the discrepancy of 1 per cent. at 80° C.
between these methods and those of Messrs. BousrretD and Lisprn is to be attributed
mainly to fundamental differences in the thermometrie and calorimetric methods
employed. In my continuous-flow methods the troublesome and uncertain corrections
of mercurial thermometry at temperatures between 40° C, and 100° C. have been
avoided, and a higher order of accuracy in the temperature measurements has been
