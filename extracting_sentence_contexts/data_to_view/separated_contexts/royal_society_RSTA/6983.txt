This value for w is, of course, equal to the increase in edge energy of the step
by the formation of a kink. Since w is small, we shall have a considerable number of kinks;
in fact, if T~ 300° K, ¢, ~ 0-15 eV, we shall have one kink for every ten molecules in the
step. The concentration of molecules diffusing in the edge of the step is much smaller than
that of the kinks, being in fact proportional to 7? which gives one diffusing molecule per
100 molecules in the step, if we use the above values for ¢, and 7. As the inclination of the step increases (h>0) with respect to the [0, 1] direction, the total
number of kinks increases, because of the presence of kinks due to geometrical reasons;
actually , increases and n_ decreases in such a way that n,+-n_ increases. For h very small
(h<2y,), and at low temperatures, one deduces

h2
n+n_= [1455]. (75)

On the other hand, as we approach the [1, 1] direction (4 = 1), the positions in the step
from which the evaporation energy is W, are no longer the kinks of height 1 (probability n,),
because of the influence of the second nearest neighbour bonds.
