TIDES IN OCEANS BOUNDED BY MERIDIANS 509

Very close agreement between the positions of the amphidromic points thus occurs for
all widths of oceans. This may be taken as valuable testimony to the accuracy of the
results for the very narrow ocean; it was a possibility to be considered that as the equa-
tions between Ay and H for the narrow ocean involved relatively small quantities, the
equations might have been affected by the errors of the finite-difference methods.

Another highly confirmatory fact is that the zero values for P,(cos @) occur at 0 = 30-6
and 70-1. Itis evident, therefore, that this function is dominant for #/ = 20, though in the
theories discussed in Part IV this function is only associated with a free motion so long as
the ocean is extremely narrow. In view of the conclusions of § 15, it is probable that this
dominance comes into effect as soon as the width becomes appreciable, but there is
need for more precise analytical investigation before this matter can be satisfactorily
explained.

Similarly, it is interesting to notice that for an ocean 50° wide the polar tides are
direct and they remain so for the ocean 70° wide, but they become indirect again for the
ocean 90° wide. These effects can be investigated by referring to the equations relating
A, and H as given at the end of § 12, from which it will be seen that, assuming continuity,
the coefficients of A, are negative for the oceans of width 30°, 50°, 70° and become
