Or did Adams act ‘like a
bashful boy rather than like a man who had made a great discovery’ [57, p xxvi]? This remains


entirely a matter of opinion. The facts are that Adams had made an astonishing prediction, but
failed to convince his peers that it was a serious theory. The moment Airy saw a confirmation of
Adams’ prediction, he acted and Challis started a serious observational campaign. His approach
was perhaps not very enthusiastic, but it was professional.
