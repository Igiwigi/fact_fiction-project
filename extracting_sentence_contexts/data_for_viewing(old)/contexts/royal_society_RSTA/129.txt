of the seemingly universal influence of VLSM in both channel and boundary-
layer flows, but the VLSM is found to be shorter in these cases than in the pipe,
which was the object of the earlier study by Guala et al. (2006); however, the
common feature shared by all these flows is that VLSM contains a large share
of the kinetic energy.

It appears now that the VLSMs do exist in velocity signals, but were no
recognized previously, perhaps, owing to the way the velocity signals were
measured and processed. It is thus useful to speculate about the origin of the
VLSM. A mechanism that is conjectured by Balakumar & Adrian (2007) relates
to the autogeneration and alignment of hairpin-vortex packets. This view mus
be reconciled with the fact that VLSM is sometimes deduced to be of the order o
the length of the apparatus itself (Ganapathisubramani et al. 2006).

Further speculations are varied. One suggestion has been that the VLSM may
be related to large-scale pressure fluctuations in experimental facilities. If so, i
would not be as interesting as one might now imagine. Another suggestion is tha
it arises from the statistical merger of many wall-layer streaks beyond a certain
Reynolds number, much like the percolation structures that span the entire size
of a percolating medium as soon as the probability of occurrence of site
percolation exceeds a threshold value. It must also be said that the detection o:
VLSM has relied heavily on the use of Taylorâ€™s hypothesis. For instance, even in
PIV measurements, two-dimensional data frames of finite streamwise extent are
