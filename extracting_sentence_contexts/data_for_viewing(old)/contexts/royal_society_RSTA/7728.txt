To test the latter a series of separate experiments was carried out in an
Andrews compression apparatus,} and the isothermals at 21° C. of carbon dioxide,
ethylene, nitrous oxide, methyl ether, and sulphur dioxide were obtained. These
were all strictly linear over a pressure range of about 0-9-3 mm. of mercury,
and as there was no reason to doubt any sudden change in properties below this
range down to zero pressure, this proved that the linear formula, pu = p,v,(1 — Ap)
was rigid, and consequently no error was introduced by the linear extrapolation
of the microbalance ratios. In addition, when three or more microbalance ratios
were measured at different pressures there was no evidence of any curvature of the
7, p graph in either our work or that of WoopHEAp and WuytLaw-GrRay.t We
thus see that the most probable error of these preliminary results was that due to
adsorption on the balance, despite the fact that the surface moments at each end of
the beam were equal. This view was confirmed by a cross ratio between the
carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide results. These two gases, having similar critical
data, molecular weights, and compressibilities, would be expected to behave in a
similar manner, and consequently the error due to adsorption should be either
negligible or extremely small. The cross ratios were taken in the following way in
order to eliminate the oxygen results with which the gases were originally compared.
