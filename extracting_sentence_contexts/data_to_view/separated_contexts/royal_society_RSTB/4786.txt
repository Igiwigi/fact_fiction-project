More recently W. 'T. Russet
(13, 1922) has calculated the correlation coefficients for monthly rainfall between con-
secutive and between alternate months. For Greenwich (65 years) no appreciable corre-
lations are found between successive months, but in the alternate months it is found
that June and August have a positive correlation -+ 0-55. Such a value should occur
by chance from uncorrelated material once only in 900,000 times, so that even allowing
for the fact that it is the highest of the 24 values obtained, it would appear to be sig-
nificant of a real association. It should, however, be borne in mind that any secular
changes either in total rainfall, or in its distribution through the year, as may exist at
Greenwich, have not been eliminated in this coefficient, and, in the second place, the
distribution of monthly rainfall is far from normal, and in consequence the probable
error of such a determination may be distinctly higher than that calculated for normal
distributions. ON THE YIELD OF WHEAT AT ROTHAMSTED.
