584 MR. H. M. WARD ON THE MORPHOLOGY AND THE

The habit of these fungi, and the fact that no true L£rysiphe had been found
among the collections of travellers in the tropics, led Frrns* to insist strongly on
the known or supposed analogies between the two genera, and, Borxer following
Fares, the Meliolas have thus come to be regarded as replacing the LErysiphes in
tropical countries—as, in fact, © representative species.” Borxer added several ſacts
to those already known concerning the coarser anatomy of the group ; but even his
excellent and systematic memoir left large gaps in the knowledge of important details,
and practically nothing was known of their development or of the formation of their
* fruit-bodies.” These and other gaps I hope to fill up to at least a large extent in
the present es8ay.
