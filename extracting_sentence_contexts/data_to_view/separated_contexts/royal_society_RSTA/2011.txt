and triplet lines in question. The points against the allocation of these lines to the
normal D group are, (1) the satellite separations are not in the usual ratio 5:3 (they
are in fact close to the ratio 3:5), (2) there is no appearance of satellite lines
corresponding to the parallel F lines noted above, and (3) the limit 53081 is somewhat
larger than we should expect from the march of the limits in the other gases. Taking it, however, as the limit, it is possible with the given value of A, to
calculate the link e, The result is 197+4d»,. The occurrency curve as found from
B’s and W.’s observations is given in Plate 2, fig.
