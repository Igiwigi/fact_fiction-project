he has had a special interest in graph theory. So
why are these graphs named after him? This will be
explained in §2. The explanation will suggest what
should be the definition of a Ramanujan graph, for a
general graph, not necessarily k-regular. Moreover, it
will suggest the definition for directed graphs (digraphs)
and even high-dimensional simplicial complexes (the so-
called Ramanujan complexes), as will be explained in §3
and in §4.

Ramanujan graphs have found plenty of applications
in computer science and pure mathematics. Most of
them have to do with the fact that they provide optimal
expanders (see [2-4] and the references therein). Lately,
Ramanujan complexes and high-dimensional expanders
have also started to be a popular subject of research
(cf. [5,6] and references therein).

Here, we concentrate on describing their aspects which truly use the full power of being
Ramanujan, and not merely expansion. In §5, we will describe random walks on Ramanujan
