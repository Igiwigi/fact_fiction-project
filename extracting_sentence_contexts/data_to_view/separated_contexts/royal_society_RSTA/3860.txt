Raman spectra of (a) cerussite layer; (6) red bole layer; and (c) gypsum layer (Ao: 514.5 nm).

a natural lead carbonate mineral worldwide distributed, whereas the mineral hydrocerussite
is extremely rare and therefore rarely used as a pigment source [7]. In the Andean region, the
Jesuit Father Bernabé Cobo reported in 1653 on the occurrence of lead carbonate mines in Juli
and Azangaro in the Viceroyalty of Peru [8]. These facts suggest a mineral source for the cerussite
identified in the priming layer of the sample. The Raman spectrum of the red bole layer (figure 3b)
showed the characteristic bands of haematite («-Fe2O3) at 225, 294, 411, 611 and 1320cm7!,
together with a weak band at 660cm™! that has been reported for disordered structures in
natural haematite [9,10]. The band at 1010cm~! in the Raman spectrum of the preparation layer
(figure 3c) is characteristic of gypsum [11].
