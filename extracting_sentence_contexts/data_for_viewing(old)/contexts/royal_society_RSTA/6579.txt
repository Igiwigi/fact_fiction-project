was precisely the same as before, and, though the current was allowed to flow
through the solenoid for some time, not the slightest change could be detected.
Several trials were made of the same kind, and all concurred in yielding the same
results. Of course, the value to be attached to an experiment of this kind depends
mainly upon the ability of the observer to distinguish small differences of pitch.
Now the author's assistantt has so frequently proved his skill in this respect}
that it can be fairly said that if longitudinal magnetisation does influence longitudinal
elasticity it does so to an extent which cannot be appreciated, even by a well-trained
ear, when tested in the above manner. It might, perhaps, be possible to detect some
effect of magnetisation on the temporary elongation produced by large loads when
the method of static extension is employed, but not with the arrangement used by
Werraemm. M. WertHerm seems to have taken no precautions to avoid the heating
effects of the magnetising solenoid, and the very fact that he was only able to detect
any change after the solenoid had been excited for some time points suspiciously to
heating as being the origin of what he observed. It is true that according to
Wenrruem the longitudinal elasticity of iron is increased by a small rise of tempera-
ture, but in this the author has ventured to differ from him.ยง

The Influence of an Electric Current on Longitudinal Elasticity.

According to WERTHEIM|| the longitudinal elasticity of wires is diminished by the
passage of an electric current, independently of the alteration which would result

* The full arrangement for effecting this will be described in a future paper.
