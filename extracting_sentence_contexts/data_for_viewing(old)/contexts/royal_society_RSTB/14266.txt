were split based on the inter-stimulus interval (â€”330 ms, +666 ms).
Each trial was baseline-corrected (from 300 to 20 ms before the
pulse) to avoid possible stimulation artefact residuals. SPESs
delivered with alternate monophasic pulses were analysed inde-
pendently between the two polarities. We performed an
automatic trial rejection as in Russo ef al. [49] to exclude trials
affected by large epileptiform abnormalities and electrical artefacts
from further analyses. After the automatic trial rejection, we cate-
gorized the receiving contacts as non-responding or connected,
considering a maximum absolute voltage greater than 5o [44,50].
As for the time window (5-150 ms), we set the onset at 5 ms
because the Tukey filter used to remove possible stimulation arte-
facts could interfere with the data up to that point [51]. The offset
at 150 ms was to avoid the classification of contacts being contami-
nated by the recruitment of epileptic networks, which are known
to evoke a pathological complex that peaks around 200 ms [45,52-
54], and to avoid the possible epileptic responses that can occur
after those latencies. The automatic categorization of each contact
was visually verified and corrected by two trained neurophysiol-
ogists. Subsequently, for CCEPs of each connected contact,
we quantified the peak latency, as the latency of the maximum
rectified peak.
