found in the domestic breeds has been modified during the period of domestication.
The experiment I have carried out is competent only to reveal the reaction of a
stock of wild origin. Whether this differs essentially from the reaction in domesti-
cated breeds can be judged only when we know what reliance to place on the
care with which these reactions have been studied and reported. It cannot,
unfortunately, be doubted that statements respecting dominance are, in general,
made with less care, and on the basis of less satisfactory evidence, than other state-
ments in the genetic literature. It would, in the literature of poultry genetics,
be easy to cite a number of examples, where factors have been first described as
dominant, without reservation, which in reality were lethal, when homozygous,
as in “dumpy,” or in which the homozygote, as in “ frizzled ” and “ spangled,”
is easily distinguishable from the heterozygote by the more extreme manifestation
of the mutant character. The term, in fact, has often been used on the strength
of experiments in which no single homozygote has been isolated for comparison
with the heterozygotes. The more critical genetic literature of recent years has,
indeed, shown that many of the reputed dominants of poultry should not, in any
precise sense, have been so described, but that they are cases in which dominance
is as clearly absent as in the oft-cited example of the Andalusian blue.

In the second place, where experimenters have been careful to enquire, by com-
parison with both homozygotes, whether the heterozygote really resembles one
of these, or is intermediate, the comparison has been often made on material
highly unsuited to this purpose. In such a comparison it is clearly desirable that
the heterozygote and the two homozygotes described should differ as little as
possible, and that not systematically, in other genetic factors affecting the character
