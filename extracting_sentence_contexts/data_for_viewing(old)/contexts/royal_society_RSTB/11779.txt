In the repeating neural units of the VNC, the B-class is
one motoneuron that has been postulated to mediate
stretch-receptor feedback from the body. The long undifferen-
tiated processes running posteriorly have led previous
models to assume stretch receptors covered a wide range of
muscle cells and that proprioceptive information travelled
anteriorly. However, more recent experimental work demon-
strated that the effect has a much shorter range than
previously assumed and is in fact directed posteriorly, because
the activity of each VB and DB motoneuron is activated by
ventral and dorsal bending of a more anterior region, respect-
ively [6]. In the light of this evidence, we model B-class
motoneuron stretch receptors as short-range connections
from the lengths of anterior muscles to the immediately pos-
terior B-class motoneurons, with the effect that posterior
body regions are encouraged to bend in the same direction
and shortly after the bending of a neighbouring anterior
region (figure 1b(ii)). The stretch-receptor current for the
B-class motoneuron in unit 1 on the kth side, Ip, sums over
contributions from the S = 6 mechanical elements anterior to
the anterior-most muscle that neuron innervates (So ;,):
