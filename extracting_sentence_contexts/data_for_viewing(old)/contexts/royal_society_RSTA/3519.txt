Throw an independent coin with probability a(®,, %+1, T,) of heads. In case of heads
accept the proposal and set x41 = Y%+1. Otherwise reject the proposal and set O41 = Px;
(IV) If the stopping rule is not reached, increase k to k + 1, decrease T;, to Ty41, go back to
step (II) and repeat.

It is appropriate to use pseudocode at this point since, as mentioned in §1c, SA is a general
stochastic optimization framework rather than a formal algorithm. This is because the stopping
tule, cooling schedule (that is, the decreasing sequence T; > T2 > T3---) and the Markov kernel
Q should ideally be tailored to each particular problem. In §3b and in the case study of §4, we
highlight particular considerations for the procurement problem under study.

SA is in fact an adaptation of the well-known Metropolis—Hastings algorithm (see [22] and
references therein). That is, its goal is to obtain a sequence of random samples from a probability
distribution from which direct sampling is computationally challenging. The particular idea in
SA is that the mode(s) of these distributions are the minimizer(s) of the objective function f, and
hence the resulting samples will tend to be located in parts of the parameter space which are
approximately optimal.

Note from (3.2) that a proposed move to a smaller f value is always accepted. A proposed
move to a larger f value, by contrast, is accepted with a probability which depends on T; (and
which converges to zero as Tj | 0). The constants T; are chosen to decrease to 0 at an appropriate
speed. In fact, T, may be called the temperature at time k and the name ‘simulated annealing’ arises
from an analogy between the algorithm and the controlled cooling used in the annealing process
in metallurgy.
