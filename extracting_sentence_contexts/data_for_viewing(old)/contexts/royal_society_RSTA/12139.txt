Ist Order, obtained by means of an uncondensed spark. That this metal at so high
a temperature yields such a spectrum is undoubtedly due to the fact that it is
almost, if not absolutely, impossible to vaporize it with the oxy-hydrogen flame.

Livernc and Dewar have recently obtained a band spectrum by the combustian
of nickel tetracarbonyl which is also accompanied by lines (‘ Roy. Soc, Proc., vol. 52,
p. 117). This spectrum, I expect, will be found to be due to metallic nickel and not
to the compound substance. ,

Yttrium and scandium, in solutions of their chlorides, each yield a line spectrum,
with a group of bands in the red and orange region, when submitted to the action of
a condensed spark. From the foregoing facts, and from the descriptions of spectra
which here follow, it will be seen that several metallic elements emit banded spectra.

Characteristic Flame Spectra of Elements emitted at High Temperatures.

I. Line Spectra.—Lithium, thallium, nickel, cobalt.

Il. Band Spectra.—Antimony, bismuth, gold, tin, sulphur, selenium,

IL. Band Spectra with Lines.—Copper, iron, manganese, tellurium, lead, and
silver.

IV. More or less continuous Spectra with Lines. —Sodium, potassium, magnesium,
