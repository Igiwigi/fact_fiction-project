ENSO. However, the connection with the surface temperatures in both the Atlantic and Arctic
regions appears to be much weaker than observed. This suggests that much of the model skill
originates from the remote teleconnection with ENSO. This likely occurs via recently discovered
global atmospheric teleconnection pathways where the stratosphere plays a key role [22]. This
is interesting as it requires both the accurate initialization of the tropical Pacific ocean and the
development of climate models that resolve the stratosphere in order to obtain skilful predictions
of extra-tropical North Hemisphere winter climate.

There is a strong dependence of seasonal prediction skill, both in the tropics and increasingly
in the extratropics, on correctly initializing ENSO in the tropical Pacific. As was discussed in §2,
the TAO/TRITON array is the key component of the ocean observing system for ENSO. It should
be a concern then that the TAO/TRITON array has suffered considerable degradation recently
and many of the 70 moored buoys are no longer returning data. In fact, as at the start of October
2013, I believe the array has not been serviced for 18 months. This is linked to budget cuts facing
NOAA that are placing harsh constraints on the ship-time needed for servicing the array. This is
a stark illustration that sustaining even the most demonstrably useful ocean observations is not
immune to political and financial pressures.

(c) Challenges for improving the representation of ocean—atmosphere coupling and the
need for better estimates of air—sea fluxes

An interesting result from the GloSea5 seasonal hindcast experiments is that the model ocean
does not seem to drive the model atmosphere with the same strength as that in the real world.
Many tens of ensemble members (versions of the model started from virtually the same initial
conditions but with some random perturbation) are needed in order to achieve the skilful NAO
