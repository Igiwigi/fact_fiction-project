are called ‘partially free’ samples. In an actual experiment twelve fields of Nj) — 400
were taken (for each value of /) and forty-eight samples of N, = 100 obtained from each
field. The mean and standard deviation of the forty-eight samples thus obtained were
found. The results obtained are given in tables 1 and 2.

180. It will be noticed that the results of experimental free and non-free sampling are
in quite satisfactory agreement with expected values. A comparison of tables 1 and 2 reveals
that the mean values of the number of patches in ‘partially free’ samples are roughly of
the same order as mean values in the case of ‘free’ and ‘non-free’ samples. Mean values are

thus fairly steady, and may be treated as independent of conditions of sampling for all
“practical purposes. The standard deviations (and hence coefficients of variations) are,
“Showever, entirely different for ‘free’ and ‘non-free’ samples. In fact, for ‘free’ sampling
2the coefficient of variation decreases with increasing values of the binomial proportion, while
ait is practically constant in the case of ‘non-free’ samples. The position is something inter-
Smediate in the case of ‘ partially free’ samples, and it is found that the coefficient of variation
Edecreases with increasing values of /, but more slowly than in the case of ‘free’ samples.

8 181. The above results make it possible to test the random or non-random nature of
binomial linear fields or binomial time series without any difficulty. It is simply necessary
‘4to count the number of patches of runs of ‘success’ and ‘failure’ and compare the observed
, eee with the expected value. The choice of the standard deviation would naturally depend
‘Son the conditions of sampling, that is, on the assumption on which the investigation is based.
gin case of doubt it is possible of course to use the standard deviations for ‘free’ wil sey! as
Sthese are numerically greater than corresponding standard deviations for ‘non-free’
