Certainly by no means the whole of the surplus phos-
phorie acid supplied to the soil remains in a citric-acid-soluble condition ; some of it
reverts into some less soluble form. How far such change follows rapidly on its
application, or how far it is the work of time, we cannot very well tell. The numbers
obtained for the earlier samples, therefore, must be regarded cautiously, in view of
the fact that they are not strictly comparable with the numbers for the 1893 samples,
which were obtained while the samples were yet fresh. Plot 3 (Unmanured). This plot has had no manure whatever since the beginning of the experiments in
1844.
