After around 1000 ms, the case with no model error continues
to reduce error, while error increases when the LETKF uses incorrect fibre rotation in the model
for the ensemble forecast. Both cases with fibre rotation error exhibit similar error patterns. The fact that the state is initially well approximated even with the model error indicates that
data assimilation has the potential to correct for model error. One potential reason for the eventual
divergence could be that because each ensemble member uses the same incorrect model, the
model error is not represented in the spread and thus the system develops too much confidence in
the forecasts. The global root mean squared spread in the model-error case continues to decrease
over time, even as the error begins to increase after 1000 ms, as shown in figure 8.
