each cell towards each of its poles, t.e., the middle is negative to the poles (p. 97).

2. The electromotive properties of the whole leaf (pp. 47-51) in the unexcited
state are represented by those of a schema (se diagram, fig. 20, a), consisting of such
cylinders arranged in the same order as its cells (p. 87).

3. On excitation, the cells of the upper layer of the leaf undergo a diminution of
electromotive force, those of the under layer an increase, 7.e., the middles of the cells
become less negative than before in the upper layer, more negative in the lower layer

(p. 152).

4. The diphasic character of the variation is not due to the fact that the individual
cells undergo opposite changes in succession, but to the interference of the opposite
electromotive actions of the upper and under cells, of which the time relations are
different (se diagrams 29 and 30 and p. 142).

5, The effect of an excitation is in no way dependent on its seat (p. 138).

6. The electromotive activity of the cells has no relation to their water-content
(p. 158).*
