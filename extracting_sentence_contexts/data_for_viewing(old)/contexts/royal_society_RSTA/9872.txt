of 1/0, and that later terms become important in the case of vapours, though for
ordinary gases these, the first two, terms appear to be enough.

As we have seen, the above laws of variation with temperature given by our theory

have been announced before. The difference between our formule and the earlier
ones chiefly consists (as regards viscosity) in the numerical constants. We have
already seen, in the case of the coefficient of conduction, to what grave errors
(f = 1°60 instead of 2°50) the older elastic-sphere theory may lead. The expression
given by Meyer for the viscosity differs considerably from the present one; JEANs*
made an undoubted improvement in the older theory by allowing for the persistence
‘of velocities after molecular collisions. The fact that this important consideration had
been previously overlooked illustrates the imperfections of that theory. As it is, the
correction for persistence of velocities is itself of uncertain amountt ; however, by its
means the discordance between the formula of the older theory, and that given by
the present theory for the case of elastic spherical molecules, is reduced almost to
10 per cent.}

From equations (54) and (55) we proceed to determine what evidence the various
hypotheses lead to, as regards the size of molecules. Those formule are strictly true
only for monatomic gases, but can be applied to polyatomic gases with much more
safety than could the formule for the conductivity of gases, where the internal
energy (which here plays little or no part) was very important. The formula (56)
could also be used to determine the relative force constants of the molecules when
