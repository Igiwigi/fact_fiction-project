The present rate of production of viable specific
mutations, amongst all flowering plants on the whole surface of the globe, is almost
certainly less than 1 in 10 years and more than 1 in 60 years; it probably lies between
1 in 15 and 1 in 30 years. The assumption of a polyphyletie origin for the flowering
plants would not very greatly affect these figures. Specific mutations must, therefore,
be such exceedingly rare events that no valid argument, as it seems to me, can be based
on the fact that we have no experience of such occurrences. My calculations fully
confirm Dr. Wrixisâ€™s conclusion in this respect. It should perhaps be added that of course the figures obtained, for a group so hetero-
geneous as the aggregate of the flowering plants, are of the nature of averages and may
well differ considerably for different families and genera.
