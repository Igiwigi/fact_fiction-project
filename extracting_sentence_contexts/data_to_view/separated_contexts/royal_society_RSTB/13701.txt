trends in the susceptibility of genes to undergo HGT, with expression, and in particular, translation, make the principal
transfer of genes encoding proteins with multiple interaction contribution to observed plasmid fitness costs, because of the
partners (such as efflux pumps) proving less successfully trans- bioenergetic costs of amino acid biosynthesis and the fact
mitted than genes with fewer interactions (such as antibiotic that proteins tend to be more abundant than their correspond-
inactivation) [18,19]. The recent global spread of ARGs is per- ing DNA and transcripts [26]. Rodriguez-Beltran and
