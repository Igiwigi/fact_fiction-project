Furthermore, as Collins
[139] demonstrates, different mechanisms will be responsible for changed flooding in different
seasons. Hence, where flooding generally occurs in a ‘rainy’ season, then again it may be
that precipitation-temperature sensitivities (if valid) are sufficient for flood projection [78,140]. But outside these scenarios, changing antecedent conditions need to be integrated into the
flood-temperature sensitivity for flood projection.

(b) Evaluation of flood-temperature sensitivities with historical trends

Using precipitation-temperature scaling for flood projection is supported by the fact that global
historical increases in annual daily maxima match the expected increase by the Clausius-
Clapeyron relationship and these increases in precipitation should increase flooding. But as
presented in §2c, the transferability of precipitation scaling to flooding is fraught because
infiltration losses have a nonlinear influence on the proportion of rainfall that appears as
runoff. The (lack of) transferability of precipitation-temperature sensitivities to flooding is
illustrated using the example of southeast Australia.
