4, CoMPARISON OF PaRENTAL STRAIN AND 1T8 CoLOURLESS DERIVATIVE.

The obvious difference between the original and the derived forms lies in the
colour of the sclerotia. Mutations in the fungi Aspergillus niger and Penicilliwm
glaucum have been described at length by Arcicuovskis (2), WATERMAN (83) and
ScHizEMANN (69). In these cases, however, although the obvious change was in spore

colouration, there were other less visible changes in several independent respects,
certain morphological characters and physiological activities of the derived fungi
being different from those of the original forms. In addition to these facts, the
results of recent researches on the linkage of characters and the multiple allelomorph
interpretation of quantitative inheritance made it appear probable that in the present
case the colour change might be only one of many related changes less obviously
visible.

Moreover, whether one regards the black sclerotial pigment as a mere excreted
product or as an integral and actively functioning substance in the metabolic
activities of the organism, the pigment itself is the result of a long and elaborate
series of causally dependent processes, and a sudden and permanent loss of the power
to excrete or form such matter can only be the visible expression of deep-seated
physiological changes in the developing organism. But a living organism is an
extremely complex and delicate equilibration of rhythmic metabolic processes in a
