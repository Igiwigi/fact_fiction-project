disturbance cansed by contact with the magnet. The influence of magnetisation, both
in this and other respects, has formed the subject of many other experiments which
will be described in the sequel.

$17. $0 far, only those results have been stated which were mentioned in the
paper, © Part I.,” communicated to the Royal Society in 1881, Figs. 1 to 10 inclusive
have been copied from that paper. It remains to describe later experiments, made
for the most part in 1883, Their principal object has been to examine the relation
between the effects of stress on thermoelectric quality, on the one hand, and on
magnetisation on the other. A glance at the figures given here and ab those given
elsewhere,* to illustrate the changes of magnetism produced by loading and unloading
an iron wire, will show that there is a very striking likeness between them ; enough
likeness, in fact, to make the hypothesis very natural that stress acts on the thermo-
electric quality of iron by altering its magnetisation, and that the variations of
magnetism are the immediate cause of thermoelectric change. Tn the writer's earlier
experiments no precautions were taken to rid the iron of magnetism to begin with,
nor to place ib in a position where it would escape magnetisation by the terrestrial
field, and it was certainly in a more or less magnetic condition throughout the
experiments. Sir W. TrxomsoNn has shownt that change of magnetism does give rise
