that complete regulation has on occasion followed each type of operation, up to the maximum
size of reversed-piece compatible with healing, with one exception. If the blastoderm at
the time of operation was in the LM stage or older, then reversals involving the front end
of the primitive streak do not lead to complete regulation unless the reversed-piece is very
small; about 10% of the primitive-streak length was the longest reversal actually found to be
compatible with complete regulation, though the series of experiments was not adequate
to determine an upper limit with any accuracy. Partial regulation is not limited in this
way.

Discussion of the actual changes of developmental processes involved in regulation meets
a serious limitation, in that the precise actual fates of the reversed-piece and residual
blastoderm are usually unknown. We can often be confident that they have not developed
according to their presumptive fate, but we do not usually know how they have in fact
developed. This is particularly so as regards the development of the anterior end of the
primitive streak. Here the tissue movements are complex and the presumptive areas
crowded, and it is always uncertain whether the changes from normal presumptive fate
which must have occurred were in the reversed-piece only or also in the residual blastoderm.
Another difficulty occurs with young blastoderms in that the reversed-piece was often seen
to persist in the axis, owing to delayed healing, instead of forming side-plate as would be
expected from its position immediately after the operation; and when the time for the
formation of the axis arrived, the reversed-piece occupied the position of, and may have
developed into, axial material. The exact fate of the reversed-pieces of young blastoderms
may vary therefore with rate of healing. Finally, it is not certain in a completely regulated
embryo that an anterior reversed-piece has even played the part of normal primitive
