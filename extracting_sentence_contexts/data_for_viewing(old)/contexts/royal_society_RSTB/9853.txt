Based on these observations, Preller et al. [114] conducted
a study to investigate the impact of cocaine use on interperso-

nal functioning and its relation to real-life social behaviour. In 2. Towards a second- person neurosc ience:

this study, a gaze-based social interaction task established in

our laboratory was used in a multimodal, psychophysiologi- target ng the neural mechanisms of social
cal and neuroimaging study. Here, it was demonstrated that interaction rather than social observation

cocaine users process social gaze cues during an ongoing
interaction differently from healthy controls and that these
impairments are, in fact, related to a reduced activation of
the brainâ€™s reward system (tables 1 and 2). Other studies
have found evidence for dysconnectivity between brain
areas underlying reward processing and areas involved in
cognitive control, which may represent an additional factor
that could explain socially inadequate behaviour (e.g. [115]).

The burgeoning field of social neuroscience has come a long
way since its inception [123,124] and has helped to characterize
the neurobiological bases of social cognition. The neural
mechanisms that underlie actual social interactions in real life,
however, are less well understood [3,4,125]. An important
avenue for future research in social neuroscience, therefore, con-
