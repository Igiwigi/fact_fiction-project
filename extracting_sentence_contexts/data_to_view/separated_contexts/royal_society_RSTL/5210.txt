Is the © horny striated substance ” supporting the
lingual teeth, © which appears to represent the body of an os hyoides ”” in Nautilus, the representative of the
buccal cartilages ?


60 MR. T. H. HUXLEY ON THE: MORPHOLOGY: OF THE CEPHALOUS MOLILUSCA;

the portion of the molluscous type here considered*, and indeed to; be peculiar'to it. Its occurrence in Chiton, therefore, would effectually determine the molluscous
nature of that genus, even if there were: no other grounds for the conclusion ; while
the structure, of the buccal armature of Sagitta, which has been compared to the
protruded tongue of a Heteropod, is. in fact s0 totally different as at once to remove
it from the MolluscaÞ.

I may further remark, that the structure/of the. tongue in'the Cephalopoda adds
one more link. to, the very strong' chain of affinity. between them \and-the- ordinary
Mollusca.
