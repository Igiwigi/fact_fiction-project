(b) A Hamiltonian formalism for incompressible fluids

Let u = (%,i/) € R? be a velocity field of a fluid particle—also called a passive tracer—located at
r= (x,y) and let w be the corresponding vorticity field, i.e.

curl(u) =. (2.1)
As seen above, a flow is incompressible if
div(u) =0. (2.2)

As already observed by Kirchhoff in 1876 [17], considering motion on R? equation (2.2) allows us
to re-write the fluid equations using a Hamiltonian formalism. In fact, notice that on the plane


by using Cartesian coordinates (x, y) the velocity fields become u = (x, y) and equation (2.2) is still 6 |
verified if we represent the velocity components as

ie. by means of the auxiliary function W, called the stream function. Formally, Y plays the role of : 2
a Hamiltonian for the pair of conjugate variables (x,y) and it is used to describe the dynamics of :e
a test-particle, located at r= (x,y) and advected by the flow. By substituting (2.3) into (2.1), we :
obtain
