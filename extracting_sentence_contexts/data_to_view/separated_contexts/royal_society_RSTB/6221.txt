The obvious
interpretation of this difference in the nature of the alveoli of the odd and even
numbered teeth is that those in the loose sockets are replacing-teeth that had
erupted only a short time before the animal died. * The fact that the seventh teeth
are implanted in a loose socket apparently means that they have been cut only a
short time, but since there is no evidence of seven teeth being present in a smaller
animal they are unlikely actually to have replaced teeth. The examination of the remaining available material provided very satisfactory
evidence in support of the foregoing interpretation. The main point of interest in
the two smallest specimens lies in there being evidence of replacement of the canines
and incisors.
