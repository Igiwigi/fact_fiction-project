Carotenoids were identified using
the 532nm laser for excitation in both untreated halite sample and powdered ‘colonized’
zone of the halite crust [65]. Moreover, the 785nm excitation wavelength on the handheld
portable Raman spectrometer was proved to be capable of detecting scytonemin within
the same type of samples, although here the time-consuming (of the order of minutes)
positioning of the system was necessary to achieve some spectral features of this cyanobacterial
UV-screening compound. In fact, carotenoids are exceptional pigments in Raman spectroscopic analysis of microbial
communities because they (i) have an extremely strong Raman signal even in a non-resonant
mode and (ii) are widespread in microbial communities and are present in all phototrophic
microorganisms. The strong coloration of carotenoids (from yellow to black) is due to the high
electric dipole transition moment of the 1-z* electronic transition resulting in absorption in
the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The colours are dependent on the number
of the double bonds in the polyene chain—more conjugated C=C double bonds cause darker
coloration [66].
