(d) Antibiotics from soil microorganisms

Antibiotics are defined as a large group of organic chemicals
produced by microorganisms that belong to several, chemi-
cally heterogeneous classes and are deleterious to the growth
or metabolic activities of other microorganisms [239,240].
After Alexander Fleming discovered in 1929 that secondary
metabolites from fungi can be used as antibiotics to treat infec-
tious diseases in humans and mammals [241], it quickly
became clear from the research of S. A. Waksman and others
that soils and other natural substrates harbour large numbers
of organisms capable of producing antibiotic substances
[242]. In fact, soils are a habitat for numerous autochthonous
microorganisms that form antibiotics in situ [239,243,244].
Soil microorganisms that are able to produce antibiotics
are fungi or bacteria belonging to the phyla Actinobacteria,
Proteobacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas, myxobacteria), Firmicutes
(Bacillus), Bacterioidetes and Cyanobacteria [51,245,246]. The
vast majority of secondary metabolites are produced by Acti-
nobacteria and fungi, and among these about 70% of all
metabolites ascribed to Actinobacteria are produced by species
of one genus, i.e. Streptomyces [29,51]. Antibiotics-producing
fungi mostly belong to the genera Penicillium, Aspergillus, Tri-
choderma and Fusarium [151,246].
