The deciduous branch is one method by which the Conifers overcame
the persistent foliage habit of the ancestral forms, when adapting themselves to more
modern climatic conditions. The other and more usual was by the foliage itself
becoming deciduous, as it has done toa marked degree in all the other Conifers except
the Araucarinex, and even to some extent in all these and to a great extent in many
of them. That the persistent habit is the ancestral one in the Araucarinez is clear
from two facts. For one, I am again indebted to Dr. Eamrs, who has observed that
the leaves persist longer on young than on mature trees. This is the more evident
in those species whose mature leaves persist for only a very few years (e.g. Agathis
australis and Araucaria Bidwillii), The other point is the practically indefinite
persistence of the leaf trace (see Section 3c) in the Araucarinee, especially significant
being its persistence in the forms which shed their leaves comparatively early.
