duce the various amplitudes in any one length of cable; thus we see that if an ampli-
tude or variation in the received current of 1 per cent. will suffice for distinct signals,
twice as many signals can be sent through any given cable as if an amplitude of 7 per
cent. is required, or four times as many as if an amplitude of 25 per cent. is required. The latter amplitude is probably necessary for hand signalling, but our experiments
have shown that less than 1 per cent. is sufficient when a proper compensation is made. The coincidence between theory and observation places it beyond doubt that the curve
truly expresses the relation between the speeds and amplitudes for straight as well as
for coiled'cables; and if the amplitude at any one speed through any one straight cable
were known, the amplitude at any other speed through any other cable of the same
Sh materials might be calculated from the curve with certainty ; but unfortunately this
a fact is wanting. There is no proof that the absolute amplitude observed through the
5 coiled cable would remain unaltered if the cable were extended; on the contrary, it is
Z very generally believed that it is easier to signal through a straight than a coiled cable ;
= and if this be 80, the amplitude would increase as the cable was laid. Although, there-
= fore, the constants for the mathematical theory might eazily be calculated from the
S values of the coordinates of the curye given by the observations, these constants would
= probably be inapplicable to straight cables.
