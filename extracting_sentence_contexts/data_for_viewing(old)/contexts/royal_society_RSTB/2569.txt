crushing has caused the maxillary and palatine bones to approximate towards the
median line and thus cover nearly the whole palatal surface, only a small portion of
the vomers appearing in the open space left behind the base of the preemaxillary beak.
Evidence of such a displacement is to be found in the fact that, were the mandible of
the same specimen shifted forwards to its natural position, with the bifid extremity
embracing the curved-down extremity of the beak, as correctly restored by Huxtey, the
series of teeth with which its edge is beset would fall outside the series of maxillo-
palatine teeth instead of fitting, as they should, in the groove between them. This
crushing has also caused a fracture in the maxillary bone, a fracture which has been
regarded by BurckHaRpDT as a suture between maxillary and palatine ; but I have
been unable to convince myself of the existence of such a suture in the position
assigned to it by that observer. One proof of the distinctness of a toothed maxillary
bone from the palatine in Huxtery’s specimen lies in the fact that the dentigerous
edge of the right maxillary bone, as determined by Huxtey, has, through displace-
ment, become more widely separated, in the vertical direction, from the corresponding
palatine than the left on the same specimen ; a correct idea of the state of things is
conveyed by Huxtey’s figure 3, but not at all by Burckuaropr’s outline drawing,
a great fault with the latter being the omission of the maxillo-palatine groove which
is clearly visible in the skull from which his figure is taken, and better still in the new
specimen which is the subject of this note. I should have felt perfectly satisfied
from an examination of the specimen in the British Museum, that Huxey’s interpre-
tation of the tooth-bearing bones was correct. But the matter is further settled by
the skull entrusted to me by Mr. Taytor, which, on the right side, shows the three
dentigerous elements, maxilla, palatine, and dentary, in situ. The anterior extremities
of the two former, perfectly distinct, are seen in the upper half of the block, together
