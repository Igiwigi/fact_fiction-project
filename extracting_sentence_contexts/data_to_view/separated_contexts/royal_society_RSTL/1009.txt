I introduced a quan-
tity of strong lixivium of potash into the cones, and likewise
concentrated sulphuric acid, separately, which are better con-
ductors than solutions of the neutral salts; but there was very
little sensible effect. The same principles will apply to all the varieties of the
electrical apparatus, whether containing double or single
plates; and if the ideas developed in the preceding sections
be correct, one- property operating under different modifica-
tions is the universal cause of their activity.

* In this process ammonia was rapidly given off fromthe $urface of the negative
cone, and nitrous acid from that of the positive cone, and a white yapour was pro-
duced by their combination in the atmosphere above the apparatus.

X. On some general llustrations and Applications of the fore-
going Facts and Principles, and Conclusion,

The general ideas advanced in the preceding pages are
evidently directly in contradiction to-the opinion advanced by
FasRoN1, and which, in the early stage of the investigation,
appeared extremely probable, namely, that chemical changes
are the primary causes of the phanomena of GaLvanism. Before the experiments of M. VoLTa on the electricity
excited by the mere contact of metals were published, I had
to a certain extent adopted this opinion ; but the new facts
immediately proved that another power must necessarily be
concerned ; for it was not possible to refer the electricity
exhibited by the apposition of metallic surfaces to any che-
mical alterations, particularly as the effect is more distinct in
a dry atmosphere, in which even the most oxidable metals do
not change, than in a moist one, in which many metals un-
dergo chemical alteration.
