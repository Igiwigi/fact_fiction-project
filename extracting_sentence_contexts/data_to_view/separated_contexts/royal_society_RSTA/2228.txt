In psychology, it is known under the name of simple marginal selectivity. The term ‘consistent connectedness’ is
less connotationally loaded than most of these terms. It is a naturally formed term in CbD, because contexts in this theory
are represented by isolated ‘islands’ of random variables, and they are only ‘connected’ to each other by the fact that some
variables in different contexts have the same content. The set of all variables R¢ with the same content q is then natural to call
a connection [34].

3The term ‘measured together’ usually means simultaneously, but it can be any empirical scheme by which the values of two
variables are paired. They can be measured at different times, as in the Leggett-Garg-type experiments [12,35], and they can
be related to the same or different physical objects.
