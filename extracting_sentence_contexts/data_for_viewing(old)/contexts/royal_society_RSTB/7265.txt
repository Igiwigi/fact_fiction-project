at the former humidity. In X. cheopis there was a comparatively better growth of larvae
and pupae within the cocoons, as is indicated by higher percentages of ultimate pupation
and advanced pupae formed at 80, 90 and 100% r.u. A fairly high mortality occurred
within the cocoons that contained the larvae about to undergo metamorphosis; this is
borne out by the fact that there was a very high pupation within the 1-day-old cocoons of

X. cheopis, that only contained the resting larvae; whilst a very large number of larvae died
in the prepupal stage within cocoons 2 or 3 days old, which contained many larvae ready
for the metamorphic change. A low percentage of pupation within the cocoons of
X. brasiliensis was due to this cause. The fact that in both these species growth occurred in
a much higher percentage of the pupae than of the larvae shows that the developmental
thresholds of pupae are lower than those of larvae; this is corroborated by slightly lower
theoretical developmental thresholds for stages within the cocoons of these species, being
11-83° C in X. cheopis and 11-63° Cin X., brasiliensis. A few of the naked pupae of X. cheopis
showed signs of growth; but the naked resting larvae of both species died.

The larva and pupa of each of the three species have different thresholds of development,
which are lower in the latter. This is perhaps due to the lower water requirements of the
pupa than those of the larva. The difference between the developmental thresholds of the
larva and the pupa is much less in X. cheopis or X. brasiliensis than in X. astia. The develop-
mental threshold of the larva of X, astia is either 13° C or a little higher; that of its pupa is
definitely lower. The thresholds of development for the larvae of X. cheopis and X. brasiliensis
