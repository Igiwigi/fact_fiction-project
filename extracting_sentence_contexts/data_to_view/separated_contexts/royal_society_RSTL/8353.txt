It appears by
Jacon!'s investigation for the quintic transformation (Fund. Nov. pp. 26-28) that we can
in fact express z, y, that is uf, v*, rationally in terms of the parameters «, þ connected by
the equation

W=2B(I+a+P),
which is that of a general cubic (deficiency =1); we in fact have

2=—a = 3% u

w(=)=P(D). (=1=F(=S):

where &, Þ satisfy the relation just referred to.
