half develops all the axial structures except part of the head; the experiments have

* In the descriptions of the specimens, the age of the embryo at operation, in hours of incubation at
37° C., is always given. It has been found, however, that these figures give rather little information as to
the stage of differentiation which has been attained, and where more accurate data are required, it has been
necessary to fall back on an arbitrary classification based on the length of the primitive streak. (See note
to Protocols, p. 197.) When the head process had appeared at the time of operation, this is always stated,
and when no remark is made, it can be taken that that structure was absent. The head process appears
considerably later in many of these eggs than appears to be usual. This is probably due to the fact that

much of the work was done in the winter, since I have found that in warm weather the embryos are
considerably more developed than in cold,
