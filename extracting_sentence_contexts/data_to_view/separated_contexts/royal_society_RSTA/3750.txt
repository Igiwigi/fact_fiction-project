Interestingly, the shape of the PDF is
nearly invariant over most of the boundary layer, with an obvious reduction in width in the outer
region. This reduction in the PDF size in the outer part is a consequence of the non-turbulent
region interspersed with the turbulent uv-containing region. In fact, the (externally) intermittent

region starts at a yt of about (4)6+ [23], which is roughly the location where the width of the PDF
size starts to decrease.
