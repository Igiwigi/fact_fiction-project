It would at first sight scem that there should be a similar theory as to the number of
ha: about which contact must subsist in order that it may subsist, about all axes, or be
S superficial. It is, indeed, found that if two-pointic contact be biaxal, or if three-pointic
Qbe triaxal, &e., the contact will be superficial. But this would prove too much, as it
would give four conditions instead of two for two-pointic, six conditions instead of three
for three-pointic, &e, superficial contact ; and, in fact, it turns out that there are always
in two-pointic contact one, in three-pointic two, &c. axes (viz. the tangents to the
branches of the curve of contact through the point) about which the contact is cireum-
axal per 86, 80 that the theory in one sense disappears. But as it at first had a semblance
of existence, it may still be worth while to have laid its ghost.
