2. SPHERICAL TESSELLATIONS

By projecting the edges of a uniform polyhedron from its centre on to the concentric
unit sphere, we obtain a network of ares of great circles decomposing the surface into
spherical polygons, one for each face of the polyhedron. We shall use the same symbols
for such spherical tessellations as for the polyhedra themselves. ‘Thus {/, ¢} now means an
arrangement of spherical f-gons, q coming together at each vertex. The tessellations
{p,q} and 4 were described by Abi’l Wafa, a tenth-century Arab (see Woepcke 1855,
pp. 352-357).

One advantage of shifting our attention from solids to spherical tessellations is that the
symbol {/, q} is just as significant when / or g takes the value 2 as when both are greater
than 2. In fact, {2} isa spherical digon or lune, and {2, g} is an arrangement of g lunes formed
by q great semicircles (meridians). Moreover, the faces of {/,2} are the northern and
southern hemispheres, regarded as spherical /-gons whose vertices coincide with / points
evenly distributed along the equator. The symbol t{2, g} for the g-gonal prism is now fully
justified; this figure has two vertices on each edge of {2, q}, just as the truncated cube has
two vertices on each edge of the cube.

Let (pf qr) denote a spherical triangle whose angles are

Tp, /Q,  7™/?.

We know that every finite group generated by more than two reflexions is generated by
reflexions in the sides of such a triangle where /, g, rare integers (Coxeter 1948, pp. 81-82).
