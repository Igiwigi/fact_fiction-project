As regards the nature of the immunity with which we are dealing, it is obvious that
the protected tissue is itself infected with the primary inoculum to the exclusion of the
secondary, and that on those spots where protection fails, a pure culture of the
secondary virus can generally be obtained, the protective strain being absent. The
varying degree of protection attained by reducing the time interval between the
protective and the final inoculation, points in the same direction, for those portions of
the tissue which are uninfected by the second strain contain the primary virus only.

When the individual strains are extracted and mixed the strong with the weak in vitro
there is no neutralization or destruction of the former as would be expected were
anti-bodies concerned.

These facts suggest that when a living cell has set up an association with one strain of
a given virus it is unable to repeat the process with a closely similar one, which implies
that some irreversible union takes place between some protein constituent of the cell

and the virus particle. Although this combination may give rise to no pathological
reaction, as is the case with X‚Äù, yet the nature of the combination must be essentially
similar so far as its attachment to the protein molecule is concerned, to that which
results when a highly virulent strain is involved with its consequent morbid reaction.
Hence we must assume that the attachment of the particle and its capacity for induc-
ing morbid change are distinct. This being so, a virulent virus molecule must contain
