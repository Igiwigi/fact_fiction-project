Leaving the placenta for later consideration, let us here try to evaluate the
significance of the acquisition by Tarsius of a connecting stalk. As I have elsewhere pointed out (Hint, ’19, p. 483), “‘ when Huprecur first put
forward his views, the existence of a connecting stalk outside Tarsius and the Anthro-
poids was unknown, and so he naturally attached great importance to it as a token of
affinity, but we now know, through the researches of NewMAN and Parrerson, that a
genuine connecting stalk, presenting a remarkable similarity to that of Tarsius, is also
present in the Armadillo (Tatusia novemeincta), in which obviously it must have been
evolved quite independently of that of the Primates. Nevertheless, the common
occurrence of this structure in these two groups of the Primates is a feature of very
great interest, -” Now the facts of development demonstrate conclusively that
the connecting stalk of Tarsius is none other than the reduced and precociously developed
homologue of the vesicular allantois of the Lemur. Like the latter, it consists of meso-
derm of direct primitive streak origin and into it there extends a diverticulum of the
yolk-sac endoderm and also, like the latter, its function is to provide, at the earliest
possible moment, a pathway along which the umbilical (allantoic) vessels can pass to
and from the chorion. Moreover, I have shown (ante, p. 60) that all that is
necessary to convert the Lemuroid allantoic primordium into the Tarsioid connecting
stalk is a slight acceleration of the developmental processes whereby the allantoic
primordium is laid down at an earlier period, prior to the appearance of the tail-fold
round the hinder-end of the embryo.
