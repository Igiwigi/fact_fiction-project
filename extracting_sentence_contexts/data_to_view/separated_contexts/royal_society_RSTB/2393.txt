I. Filices, which
excluded Hymenophyllacese, Parkeriacese, Schizeeacere, Osmundacee, Marattiacez,
Ophioglossacese, was divided into two sub-orders, Helicogyrate, BERNH., and Catheto-
gyrate, BERN. ; according as the annulus was oblique or vertical. This character has
been used with greater or less prominence by all subsequent writers on the subject,
but exceptions were found by G. Kunze,{ in the case of certain Japanese Ferns referred
to the genus Lomaria. These sporangia showed an oblique annulus, with lateral
dehiscence, and a short massive stalk; in fact, characters which resemble those of
the Cyatheacew ; he styles them “sporangia Plagiogyrata” (see above, figs. 139-143). The question was thus raised of how such Ferns are to be classified.
