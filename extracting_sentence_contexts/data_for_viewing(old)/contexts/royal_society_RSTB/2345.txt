when a multi-perforate diaphragm is introduced into a line of static flow of a diffusing
gas or solute. Ata distance away from the openings the lines of flux (analogous to
lines or tubes of force) ave sensibly parallel, and become convergent as they approach
the diaphragm, the velocity at the same time increasing owing to the local alteration

of gradient produced by the ellipsoidal “density shells” (lines of potential) around
the openings. As the hyperbolic lines of flux pass through the apertures they begin
to diverge, but since these divergent streams, proceeding from adjacent holes, cannot
cross each other, they bend round and once more become parallel, the velocity at the
same time diminishing. It is this bending round of the lines of flow to and from the
diaphragm which explains the striking fact that the apertures under favourable
conditions of distribution may be almost as efficient as if the diaphragm were non-
existent.*

The resistance which a multi-perforate diaphragm can introduce into a statically
diffusing column of any length, can be approximately calculated if we suppose the
apertures to be arranged at a sufficient distance apart to allow each aperture to
exercise its power without interference by its neighbours, and this resistance can be
compared with that of the open tube under like conditions. We have already shown
that the resistance of an open tube of length L, will be L + x, where «= {7 x
diameter.
