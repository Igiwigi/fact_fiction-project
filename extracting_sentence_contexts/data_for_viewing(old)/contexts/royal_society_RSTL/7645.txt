7. Although I have spoken of the Material of which these fabrics are mainly com-
posed as *sand,” yet its composition is very peculiar, When a portion of a non-infil-
trated specimen is treated with very dilute Nitric acid, a slight effervescence takes place,
and the arenaceous particles fall asunder. But when these are treated with stronger
Q nitric acid, by far the larger proportion of them is dissolved ; only a small residue
QA remaining insoluble in the strongest acid. Hence it appears (1) that the Arenaceous
S particles are held together (as in many other Arenaceous Foraminifera) by a cement
= of Carbonate of Lime, which, however, forms no large proportion of the whole ; and (2)
= that, although Siliccous sand-grains do occur in small proportion, the principal part of
= the Arenaceous material is not siliceous, but (being soluble in moderately strong nitric
© acid) is probably Phosphate of Lime. This proves, in fact, to be the case; a careful
& analysis, made -under the direction of Mr. H. B. Bravy, having given the following
