For example, E. coli, a bacterium that does not possess similar epigenetic mechanisms
and probably does not exploit DNA methylation processes for the same purposes as pluricellular
organisms, does not present significant differences between dinucleotide distributions. The same
is true for Adenovirus. This different behaviour might be justified by a different role of DNA


methylation in bacteria, or by the fact that only a small portion of bacterial DNA is affected
by this process [45]. Thus, our statistical approach might not be sensitive enough to highlight
possible differences. The case of fruit fly looks similar, since the difference between dinucleotide
distributions is not as marked, as shown in the double-logarithmic plot of figure 5.
