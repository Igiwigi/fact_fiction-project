While they perfectly match the period of the mean
local clustering in these examples, it should be noted that the periodicity of the structure is not


always so clear (e.g. when p is very large). However, understanding whether this is a consequence
of considering too small sizes requires further research and will be studied elsewhere. Our conjecture is greatly motivated by figure 5b; more specifically, by the fact that the
distribution of community sizes s; for large k appears to have support mainly over at most two
values, |s-| and [s,| + 1 (where |x] represents the integer part of x) with different weights 1 — f
and f, respectively, such that

Se = [SeJ(1 —f) + (L8e] + Vf. (7.1)

This suggests that the network is organized in groups of S spins such that each group contains
an integer number of communities of size [s,| and |s;| +1 in the same proportions as the rest
of the network. Hence, one would expect that the addition of precisely S spins would enable the
system to organize with a similar network structure. The smallest number of spins S with integer
amounts of communities of both sizes in those proportions corresponds to p.
