The first difficulty arose from the preponderance of the electrostatic attractions
between the suspended condenser and the walls of the containing case. To minimise
these effects the condenser was protected by a metallic coating which was kept at
the same potential as the case, all being earthed.

The suspending wire was made the insulated terminal, so that any electrostatic
pull upon this wire could only produce a force acting through the centre of support,
and thus the rotational effect would be eliminated, leaving only a translatory pull,
which would not affect the result. There were still residual electrostatic actions,
which were traced to the point where the suspension was fixed to the condenser.
At this point there was necessarily a break in the metallic protecting coating fixed
to the condenser, owing to the fact that the earthed terminal could not be brought
very close to the insulated terminal without breaking down the insulation. To
eliminate this effect, the protecting coating was prolonged up round the support in
the form of a cylinder, about 3 centims. wide, and 6 centims. high. The pull being
now between the cylinder and the wire, and therefore an internal force, there could
be no rotation produced. Finally, it was found necessary, for similar reasons, to
shield the wire as it passed through the top of the containing vessel (or case in which
the condenser hung) by a thin brass tube 1 centim. wide, passing well into the vessel,
and at the same potential as the wire. These precautions practically eliminated all
electrostatic disturbances. :

As it was necessary to keep the condenser charged for several minutes at a time,
condensers insulated with paraffin wax were found quite useless for the high
