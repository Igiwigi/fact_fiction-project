secondary, 5-6 by 4-1 cm. (Pl. 17, fig. 98). It is evident from these data that the
Platyrrhine placenta undergoes its greatest growth in what are relatively late foetal
stages, and it is an interesting fact that during this period also, as the sequel will show,
it attains its maximum grade of functional efficiency, so far as that may be judged from
its structural condition. Apart from a definite increase in thickness, due to the growth and branching of the
villi, the placenta of Cebus 703 shows no very great advance on that of Chrysothrix 648. The villous branches, though varying greatly in size, still tend to be coarse and very
variable in form.
