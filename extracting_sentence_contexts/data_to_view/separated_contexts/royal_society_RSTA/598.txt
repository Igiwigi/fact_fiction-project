148 P. L. WILLMORE ON SEISMIC EXPERIMENTS

(d) Relative amplitudes of P, and P, In spite of the loss of energy in the double refraction, there are several stations at which
P.is more strongly received than P,. This may be due in part to the fact that P, is continually
fed with energy from the P, waves reflected from the surface and therefore tends to grow at
the expense of the latter phase. Moreover, strong reception of P, at a given station depends on conditions being favourable
for refraction at a particular point in the lower layer, whilst it is possible for P, to be formed
from the wave refracted at a point nearer the focus, and reflected in the vicinity of the
station. P, therefore has a double chance of reaching a particular seismograph, and may
therefore be relatively immune from the erratic variations of amplitude which affect other
phases.
