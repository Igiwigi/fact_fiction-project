(1) The science behind forensic evidence. What is the research foundation that sup-
ports forensic science? What is the basis for forensic reasoning and
inference? What statistics or other sources are used to determine perform-
ance data and error rates? Such questions have different answers when
examining different domains of forensic science.

(2) The human element. Since forensic science emerged about 100 years ago,
there has been a systematic neglect in considering the role of the human
examiner in forensic science. This is despite the fact that the human exam-
iner plays a critical role in forensic science. Indeed, in many forensic
domains, it is the human who is the main instrument of analysis. Even in
the domains that rely more on objective quantification and instrumentation,
the human still plays an important role, from the initial stages of sampling,
determining what is noise and what should be used as input, to the final
stages of communicating the results.
