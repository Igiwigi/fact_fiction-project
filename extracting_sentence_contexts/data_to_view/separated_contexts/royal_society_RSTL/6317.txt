We may be justified in concluding that,
the velocity of wavye-propagation (or transit) really does increase with the force of the
original impulse; it would be vain, however, to attempt to deduce the law of swch
Ancrease from the results before us. Q The experiments of Mr. GoLDISGHAM at Madras, on the retardation of sound in moist
Air, and the theoretical researches of Mr. Earxsnaw, both, by analogy, rendered & priori
Sprobable the fact itself, now for the first time, s0 far as I am aware, experimentally
Shown. Â® It follows, then, on reference to my former experiments at Killiney Bay, that the rate
Sf wavye-propagation in highly stratified, contorted and foliated rock is intermediate
:Setween that for dense wet sand and for discontinuous and shattered granite.
