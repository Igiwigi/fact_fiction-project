ON CLIMATE AND TSETSE FLIES 203

The few which died were rejected, and the rest killed at once, weighed and
dried. The control was furnished by flies taken unfed from the cages, on the same
days. The results were inconclusive and need not be tabulated. The mean wet
weights were lower at the two lower humidities than at the higher, and this may well
have been due to greater evaporation, but only one of the differences between wet
weights (that between the control and flies exposed to 11°, humidity) is statistically
significant. We should expect a disturbance in the percentage of dry matter, and,
in fact, it rose from 32-9°% after exposure, at a relative humidity of 88°%,, to 33-0 at
44%, humidity, and 34-0 at 11% humidity. It seems, therefore, that there is
greater evaporation in drier air, and that the increased metabolism of fat is not
sufficiently rapid to compensate for it. But this conclusion cannot be regarded as
proved, for the percentages of dry matter after exposure to different degrees of
humidity are not significantly different from one another, nor from the control.

The preceding pages give a partial explanation of what happens when unfed
Glossina are exposed to atmospheres of different humidity. During a 24 hours’
exposure to 30° C, loss of weight is greater the drier the air ; but the proportion of
water in the insect’s body is maintained nearly constant by using more fat in dry
than in damp air. It is also known that Glossina can survive a higher temperature
in dry than in moist air, for an hour. It must be presumed that the insect does this
