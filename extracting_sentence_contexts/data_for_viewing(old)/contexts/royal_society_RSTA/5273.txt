have taken nkgT = 1 atm = 10Â° Pa as the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid. Although the effective
Dp is likely to be increased by both high density and activity, we expect active diffusion currents
to be negligible compared with passive ones. This is supported by the experiments that are in a
regime where the density is very high and shows little spatial variations. Our numerics are indeed
performed in this regime and show very little variations of the density even at the largest activity.

Special attention should be devoted to the fact that the self-propulsion speed vg depends
linearly on the range R of a defect, this being defined as the defect-free portion of the system
surrounding a defect (and possibly coinciding with the entire system). Although two-dimensional
hydrodynamics is known to be plagued with anomalies, such as the Stokes paradox [50], this
behaviour does not result solely from the two-dimensionality of the problem. Point defects in
three dimensions would also yield a similar behaviour. To see this, we note that the deviatoric part
of the Oseen tensor scales like r2~?, with D the space dimension. On the other hand, the active
force f* =aV - Q always scales such as r~!. The backflow velocity in D dimensions thus scales
like v? ~ se d>r7>-P;-! =R, regardless of the space dimension. In three-dimensions disclinations
are, however, line defects. In this case, denoting by & the persistence length of the disclinations,
ie. the length scale over which these line defects can be treated as straight lines, the length R
controlling the flow velocity induced by a +3 defect would scale as R ~ &4 log(L/a), with L the
system size and a the core radius. These results could also be obtained on the basis of dimensional
