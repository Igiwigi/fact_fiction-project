These conditions, as well as the mode of
distribution of the rubble from many independent centres, accord in all points with
the results that would ensue from the submergence and re-elevation of a land surface
from beneath deep waters after a temporary submergence. : These conclusions, startling though they may appear,* have been forced upon me,
not only by my own observations in the South of England, and parts of the â€”
Continent, but also by the independent evidence of other geologists, though their
interpretation of the facts may be different. Looked at in all its aspects, I see no
alternative that equally well answers to all the conditions of the problem. Other

* Viewed by our own standard the depth of submergence appears excessive, but in dealing with a
body of the volume of the globe and with a surface length of 3000 miles or more, the deflection of the
crust would appear really comparatively slight.
