In the case of c, we have from equation (3.),

f
Faint= ccos0cos87+dsind ;

from the observations at N. to N.E. and N.W. inclusive, and from $S. to S.E. and
S.W. inclusive, eliminating d, we have
e=+:009.

The constant d is perhaps the most difficult of the constants to ascertain satisfac-
torily, as its value derivable from the observations depends on a knowledge of the true
geographical dip at the place of observation, free from what is now known as station
error. Experience has fully shown the general fact, that inclinations observed on land
cannot safely be assumed as free from local disturbance. The discrepancies of gravi-
tation-at the Falkland Islands are well known from the experiments with the pendu-
lam; and from the geological character of these islands, we might be prepared to expect
the existence of magnetic discrepancies also. By the needles in both ships, the incli-
nation was found a third of a degree higher at the magnetic obseryatory on shore
than when observed on board in the harbour; if the obseryatory dip were to be
assumed as an undisturbed one, we should obtain d in both ships considerably less
than unity, whereas from the comparison of the observations in both ships in the
preceding December and January, with the inclination observed at the same time
on the ice over a deep sea, where no local attraction can be imagined to exist, we
have d (as far as the small differences of geographical position will permit us to judge)
differing scarcely, if at all, from unity in either ship. The preference is certainly
