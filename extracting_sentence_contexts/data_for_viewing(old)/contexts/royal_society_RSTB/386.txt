386 MR. BE, B. POULTON ON THE COLOUR-RELATION BETWEEN EXPOSED

In the above Table it is seen that the difference in the position of the gilt chamber
corresponds with a larger difference in pupal colour when the larvae were covered for
part of Stage ILI. than when they were covered for the whole of it. And the difference
is made by the increased darkness of the pups of the former set in tubes with the
gilt chamber above (especially in XIII.), while the pupz in the other tubes of the
same set are as nearly as possible identical with those in similar tubes, but which
had been covered for the whole stage. This is probably due to the fact that the gilt
chamber when below was strongly illuminated, and could produce effects even when
working for something short of the whole stage—although it is very likely that
large numbers of experiments would show that such effects are not so great as when
the influence worked for the whole stage, while the less illuminated upper chamber
failed to have any effect except when working for the whole stage.

If the results obtained were merely those of the last three lines of the complete
total, it would make the conclusion as certain as the conditions of this experiment
and the numbers employed could make it—that the influence does make itself felt
through some anteriorly placed sense-organ situated in the lower chamber, and affected
by its colour alone. Accepting the free larvee as on the whole normal, it is seen that
when the head was in black surroundings the pup are in no instances as light as the
