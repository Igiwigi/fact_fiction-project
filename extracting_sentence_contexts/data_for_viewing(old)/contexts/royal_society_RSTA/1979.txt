Since the present scheme relies on maximum shear stresses 1,z in the UCM base flow, it is not [4

shear rate exhibits a maximum (at shear rates near the inverse of the fluid relaxation time) and 18

instability for all values of a, according to

where (-) represents a time average over one oscillation period. This being the case, the instability
threshold goes to infinity as a â€” 0, in agreement with the fact that normal radial stresses in
the rectilinear flow of the single-mode UCM constitutive equation remain finite at all driving
amplitudes. Shear-thinning seems therefore an essential ingredient for the destabilization of the
rectilinear flow in this framework.

This analysis however does not rule out that the zero-mean oscillatory flow of viscoelastic
fluids with linear rheological constitutive equations may be unstable to infinitesimal
perturbations in the radial or the azimuthal direction, without the need of invoking nonlinear
theological laws. The corresponding linear stability analysis is however cumbersome in the
cylindrical geometry, because the base flow is given in terms of Bessel functions of complex
argument. The facts are that shear thinning of the WLM solutions is non-negligible at the flow
conditions at which instability is observed, so that the Giesekus equation is a better model of
their shear rheology than the UCM equation, and that the predictions of our perturbative analysis
