carbonate monohydrate and gaylussite. One of the important factors was the choice of
suitable additives. Two substances were used, namely magnesium-ion, which from general
crystal chemical experience can be expected to enter to some extent into the structure of
calcium compounds forming substitutional solid solutions, and Calgon, which we know to
be extensively adsorbed on some surfaces and which can lead to crystal habit modification.

In the case of Calgon it was observed that the appearance of metastable phases was
preceded by a reduction in frequency of nucleation with the stable calcite, which was
followed by its complete suppression, and ultimately when the highest concentrations of
Calgon were used growth even on seed was inhibited. In the case of magnesium-ion,
distortion of the stable calcite lattice was observed. Analytical evidence of absorption of
impurities and X-ray evidence of lattice distortion was obtained in the case of some of the
other solid phases also. A consideration of these facts added to general arguments makes
it possible to evolve a hypothesis to account for the observations which were made. The
hypothesis is concerned primarily with nucleus formation.

Although the formation of metastable phases in the way quoted in the experimental
section is probably not unusual, it is common practice, and often indeed most useful, to
forecast the outcome of a proposed reaction in terms of solubility data obtained at equili-
brium. It is important to consider therefore whether it is possible to deduce from equilibrium
conditions whether the formation of metastable phases is to be expected in any given case.
It is concluded below however that for an understanding of processes in which kinetics are
important it is necessary to turn away from the end conditions and look to the beginnings.

Solutions of salts in water are macroscopically homogeneous; but when they are con-
