Bionics and Biomimetics are considered here to be synonyms. The field may be defined as the
‘Study and application of construction principles and systems in living organisms for the design
of sustainable technical solutions’. For a detailed discussion of these terms, we refer to Barthlott
et al. [6], who provide an analysis of the vast literature on the confusing definitions and historic
background of bionics, biomimetics and bioinspiration between science, arts and marketing.


Figure 8. Mimicry and parabionics. (a) The leafhopper Paulinia acuminata feeds exclusively on Salvinia and is hard to detect :8
because of its protective coloration and surface appearance imitating its host plant: camouflage, a form of mimicry. But in : 2
convergent evolution, Paulinia also developed superhydrophobicity by analogous, but chemically different, wax crystals for its :=
life in a semi-aquatic habitat. (b) Package of a fluorized polymer-coated (e.g. ‘Teflon®’) baking pan. The product suggests that : yy
itis bionic and refers to the Lotus Effect® in detail and is named ‘Lotex-everclean’. However, it does not differ from the billions : 5
of other pans in use since the 1960s. We expect the majority of ‘bionic products’ currently on the market are in fact parabionic: 1S
Bionics is purely a marketing tool. Sources: (a) from [17] and (6) photo taken from the package bought in a department store. DS

Biologically inspired design (BID) or bioinspiration means ‘inspired by biology’ and is as old 5S

as mankind: from the biomorphic palaeolithic paintings in the caves of Lascaux, Daedalus and
Icarus, and the Trojan Horse, to the sculpture Queens vagina in the gardens of Versailles of 2015.
The impressive Cadillac tail fins of the 1960s represent a classic example of bioinspired design.
We may call this category biodecoration; it does not claim to be functional. The ambiguous term
