Again, let B be fixed, or the distance of the two edges be constant, we sball get the

equation (a being =A E, b=BE, b=DE and E C=2) y= EXC Vere
also a wholly different curve from the conic hyperbola, which all experiments give. Therefore the conclusion from the whole is that the phenomena have no reference to
interference. Having delivered the doctrines resulting from these experiments, I have some few
particulars to add, both as illustrating and confirming the foregoing propositions, as
removing one or two difficulties which have occurred to others until they were met by
facts, and also as showing the tendency of the results at which we have arrived.

1. It may bave been observed that in all these propositions I have taken for granted
the inflexion of the rays by the body first acting upon them as well as their deflexion
by that body, and have reasoned on that supposition. It is, however, not to be de-
nied that we cannot easily perceive the fringes made by the single inflexion, as we
can without any difficulty perceive those made by the single deflexion, and fully de-
scribed in Proposition I.
