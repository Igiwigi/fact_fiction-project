{MIA AND THE

plete arrest of circulation in an arterio-cortical area would produce destruction of
nervous elements; but some anastomosis might lead to a comparative restoration of
circulation, otherwise to comparative stagnation—to a semi-stagnant patch. Such a.
condition is likely to cause destruction of cells in the central part of the arterial area,
and is one favourable for over-nutrition of an inferior kind of those at its periphery.”

The experiments of Scarrr prove that unilateral convulsions can occasionally be
experimentally discharged by compression of the carotid in man. I have several
times confirmed on myself the fact that compression of one carotid may produce
unilateral clonic spasms.* The spasms are preceded by a march of peculiar tingling
and pricking sensations. These run down the opposite side of the body, and, starting
in the hand, from thence proceed to the arm, and then to the leg. The clonic spasms
are movements of flexion of the fore-arm, and these are accompanied by a feeling of
alarm and vertigo.
