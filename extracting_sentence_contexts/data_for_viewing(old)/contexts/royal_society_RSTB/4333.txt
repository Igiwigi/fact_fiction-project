On the theory that an epidemic ceases because the number of susceptible persons is
exhausted, the course and the severity of the secondary epidemics in the districts —
surrounding the central focus should not be essentially different from that in the
central area itself. On certain occasions, it is true, it might happen that in one or
other of these surrounding districts an independent epidemic of measles might have
recently taken place, and the spread of a new infection thus rendered impossible on
account of the lack of susceptible persons, but, when a series of years is taken, as has
been done in this case, and when the series of years contains at least ten periods of
each epidemic studied, this possibility must be dismissed as not probable on the
average considered. It must be remembered that the kind of disturbance suggested
in the peripheral districts is just as likely to affect the central focus, so that the
effect will be equalised. The facts relating to the epidemic of 87 weeks’ period are
thus wholly in favour of the theory that the power of infection of the causal
organism plays a large part in determining the course of the epidemic. The data
referring to the epidemic of 109} weeks’ period do not offer an equally clear
interpretation, but such evidence as they present is read by me in the same light.

One point of great interest, if it be admitted that the different periodicities are
due to the action of different strains of organisms, refers to the degree of protection
which one strain of organism may afford against another. The facts seem to
indicate that this degree of protection is high, but it is certainly not absolute.
Second infections from measles within the short period of three weeks were far from
uncommon in the wards of the city of Glasgow hospitals set apart for the treatment
of that disease. Further, as the frequency of such second infections varied with
