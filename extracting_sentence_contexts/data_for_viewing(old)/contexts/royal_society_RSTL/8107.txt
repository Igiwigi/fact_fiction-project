Is a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions (1870, p. 289) I have considered
the contact, at a point P, of two curves which are coplanar sections of two surfaces
<(V> V), and have examined somewhat in detail the case where one of the curves, viz.
Qthe section of V, is a conic. In the method there employed, the condition that the
point P $hould be sextactic, involved the azimuth of the plane of section measured
Zabout an axis passing through P; and consequently, regarded as an equation in the
Sazimuth, it <howed that the point would be sextactic for certain definite sections. It
Sdoes not, however, follow, if conics having six-pointic contact with the surface U be
>frawn in the planes 80 determined, that a single quadric surface can be made to pass
Sthrough them all. In fact it will be shown in the sequel that when this is possible, the
-Squadric in general degenerates into a pair of planes. The investigation therefore of the
-Zmemoir above quoted was yot directly concerned with the contact of surfaces, although
Sit may be regarded as dealing with a problem intermediate to the contact of plane
urves and that of surfaces.
'> In the present investigation T have considered a point P common to the two surfaces
ZU and V, an axis drawn arbitrarily through P, and a plane of section passing through
the axis and capable of reyolution about it. Proceeding as in the former memoir, and
Sforming the equations for contact of various degrees, and finally rendering them inde-
Spendent of the azimuth, we obtain the conditions for contact for all positions of the
Secutting plane about the axis. Such contact is called circumaxal ; and in particular it,
1s called uniaxal, biaxal, &c. according as it subsists for one, two, &c. axes. If it holds
good for all axes through the point, it is called superficial contact.
