and the expression (1), and consequently also (2) satisfies the differential equation

a een grr

or, as I shall write it, Dy = 0. When the motion is rotational, (3) no longer holds. In fact, as is well known, we
have under all circumstances

x Dy = — 20,
where @ is the resultant spin at the point (a, 2). Thus, if there is spin in the fluid, (3) is replaced by

oe ete. (80).
