Professor MiLXE-EpwaDs, in his © Legons sur la Physiologie et Anatomie compare,”
vol. iv. (Paris 1859) p. 476, correctly views the pulsating organ in the eel's tail as a
lymphatic heart, but adduces no facts, either anatomical or physiological, to prove that
the organ is of this nature. Te merely refers to Professor MULLER as having recognized
the organ to be a lymphatic heart.

of this organ is to propel the lymph of the tail into the end of the caudal vein.” But a
reference to the quotations, also above given, from Professor MULLER's paper in the Phi-
losophical Transactions for 1833, and his paper in the * Archiv * for 1842, p. 477, as well
as from his *Elements of Physiology, by BALY, 2nd edition, 1839, pp. 216 and 245
Shows that Professor MiLLER did not in these more recent writings dissent from Di. Manznarr TA in the opinion he entertained that the * caudal heart ” in the eel belongs
to the blood-yascular system. So far as T have been able to ascertain, no one has hitherto given a correct explanation
of the phenomenon of small drops of red blood propelled in rapid succession, as if from
the caudal heart, along the caudal yein.
