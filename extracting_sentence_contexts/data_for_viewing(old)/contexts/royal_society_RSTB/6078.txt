cyst and uterus. Then, in the second place, the originally single-layered ecto-placental
trophoblast, practically immediately it has destroyed the hypertrophied and thickened
uterine epithelium (which, judging from Hapale, appears to be the first reaction to the
primary attachment) proceeds to thicken and to give off cells on its outer side. These
run together to form a syncytial layer, which is capable of invading and destroying the
maternal endometrial or decidual tissue, with which it comes into contact. In other
words, the trophoblast undergoes differentiation into a basal, cellular layer, the cyto-
trophoblast, and a superficial syncytial layer, the syncytiotrophoblast. And the
important point is that here the cytotrophoblast retains its individuality for a longer
or shorter time during the development of the placenta, longer in the Catarrhines than

* In his paper on the placentation of the Primates, WisLockt (’29) has provided two most useful tables
in which are collected the known facts relating to the form of the placenta in the higher members of the
Order, to which the reader is referred for further details.

{ Wistocxi (’26), I find, has also reached much the same conclusion. He writes (p. 479), “ the
placental arrangements of catarrhines and platyrrhines derive from a common stem characterised by a
labyrinthine placenta, with the existing platyrrhines less removed from that stem.”
