This, however, would leave the
anomalous § value unaccounted for. 14 SIR WILLIAM HARDY ON PROBLEMS OF THE BOUNDARY STATE. The fact that the sign of the effect of the number of carbon atoms in the chain is
different for T and N shows that the difference between them does not consist merely in
an extinction of the forces of repulsion. It might indeed be taken to mean that the
portion of the molecular field involved is different. This would explain why the sign is
the same for the viscosity _ of a fluid in mass as it is for the normal reaction, because
during flow, owing to the heat motions, the molecules must be presented in every spatial
way to the shearing stress.
