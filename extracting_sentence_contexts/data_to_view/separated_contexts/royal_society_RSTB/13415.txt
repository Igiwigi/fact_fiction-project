Cry/whimper rates based on the laboratory counts
should, however, be interpreted in light of the fact that the recordings were sometimes interrupted to soothe a crying or fussing infant. The high rate of cry/
whimper during the No Adult Talk circumstance at zero months appears to have been the result of infant distress at being left nearby but unattended, which
resulted in either the parent deciding to hold the infant during No Adult Talk or interruption of the recording to calm the infant. (c) Protophone rates were
higher in the laboratory than in the all-day recordings though they tended to fall across the first year. Note that Parent Infant Talk did not correspond to notably
higher rates of protophones than in the other circumstances, a fact we interpret as corresponding to the largely endogenous nature of protophone production. Means
and standard errors for figure 2 were computed at the infant level.
