As can readily be verified, the hydrogenic formulae given above can be applied im-
mediately to complex atoms if simple product-type wave functions are employed. Thus the
contribution from each electron in a subshell can be obtained by using its initial and final
wave functions for y, and y,, in (26), the other electrons being ignored; and the full cross-
section can then be found by summing the contributions from all the equivalent electrons.

Exact wave functions for complex atoms cannot be derived, and the necessity of employing
approximations such as those of Slater (1932), Hartree (1946~7) or Fock (1930) introduces
uncertainties distinct from those inherent in the Born treatment.

If y, and y, (in (26)) overlap considerably and are not too crudely represented, the
additional error will in general be relatively unimportant. In some cases it may be worth
taking advantage of the fact that by making use of the equations satisfied by the y’s the
original formula may be transformed to

Iyg( Ky hy) AK = Fy | [exp (—iKe2) {yy () “PEED — yg (xy HO)

3 } | xe Ey (0)t

} This transformation is closely analogous to that introduced by Chandrasekhar (1945) in his work on
the calculation of the cross-section associated with photo-detachment from H™.
