Our numerics show that the solutions from the proposition 6.1 are related to the delay-
induced switched states in (1.1) and (1.2). Figure 4 displays the solution to (6.1) and (6.2)
for two example functions f and suitable initial conditions. Figure 4a shows a period-1
solution that switches between two distinct sets of values with opposite sign, along which it
changes regularly. In fact, it changes exponentially with a small rate, and proposition 6.1(iii)
determines this rate to be n/(f’(x()) — 1). We remark that for small values of 7, this trend can be
approximated as

x(E+ At) =x(elt  /FCO-Dds ~ x(t) + O(N AN),

so that along such regular ‘plateaus’ it appears to be linear in n. Here, we assumed that
f'(x(t)) — lis uniformly bounded away from zero. In figure 4a, the parameters are chosen such that
f'(x(£)) < 1 along the solution. If this condition is not met for some values of x, the corresponding
period-1 solution is unstable, and the numerically computed solution appears irregular for those
values; see figure 4b and compare proposition 6.1(iii). This qualitatively resembles delay-induced
switched states with incoherent part in (1.1) and (1.2), although the solution is more erratic than
for positive ¢; compare figure 1. We attribute this to the ‘smoothing’ effect of the term ex’ in (1.1)
