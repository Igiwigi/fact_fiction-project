attention.

38. I have now put together all the principal materials which I have procured for
determining the course of the tides of the Pacific. But it is apparent from what has
been aid, that the materials are insufficient to give us any complete or consistent
view of the tidal movements of the waters of that ocean and the neighbouring seas.

39. I may observe, moreover, that there appears to be little chance that our know-
ledge of these tides will ever be much increased by observations made in voyages
principally directed to other objects. Although, in the surveying and exploring
voyages since Captain Kixc's, many tide observations on the coasts and at the isJands
of the Pacific have been made, and many of them with care and skill, we bave
scarcely any material fact added to onr knowledge; and the cotidal lines for the
shores of America, New Zealand and Australia, as I drew them in 1833, remain with
scarcely any alteration. Cook's observations at New Zealand, for instance, are for
this purpose, better than any since made, because they are connected (being made hy
the same navigator and in close succession) and extend along a continuous shore.
It is only by observations thus connected and having some degree of geographical
continuity, that we can hope to trace the course of the tides.


22 THE REV. W. WHEWELL ON THE TIDES OF THE PACIFIC,

I add a very slight and imperfect sketch of the cotidal lines of the Pacific as they
result from the materials just examined. (See the Plate.)
