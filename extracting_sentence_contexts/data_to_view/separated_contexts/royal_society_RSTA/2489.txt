There are many ATPs for an interested mathematician to choose from. The most popular ones
include PROVER9 [6], E [7], WALDMEISTER [8] and VAMPIRE [9]. Most of my own experience has
been with PROVER9 and in fact, only it and E have the necessary infrastructure to implement
the proof simplification techniques I will describe later. Another advantage of PROVER9 for
mathematicians is that its learning curve is less steep and unlike the others, its input language
is easily readable by humans. ATPs search for proofs by generating and processing inferences much faster than humans can.
