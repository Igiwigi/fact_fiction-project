On
Zthe arrival of this specimen in a keg of arrack, I prosecuted as complete an examination
as the condition of the parts would permit, and made the preparations (Nos. 3558 0. and
$3558 D.), which are now in the Physiological Series of that Museum. The results of this
examination were orally communicated in the Theatre of the College, in the 17th Lec-
Sture of my Course © On the Generation and Development of the Vertebrate Animals,”
delivered in 1850+; and were illustrated by diagrammatic views of the chief peculiarities
"==which the parts presented. Circumstances prevented further publication of the facts at
that time; but I am now able to submit the following description of the foetal mem-
Sbranes and placenta of the Elephant to the Royal Society. S The chorion of the Elephant (Plate XVI. fig. 1, a, a, 4), at about the middle of
=the period of utero-gestation, forms a transversely oblong sac, 2 feet 6 inches in long
Sdiameter, and 1 foot 4 inches in short diameter, encompassed at its middle part by an
annular placenta (6, 6), 2 feet 6 inches in circumference, varying from 3 to 5 inches in
breadth, and from 1 to 2 inches in thickness. This placenta is partially divided by
opposite constrictions into two moieties, one measuring 12 inches, the other 10 inches
in length, and the extreme breadth being 5 inches in each ; the connecting isthmus is
3 inches in breadth.
