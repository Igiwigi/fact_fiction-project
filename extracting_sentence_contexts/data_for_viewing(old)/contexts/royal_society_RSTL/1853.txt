the component parts of the brain.

These observations are registered in the Philosophical
Transactions, and the communications have been of so recent
a date, as not to require that I should do more in this place
than refer to them.

In the present Lecture, it is intended to pursue till farther
the anatomy of the human brain, and to compare it with that
of fishes, insects and worms ; in the hope that by the esta-
blishment of such a series of facts, we may throw light on the
connection between the action of the nerves and the motion
of the muscles.

The following circumstances explain the difficulties that
are met with in the examination of the structure of the hu-
man brain.

The transparent elastic matter readily dissolves in water,
and when in solution the globules become one confused mass,

The cortical substance containing serum, when it coagulates,
is different in density from the medullary structure, and rea-
