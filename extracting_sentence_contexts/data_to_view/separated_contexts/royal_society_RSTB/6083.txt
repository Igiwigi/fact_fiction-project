In
Calliphora about half the petrol-ether extract is used during the life of the puparium. NerEpuAm (1929) points out that changes in the intensity of the respiratory exchange
of insect pupz indicate two periods of increased metabolic activity with a less active
intermediate period. In Glossina we find no evidence of the first of these periods,
but the insect may have passed through that stage during larval life, for Evans
(1932) emphasizes the fact that in the blow-fly, Lucilia sericata, the prepupa is
“morphologically similar to the larval stage but physiologically belonging to the
pupal stage.” The second period of increased activity accounts for the loss of dry
weight in the last part of pupal life, fat being used to meet the needs of the developing
adult. Taste XXII—Showing the mean and percentage weights of puparia of Glossina
tachinoides kept at 24°C at two humidities and killed, some on the 15th and
others on the 30th day. The composition is shown as dry matter, including
ether-soluble “ fat,” and water.
