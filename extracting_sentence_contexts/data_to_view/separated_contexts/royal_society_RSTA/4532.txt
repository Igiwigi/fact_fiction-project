anoxic soil C changes is that plant inputs account for a large fraction of the substrate fuelling CH4
emissions [32]; because we include these plant fluxes as inputs to the decomposition model, most
of which turn over quickly, they constitute a large fraction of the respiration flux. Instead of using
the CH, production rates from anoxic incubations as the basis for calculating CH4 emissions due
to the differences between methane production and flux and the fact that incubations exclude the
plant C inputs, we can use top-down estimates of current CHy fluxes [33] as the absolute flux
against which the proportional change in CH4 emissions is applied. Finally, we use the resulting
absolute changes in CH4 from the top-down approach to compare the CO2:CHy flux ratios
inferred for anoxic soils in the scaling approach to incubation CO} : CH, ratios as an independent
though imperfectly corresponding constraint on the validity of the approach. Note that this approach for calculating CH, emissions differs from the more typical method of
multiplying CHy flux density and wetland extent (e.g. [31,34]).
