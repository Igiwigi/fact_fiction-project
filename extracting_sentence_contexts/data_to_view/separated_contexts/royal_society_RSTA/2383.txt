In obtaining his result Lord Rayierau assumes that, if there are no bounding planes,
w = 0 at infinity ;{ it does not apply therefore to the case just considered. The conclusion arrived at is that the discrepancy between RAy. LerGcH’s and
Reynotps’ results is due to the fact that the perfect slipping at the boundaries
assumed in Ray1ercH’s work prevents the escape of the momentum which is a
necessary accompaniment of a disturbance of a fluid for which d?U/dz is everywhere
negative. The complete absence of slipping assumed in Reynoups’ work enables
the necessary amount of momentum to escape, and so a type of disturbance may be
produced which is dynamically impossible under the condition of perfect slipping at
the boundaries. * See “Conditions Necessary for Discontinuous Motion in Gases,” Taytor, ‘Roy.
