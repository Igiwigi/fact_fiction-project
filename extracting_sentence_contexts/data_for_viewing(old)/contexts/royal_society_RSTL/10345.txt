established, experiment shows that there are two possible ways which essentially
depend upon the configuration of the cell.

In 8nch exceptional cases as Strychnos, Tamus (Plate 70, fig. 33), and Droscorea,
where the walls are extremely thick, and, at the same time, devoid of pits, the com-
municating protoplasmic threads run through the cell-wall. A section of snch an
endosperm exhibits the threads, which are seen freely perforating the wall, except at
the corners of the cell, at the point where the junction of several cells occurs.

The usual mode of union, however, is by means of pits. As T have mentioned
elsewhere, the presence of pits in the cell-wall, due to unequal thickening, is of almosb
universal occurrence, and it is through the closing membranes of such pits that the
protoplasmic threads run. This, in fact, appears to be by far the most common and

typical way in which the continuity of the protoplasm of adjacent cells is bronght
about,

In other, and perhaps less frequent cases, examples of both modes of connexion
occur; the communication taking place not only through the pits, but through the
