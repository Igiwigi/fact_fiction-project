The slightest touch applied to one of the spines of the hedgehog immediately
rouses it to draw that deep inspiration of which I have spoken. The merest
shake induces a few respirations in the bat. The least disturbance, in fact, is
felt, as is obvious from its effect in inducing motion in the animal. It is from the misconception on this point that the error has arisen, that the
respiration is not absolutely suspended in hybernation. This function has been
80 readily excited, through the medium of an unimpaired sensibility, that the
event has been considered as appertaining to the state of hybernation.
