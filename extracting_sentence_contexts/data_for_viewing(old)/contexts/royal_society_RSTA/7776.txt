we reach the edge of the optical shadow represented by the tangent plane to the
earth at 7, but only when we reach the tangent plane to the sphere of radius | 7, | at
a height h, above T. Points on this plane correspond to ¢ = | «|, i.e. to ¢— |a| =0,
and therefore to zero attenuation.

As we should expect, 4, increases with A. This implies that on long waves, where the
attenuation is much less than for short waves, the gain for a given height is less. This is
found to follow from the more detailed analysis for points below | r,|. Physically this
corresponds to the fact that the edge of the diffraction shadow gets more ill defined as
the wave-length increases.

The above argument provides a limit to the practical application of the height-gain
analysis. From (5:14) we see that /, is proportional to | p |, and therefore increases for
the higher terms of the diffraction formula. For points beyond the tangent plane
corresponding to the first term, the higher terms would have to be taken into account.
Actually for points well out in space, the vectorial addition of all the terms obtained by
the complete analysis should reduce to the simple inverse distance law. Although
the analysis which follows has a formal generality, the application of the height-gain
theory is confined to the ultra-short waves, for which the results are of great practical
importance in the region below the tangent plane, where they can be represented
adequately by the first term of the diffraction theory.
