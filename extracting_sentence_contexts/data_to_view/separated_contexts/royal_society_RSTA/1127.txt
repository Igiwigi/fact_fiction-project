The problem of the tooth is actually a three-dimensional problem, but as the analogous
two-dimensional problem presents some interesting and simple features, it receives
attention in Part II (§§8-11). The determination of the pressure in the membrane
in terms of the displacement of the tooth is reduced to quadratures in (71) and the
displacement of the tooth is connected with the applied force-system in (80). In $9
the positions of the points of maximum and minimum pressure are investigated, and it is
found that these points are in general arranged ona circle, having for centre the centre of
rotation of the tooth, and for radius the radius of gyration of a fictitious wire, coincident
with the longitudinal section of the root, with a linear density equal to the inverse
cube of the thickness of the membrane. The results are applied, in § 11, to a wedge-
shaped model of the upper central tooth. It is found that the centre of rotation lies
near the middle point of the root, on the side away from the apex (see (89)).
