XIV. Observations on the Analogy which subsists between the
Calculus of Functions and other branches of Analysis. By
Charles Babbage, Esq. M. A. F.R.S.

Read April 17, 1817.

I is my intention in the following Paper to offer to the
Royal Society some remarks on the utility of analogical rea-
soning in mathematical subjects, and to illustrate them by
some striking facts which have occurred to me, when com-
paring the calculus of functions with other modes of calcula-
tion with which mathematicians have been long acquainted.
The employment of such an instrument may, perhaps, create
surprise in those who have been accustomed to view this sci-
ence as one which is founded on the most perfect demonstra-
tion, and it may be imagined that the vagueness and errors
which analogy, when unskilfully employed, has sometimes
introduced into other sciences, would be transferred to this.

It is, however, only as a guide to point out the road to
discovery, that analogy should be used, and for this purpose
it is admirably adapted.
