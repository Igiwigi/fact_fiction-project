the apparent continuation of this inference, that what is true of the young is 80 also
of the old. In relation to the history of the solid elements of the chylaqueous fluid
in the Annelids, another fact of equal value and significance with the former may
here be mentioned. For some time before the death of the old worm, whether the
death take place by fission of the body into fragments, or by general decay and
decomposition, the corpuscles of the chylaqueous fluid go on gradually disappearing. The ova and sperm-cells accumulated in the fluid of the visceral cavity during the
eason of reproduction, also supersede, to a great extent, the proper corpuscles of
this fluid.
