Previous studies modelling national or sub-national yields in our study may be partly due to a lower or more hetero-

variance. Lobell & Field [45] explained about 30% of between irrigated and rain-fed crops in our data from available
year-to-year variations at the global scale (results without statistics despite the fact that most of the European irrigated
cross-validation), similarly Ray et al. [46] showed that areas are located in Southern Europe [48]. The shorter yield
about one-third of the variability in yields was explained by time series and the lower number of districts included in our
climate variation worldwide (results obtained without cross- study for Southern Europe (only 10% of the total number of

validation). Using mean values and extremes events, Vogel yields data in our database) may also explain the reduced RF
