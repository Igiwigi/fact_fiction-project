The existence in the sporangial wall of a black, carbonised, outer layer
(probably representing a thick-walled epidermis) and of a thin, brown, translucent
layer (representing a persistent tapetum) is demonstrated. These layers appear com-
parable to those shown in the sporangia of Rhynia.

(5) Spores have been demonstrated within a number of sporangia. They range in
size from 100 » to 60 », have smooth yellow or brown walls, and a small apical region.

(6) The bearings of these facts are indicated and briefly discussed. BIBLIOGRAPHY. Dawson, J.
