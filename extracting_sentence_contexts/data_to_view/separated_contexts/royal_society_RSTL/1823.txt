The goldfinch, were he now
to open his full song upon us, would be as appalling as the
tones of the owl in the midst of a fine summer's day,

Mr. Joun HunTes, my late valued friend, and honoured
preceptor, under whose roof I first caught a gleam of that
light which s0 successfully conducted him through the ob-
scure paths of nature, first demonstrated the different sizes
of the testes of birds at different seasons of the year. On a
farther investigation of this subject, a fact presented itself to
me, which may not be unworthy of the attention of this
Society, and, as it is in some measure connected with the
preceding observations, I have taken the liberty of annexing it. In those birds that remain but a short time paired with the
female, there appears a vast disproportion in the size of the
testes, compared with those that live in the connubial state
much longer. The cuckoo and the swift point out the fact
most obviously.
