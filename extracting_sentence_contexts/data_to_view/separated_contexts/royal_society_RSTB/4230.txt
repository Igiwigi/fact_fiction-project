Loxp’s dictum that bases are efficient in the proportion in which they enter the cell
is, therefore, opposed to experiment. As far as Tam aware Prof. Lozs has not advanced any other explanation beyond
that quoted above. ‘The theory advanced in this paper does, however, give a
consistent and practical explanation of all these facts. Free alkali increases the
permeability of the egg surface or membrane to other electrolytes, and its action is
antagonised by acid or by bivalent metals in exactly the same way as an artificial
membrane is affected by these substances (see Grrarp, Perrin, and MIngs). APPENDIX ILI.
