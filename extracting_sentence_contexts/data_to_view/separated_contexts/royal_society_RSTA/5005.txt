Ferro-manganese yielded a very fine spectrum after an exposure varying from 15
to 30 minutes, better in fact than any compound of that substance. It may thus be
generally stated that manganese alloys containing iron yield a more distinctive
spectrum of manganese than any compound containing the same proportion of that
element. (See the upper spectra on Plate 14.)
