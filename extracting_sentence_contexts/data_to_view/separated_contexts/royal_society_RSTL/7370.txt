Distribution of the external and internal fibres at the apex and fundus, —The various
directions pursued by the external and internal fibres on the walls of the bladder
generally are readily made out at the apex and fundus, both from without and from

within. In fact if a cylinder composed of external and interial longitudinal 8lightly
oblique, oblique, and very oblique fibres be constricted at either end, the general scheme
of the arrangement of the fibres at the summit and base is at once apparent. , The
longitudinal or vertical fibres, particularly the external ones, bend over and unite, to
form a crucial arrangement, the anterior joining with the posterior and the lateral with
each other (Plate IV. fig. 16,0, kl; fig. 18, bp, mn). The slightly oblique and
oblique fibres in like manner bend over and unite, those because of their obliquity
occasioning a tellate arrangement, which causes at the apex a corresponding thickening
of the wall (Plate IV. figs. 13 & 15, #), and at the cervix a thickening and funnel-shaped
puckering, which largely contributes to the closure of the urethral orifice (Plate IV. figs.
14 & 17, 2, »). The very oblique fibres, because of the greater size of the loops formed
by their junction, furnish what are known as the circular fibres, and are continued on
the body of the viseus generally (Plate LV. figs. 13, 15, & 16, &1, and figs. 14, 17 & 18,
mn).
