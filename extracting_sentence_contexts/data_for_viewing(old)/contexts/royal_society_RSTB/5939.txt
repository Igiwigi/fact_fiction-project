experiment not yet mentioned, No. 26, in which bracts arose on both sides of the wound.
It can be seen from the table that the imperfect leaves all covered arcs that were larger
than those of the bracts, though less large than those of normal leaves. For their arcs
ranged from 88° to 115°, whereas those of the bracts ranged from 60° to 82°. It can also
be seen that the imperfect leaves extended to distances of from 12° to 35° beyond the
presumptive primary area of I, (the mean being 24°-4), whereas the bracts only extended
to distances from 2° to 12° beyond that area, the mean being 6°-1.

In the light of these observations, the following explanation is suggested for the fact
that the imperfect leaves were all kathodic, and the bracts all but one anodic. It is
suggested that in the experiments in which J,a bracts arose, I,, which lies nearer to the
anodic side of the wound than to the kathodic, may have prevented I,a from extending
more than a few degrees beyond the presumptive area of J,. Thus I,a may have been
restricted to so small a space that it was unable to form even an imperfect leaf and
developed into a bract, which, as the measurements show, needs less room for its forma-
tion. It may indeed be objected that since I, arose at a higher level than the I,a bracts,
it could not have set a limit to their extension. But on the other hand it is possible
that even when I, arose at a higher level than I,a, it may have been determined before
the time at which the presumptive area of I, (already partially determined) had been
completely reorganized so as to form J,a: for the formation of a new leaf may take a
longer time than the formation, by reorganization, of a bract.
