And generally, any invariant whatever of a quantic or quantics of a given order or
Arders leads to a covariant of a quantic or quantics of any higher order or orders: Viz.
the coefficients of the original quantic or quantics are to be replaced by the derived
functions of the quantic or quantics of a higher order or orders.

71. The same thing may be seen by means of the theory of Fmanants. In fact, con-
sder any emanants whatever of a quantic or quantics; then, attending only to the
facients of emanation, the emanants will constitute a system of quantics the coefficients
of which are derived functions of the given quantic or quantics; the invariants of the
System of emanants will be functions of the derived functions of the given quantic or
quantics, and they will be covariants of such quantic or quantics; and we thus pass
from the invariants of a quantic or quantics to the covariants of a quantic or quantics

' of a higher order or orders.
