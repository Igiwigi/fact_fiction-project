characterized as those which preserve I*’. And, very importantly, expressions which make no :

On translating the standard relations of first quantization, helicity becomes an operator, DN
which is none other than the Euler homogeneity operator. For a more precise statement, see [5
Penrose [4], which also discusses a number of further topics in the foundations of twistor :8
theory. This identification of helicity can be implemented concretely by means of Penrose’s ,
contour integral formula, which gives the zero-mass field of helicity 1 corresponding to a twistor
function of homogeneity (—n — 2)—or more properly, an element of a first cohomology group. The
chirality of twistor space means that fields of opposite helicity are represented by quite different
homogeneities, and there is no natural way of adding them, as one might wish to do to express
a real Maxwell field. Another striking fact is that the property of being of positive (or negative)
frequency can be expressed in terms of the geometry of the two halves of twistor space, without
any reference to momenta. For such fields, there is an inner product structure, which can be
realized in twistor space as a (many-dimensional) compact contour integral, without reference
to space-time coordinates. As such, it is manifestly finite and conformally invariant. Moreover, in
the particularly important case of spin 1, it is manifestly gauge invariant.

This extraordinarily simple inner product structure can be considered as corresponding to zeroth-
order interactions, i.e. no interaction at all. Penrose proposed [5] that an extension of such
many-dimensional contour integration should supply a natural representation of the interactions
of fundamental fields. This proposal was made within standard perturbation theory and was
