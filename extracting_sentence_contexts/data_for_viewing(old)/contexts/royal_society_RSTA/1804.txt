with Ma et al. [34] who investigated literature data of OC-Fer and suggest that OC-Fer contents
in marine surface sediments are highly dependent on OC and Fer availability. Moreover, our
data show no clear spatial relation between sea ice cover and OC-Fer content. Stations B6, B7 and
B11 were affected by winter sea ice at least for the past 40 years (figure 1) [2]. But compared to
B11, OC-Fer concentrations at B6 and B7 are very low. B13 is not affected by sea ice but OC-Fer
concentrations are high (figure 6e). This implies that sea ice cover has no direct impact on the
preservation of OC through Fer sorption.

In contrast to OC-Fer, the spatial distribution of the OC fraction of the total sedimentary OC
pool bound to Fer (fOC-Fer) (figure 6f) shows no relationship to either TOC or Fer contents
and, therefore, does not show a spatial south-north gradient. Also, an association to sea ice
cover, proximity to land, grain size distribution or sediment composition were not identified
either. In fact, the fraction of OC bound to Fer in the southern Barents Sea is very similar
to that in the northern Barents Sea region (figure 6f), even though sample locations are very
different in terms of their environmental settings, sediment sources, OC and Fer contents (see
discussion above). Thus, a relatively high fraction of OC can be bound to Fer even if absolute
Fer contents are relatively low. This suggests that the amount of OC bound to reactive iron is
