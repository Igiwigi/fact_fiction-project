In what manner does the influence of this
mixture effect our results ? F
Let a group N consist of n, + n, + 7; -+ ” pairs of individuals. Of these, in the
ease of m, pairs, both individuals have the true value of the character under investi-
ation recorded ; in the case of n. pairs, neither have the true value recorded ; in the
Ease of n; pairs, it is the first individual of the pair which has a true recorded value,
Sand the second an apparent or fictitious value; lastly, in , cases, let the fictitious
value be in the first and the real value in the second individual of the pair. Then
gihere will be no correlation between individuals in the groups 7, 23, 7%. Let r be
vthe correlation in the group m and R that observed in the whole group of
<N = =n+n+n, +7, Let « be the measure of a character in the first, 2’ in the
Second individual.
