hour (= 6000 calories) by the respiration, i.e, three times the amount of heat
normally produced. I conclude that this power to lose heat is absent in Monotremes and little evident
in Marsupials, which no doubt accounts in large measure for the fact that when
heated in the chamber they so readily suffered from heat apoplexy, as their range of
adaptation is thereby curtailed. If the body-temperature rises to 35° in Platypus and 37° in Echidna they very
soon die, showing that the maximum consistent with life is lower than is the case
with the higher animals. In this respect I may mention an observation of CHAPMAN’s*
that the muscle of Echidna, which retains its vitality after excision much as reptilian
or amphibian muscle, lost its irritability immediately after its temperature was raised
to 35° C,
