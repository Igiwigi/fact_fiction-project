The Otter in its wild state breeds only in the winter, according to BeLt (1874), but in captivity the
female comes in season very regularly once a month all the year round in the absence of the male (Cocks,
1881). Mr. Cocks’ subsequent experience, concerning which he has been good enough to give us
information, confirms the fact that there is no ancestrous period, about which there previously appeared to
be some doubt. In the wild state, according to Cocks, “it may be asserted with some confidence that
while the young are born during any month of the year, yet that more litters are born between October
and February, both inclusive, than during the remaining seven months.” Mr. Cocks adds that he has no
doubt that the Otter only breeds once in about a twelvemonth.} SouTHWELL (1888), states his belief that
the Otter in the wild state, as a general rule only breeds in winter, but that it occasionally breeds also at
other times.
