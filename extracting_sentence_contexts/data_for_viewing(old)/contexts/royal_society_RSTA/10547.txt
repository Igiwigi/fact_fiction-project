4RR = }(C — R)(C— R) + CR—40C = 4DD + CR 4CC.

We require to evaluate # to the fourth order; now d is at least of the second
order and d? of the fourth order; hence d?. 8? is at least of the fifth order and
negligible.

Hence, finally, to the required degree of approximation

E=1JJ—JR+ CR —}3CC + $DD + $(A; — 4,) 80° — 5 Md’o*. . (3).
Tt will appear below that d is not even of the second order, so that the last term

will, in fact, entirely disappear, although we cannot see at the present stage that this
will be so.
