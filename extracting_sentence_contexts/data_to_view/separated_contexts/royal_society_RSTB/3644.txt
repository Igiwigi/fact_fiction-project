Their nuclei lie near the middle of the thickness of the retina. In
Sphenodon the supporting cells are most conspicuous in the outer part of the retina,
where their nuclei are also situated. More important is the fact that in the lamprey
the so-called pigment undoubtedly lies in the supporting cells, which are consequently
often called pigment-cells. The pigment, however, cannot be compared with that in

the pineal eye of Sphenodon, for, as is well known, it is white and consists probably
of phosphate of lime. Another peculiarity of the pigment-cells (in Geotria) is that
their inner ends project as rounded knobs into the cavity of the eye.
