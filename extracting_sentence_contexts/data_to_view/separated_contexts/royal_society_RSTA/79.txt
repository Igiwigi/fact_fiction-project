'= g,(c), etc., we find from (50) after
some reduction

#0) =20-o e+e’ aay. (51)

This expression in fact gives, over the aerofoil and to the left of it within the Mach cone, the
‘reflected’ wave corresponding to the wave g,(7) coming from the edge Oz’. The complete
solution can then be written, for points on the aerofoil surface

6Z r
=F [1+ 3 (—1Lelo) +40(0)]},
os
where 1 denotes the plane wave, and successive g,’s are to be derived from the recurrence

relation (51).
