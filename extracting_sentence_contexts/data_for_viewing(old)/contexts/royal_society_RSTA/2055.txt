soft and easy to handle hydrogels, the elasticity of which can be controlled in a wide range by :8

varying the alginate concentration in the pregel solution. Even more, when the particles were
functionalized by adsorption of alginate molecules onto the particle surface, the solid particles
occupied the knots of the internal network, so avoiding the settling of the particles inside the gel.
Simultaneously, this particle-polymer networking reinforced the mechanical response of the gel
under the action of mechanical stresses.

The magnetic particles embedded in the hydrogels prepared in this work were composites
of bentonite platelets on which magnetite nanoparticles were synthetized by a coprecipitation
reaction. These composite particles were functionalized by adsorption of alginate molecules and
the resulting particles had low density and, consequently, negligible settling rate inside the pregel
solution. This fact allowed homogeneous ferrogels with a high enough MRE to be obtained.
Nevertheless, the intensity of that MR effect strongly depended on the concentration of sodium
alginate employed for the preparation of the pregel solution, being the optimal concentration
0.5% w/v.

The comparison of the ferrogels based on magnetic particles with different shapes and the
same alginate concentration—normalizing other quantities as particle concentration, applied field
and magnetization—demonstrated that the more intense MR effect was achieved with fibre-like
particles. The MR effect attained for spherical and plate-like particle ferrogels were of same order
of magnitude, possibly because some stacked clay clusters remained, in spite of the electro-
steric stabilization imparted by the adsorbed alginate molecules. However, the use of magnetic
composites based on clay minerals has the advantage, in comparison with spherical particles
of pure magnetite or iron, of avoiding the settling of the particles inside the pregel suspension,
