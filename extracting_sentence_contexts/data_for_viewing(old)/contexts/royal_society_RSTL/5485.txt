outlines of the indicator-diagram from A to D, and from B to C, are portions of a
pair of curves of equal transmission (determined as in Proposition IV.) ; for then, if
the operation of the regenerator is perfect, the changes from B to C and from D to A
will be effected without expenditure of heat ; the heat transmitted from the working
snbstance to a given stratum of the regenerator, during any part such as bc, of the
operation BC, being exactly sufficient for the corresponding part, da, of the operation

3 d.F
DA. In this case 70 for each value of Q between Q, and Q,, has the same value at

either side of the diagram.

In fact, the effect of a perfect regenerator is, to confer upon any pair of curves of
equal transmission the properties of a pair of curves of no transmMiss0n.

(29.) ProposITION NI, â€”Tnroke. The greatest efficiency of a thermo-dynamic en-
gine, working between given limits of actual heat, with a perfect regenerator, is equal
to the greatest efficiency of a thermo-dynamic engine, working between the same limits
of actual heat, without a regenerator.

(Demonstration.) In fig. 18, let Q,Q,, Q,Q, be the isothermal curves denoting the
given limits of actual heat. Let AD, BC be a pair of curyes of equal transmission
of any form. Then by the aid of a perfect regenerator, the whole of the heat given
out by the elastic substance during the operation BC may be stored up, and given
