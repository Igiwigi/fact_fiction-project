However, the final four
are innovative and take the UK into entirely new directions. Perhaps the most bold and creative idea for a Phase II beamline is encapsulated in the surface
and interface analysis beamline, 109, where it was proposed to let both hard and soft X-rays
impinge at the same point on a sample. This has involved building hard and soft X-ray beamlines
side by sideâ€”in fact, they are intertwined so that, when fully optimized, there will be three
endstations: one soft, one hard and one combined. The combined energy endstation is complete
and already producing spectacular results. The concept of the 109 beamline is already being copied
at other facilities.
