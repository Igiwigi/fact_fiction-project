In this paper, we apply the methods described above (in particular, a morphoelastic theory
of growing rods) to study growing plant shoots. These are slender elastic (biological) structures
where growth phenomena are self-evident. Well before they grow tall enough to become prone to
buckling under their own weight (Euler buckling), they exhibit spontaneous oscillations referred
to as circumnutations in the plant science community. These movements are too slow to be
detected by a casual observer, but they become apparent through time-lapse photography. They
have fascinated scientists since the pioneering work of C. Darwin [20]. Recently, they have
received new attention in the context of the design and optimal actuation of novel bioinspired
robotic devices [21,22], and they are still the object of study and debate [23-27].

Among the possible explanations, one is that these movements arise as an overcompensatory
response to perturbations due to the (slow) bio-chemo-mechanical machinery the plant uses
to control its vertical posture. In fact, nutations in growing plant shoots may be described as
spontaneous oscillations caused by a flutter-like instability (a Hopf-type bifurcation) in a growing
elastic system subject to gravity loading while sensing and actively responding to external
stimuli. We have discussed the merits of this hypothesis in previous studies [28,29] and, in
this paper, we study in detail the impact of different growth models on the qualitative and
quantitative features of these spontaneous oscillations. To this aim, we model the system using
the theory of morphoelastic growing rods discussed in [30]. Here, we treat the rods as elastically

corresponds to that of growth. In formulae, we have A = 1°8 = a8, where 8 is the growth stretch
