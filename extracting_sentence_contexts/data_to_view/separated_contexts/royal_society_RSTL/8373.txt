It is scarcely possible, however, that among the many cases of
extremely young gonophores which I examined there were not both male and female
examples; and in no case did I find any thing which would lead me to believe that the
origin of the generative elements in one was different from what it was in another. The facts here noted have thus led me to maintain that both male and female elements
have their origin in the endoderm. Still, considering the difficulty of the observations,
and the fact that the appearances lie possibly open to another interpretation, I do not,
desire to insist on the impossibility of the generative elements being in one or both
8exes Primarily introduced from the ectoderm into the endoderm ; and I am willing to
wait for the confirmation which may be expected from further investigations. As is well known, all the fixed hydroids pass through a free locomotive stage before
finally attaching themselves. TI have elsewhere* pointed out that this free stage shows
itself under one or other of two forms, namely, that of a planula (as in the great majority of
hydroids, Campanula, Sertularia, Coryne, &c.) and that of an actinula (as in Tubularia).
