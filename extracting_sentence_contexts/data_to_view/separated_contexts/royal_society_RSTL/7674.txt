Owing'to the scarcity of labourers in that island and the irregularity
of communication between it and Mauritius, nearly a year passed before anything
could be done, and at last it was found necessary to send a small band of coolies
to Rodriguez for the express purpose of digging in the caves theref. These men
were dispatched in August 1866 and returned to Mauritius in about two months,
Mr. JexxER sending with them the results of their labour, consisting of nearly 2000
bones or fragments of bones of the Solitaire, with a few others belonging to various
animals. Two facts, however, it must be said are greatly to be regretted in connexion
with this expedition. It had been found impossible to put the coolies employed under
an intelligent superintendent, who could have carefully noted down all the circumstances
under which the bones were found; and the report which Mr. JuxxER was requested to
draw up, giving an account of the caves visited and 80 forth, has unfortunately neyer
reached us. Consequently nothing more is known of the specimens described in the
present paper than that they were found in caves in the island of Rodriguez, but it is
impossible for us to say how long they have been there buriedg.
