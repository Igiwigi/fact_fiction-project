If, in addition to @ being zero, we also have n = 1, this line is horizontal; we get an
analogue of the straight-line phugoid. If @ is not zero, we find readily that

in which wp is the actual velocity along Gx at t= 0, and we proceed only so long as
(gsin @/uy) tis distinctly less than unity. For different values of @ and uy we get a variety of paths which can be easily plotted;
we may call them “neutral’’ phugoids, since they are distinguished by the fact that
the machine is statically neutral. The statically neutral aeroplane is dealt with by
