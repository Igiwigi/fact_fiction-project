distant room, speech loud enough to be heard over a small apartment could be readily
produced. The words, however, were certainly lacking in distinctness.

A mos natural assumption was, that the sonnds heard regulted from the impact of
a series of pufls of air against the flame. Accordingly I attempted to produce a
greater yolume of sound by increasing the number of jets. Several small round holes
were pierced in the telephone diaphragm, and a separate flame placed in front of each
of them. The experiment did not justify my anticipations ; for it s00n appeared that
by far the most effective jets were those that issued near the centre of the diaphragm,
where the greatest motion existed ; an orifice near the circumference of the diaphragm

yielding only feeble sounds. In fact it looked as if motion of the orifice, rather than
compression of the air, was the chief agent in the phenomenon. This conclusion was

speedily verified by attaching a light glass jet to a piece of soft iron, 8oldered to a brass
gpring, and letting the oft iron take the place of the telephone diaphragm. (Fig. 1.)

The results with this arrangement were still more satisfactory than those previously
