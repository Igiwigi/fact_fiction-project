Introduction

The difficulty in obtaining regular nanoscale order, as well as the associated cost with ensuring
such design, is a key concern and challenge when engineering materials for applications
in catalysis, sensors, batteries, supercapacitors, photovoltaics, drug delivery and biomedical
imaging [1-4]. For interfacial materials that require three-dimensional topographical structures,
nanoscale features, such as nanofibres, nanorods and nanotubes (e.g. vertically aligned porous
structures), have been challenging to develop in a robust, straightforward manner. For
nanotubular structures, this challenge is further complicated by the fact that the dimensions of
these features (diameter, height, porosity, shape) significantly impact on macroscopic surface
properties, most notably wettability [5-10], and therefore a method that not only permits their
development but also enables facile manipulation of their characteristic dimensions is necessary. A unique aspect of nanotubular and nanoporous structures, which makes them particularly
interesting to study, is that the air trapped within nanotubes significantly impacts the macroscopic
surface hydrophobicity and water adhesion. The capillary force due to the trapped air within
nanotubular features causes increased adhesion with fluids, which is often unexpected given
the roughness of these surfaces and the non-adhesive behaviour typically observed on similarly
rough surfaces without porous structures.
