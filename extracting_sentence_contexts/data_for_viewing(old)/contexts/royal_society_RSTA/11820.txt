The results given in Table E show that the diffusion of metals is not inerea|
nearly so rapidly by a rise in temperature of 50° as the ordinary aqueous diffusion’

diffusing metallic molecules is not much reduced by heat, and it may be that
molecules of the diffusing substance are not so liable to disruption by a rise j

It may be well to wait until more results have been obtained before attempting
