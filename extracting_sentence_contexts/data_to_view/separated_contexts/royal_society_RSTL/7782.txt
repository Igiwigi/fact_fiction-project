It may be remarked, that, taking the coordinates to be (y+X, y+Y, . . .) , there is
no obligation to have (X, Y, . . .) indefinitely small; in fact whatever the magnitudes of
these quantities are, if only X : Y :... =7: 9:..., then the point (y+X,y+Y, . ..) will
be the very same with the original point, and it is therefore clear that a consecutive
point may be represented in the same manner with magnitudes, however large, of X, Y,... But we may assume them indefinitely small, that-is, the ratios a +dw : y+dy, : .
