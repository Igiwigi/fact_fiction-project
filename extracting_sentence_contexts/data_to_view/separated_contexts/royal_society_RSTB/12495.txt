The formulae at the end of appendix B, with the right
replacements for the variables, would then apply here too. The model there, however, does not allow for group-level
noise. If we want to estimate the difference b—c, and allow
_ Cov(w, p) —b- Var(p) for noise at the group-level as well as individual noise, then
Cov(p, q) we can use the fact that, for both versions of the model, b —
c is also the effect that one additional cooperator has on the
total group payoff. That makes the average group payoff a
linear function of its share of cooperators, and with the
Cov(w, q) - Cov(p, q) = b - [Cov(p, or + (Cov, p) —b noise in the group average equal to the average noise in indi-
- Var(p)) Var(q), vidual fitnesses in the group plus the group-level noise, this

gives us m observations of group averages

Cov(w, p) = b - Var(p) + c - Cov(p, q)

Cov(w, q) = b - Cov(p, q) +c - Var(q). Rewriting the first of those gives

Substituting in the second of those, and multiplying left and
right by Cov(p, q) gives

which makes Hi =(b- OF, +4.

pe Cov(w, q) - Cov(p, q) — Cov(w, p) - Var(q)

[Cov(p, pF — Var(p) - Var(q) Therefore, similar to appendix A, but now with group

averages for individual values, the estimator of the difference
Filling this in in either of the two, or using symmetry, gives b—c would be

ae Cov(w, p) - Cov(p, q) — Cov, q) - Var(p) $-t= Sap :
[Cov(p, q)? — Var(p) - Var(q) so



This could also be written as

with, as before, this covariance and variance defined on the
random variable that draws one of the observations, with
all observations being equally likely to be drawn.
