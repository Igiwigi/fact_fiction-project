TH is achieved when W = 85nm, that is exactly at the width at which there is a plasmon mode at
both the FF and TH. Importantly, from the results presented in figure 6, we find that the double
resonance condition is fulfilled when the graphene ribbons are in relative close proximity to their
nearest neighbours. Therefore, despite the fact that the excitation of localized surface plasmons
on the graphene ribbons plays the major role in the observed enhancement of the TH intensity,
the optical coupling between neighbouring ribbons and other diffractive effects could also affect
the optical response of the graphene structure.

The conclusions valid for a periodic distribution of graphene ribbons also hold in the two-
dimensional case. To illustrate this, we calculated the linear and nonlinear optical response of a
two-dimensional array of square graphene patches with side length, W. This particular choice
of the shape of graphene patches was guided by the fact that numerical simulations converge
much faster in the case of square patches when compared to discs. From the results presented
in figure 8, it can also be seen that in the two-dimensional case there are certain values of W for


which a graphene plasmon mode exists at the FF and TH wavelengths. To be more specific, for
W =84nm, the graphene diffraction grating supports a (fundamental) plasmon mode at the FF
corresponding to App = 9.69 1m and a third-order plasmon mode at ATy = Agp/3 =3.23 pm.

To verify that enhanced THG is achieved when the double-resonance condition is satisfied in
the two-dimensional case, we have computed the dependence of the TH intensity spectra on the
side length, W, of the square patches. This dispersion map of the nonlinear optical response is
presented in figure 8. In the inset of figure 8, we also show the dependence of the TH intensity
