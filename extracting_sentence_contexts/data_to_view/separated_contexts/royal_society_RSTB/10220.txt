In
nature, cooperative systems are formed by a mutational
event producing a single copy and accordingly the small
size scenario is applicable. Eventually, we are left with the
result that the kinetic model predicts that simple cooperative
units of the hypercycle type are stable only when they have
no more than three members.

real parts, and it is marginally stable for n = 4 because we
have the complex conjugate pair A;3 = +i. As a matter of
fact, the linear term in the stability analysis for S, with
n=A4 vanishes but there is a negative higher-order term
that causes slow oscillatory convergence to the stationary
state [20]. For n > 5, trajectories of hypercycles were com-
puted by numerical integration and show relaxation
oscillations becoming harder with increasing n [46]. The exist-
ence of a stable limit cycle for systems with n > 5 was proven
many years later in an elegant piece of analytical work [47].
