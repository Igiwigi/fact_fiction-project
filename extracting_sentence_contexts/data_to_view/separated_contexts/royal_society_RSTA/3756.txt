In this sense, the increase in FST can be viewed as ‘simulating’ 1S
an increase in Re; for a canonical boundary layer. It should also be noted that the peak in the pre- [oS
multiplied energy spectrum occurs at length scales near 106, which is consistent with the energetic : S
scales of high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layers. This dominant scale was, in fact, a : S
deliberate choice made when establishing the scales of the FST. It is certainly possible to change : s
this dominant scale by altering the active-grid operation mode as well as by altering the location : S

of the flat plate relative to the grid. In this study, we are specifically interested in isolating the
scale interactions where the energy containing large scales are of O(105) and therefore, we chose
the mode of grid operation to produce these dominant scales.
