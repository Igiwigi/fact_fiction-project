energy are certain to be smaller, probably much smaller, than those of shale. Hence, the hydraulic
cracks must be expected to run along the rock joints wherever possible. That they do is supported
by the fact that the typical spacing of rock joints appears to be of the order of 0.1m, which is
roughly equal to the aforementioned spacing of hydraulic cracks deduced from observations of
gas flux on the surface. The ultimate goal is to simulate the whole fracking stage, which is typically 70m long, 150m
deep and 500 m wide. The present discretization of fracture relies on the crack band model [34,35],
in which the crack is smeared as equivalent damage over the finite element of a width equal to the
crack band width.
