* The difference of 25% shown between text-figs. 5 and 2 (the measured somatic prophase) would of
course be quite effective confirmation of the fact of elongation if it were clear that the measurements
could be used at their face value. Caution in this is however necessary from the many sources of
uncertainty regarding the exact somatic length.

206 I. MANTON ON EVIDENCE ON SPIRAL STRUCTURE

While all emphasis is thus laid on the weakness of this part of the evidence it is
nevertheless true that such facts as there are cannot easily be swept aside, for the
single aceto-carmine specimen at leptotene (text-fig. 6) remains unrefuted. It is un-
fortunate that no comparable figures appear to exist for another plant. Leptotene
measurements have, however, been made on one animal, Dendrocoelum lacteum, by
Gelei (1922). With a particularly favourable object and by means of what appears
to be most rare technical skill, Gelei succeeded in measuring every chromosome
(2n=14) in two complete nuclei. Unfortunately, the comparable measurements for
pachytene are not given and there is no knowledge of spiral structure in the pre-
meiotic chromosomes. Even this work is therefore not readily usable for comparative
purposes. If, however, it is assumed that “‘diplotan” is, as it appears to be, the
equivalent of the plant pachytene, the general impression gained from Gelei’s figures
is not unlike that of Osmunda.
