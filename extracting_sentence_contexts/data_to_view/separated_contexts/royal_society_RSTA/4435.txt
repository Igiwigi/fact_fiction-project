Next, consider the signal structure of figure 8. Here,  =2/(1 + 5) and is the inverse of the
Golden Ratio. One can check that our indistinguishability condition is satisfied (use the fact that
? + © =1). Now consider the following strategy profile for the team in the extended tree: (i) at
Ii, choose Up; after H; and Downy after Tj; (ii) at 12, choose Up2 after Hy and Downy after T2;
(iii) at Iz, choose Up3 after H3 and Downg after T3; (iv) at I4, choose Up, after Hy and Down, after
T4. The team’s expected pay-off from this strategy profile is t x @° x m> 0.
