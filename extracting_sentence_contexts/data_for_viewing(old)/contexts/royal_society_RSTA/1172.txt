If 0 €o(A) we let Po be the Riesz projection corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 (noting that Po
need not be orthogonal), and if A is invertible we set Py = 0. Let Xp := (I — Po) X and Ag := Al xy.
Then Apo is the generator of the Co-semigroup (7o(t)):>0 of contractions (namely the restriction of
the semigroup (T(t));>0 to the T-invariant subspace Xp) and o(Ag) = o(A) \ {0}. In particular, it
follows from Theorem 3.4 that the semigroup (7o(t));>0 is semi-uniformly stable.

One would typically like to determine whether (Jo(t)):>0 is exponentially stable or, if not, to
obtain uniform decay rates for classical solutions. The decay of (Zo(f));=0 is intimately related to
the decay of the physically relevant energy of solutions u of the second-order problem (4.2):

E(u,t):= 4 (1a¥?u I? + Wii) . (4.5)

In fact, the decay rate of the energy E(u, t) for all pairs of initial values (ug, 1) € D(A) x D(A'?)
(no restriction to 4!) is the same as the square of the decay rate of ||To(f)Ap 1 and, as a result,
we may apply the results in §3. It is then natural to say that the energy of (4.2) decays semi-
uniformly with rate r € Co(R+) if E(u, t) < Cr(t)*|| A(uo, 11) |? for all (uo, u1) € D(A) x D(AY?). Note
that E(u, t) = O(r(#)*) for some r€Co(R+) and for all initial values (19,11) € ¥ is equivalent to
exponential stability of the semigroup (7Zo(f));>0), and therefore to exponential decay of E(u, t) for
all solutions of (4.2).

Recall from §2 the discussion of circles contained in the spectrum of Co-semigroups. This
discussion implies in particular that the well-known alternative—either ||Zo(t)|| =1 for all t>0
or (Zp(t)):=0 is exponentially stable—holds here in a much stronger form: either (Jo(t));>0 is
exponentially stable or T € o (7o(t)) for almost every t > 0. Thus, unless (7o());>9 is exponentially
stable, its peripheral spectrum (in fact, even the peripheral essential spectrum) is as large as
