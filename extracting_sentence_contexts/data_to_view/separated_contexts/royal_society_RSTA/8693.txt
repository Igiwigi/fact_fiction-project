For such a lens and magnification as low as 2, the
critical value of «, is found to be about 4° 40’, corresponding to a value of a, of 13°,
whilst the greatest practical value of a, is 26°, so that in this case only about 4 of the
light going through the lens could be dealt with by series in terms of the emergent
angle. From M = 2 to M= & the conditions are still worse. As a matter of fact, it appears that in this case the range of magnifications, within
which development in terms of the emergent inclinations is possible for all rays
travelling through the lens, is restricted to a range lying somewhere between M = —1
and M=1°5. This makes it clear that we cannot depend, in the calculation of the
aberrations of an optical system, upon any series with the emergent inclination as
argument. This is important, because from other considerations it would have been
valuable to have been able to express the equation of the emergent ray in the
form

y+qu =f (9g)

where q is the inclination of the emergent ray, and to proceed to obtain successive
approximations to the caustic by developing f(g) in powers.
