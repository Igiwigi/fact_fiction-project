The effect, however, of
this conjunction of the reasonings of the physical astronomer and of the geologist has
been to raise a new difficulty for both.

16. The geologist, chaineddown under 800 miles or more of solid rock, the real thickness
of which he is in no condition to disprove, cannot get his liquid lava sea beneath to the
surface; and he has no other source for volcanic heat and ejecta to snggest. The mathematician has the fact before him; volcanoes exist. He admits the difficulty
of the geologist, and meets it by the most lame and gratuitous hypothesis of lakes or
isolated masses of liquid fused rock existing at different points and at different depths
(which depths, however, must, on the whole, be shallow within the solid erust of the
earth), and asxumes that from these the volcanic vents are supplied. 17.
