consumption psychology instead exhibits flexibility, but
non-random flexibility that derives from the different factors
the system was designed to take as input [8,32]. Prior research
into the acquisition of taste aversions and preferences identifies
a number of such contextual factors. Here, we highlight three:
nutritional state, prior experience and developmental stage.

(i) Nutritional state
The nutritional state of the organism can shift the costs of error
associated with food assessment. The costs of failing to detect
pathogens when they are in fact present will generally out-
weigh the costs of inferring the presence of pathogens when
they are in fact absent [5]. Under normal circumstances, for-
going a few calories matters little: hunger is a better option
than death. But the calculus of food assessment changes dra-
matically when starvation or dehydration threatens: the costs
of forgoing nutrition climb, while the relative costs of possible
pathogen presence decline. As a result, internal representations
of a person’s nutritional state should feed into calculations
of expected consumption value, increasing consumption
value—and thus reducing disgust—even when cues to patho-
gens are present, or when cues to sugar, salt and protein are
lacking. We note that this shifting of costs probably does not
apply to plant toxins—the potency of plant-based poisons
(e.g. strychnine and atropine) generally does not allow for
