This also appears from the fact that the inyerse of a focus is. a focus; and since the
Cartesian cyclide has three collinear single foci, the inverse surface will haye four con-
cyclic single foci, namely the inyerses of the three collinear foci and the centre of
inversion.

205. If we differentiate the equation (138) of the generating sphere with respect to j,
we get

+ +2 +2a7+1*+2pR*=0;
and if from (1+) times this result we subtract the equation (138), we get

2ar ++ (2p +p?)R*=0. Hence the Cartesian cyclide is generated as the locus of the curye of intersection of the

From this it follows that a Cartesian cyclide is a surface of reyolutionâ€”a fact which

we kney otherwise, it being" the surface generated by the revolution of a Cartesian
oyal about the axis passing through the three collinear single foci.
