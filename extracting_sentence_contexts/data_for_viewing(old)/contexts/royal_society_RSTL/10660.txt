distorted, and the distribution of the induction will be greatly altered.

We may ascribe this alteration to a distribution of electricity along the wire, the
quantity in any s8mall area 'on the g8urface of the wire |being equal to the difference
between the number of tubes which have entered and the number which have left
that area since the beginning of the system. We have a familiar example of this in

& the charging of deep-sea cables. Another example is afforded by a condenser with
terminals connected to two points in the circuit. The plates of the condenser are
E then virtually parts of the circuit.
} The effect of a junction of two wires, say of the same diameter, but of different
= gpecific resistances, upon the level surface will resemble that of a charge upon the
Soeparating surface. This can be seen in a general way from the fact that the level
S 8urfaces must cut the wire with the higher speecific resistance at intervals shorter than
.& those at which it cuts the other wire.
2 Tf there be an insulated conducting body, say a metal sphere, near the circuit, we
'S know that in the steady state there is no electric intensity, and therefore no current
within it ; consequently there is no movement of energy and no movement of
> induction through it. We can see how this condition is arrived at. As the first
= tubes of electric and magnetic induction come up to the sphere they will enter it, and
2 the parts of the electric induction tubes thus entering will be broken up, causing a
Z transient current in the s8phere. The parts of the tubes left in the medium will end
Son the sphere giving a negative charge on the end nearer the regions of higher
Â£ potential, and a posibive charge on the end nearer the regions of lower potential.
E This will go on until 8nch charges have accumulated that the sphere becomes itself a
