THROUGH THE OVIDUCTS IN TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATES. 399

If active sperms are injected into the distal end of a uterus in a freshly killed rabbit
and the animal set aside, in two hoursâ€™ time they will be found at the proximal
end of that organ. If a similar injection is made at the proximal end of the
uterus active sperms will be found in about the same time at the distal end. During
such tests the uteri were kept under inspection and no peristaltic or antiperistaltic
movements were observed. The length of tube traversed by the sperms was about:
seven centimetres, a distance that would be covered by the straight-away swimming
of a rabbit sperm in a little less than twenty-five minutes. The fact that it required
about two hours to cover this distance is consistent with the observation that sperms
do not swim straight ahead, but with great irregularity, and that what has been called in
this paper their rate of diffusion may reasonably be expected to be much less than their
rate of individual locomotion. In consequence of these results I agree with MarsHaL
(1922, p. 174) in his second assumption, that sperms ascend the uterus of the rabbit as
individuals by their own locomotion and not by other means. This conclusion is
consistent with the observations of Lim and Cao (1926, 1927), who by a surgical opera-
tion reversed a segment of the rabbit uterus without, however, inhibiting pregnancy. I
therefore believe that so far as the ascent of the sperms is concerned, the uterus of the
rabbit is a non-polarized tube. It serves merely as a channel through which in an
hour or two the sperms may make their way by their own locomotion to the entrance
into the uterine tube.
