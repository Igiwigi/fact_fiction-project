in fact, orientated parallel to a line joining the intersection of the main and secondary
basal articulations (P, figure 5) to the centre of the end-knob. This is significant in the light
of the dynamical considerations outlined above. From a mechanical point of view, a hollow structure with corrugations on the dorsal
and ventral surfaces and unfolded cuticle on the sides has differential flexibility in the
two planes.
