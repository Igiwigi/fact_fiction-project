The study of some of these specimens by modern methods has resulted in the addition
of details to previous descriptions. It is of morphological interest to ascertain all that
can be learnt about these well-defined types of early plant-remains. The facts ascer-
tained also have their bearing on the question whether the two types of remains can be
regarded as parts of the one plant. Further, by adding to the critical characteristics
of the “type specimens ” they will have value when apparently similar remains from
other regions have to be specifically determined. It is an additional source of interest
in these two types of remains that specimens agreeing in general features with them
occur, also in association, in Lower Devonian rocks of regions widely distant from Gaspé.
