92 J. P. HILL ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY OF THE PRIMATES. The alterations in the endometrium which accompany the development of the placenta
are of a remarkable character; indeed they appear to me to be unique, certainly for
the Primates, but it is only possible to refer to them quite briefly here. As a matter
of fact no detailed account of the changes in question has ever been given, though
Husrecurt (’99) has described the alterations in the uterine glands and the connective
tissue stroma situated immediately below and around the tropho-placental mass. According to his account, which I am able to confirm, the neck-portions of the uterine
glands commence to enlarge and their epithelium begins to thicken immediately the
attachment of the blastocyst is effected (Pl. 4, fig. 30). The epithelium continues to
increase until it completely obliterates the gland-lumen, the cell-outlines disappear and
by the time the tropho-placental mass is established the gland-necks adjoining its upper
half are represented by lightly staining solid syncytial masses, finely granular in
character and containing numbers of mostly small pale staining nuclei (PI. 4, fig. 31).
