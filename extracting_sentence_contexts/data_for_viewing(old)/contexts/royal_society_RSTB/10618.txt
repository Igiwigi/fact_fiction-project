5. Discussion

Brain responses measured with functional magnetic reson-
ance imaging (fMRI), MEG [19] and EEG (as seen here)
show consistently increased activation to regular acoustic pat-
terns, relative to matched random stimuli. One interpretation
of these systematic, pronounced effects is that they indicate
large differences in attentional capture between regular and
random patterns, such that regular patterns automatically
and involuntarily attract more attention. This account of the
imaging data is consistent with previous behavioural work
in the visual modality [44] and is broadly in line with the
fact that sensitivity to predictable patterns in the natural
environment is a major pre-requisite for survival. Organisms
produce regular, periodic motor sequences, such as loco-
motion and vocalizations, which are expressed as a pattern
in the temporal succession of sensations. The ability to auto-
matically orient towards such patterns within a crowded,
noisy scene is often critical for continued existence.

(a) Attentional capture by regularity?

The behavioural experiments reported here aimed to identify a
behavioural correlate for the observed brain response effects.
Using two tasks designed to probe different aspects of atten-
