After winter frogs have received large sublethal doses of pseudaconitine, or of its
allies, there is a period of 8 or 9 days of great reduction of voluntary and reflex
movement. Circulation is feeble, and respiration may be suspended entirely for the
earlier part of the time, whilst the phenomenon described in the next paragraph
will probably be witnessed,

Action of Pseudaconitine in favouring Occurrence of Usdema. The fact was incidentally observed that frogs (2. temp. and 2. ese.) kept wet
(ze., sitting in water â€˜5 to 1 centim. in depth) increased greatly or enormously in
weight during the days following administration of a large sublethal dose of pseud-
aconitine, and to a slighter extent after the other aconitines, This increase in
weight depends upon the increase of fluid, either

(a) In the urinary bladder ; or
(b) There is a general cedema of the tissues and within the lymph spaces ; or
(c) These conditions co-exist. The following daily weighings are taken from a series of frogs kept in different
conditions. All the frogs, except No, 1, received pseudaconitine after it had been
ascertained that their normal weight (with empty bladder) was practically constant.
