This is evidently to be ascribed to the
S abolition of common sensibility as well as of true 8mell from the right nostril. The
Zlacrymation was the indication of the reflex excitation of the lacrymal gland through
> the medium of tactile sensibility, which till continued unimpaired on the left side. Z The absence of motor reaction, however, was an interesting fact, and serves to show how
Â£2 much of the reaction caused by a pungent vapour applied to the nostril is dependent
HZ on the integrity of true olfactory sensibility. E As regards taste, the results indicated its entire abolition. But not only taste, as
E 8uch, but also the tactile sensibility of the tongue seemed to have been destroyed.
= This was noted as a remarkable phenomenon, and the tests were frequently repeated in
SZ order that no fallacy might be allowed to remain.
