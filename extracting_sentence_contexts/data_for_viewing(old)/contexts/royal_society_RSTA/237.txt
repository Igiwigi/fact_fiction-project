2000). Time delays may also be included in continuum models (Siebel & Mauser
2006) to mimic driver reaction time. As will be shown below, reaction time is
an essential element of car-following models, but it is not clear how it should be
incorporated in continuum models. Noise may also be added explicitly to any of
the above models, but it has rarely been done in the literature.

The advantages of continuum models are that the results can be directly
compared with macroscopic data, such as the FD in figure la and the space
time diagram in figure 2b (Kerner 2004), and that it is also relatively easy
to provide the boundary conditions for velocity and flux. Their disadvantage
is, however, that it is difficult to relate the model parameters to microscopic
driver parameters. Moreover, it is not clear what limitations are imposed by
the fact that fundamentally discrete systems are being modelled as continua.
