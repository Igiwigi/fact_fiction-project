the iron remained unimpaired.

cate such of them as are connected with new facts, to the
Royal Society.

The Lords Commissioners 'of the Admiralty, with their
usual zeal for promoting the interests of the Navy by the
application of science, have given me permission to ascertain
the practical value of these results by experiments upon ships
of war; and there seems every reason - to expect ( unless
causes Should interfere of which our present knowledge
gives no indications) that small quantities of zinc, or which
is much cheaper, of malleable or cast iron, placed in contact
with the copper sheeting of ships, which is all in electrical
connection, will entirely prevent its corrosion. And as ne-
