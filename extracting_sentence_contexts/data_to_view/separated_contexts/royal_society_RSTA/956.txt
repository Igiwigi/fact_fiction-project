distortions [1,2]. This, in fact, severely inhibits their uses and applications. This behaviour is 2 |
generally attributed to the presence of quenched defects like hairline microcracks, interstitials,

dislocations or vacancies in these materials [3]. The defects cause distortion of the stress field 3
around the defects and anisotropy in the field distribution.
