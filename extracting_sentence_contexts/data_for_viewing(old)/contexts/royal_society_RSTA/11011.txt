area, re-etched, after 24 hours’ exposure to 200°C. It now shows a well-defined
erystalline structure. Fig. 35 shows the same area again, after six days’ further
exposure to 200° C., and a very considerable increase in the size of the crystals is
visible. In this case, although the gradual growth of some of the crystals is very
strikingly shown, many of the features that we have observed in the case of lead are
entirely absent. In the cadmium we can see no invading branches and no aggressive
individuals, nor does there seem to be any considerable amount of twinning.

Experiments similar to those just described were also made on specimens of zinc,
with the result that specimens of zine strained by compression at ordinary tempera-
tures were found to re-crystallise on exposure to 200°C. Some results obtained with
sheet-zine, such as that used for electric batteries, were particularly interesting. It
is a well known fact that the mechanical properties of zinc are widely different at
different temperatures, particularly that the metal is soft and ductile at temperatures
slightly above 100° C., and that it is generally worked at that temperature, while it

is known to become very brittle at and above 200° C. Commercial sheet-zinc, rolled
at temperatures above 100° C., remains fairly soft and flexible at ordinary tempera-
tures, and its crystalline structure is too minute to be seen in specimens etched with-
out previous polishing.
