With other electrolytic fluids
iron and nickel would be included, and even gold, platinum, palladium ; in fact all the
bodies that can be made to yield in any way active voltaic circuits. Then is it pos

-8ible that this can be true, and yet not a single combination of this extensive class of
bodies be producible that can give the current without chemical action (1867.), con-
sidered not as a result, but as a known and pre-existing force ?

1893. I will endeayour to avoid further statement of the arguments, but think my-
self bound to produce (1799.) a small proportion of the enormous body of facts which
appear to me to bear evidence all in one direction.

1894. Bismuth—This metal when associated with platinum, gold, or palladium in
Solution of the sulphuret of potassium, gives active circles, the hismuth being positive. In the course of less than half an hour the current ceases ; but the circuit is still an
excellent conductor of thermo currents.
