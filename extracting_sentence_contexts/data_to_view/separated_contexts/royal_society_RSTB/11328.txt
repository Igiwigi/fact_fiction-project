This observation indicates
catalytic subunits have different sequences and often differ that the a- and B-subunits are fully competent to propagate
significantly in their tertiary structures. In homomeric ring signals between catalytic sites without the concourse of the
motors, ATP hydrolysis in the catalytic sites is activated by y-subunit (figure 3a). The fact that mutants of the arginine
arginine residues provided by identical neighbouring sub- finger abolish multi-site catalysis [32] suggested that the a-sub-
units (figure 3b). In each subunit, the nucleotide-binding unit, via its arginine finger, plays an important role in
pocket and catalytic residues are located at the opposite transmitting signals between catalytic sites. Isolated B-subunits
