The largest difference between two densities at the same temperature is ‘00038 at
91° C., which, if the observation at 90°°5 C. be corrected to 91°25 C., is reduced to
a difference of 00020, and this corresponds to an error of about 0°02 per cent. In
solubilities, however, the largest difference is ‘06 at 75° C., and this corresponds to

an error of 0°16 per cent. This large difference in the two percentage errors is
remarkable, and I have not yet been able to account for it—it is manifested in most
of the salts hitherto worked with. A fact which may possibly throw light on the
subject is noticeable in the above table, and is one which most of the salts also show,
namely, that the solubilities obtained when
starting with an unsaturated solution, tend to
be slightly less than those obtained when
