One contribution of 15 to a theme issue for this reason, there remains a disconnect between research on hominin inno-

there is something of a disconnect between the theoretical work on innovation
in hominin evolution (based on theories of cultural evolution) and the
experimental tradition on human innovation. That disconnect is largely due
