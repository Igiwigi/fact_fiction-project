amounts of both potass and phosphorie acid considerably greater, especially in the
upper layers, the greater had been the previous supplies by manure. Lastly, Dr.
VorLckER's analyses of the drainage waters from the different plots of the same field
showed very much less loss of potass in that way than of either soda, lime, or magnesia,
and also very much less of phosphoric acid than of sulphurie acid or of chlorine. There
was in fact comparatively little loss by drainage of either potass or phosphorie acid.

To sum up in regard to the effects of the different mineral manures when used
without artificial nitrogenous supply : the comparison of the results obtained without
manure, with superphosphate of lime alone, and with a mixed mineral manure with,
and without, potass, brings clearly to view the much more striking influence of an
increased supply of potass, than of lime, magnesia, soda, phosphorie acid, or sulphuric
acid ; and it will be observed that this is quite consistent with the facts adduced in
Table T., and context, in regard to the mineral composition of the hay crop. It is true
that when there was either a direct supply, or an ayailable residue, of potass ab
command, more of the other constituents enumerated above were taken up, and even
when superphosphate of lime was used alone, considerably more phosphoric acid was
taken up, but coincidently with this there was but little increase of produce, and very
little increase in the amount of nitrogen assimilated.

The more special effects of the mineral manures, and particularly of the artificial
supply of potass, on the botanical and chemical characters of the herbage, will be
discussed in Parts II. and II.

Having now considered the results obtained by nitrogenous manures alone, and by
