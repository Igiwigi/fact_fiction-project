quantum mechanics in providing an explanation for the periodic table. This process began when

Bohr assigned particular numbers of electrons to each electron shell, thus using just one quantum : =
number [7]. :3
Soon afterwards a second and third quantum number were introduced to give more detailed : =
electronic structures [8], a process that culminated with Pauli proposing the need for a fourth :8
quantum number. Considering the possible values of these various quantum numbers, as well as [3
the relationships established among them, made it possible to predict the fact that the first few 3
shells contain, 2, 8 and 18 electrons, respectively. This understanding lent further support for the 18
18-column table in which the s-block (2 elements wide) was followed by the d-block (10 elements : 3
wide), followed by the p-block (6 elements wide) to make a total of 18 columns. The question of â€˜Ss

how to label the groups in the periodic table was decided by IUPAC amid much controversy in
1990, although this episode will not be reviewed here [9].

4. The 32-column table

Even more recently some authors have taken the logical step of extending the periodic table
even further to feature 32 groups (figure 5; [10]). This version has the possible advantage over
the 18-column representation in that the f-block is incorporated into the main body of the table
