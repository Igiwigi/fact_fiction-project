ation did not alter the underlying rate of actuarial ageing but
added a quantum of damage that was equivalent to altering
the basal vulnerability of the animal. With regard to the
nature of the underlying damage, Sacher [10] discussed exten-
sively how the effects on the Gompertz model could be related
to the molecular mechanisms at play, especially with regard
both to lesions introduced by radiation and also to their
relationship to cancers arising in the various organs of the
body. He was well aware of the pitfalls of overly simplistic
identification of radiation damage and ageing: ‘Exposure to
ionizing radiation produces a kind of primary injury that
remains permanently imbedded in the molecular constitution
of the organism. This fact made it possible to find the math-
ematical transformation that makes radiation injury additive
with itself and with the injury of natural ageing, and this led,
in turn, to the development of the theory of the probabilistic
relationship between the level of cellular—molecular injury in
a population and its expected death rate. These conclusions
are quite general and can be carried over to the analysis of
life prolongation by anti-ageing therapies. However, present
evidence indicates that ageing is not due to the same molecular
lesion as radiation life shortening. Thus, the efficacy of a drug

as a protective agent against radiation life shortening is not
necessarily related to its efficacy in life prologation’.
