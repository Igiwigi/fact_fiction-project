This result is consistent with construal level theory [20], which states that the level at which
an idea is construed influences peopleâ€™s evaluations and preferences. Specifically, projections
expressing an outcome as certain may be processed at a lower level of abstraction, decreasing the
psychological distance between the individual and the event, and leading individuals to respond
more strongly (compared to projections expressing an outcome as uncertain). A potential limitation that should be addressed is the fact that the projections in the two
uncertainty conditions were imbalanced in a number of ways. First, the projections in the outcome
uncertain condition included the mean projected outcome in addition to the upper and lower
bounds of the confidence interval, whereas the projections in the time-uncertain condition did
not include the mean projected year of arrival. Thus, more information was presented in the
outcome-uncertain condition than in the time-uncertain condition.
