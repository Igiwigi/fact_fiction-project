MYOLOGY OF THE CHEIROPTERA. 137

coexists* with the lesser pectoral as an anomaly ; and in one of its conditions it is known
as the chondro-epitrochlearis. That it is not pectoralis minor is shown by this fact, and
also by the fact that it is supplied by the anterior thoracic nerve from the outer cord of
the brachial plexus, not by the middle, which should supply it if it were lesser pectoral. Cuvier and MEckEr describe a muscle passing in the Bat from the three upper ribs
to the coracoid process with a broad tendon of insertion ; this they call the pectoralis
minor. T have not scen the least trace of a muscle like this in the whole course of my
dissections, nor has Huxenry met with it in his Pferoprs.
