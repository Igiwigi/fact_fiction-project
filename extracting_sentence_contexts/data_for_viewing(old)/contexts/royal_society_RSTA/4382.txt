The RNA World hypothesis supposes that sophisticated autocatalytic systems based almost
entirely on ribozymes were the earliest integrated systems that survived by harnessing
environmental energy flows. The sine qua non of the RNA World is a putative ribozymal RNA
polymerase, which could replicate all functional components of the system, keeping it alive
so to speak. Something like an RNA World may well have preceded the emergence of genetic
coding and, as Takeuchi & Hogeweg [17] have shown, it would necessarily have been structured

according to ‘bioinformatic processes’, as they were originally defined [18]. From this perspective, : =
the RNA World could be considered as a physico-chemical computational system, one that was : Sy

of such a system having an elementary ‘code’—complementary Watson—Crick base pairing—and aed
the information for any function would have been stored in the sequence complementary to the 22
ribozyme that performed that function. In fact, it was the capability of RNA to act simultaneously : Sg
as both an information carrier and a catalyst that led to the RNA World hypothesis, circumventing DNS
the need for complex genetic coding in the earliest autocatalytic systems. However, RNA faces : a

A nucleotide base occupies on average about 0.30nm? compared with an average of
about 0.13nm3 for the 20 standard amino acids found in proteins. Thus, considering the
combinatorial manner in which adjacent spaces in a three-dimensional array can be filled with
informationally determined choices from 20 (or fewer) distinct small entities rather than four
larger entities [19], informationally encoded proteins offer, compared with ribozymes, very much
finer computational control over the chemistry of the small regions of space in which individual
