In the vast literature on the
neurobiology of memory, this is the only case in which
the engram for a specified quantitative experiential fact (the
duration of the CS—-US interval) has been localized—and it
has been localized to a sub-cellular level. In this case at least,
the numeron encoding the duration of an interval resides in a
cell-intrinsic medium, not in a plastic synapse. These considerations—the metabolic and volumetric costs
and the fact that the CS—US interval is stored by a cell-intrin-
sic mechanism—lead me to seek answers at the cell-intrinsic
level, which is to say at the molecular level. At that level, it is
easier to find structures of the kind one would look for to
implement an efficient, versatile number-encoding scheme. As mentioned in §1, it is easy to see how to encode numbers
into polynucleotide strings (DNA and RNA).
