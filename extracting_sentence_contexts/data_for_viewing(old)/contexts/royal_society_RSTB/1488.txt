the two areas last described. Thus, in deep ether narcosis, at a stage in which
excitation of both the area for arrest in adduction and that for arrest in abduction
usually results in slowing of the movements of the cords, excitation of this focus,
which is immediately behind that for arrest in abduction, was responsible for distinct
intensification of the movements of the vocal cords, together with acceleration some-
times. The intensification is accompanied by acceleration, if narcosis is not too
profound, and the exact focus from which the effect is as a rule best obtained is about
the point of junction of the anterior sylvian and anterior composite gyri (see fig. 1).

8, Spencer’s Area of Arrest of Respiration.—Provided the animal be sufficiently
under the influence of ether, or if ether and morphia narcosis be combined, excitation
of the chief focus of this area results in arrest of the movements of the vocal cords in
the adductor position of the expiratory stage of respiration (see fig. 9), a fact in
keeping with the result obtained by Spencer with regard to respiration, for he found
that in the dog excitation of this area resulted in arrest of respiration in expiration.
This focus is on the olfactory lobe, with the olfactory tract and rhinal fissure bounding
it in front and laterally, and with the sylvian artery behind, forming the base of the
triangular area of grey matter.

Instead of the movements of the vocal cords being arrested, they were sometimes
only slowed, an event consequent on one of the following causes: an insufficient
amount of the anzesthetic, too much anesthetic, or, with the proper degree of
anesthesia, an insufficient strength of Faradic current.
