As the black extended only from 7'5 to 18:5 mm.,

dT/T==—0-004/4'51 x 0.6=—015 per cent. This experiment illustrates the importance of obtaining, if possible, two meagure-
ments with the game pair of films. The fact that the change in the magnitudes of
the principal diameters went on without reference to the thinning of the films is
strong evidence that that change was not caused by the alterations in their relative
thicknesses,

Experiment XI. The same films were used as in Experiment IT. The final observations in thab
experiment gave 0'18 as the initial difference of the diameters.
