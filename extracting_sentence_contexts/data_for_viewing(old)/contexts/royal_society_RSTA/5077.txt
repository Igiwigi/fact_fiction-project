fracture of 2y) with that required to blunt the crack by the generation at, and movement away
from, the crack tip of dislocations, at a theoretical shear strength of 1/10, modified by appropriate
geometrical factors to allow for the operative slip systems. The KTC approach provides a rationale
for why some materials are intrinsically brittle, and others are intrinsically ductile. The conclusion
for iron is that it is a ‘borderline’ material, consistent with the fact that it exhibits a ductile/brittle
transition temperature. RT approached the problem in a somewhat different manner, by analysing
the emission of dislocations from a crack tip at the Griffith stress. (This also assumes that the work
of fracture is 2y). Again iron was found to be a borderline material. Further work of this sort has
been reviewed by Xu [38].

Both KTC and RT assume implicitly that the work-of-fracture is that of two free surfaces,
2Jm-? (KTC 4Jm~? at OK). Experimental values for the work-of-fracture, derived from og values,
lie in the range 8-14Jm~ and it is of interest to explore this discrepancy. Even setting aside
the restructuring of surfaces after fracture, it should be noted that the Griffith energy balance,
