where kp represents the equilibrium partition coefficient, C, is the solute concentration in the
liquid phase, and Dc represents the diffusion coefficient.
The convective heat and mass transport equations in the solid and liquid phases take the form

and

where w is the fluid velocity. Here, we traditionally neglect atomic diffusion in the solid. For
the sake of simplicity, we consider the case of equal thermal diffusivities in both phases. This
hypothesis does not change the selection criteria given below due to the fact that different thermal
diffusivities will change the selection constant only.

To describe the hydrodynamic flows, we use the linearized Oseen model for a viscous flow

Here, U is the fluid velocity far from the dendritic surface (see figure 1), p is the pressure, p) is the
density of the liquid and v is the kinematic viscosity.

The convective heat and mass transfer problem (2.1)-(2.10) written out for the case of n-fold
symmetry of crystal growth enables us to find the generalized solvability criterion, including the
