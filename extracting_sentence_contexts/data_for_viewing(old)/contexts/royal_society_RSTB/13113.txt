pure primary reward tasks, where losses cannot be
implemented (it is impossible to take some fruit juice away
from the stomach of a monkey), tokens have the advantage
of making possible subtracting previously acquired rewards
from the animal, thus inducing ‘losses’ in the same manner
as in human. However, a recent study using tokens, showed
risk-seeking attitudes comparable to that observed using pri-
mary reward [96]. Furthermore, when tokens are used, they
are almost immediately changed against primary reward,
making them not really comparable to money, whose value is
much more permanent. Taken together, the available evidence
suggests that the primary /secondary reward dichotomy does
not explain the fact that human description-based biases are
hardly observed in monkeys.

Second, in addition to the difference in the nature of the
reward, description-based paradigms in humans and para-
digms in monkeys often present a systematic difference in
the amount of the reward (figure 4). Indeed, most of the orig-
inal studies about PT used hypothetical gambles of hundreds
of dollars and the same biases have been replicated using real
stakes of about a month’s salary [111]. On the other side,
monkey studies use very small amounts of rewards (mere
drops of liquids). It has been argued that part of the descrip-
tion-experience gap may simply derive from this difference
