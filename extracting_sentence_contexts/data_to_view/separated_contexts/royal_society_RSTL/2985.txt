The two preliminary and curious facts just detailed, con-
nected with the art of embalming among the Egyptians,
havenever been noticed before. Neither HeropoTus, nor
D1oporvs SicuLvUs; mention them, and all the more modern
writers are Silent on the subject. The nezt fact worthy of notice, is the appearance of minute
saline crystals, found in great abundance in almost every
part of the external, but more particularly of the internal
surface of the body. These, at first, had escaped notice ; but
upon the various; portions of the dissected mummy being
exposed to the open air, in.one of the rooms on the ground
floor in my house for some weeks, where a fire was kept,
the appearance of the -saline | particles became strikingly
visible. This saline efflorescence 1 gently swept off the sur-
face with a new brush, and subjected to various analytical
experiments, from which it results, that it consists of nitrate
of potash, carbonate, sulphate, and muriate of s0da;-and traces
of lime.
