to 6—G is a discrete valuation ring of rank 2. The contracted valuation ring R = Gn
is also discrete, of rank 2; in fact, R is the set of elements of Y whose images in F belong to

Any valuation ring 6’ of L lying over ® has rank 2, and is therefore contained in a rank
valuation ring 8’ of L; the image of G’ in the residue field of 8’ is a valuation ring ©
and @’ consists of all elements of 8’ whose images in the residue field belong to ©’. Thi
valuation ring 8’ K can be none other than %. By the preceding remarks, B’ = §.
