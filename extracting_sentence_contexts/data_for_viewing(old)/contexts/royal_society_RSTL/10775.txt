Such use ; if it is too long the thin film is apt to break before the thick one is ready

Eave the films in communication while one of them is being thickened. A black film

Me or two millimetres. Tt is, therefore, necessary to separate the films while the
Biickening takes place, and nob to pub them again into communication until after the

Siameter, We have attempted as far as possible to overcome these difficulties, and
have carried out our observations in two different ways.

HVirst Method of Experiment.

The fact that the method of measuring three ordinates confirmed that based upon
the meagurement of the principal diameters only, in indicating a small difterence of
gurface tension between the films, even when both had been recently flooded, proves
either that such differences really exist or that some slight ontstanding cause of error
affects both methods equally. In either case ib seemed best to argue in each experi-

ment, not from the theoretical position of equilibrium, but from that assumed by t
films which were as similar as we could make them.

Two cylindrical films were therefore flooded and put into communication. Th
