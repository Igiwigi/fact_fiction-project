The phenomena were, however, at least as favourable to the view
that magnetic conditions on any one day represent an integral to which a number of
previous days contribute. The similarity in the nature of the results derived by these different investigations
from the 11 years as a whole, and the fact that the apparent sunspot influence
indicated was far from infinitesimal, seemed to preclude the possibility of the
phenomena being wholly accidental. There was, however, this remarkable fact, that
when the years were treated individually, some of them, notably 1895, gave results
which appeared to be of an opposite character to those derived from the whole 11 years,
there being an apparent association of large D ranges with small, not large, spot areas. Further investigation thus appeared necessary, and it was clear that it ought to be of
a much more comprehensive character, calling for a large expenditure of time. It is
only within the last twelve months that a suitable opportunity has presented itself.
