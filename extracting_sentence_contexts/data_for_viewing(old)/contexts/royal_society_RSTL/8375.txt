The pyramidal (Plate XXXVIII fig. 5, p) has the shape which is s0 characteristic of
it in all Paridigitata. We may remark, in reference to this bone, that it is the least
changeable of all the carpal bones, its shape being very similar, even in animals of
widely different families and even orders. For instance, it is very like in both
Paridigitata and Imparidigitata; and a pyramidal of Rhinoceros is hardly to be dis-
tinguished from that of a Hippopotamus. We may suppose that, as this bone has a
very similar function to perform in all Ungulata, it did not change its shape, while the
other bones, more directly acted upon by the different condition of life, did.

The pyramidal of Hyopotamus presents therefore a certain likeness to that of an
Anoplotherium, and also to that of a common hog ; the chief distinction lies in the fact
that all its edges are much sharper, and not 80 much blunted as in Suide; this applies.
particularly to the ridge separating the facet of the ulna from the facet for the pisiforme
(Plate XXXVIIL. fig. 5, p).

The distal surface, adapted to the outer proximal facet of the unciform, is shaped very
much as in all other Paridigitata.

I have this bone only from Puy.
