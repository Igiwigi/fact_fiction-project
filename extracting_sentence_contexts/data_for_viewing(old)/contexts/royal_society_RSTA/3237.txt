When the background is strongly curved the same prescription of keeping the logarithms
under control forces one to make a distinctively different choice. As one may see from the
effective potential (3.1), in de Sitter space all effective masses contain curvature contributions,
remembering that the scalar curvature in de Sitter space is R= 12H?. A well-behaved choice in
curved space can then be obtained from

The fact that the renormalization group running scale jz gets a contribution from R leads to an
important result: curvature can influence the running of couplings.

A related and equally important curved space effect to curvature induced running is the
generation of the non-minimal term which couples the scalar curvature to the Higgs field ~ER¢”.
The expression for the effective potential (3.1) shows that we chose a non-minimal term to be


present already at tree-level, but from the quantum correction one may see that this is in fact
required by renormalization group running: the f-function for § can be determined from the
coefficients of the logarithms to be
