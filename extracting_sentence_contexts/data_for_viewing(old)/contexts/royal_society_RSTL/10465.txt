parts : thus a basal part or hypopodium may be recognised, which coincides with
ErcuieR's © blattgrund ” : a median, elongated part, the mesopodium, which coincides
with the petiole : and thirdly, an apical part, the epipodium.*

It will be necessary to say a few words upon: the third part of the phyllopodinm,
in order to show how it differs from the © oberblatb” of Eronrer, this being the
essential point in which his method of treatment differs from that which I am
endeavouring to establish, Under the term © oberblatt,” EronieR and GopBEL include
the whole of the upper part of the leaf whether branched or unbranched : supposing
the leaf to be unbranched, the term © oberblatt ” will include precisely the same part
of the leaf as I wish to express by the term © epipodium.” But in the case of branched
leaves, while the term © oberblath” will include the whole of the upper part of the
leaf with its branches, in fact a whole branch-system, I should include under the term
epipodium only the upper part of the phyllopodium with its wings, and exclusive of
its branches of higher order. The difference of application of the terms may seem at
first 8ight s8mall, but beneath it lies an important difference of morphological method.
By ErcHLeR the leaf is treated as one member, which may branch in its upper part ;
under the method which I propose it is treated throughout as a potential branch-
system ; under the former method a sharp distinetion is drawn between the basal part
of the leaf, and the upper part which may or may not branch ; under the latter the
distinction is between the podium, and the branches (if any) which ib bears,

It seemed to me to be important to test the validity of my views as to the mode of
procedure in studying the morphology of the shoot by a series of observations on those
plants of the vascular seriesf which are universally allowed to be lowest in the scale,
