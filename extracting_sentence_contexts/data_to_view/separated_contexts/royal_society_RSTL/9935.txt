It thus represents a comparatively late ontogenetic condition, not even the
radials of the posterior side being separated by an anal plate as in the lyptasterites. There are,doubtless, close affinities and remarkable transition forms between Glyptocrinus
and Reteocrinus, as as8erted by Messrs. WACHSMUTH and SPRINGER. But these
depend very largely upon the characters of the rays and arms, which are of a
comparatively subordinate value ; while the lateral separation of the radials in the
las named genus, and in the /hodocrinites, is a fact of considerable importance in
Crinoid Morphology. It must be remembered also that Glyptocrinus has decided affinities with some of
the earlier Actinocrinide, certain species appearing to be without under-basals. In
fact, according to the American authors, © It is a question whether that genus, ab
least partly, should no be arranged with the other group alt ogether.”
