fig. 31, in which the steles of both roots are visible). Occasionally two roots lie side
by side in the cortical sheath of a third root.

The xylem in the intruded roots (which are all at an early stage of development)
is invariably feebly developed, and the middle zone of the cortex is not differentiated.
In other respects the structure is similar to that of the roots outside. It is remarkable
how well the root-hairs have been preserved, even in the intrusions (Plate 5, figs. 27,
clearly seen with a lens, 28; Plate 6, figs. 41, 43, 46), a fact which suggests that they
continued to function as well as in the roots outside.

The invading roots almost invariably run lengthwise through the petiole. Whether
they grew downwards or upwards, or some in one direction and others in another, is a
question which will be discussed presently. A noteworthy fact about the distribution of
the intruded roots is that they are commonest in the large petioles towards the periphery
of the trunk (see Plate 1), becoming gradually rarer in the thinner petioles towards the
interior.

As the large outer petioles are those of the older leaves cut at a higher level, while
the inner petioles are younger but cut nearer the base, where they are thin, one is
inclined to suspect that the roots grew downwards through the leaf-axis. In spite of
the number of petioles examined, intruded roots were invariably absent from the very
base of the leaf, where it is attached to the stem ; nor are such roots found in any of
the stems, although the latter are literally packed among roots. Moreover, not a single
root has been observed piercing the sclerenchymatous sheath of a rachis, whether from
within or without. These facts, combined with the almost invariably longitudinal
