Furthermore, quantum communications is the : =
backbone for the quantum Internet [6], a network of new devices that will revolutionize the way : =e

we communicate and perform computational tasks. Despite the many advances of fibre-optics quantum communications, a real global-scale
quantum communication network cannot be deployed using only fibre-optics connections. In
fact, the signal attenuation and the polarization-preservation issues render fibre-optic links quite
problematic and limit their lengths to a few hundred kilometres [7]. A possible work-around can
be given by quantum repeaters [8], but the most promising solution to this problem is the use of
space technologies to develop satellite links [9]. Such channels could potentially lead to a global
quantum communication network as they could connect any two points on the Earthâ€™s surface
with reduced propagation losses as compared with terrestrial channels, even in the presence
of noise [10].
