THE MORPHOLOGY OF SPORE-PRODUCING MEMBERS. 197

how certain cells of the columella of a moss, Syntrichia subulata, were found to be
undergoing the tetrad division, prior to forming spores, A similar condition has also
been noted by Krenrrz Grruorr* in a species of Brywm. Upon facts of this order,
together with a general comparison of the sporogonia, a reasonable theory of the
evolution of the more complex from more simple forms of sporogonia may be based,
with progressive sterilisation as the leading feature. Tt will be seen that these cases of sterilisation can be matched among the
Pteridophyta : the facts regarding sterilisation in them, especially those acquired in
this series of Memoirs, will now be briefly summarised. In Lycopodium and Phylloglossum, and in the homosporous Ferns, after the
sporogenous tissue is first defined, all its cells normally undergo the tetrad division,
and develop into spores; occasional cells may become disorganised without full
development, though as a rule all the potentialities are realised.
