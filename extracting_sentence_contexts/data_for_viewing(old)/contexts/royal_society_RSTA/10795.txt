But p’y = 4,1}, ply = — ae 4}, p's = rebew fi, 4} fi, 6}, and
os + dp'o + 4p, = 3's (52 +7),

Therefore the factors are

- (36).
D: (sin) = 1 + gy? (3? — 5)

It is easy to verify that the other coefticients of €? and § are in fact reproduced.

The notation adopted here and below for distinguishing the cosine and sine factors
is perhaps rather clumsy, but I have not thought it worth while to take distinctive
symbols for the factors in these cases, because they will not be of frequent occurrence.
When s = 1,

This must be equal to i 1% y
Now, with upper sign for cosine and lower for sine,
