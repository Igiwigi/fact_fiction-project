ON THE THYROID AND

whole, most probable. The proportion of epithelial to adenoid tissue is perhaps
not greater than is found in the thymus of young birds.* Against the supposition
that they are parathyroid is the fact that embryologists have not observed any
parathyroid in the course of development, and also, from a general view of the
comparative anatomy of the parathyroids throughout vertebrates, one would expect
that in fishes they would be represented by separate structures, lying outside and
independent of the thyroid gland. Mavrert describes epithelial bodies connected
with the gill clefts in fishes, but these seem to have been of a different nature. Mustelus vulgaris has the low type of cell lining the vesicles, which are in this
respect almost identical with those of mammals.
