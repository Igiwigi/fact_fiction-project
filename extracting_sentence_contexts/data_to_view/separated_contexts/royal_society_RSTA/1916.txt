Intrusions being of quite local character, and often irregular in shape, are
more likely to cause sharp changes in the character of the magnetic disturbances
than sedimentary rocks occurring as horizontal or gently dipping sheets. (vii.) Further, it is a well-known fact that in many areas the distribution of
intrusions is intimately related to the faulting, and there is evidence that similar
relationships hold in Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire, so that it is quite possible
that the intrusions really represent fault-intrusions. In such case the sharp nature
of the changes in the character of the disturbances between Rempstone and Lough-
borough, and again between Melton and Asfordby, might be readily explained. The point will be further elaborated below.
