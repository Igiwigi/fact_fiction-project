This original Bayesian-based framework represents an effective engineering approach,
providing an alternative use of the experimental data (short- or long-term field monitoring)
to define a probability distribution over a set of plausible structural models. Although the
methodology has been illustrated for a specific structural typology, that is the historic masonry
towers, the whole procedure may serve as guidance for its application in other structural
typologies. The achieved results, in fact, encourage the extension of this approach to the
safeguarding of different components of the cultural heritage. Data accessibility. This article has no additional data.
