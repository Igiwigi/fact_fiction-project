speculum was fused, and then melted resin was poured in between the plates; tin in
fusion was also applied in the same manner, and the plates moved a little backwards
and forwards. As 800n as from the aspect of the edges of the plates it was certain
that the tin was acting on the speculum metal, the fire was alimost all withdrawn, and
the temperature was not suffered to rise higher. The joints of the plates were now
made straight, and kept open about one-twentieth of an inch by chips of wood ; the
whole was then suffered to cool gradually, and in five days it was ready to be ground.


512 LORD OXMANTOWN ON THE REFLECTING TELESCOPE,

There are here also some points which it is necessary to attend to. The perfect union
of the plates with the brass speculum depends upon the fact, that if a plate of Specu-
lum metal, scraped as directed, is Jaid upon a clean surface of tinned brass, and the
temperature raised a little beyond the fusing point of tin, and then melted resin and
tin applied, the plate of speculum metal will be immediately tinned all over, and
the union of course will be perfect. If resin, however, is applied at the beginning of
the process, and therefore exposed for hours to an increasing temperature, the resin,
before the temperature has reached the proper degree, will have been decomposed, and
will effectually prevent the snccess of the operation. In my earliest experiments, I
was not aware of this fact, and was therefore obliged to turn the plates over repeatedly
with a wooden tongs, to remove the decomposed resin ; and, although where the plates
were small this was practicable, in attempting to manage the plates of the three-feet
speculum I failed: several were broken by unavoidable exposure to variation of
temperature. I may perhaps as well mention, that formerly I tried the muriate of
