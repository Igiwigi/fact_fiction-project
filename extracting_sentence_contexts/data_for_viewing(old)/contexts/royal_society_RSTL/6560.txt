M. Hrrare gives to the equation y=$z the following form,
y=aT+(ar+b)B+(aa*+4bx+6c)C+(aa* +4ba*+6ex+44)D
(T write B, C, D in the place of his T,, T,, T,), and he shows that the transformed equa-
tion in y has the following property : viz., every function of the coefficients which,
expressed as a function of a, b, c, d, e, T, B, C, D, does not contain 'T, is an invariant,
that is, an invariant of the two quantics
(a, b, e, d, eXX, Y)\, (B, C, DYY, —XY.
This comes to saying that if T be s0-determined that in the equation for y the coeffi-
cient of the second term (*) shall yanish, the other coefficients will be invariants; or it,
in the function of y which is equated to zero, we consider y as an absolute constant, the
function of y will be an invariant of the two quantics. It is easy to find the value of T;
this is in fact given by the equation
0=aT+30B+3cC+4D ;
and we have thence for the value of y,
y=(az+0)B+(aX*+4br+ 3c)C+(4a2%+4ba%+6er+30)D ;
80 that for this value of y the function of y which equated to zero gives the transformed
equation will be an invariant of the two quantics. It is proper to notice that in the
last-mentioned expression for y, all the coefficients except those of the term in a*, or
3B+3cC+34D, are those of the binomial (1, 1)', whereas the excepted coefficients are
those of the binomial (1, 1)*; this suffices to 8how what the expression for y is in the

general case,
