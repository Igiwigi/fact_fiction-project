4. Summary and conclusion 3

Figures 2-4 illustrate the particle-size distribution function plotted in accordance with the [8
analytical solution (3.15) (physical parameters of the system under consideration are given in :
[15], Q(t) = A(1 — sin(wt)/2), A = 0.005, and w = 7/15). The first important conclusion is the fact
that the size distribution of crystals strongly depends on the parameter x (compare curves at
different x in figures 2 and 3a,b). It is easily seen that the nonlinear growth rate of particles
in a metastable liquid of crystallizer (expressions (1.1)) substantially changes the particle-size
distribution. Our calculations show that the relative error may exceed tens of per cent in the course
of time for real metastable liquids. As this takes place, the greatest difference of nonlinear growth
law occurs for sufficiently small particles at a fixed time (figures 2a and 3a) and at essentially
large times for particles of a given size (figures 2b and 3b). From the physical point of view, the
nonlinear growth law (1.1) with non-zero x means that the growth rates of evolving crystals
become lower as compared with the case x =0. In other words, we have more crystals in the
supercooled (supersaturated) liquid of a crystallizer, which grow longer until they are removed
from the system (until they reach a given size x0).
