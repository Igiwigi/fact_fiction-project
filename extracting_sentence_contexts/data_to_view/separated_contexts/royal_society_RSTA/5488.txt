Here, we
have demonstrated to what degree ECG classification performance was decreased in the presence
of different physiological noise types, and found that electrode movement and motion artefact
have a bigger impact on performance than baseline wander for attractor images, while networks
trained using scalogram image transforms appear to be more robust (see table 4, overall network
scores). The SPAR attractor method inherently factors out baseline wander (see [20] for details)
which may account for the smaller performance decrease for baseline wander. This result for
baseline wander may also be partially due to the fact that some of the ECG signals were short
(less than 10 s) so only a minimal amount of baseline wander could be applied. When the network trained on clean data was used to classify images from the different
noisy datasets, performance measured by F1 score decreased minimally for both image types
when baseline wander was applied (less than 0.04). When motion artefact, electrode movement
or all types of noise combined were added to the input data, classification performance using
the network trained on clean data decreased by approximately 0.1 for the scalograms and
approximately 0.2 for the attractors.
