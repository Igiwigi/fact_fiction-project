The best ascertained plant virus mutations, viz. those of common tobacco mosaic to
yellow mosaic, can be observed under normal conditions of temperature and the like
in every infected plant if kept long enough. There is no means of even guessing the
frequency of such mutation in terms of virus particles, but McKinney’s investigations
suggest that it cannot be a very rare occurrence. There is good evidence that a plant
virus with appropriate treatment may be induced to mutate at an increased pace.
Such acceleration we have seen happen when X is introduced into a member of the
family Chenopodiaceae or, in the case of the Y virus, when it is passed through
Schizanthus and possibly also when certain treatment is applied to root fibres of
infected plants.

It should be observed, however, that although virus mutations must be accepted as
facts, it does not follow that a mutation has taken place every time a change of reaction
is observed in an apparently pure line. A change, even a sudden change in reaction,
may be due to selective agency operating on a mixture of strains. We have seen that an

artificial mixture in which X° and X% are mixed in proportions of 9:1 induces a

development of X¢ and encourage that of X° in such a mixture will bring about a more
or less rapid change in the clinical picture from X° to X$. Any factor which induced an
