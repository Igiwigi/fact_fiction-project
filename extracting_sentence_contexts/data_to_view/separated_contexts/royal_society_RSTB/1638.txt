Similar
hemorrhages we have observed in the pons, and in various regions of the corona
radiata far from the track of the bullet. Such effects are well shown in Fig. 14,
Occasionally some hemorrhage may be found in the pia mater and choroid plexus of
the fourth ventricle, and this without any hemorrhage into the lumen of the ventricle. The mechanism of the production of the intraventricular hemorrhages is probably
that first described by Durer as “ choc céphalo-rachidien,” and which consists in the
fact that the cerebro-spinal fluid (being incompressible) of necessity transmits directly
to the structures of the fourth ventricle any pressure applied to it in the cerebral
hemispheres. In the present instance the motion of the bullet produces a direct
effect by the energy it imparts to the cerebro-spinal fluid. ConcLusIons.
