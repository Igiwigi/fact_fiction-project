portion of the magnesian constituent. 'The amount of one equivalent of enstatite to
three of augite that this explanation would require, is more than microscopic observations
would warrant ; and it is probable that the augite itself is richer in magnesium than is
usnal in terrestrial augites.

The small amount of the oxide that in this augite corresponds to the ingredient of
Osbornite that T identify with a titanoid metal, is met with in the precipitate by ammonia
from the solution of the bases, and is included with the iron oxide in the above analyses.

VII. Enstatite as & Constituent of the Busti Meteorite.

Besides the augitic mineral that has just been described, there is present in this
meteorite another silicate which is in fact its most important ingredient. 'The augite is
present in greatest quantity in the nodule that contains the calcium sulphide, though it
is met with in smaller amount in the other parts of the meteorite. But associated with
it everywhere, and otherwise forming the mass of the stone, is the mineral I have next
to describe. As een in a microscopic section, it presents the appearance of a number
of more or less fissured crystals with different degrees of transparency, sometimes quite
clear, sometimes nearly opaque, and with a more or less symmetrical polygonal outline.
'These crystals are imbedded in a magma of fine-grained silicate, through which a sort of
irregular meshwork of an opaque white mineral is een to ramify. When the ingredients
