In
hing the process of digestion in Ameba, I have often seen the enclosure of such
ve infusoria as monads. And in the notes on these observations (made some years
) I find frequent mention of the fact that a monad continued to move in the
quole of ingestion for 5, 7, or 10 minutes, and thus was suddenly and finally
siaced to quiescence ; the statement seems to afford. a parallel to the sequence of
igression, quiescence, and aggregation in Carchesium (2). (b) Again I was struck,
at that time, by the cohesion of ingesta during solution.
