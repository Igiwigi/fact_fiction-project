From figures 5 and 6, it can be seen that, if T=O(1), then an approximate formula (3.35) : =
provided a quite accurate description of the transport of radioactive contaminant in the fracture [3
surrounded by the porous medium, where anomalous diffusion takes place. Moreover, the : oe
accuracy of the approximate solution (3.35) increases with time t and also when y approaches 1, :8
which confirms the delta-like nature of the function y, (t). In addition, according to the numerical : s
experiments, it can be seen that contribution of the diffusive transport into the coupled advectionâ€” 18

diffusion process in the fracture increases with increasing parameter A. The effect of diffusion
also increases with decreasing parameter y. It occurs due to the fact that for smaller values of y,
penetration of the contaminant into the porous matrix is intensified, which leads to the reduction
in the concentration gradient in the fracture. Hence, at certain moments of time T, the effects of
advection and diffusion are of similar magnitude within the advective-diffusive mass transport
in the fracture.

After obtaining the formula for solute concentration in the fracture, if necessary, concentration
within the porous matrix can be also readily computed by the formula (1.46).
