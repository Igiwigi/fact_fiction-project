region is one sui generis.” “ On the-other hand,” Neat continues, “ Donen (’90) and
Mrrropuanow (93) have stated, like the present author, that they find the crest
continuous in the two regions.”

Braver (’04) has recently investigated the development of the cephalic neural

crest, and more particularly that of the Trigeminus ganglion, in the Gymnophiona.
In his text-figures and descriptions, the differentiation from the neural crest of three
ganglionic lobate expansions, much as we have shown to occur in Ornithorhynchus,
becomes manifest (cf: eg., his text-fig. B). Were it not for the fact of the association
of this phase of ganglionic development with the uprising of medullary folds, the
resemblance to the condition in the neurular stage of the Monotreme would be even
more striking.

In reference to trigeminal development, Brauer claims to demonstrate that the
ophthalmic portion of the Trigeminus-ganglion complex has both a separate and
a different origin from that of the maxillo-mandibular component. The former
originates solely from a thickened epidermal placode, and receives no contribution
from the neural crest. The latter, on the other hand, is exclusively a product of the
neural crest, and receives no addition of epidermal elements.

No indication of double origin, in this sense, of the Trigeminus ganglion in
