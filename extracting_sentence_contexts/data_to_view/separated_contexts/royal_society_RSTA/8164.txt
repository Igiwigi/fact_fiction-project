From the comparatively high phosphorus content of 0-108 per cent. in No. 31/D.4
there seems no doubt that wrought iron was used as the base. Of the high carbon alloys, each of those analysed is comparatively low in phosphorus
and, except in the case of specimen No. 32/D.5, remarkably uniform, namely between
0-030 and 0-032, No. 32/D.5 containing 0-051 per cent. The possibility that

No. 20/C.1-9 may represent some of the base material used in making the high carbon
steels was therefore made more probable by this fact. Special care was in the circum-
stances taken with this specimen, the sample for analysis being taken by drilling along the
central axis so as to preserve the exterior appearance. Prior micro-examination of a transverse section, however, disclosed segregation
of carbon.
