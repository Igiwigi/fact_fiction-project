The basic difficulty, of course, is the inapplicability of the principle of superposition.

& Rayleigh (1916) attacked the two-dimensional problem by a method of successive approxi-
3 mation, but even in the case of flow past a circular cylinder he was not able to proceed very
6 far. Bryan (1918) suggested a semi-graphical method which has not in fact led to results.
& Taylor & Sharman (1928) utilized an electrical analogue to obtain solutions by experiment: © their method is one of ‘cut-and-try’, and was not successful when the local speed of sound

Was exceeded at any point. This being the state of theory, a numerical method which is general will have value even
though it be incapable of giving very exact results.
