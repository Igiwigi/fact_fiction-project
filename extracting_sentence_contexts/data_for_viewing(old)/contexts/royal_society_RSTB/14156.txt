What drives the extraordinary human investment in inter-
action? Alloparenting, the outsourcing of infant care, depends
on building bonds within social groups, and such bonds
would also have been crucial in the earliest phases of hominin
cooperative scavenging and hunting [88,89]. The multiple child-
hood attachments offered by alloparenting would have
facilitated the acquisition of skills and information crucial to
building cultural adaptations. There were probably multiple
incentives of this sort for investing in interactional partners. In
addition, Dunbar has suggested that language, because of its
broadcast character, arose as a form of mass grooming, so knit-
ting together large groups. However, this neglects both the fact
that chimpanzees often groom in large chains [90], and that
human conversational huddles are mostly in the twos or
threes. However, pointing to the primary social functions of
language is surely correct. Studies suggest that around two-
thirds of what is discussed in informal conversation concerns
social relationships [86,91]. The central role that social naviga-
tion plays in human social life is reflected in the way
languages have elaborated conventions for signalling social
relationships, for example, the elaborate honorifics of Japanese
or Javanese, or in English the many indirect request forms (Can
I..., Could I possibly..., Would it by any chance be possible...etc.)
which achieve the same sort of effect. One of the central func-
