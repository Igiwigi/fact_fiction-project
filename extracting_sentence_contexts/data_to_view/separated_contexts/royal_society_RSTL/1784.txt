1. Tur rapid decay of the copper sheeting of His Majesty's
ships of war, and the uncertainty of the time of its duration,
have long attracted the attention of those persons most con-
cerned in the naval interests of the country, Having had
my enquiries directed to this important object by the Com-
missioners of the Navy Board, and a Committee of the Royal
Society having been appointed to consider of it, I entered into
an experimental investigation of the causes of the action of
sea water upon copper. In pursuing this investigation, I
have ascertained many facts which I think not unworthy of
the notice of the Royal Society, as they promise to illustrate
some obscure parts of electro-chemical science ; and likewise
seem to offer important practical applications. 2. It has been generally supposed that sea water had little
or no action on pure copper, and that the rapid decay of the
copper on certain ships was owing to its impurity.
