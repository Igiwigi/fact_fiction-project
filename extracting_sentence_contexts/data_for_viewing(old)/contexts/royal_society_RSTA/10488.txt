IMPARTED TO A VACUUM BY HOT CONDUCTOR 543

with enormous rapidity in the neighbourhood of the absolute zero; so that, although
the resistance of metals decreases steadily with decreasing temperature down to the
lowest temperatures yet reached, it is quite possible that it becomes infinite again at
the absolute zero. The fact that the resistance of pure metals is proportional to the
absolute temperature over a wide range, together with the high values of m which
prevail at ordinary temperatures, seems to indicate that for most metals & has
practically reached its maximum value, where it varies only slightly with 0.

For this reason we are led to the conclusion that the discrepancies of 1 are not
due so much to disturbances produced by its temperature-variation (except, perhaps,
in the case of carbon) as to the fact that the exponential coefficient b is a function of
6. We have seen that b = ©/R, where ® is the work done by a corpuscle in escaping
from the metal, and R is the gas constant for a single corpuscle. Now
R= 35 X 107" roughly, and b = 5 x 107 for platinum, so that ® is approximately
equal to 107!,

A second approximation to the value of ® is obtained when we consider the nature
of the forces which retain the corpuscles inside the metal. These are a sort of
integrated effect of the attractions of the positive and negative ions scattered about
in the metal near the corpuscle. The field would thus be much the same as if
the corpuscles were surrounded by a perfect spherical conductor of molecular
dimensions. The quantity ® is therefore of the same order as the energy required to
remove a corpuscle from inside such a charged sphere, which is 3¢*/, where e is the
