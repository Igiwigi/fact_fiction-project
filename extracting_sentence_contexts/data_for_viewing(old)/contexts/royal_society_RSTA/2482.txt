An image sensor’s shutter determines how and when light gets recorded during an exposure. : S

Typically, there are two methods to capture a static picture or each frame of a video signal. One is
called the rolling shutter and the other called global shutter. Although both technologies record
ight within a necessary time interval, not every portion of the image starts and stops receiving
ight at the same time. As used in popular complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
cameras, a rolling shutter is exposed in a progressive step, in fact line by line from top to bottom.

Figure 7 illustrates details of the rolling shutter process in successive image recording. As can
be seen from this figure, the start and end of exposure on each row or column or individual pixel
happen sequentially. So all the pixels are not exposed at the same time. It can take time up to
1/fcam for all of the pixels on the sensor to finish exposure where fcam is the frame rate. The effect
will be noticed if the object is moving fast, causing a jello effect and damage to the image quality.
However, one can take advantage of the rolling shutter mechanism in an OCC system to increase
the sampling rate of the receiver [33,34,37,41,51,76-83].

Figure 8 demonstrates an operation process of an OCC system with sequential data
transmission by the LED transmitter and signal reception by a rolling shutter-based sensor.
Figure 8a shows sequential data transmission by a commercial white LED at a rate of kHz. When
