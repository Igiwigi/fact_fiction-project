Similarly, I see no resemblance between a synangium of Psilotum or a strobilus of Spheno-
phyllum and a simple terminal sporangium of Stauropteris, which, indeed, is more like that
of Asteroxylon. The discovery of the heterosporous nature of Stauropteris has further com-
plicated the matter. Stauropteris is, in fact, remarkable in showing a strange combination of characters of
different groups, a fact which perhaps explains the difficulty in assigning to it a correct
position in the plant world. In some respects it resembles the Psilophytales, from which
it has most probably evolved. At the same time it also shares some important characters
with the Zygopterideae.
