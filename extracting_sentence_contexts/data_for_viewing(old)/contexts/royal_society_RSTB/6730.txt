The single axon of each giant cell passes dorso-medially and backwards into the
palliovisceral ganglion, and its very numerous dendrites spread throughout the giant
cell lobe. The greatest overall length from the tip of the most ventral dendrite to
what may be considered as the origin of the axon was found to be about 750,, after

fixation, in a specimen of L. pealii of mantle length 25 cm. The greatest diameter of the
same cell was 150. The nucleus has diameter 35 (with a nucleolus of 8) and is thus
very small, in fact little larger than that of one of the much smaller neurons nearby.

Surrounding the nucleus there can be seen in preparations fixed in Flemmingâ€™s
fluid to be a mass of fuchsinophil granules (fig. 4 and fig. 25, Plate 43). Similar
granules occur in all cephalopod neurons (Young 1932). They are dissolved away
by procedures which do not preserve fatty substances, leaving large empty spaces
(fig. 22, Plate 43).

Around these granules lies the Nissl substance, which is curiously small in amount,
and stains less strongly than that of the neighbouring neurons. After fixation it
appears as a finely granular substance, broken up, especially towards the periphery of
the cell, into flakes or blocks, similar to the Nissl granules of a vertebrate ventral horn
cell. From the main central mass of the substance tongues project both into the axon
