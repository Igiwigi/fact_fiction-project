are to be a S,, represents the operation of moving one letter from the s‘* row
of the tableau up to the 7 row, and the resulting term is taken to be zero when
any row becomes less than a row below it or when letters from the same row overlap. In fact, when cycles of degree r are replaced by the symbol s, this equation becomes

become zero or negative.
