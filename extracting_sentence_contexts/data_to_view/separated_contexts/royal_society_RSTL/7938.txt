Although the wave-length A is a function
of the size and shape of the resonator only, 7 or the position of the note in the musical
scale depends on the nature of the gas with which the resonator is filled. And it is
important to notice that it is on the nature of the gas in and near the opening that the
note depends, and not on the gas in the interior of the reseryoir, whose inertia does not
come into play during vibrations corresponding to the fundamental note. In fact we

may say that the mass to be moyed is the air in the neighbourhood of the opening, and
that the air in the interior acts merely as a spring in virtue of its resistance to compres-
