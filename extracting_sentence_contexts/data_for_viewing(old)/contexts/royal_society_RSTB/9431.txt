ducing populations [41]. Selection for rapid spermatogenesis is
one mechanism that can make males evolve to ‘accept’ higher
cancer risk [42]; thus sexual conflict in species with multiple
matings can involve conflict over how cancer risk is managed,
in addition to many other life-history features [43].

Finally, theory predicts that the force of natural selection
on life-history traits such as body size and on cancer protec-
tion mechanisms will be age-specific [44,45]. Future models
should explore how age-specific extrinsic mortalities (e.g. pre-
dation, disease) and cancer dynamics interact to produce
both life-history and anti-cancer traits [39]. For instance, it
is an empirical fact that cancer incidence increases at older
ages in humans, and the interplay of the cumulative probabil-
ities derived here and the lowered force of selection at
advanced ages [46] merits further attention. It would be inter-
esting to know if this same effect is manifested in life-history
traits such as cell replacement rate (the ‘pace of life’), and
whether selection on early-life performance contributes to
increased incidence in cancers late in life: this would be a
cancer-oriented twist on theories of ageing [45,46]. As these
and other unexplored phenomena are inherently complex,
they will require mathematical models to yield empirically
testable predictions.
