Fig. 28 is a section of one of the rows of large teeth from the centre of the scale. In this specimen, from which the lower laminz have been accidentally detached, as
is usnally the case, the tubercles are deyeloped into the form of regular pointed
dermal teeth, each having a pulp-cavity, fig. 28 a, from which spring small branching
tubes, 28 b, like those seen in the dermal teeth of ordinary Placoids, Each one ex-
hibits a laminated structure like that seen in the true teeth of reptiles, the lamellae
being arranged as a snccession of cones, having evidently been formed by the addi-
tion of new internal layers organized around the soft pulp. In fact, it is only one
of the laminated tubercles of the operculum, fig. 26 a, drawn out vertically ; the len-
ticular space, fig. 26 c, being also elongated in the form of a true pulp-cavity, whilst,
in consequence of this modification of the external contour, the Jamella have assumed
the appearance of a 8vecession of cones inclosing each other. At the base of each
tooth we 8till find the radiating canals, fig. 28 4, communicating with the exterior of
the scale, as in those of the operculum. Fig. 28e represents the externally grooved appearance of each tooth, the section
not having passed completely through its centre.
