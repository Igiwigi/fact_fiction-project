argue that researchers across disciplines should adopt the
term ‘evolution’ when describing the evolution of antibiotic
resistance in bacteria.

(b) Eco-evolutionary dynamics

The potential for eco-evolutionary feedback loops in deter-
mining the interaction between ecological and evolutionary
dynamics has been increasingly recognized in recent years
[23-27]. While the potential of species to adapt to ecological
conditions has long been realized, the effect of rapid evol-
utionary change on ecological dynamics is still poorly
understood. In part, this is due to the fact that traditionally
evolution has been viewed as a slow process operating at a
timescale that is very different from ecological time [28].
From such a perspective, ecological dynamics would play
out as if evolution was not occurring, as evolutionary
change would be non-significant on the ecological time-
scale. Likewise, short-term fluctuations in ecological variables
would average out over evolutionary timescales, and only the
long-term average would affect evolution [29]. However, it is
becoming increasingly clear that evolutionary change can be
extremely rapid, in the case of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
practically instantaneous, and there are compelling examples
of this in a diversity of traits ranging from life histories to
