previously supplied by the stapedial artery.

In the primitive state the branches of the first branchial arch artery accompany the
divisions of the trigeminal nerve. These peripheral branches would not alter if only the main
stem of the primitive mandibular artery were replaced by the stapedial artery. The supra-
orbital division of the stapedial artery would then have an extensive intracranial course
from the petrous bone to the orbit; this intracranial course of the supra-orbital division is
seen in Arctomys (Tandler 1899).

The relationsip of the ramus anastomoticus to the mandibular nerve in all the animals
studied, the fact that it lies opposite or nearly opposite to the inferior dental artery (in the
goat, the inferior dental artery has been seen to arise from the ramus anastomoticus), and
further the fact that the ramus anastomoticus gives off the middle meningeal artery, all
suggest that this ramus or its homologue and the inferior dental artery are remnants of the
mandibular branch of the stapedial artery.

As has been suggested above, the supra-orbital division of the stapedial artery in the rat
probably corresponds to the external ophthalmic artery of other species. However, its
peripheral distribution is that of a true supra-orbital division of the stapedial artery and

in this animal the intracranial portion has been lost while the supra-orbital division has
acquired a secondary communication with the infra-orbital division as the latter vessel
