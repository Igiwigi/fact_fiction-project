of AP spectrum of figure 8; their expressions are reported in table 3 as well. The order adopted in
the table reflects increasing frequency for chosen parameter values, i.e. F,,; < f,,;41 and F pi< Spitt-

In the following, we provide a short description of the transfer function for each case.

(a) Intracellular-passive sensor: the TF has two zeros, one in the origin (k= 1) and one in
the MHz regime (equation (4.3) in table 3, thus not visible in figure 8), and four poles. The low
frequency fyi and fp2 shape the bandwidth as depicted in figure 8. The remaining poles fall above
the upper frequency limit of the figure (equations (4.6) and (4.7) in table 3). The in-band gain is
set by capacitive and resistive dividers according to equation (4.2) in table 3. To maximize the
gain and reduce distortion (i.e. to widen the flat portion of the TFs by making f,1 small and f,2
high), Ramp, Ryjseal and Cnano should be large, and Cstray and Camp small according to equations
(4.4) and (4.5). In fact, a low fy (e.g. for large values of the sealing resistance) filters out the high-
frequency signal components, thus slowing the Vout transients and making it appear spread out
