arded as entitled to principal considerartion, inasmuch as their derivation is much more
Firect than in the cases either of the Inclination or of the Total Force. To this it may
"Be added that, in comparing the declination-phenomena at Kew and Hobarton, we have
he adyantage of a somewhat larger series of observations than is the case either in the
clination or in the Total Force, as the hourly observations of the Declination at
obarton in 1841 and 1842 are available for the purpose, in addition to those of the
— —_ years 1843-1848 ; making together eight years of the Declination, whilst we
"Eve only six years of either the Horizontal or the Vertical Force. In all cases, how-
Fer, and whether from Kew, Hobarton, or elsewhere, the numerical values which we
may derive in regard to the lunar influence can only be regarded as approximations ;
d as indicating generally what we may expect will be accomplished by a further per-
'Syerance, rather than as preferring a claim to present or immediate precision. With
is reservation we may view the facts regarding the moon's influence on the magnetic
clination at Kew and Hobarton as placing beyond doubt the existence, at this parti-
= epoch in the great cycle of the variations of the terrestrial magnetism, of a lunar-
wrmal variation which has two equal or very nearly equal progressions, both in time
j in amount; producing consequently two easterly and two westerly maxima of
Feflection in every lunar day, with four nodal epochs, occurring also at nearly equal
Ktervals of lunar time, in which the direction of the magnet due to other causes is
Endisturbed by the moon's influence. The lunar hours of extreme deflection at Kew
d Hobarton are 1, 7, 13, and 19; 1 and 13 being the westerly extremes at Kew and
Fsterly at Hobarton ; the nodal hours, or those in which the lunar influence is inope-
\rative in producing deflection, are, as nearly as can be judged, strictly intermediate
between the times of extreme deflection ; viz., between 4 and 5, 10 and 11, 16 and 17,
22 and 23 hours. The amounts of the extreme deflections, measured by the mean of all
