these strain components, we can construct 3 x 3 strain tensor and obtain principle axes or
eigenvectors of the tensor for 7") <0 atoms, then evaluate the maximum shear direction as
unstable deformation mode [16].

In the present study, this mode analysis is applied to mode I crack along the bi-metal
(001) interface of Fe/W, Fe/Ni, Fe/Co and Ti/Mg. There are enormous MD studies on crack
propagation in single crystal including our AES analysis on Fe [12], Si [13], Mg [14] and 3C-
SiC [15]; however, a few studies treat the crack propagation along the bi-metal interface. Liu et al.
investigate the influence of alloying elements Re, Co and W on the crack propagation along the
Ni/NigjAl interface [18]. Zhou et al. study the crack propagation along the Al/SiC interfaces [19].
Zhang et al. discuss the crack propagation along the twist boundary of nano-nickel bi-crystal [20].
Elzas and Thijsse propose a cohesive law for crack growth along Fe/precipitate interfaces [21]. In
fact, spontaneous cracking along the bi-metal interface cannot be expected since the rupture occurs
in either side of lower surface energy and elastic constants, as reported in our previous study on
adhesion of Ni/Al interface [22]. However, some impurities such as oxide and precipitate could
initiate cracking along interfaces. Thus we introduce an ideal crack along the bi-metal interface by
virtual force shield. It is also noted that our main purpose is not to discuss the obtained behaviour
as real material but to explore the physical meaning of AES in various phenomena with model
material. We adopt the embedded atom method (EAM) potential by Zhou et al. [23], of which
basic characteristics are clarified in the previous static analysis [24].

In the framework of the EAM potential, the energy contribution of atom a, E", is defined as,
