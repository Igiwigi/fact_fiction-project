into a large number of current sheets that are scattered throughout the loop volume [59]. These
sheets can then reconnect to heat the plasma. This is an example where the individual events in


a nanoflare storm are activated by a single source, rather than being the result of an avalanche
(although the formation of multiple current sheets is not yet fully understood and may have an
avalanche-like quality). Another interesting aspect is that the kinking of one loop, or strand, can
trigger the kinking of another nearby [60].

Tl. Chromospheric nanoflares are not a primary source of coronal plasma

Heating is expected to occur at all heights in the solar atmosphere, including but not limited to the
corona. In fact, the heating requirements of the chromosphere are much larger than those of the
corona [29]. This suggests the interesting possibility that coronal plasma comes not from heating
in the corona but from heating in the chromosphere. If chromospheric plasma is directly heated
to coronal temperatures and ejected upward, might this explain much of what we observe in the

corona? : =

We have looked at this question carefully and concluded that the answer is no [61-64]. When : =
chromospheric plasma is heated impulsively to, e.g. 2 MK, its pressure suddenly increases by two : B
orders of magnitude. This leads to an explosive expansion upward along the magnetic field at : a
several hundred kilometres per second. The expanding plasma cools at a tremendous rate, simply 22
from the work done by expansion, i.e. even if the expansion is adiabatic and excludes radiative [4
and conductive cooling. We have computed spectral line profiles of Fe XII (195) and Fe XIV (274) : Aas
