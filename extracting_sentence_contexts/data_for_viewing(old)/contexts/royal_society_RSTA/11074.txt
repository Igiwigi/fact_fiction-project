value for sulphur be taken, the 6 will be slightly greater, and the melting point of
gold will be raised a few degrees above 1062°, lower temperatures being raised by a
corresponding amount. This correction can be made at any time, but as it does not
affect the argument of the present paper, we have not thought it necessary to apply

it. We give the platinum temperature pt, that is, 100 x Roa because this,
