(3.) By aid of the twenty stations dealt with in this paper, a fair appreciation
can be obtained of the barometric frequency at any place whatever in the British
Isles by means of interpolation.

For example :—A line from Hillington on the Wash to a point midway between
St. Leonards and Southampton strikes the south coast between Littlehampton and
Worthing, cuts the generalised isobars so that they make approximately equal angles
with it, and passes very nearly at one-third and two-thirds distances through

‘ambridge and London. Thus, if the St. Leonards constants were based on a longer
period and so somewhat more satisfactory,* we might fairly accurately predict the
constants of the Cambridge and London frequencies from those of Hillington,
Southampton, and St. Leonards. We find, as a matter of fact, by interpolation :

| Mean height. Standard deviation. Skewness.

| Dondonays! erie 29-969 0°330 0165
Cambridge. . . .| 29°956 0:336 0-176

Actual calculation for thirteen years at these stations corresponding to the years
used for Southampton and Hillington gives :—
