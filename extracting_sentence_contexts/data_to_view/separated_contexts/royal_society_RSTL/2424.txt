HERSCHEL's account of the

even when thus magnified, is still equivocal ; and its mag-
netism, if it exist, can hardly be estimated at a thousandth
part of that of copper, and is probably till lower.

24. The reduction of the metals to filings or to powder,
was found to produce a still more striking diminution of their
magnetic energy ; and a class of experiments of great in-
terest, as to the effect of the agglutination of these powders by
metallic and non-metallic cements and liquids, immediately
presents itself, into which want of leisure only has hitherto
prevented our entering, as well as on the important subject of
the magnetism of metallic alloys and atomic combinations, with
which this branch of the enquiry is essentially connected.

25. When we come to reason on the above facts, much
caution is doubtless necessary to avoid over-hasty generali-
zation. Whoever has considered the progress of our know-
ledge respecting the magnetic yirtue, which, first supposed to
belong only to iron and its compounds, was at length reluc-
tantly conceded to nickel and cobalt, though in a much
weaker degree—then suspected to belong to titanium, and
now extended, apparently with an extraordinary range of
degrees of intensity to all the metals—will hardly be inclined
to stop short here, but will readily admit, at least the proba-
bility, of all bodies in nature participating in it more or less. Yet if the electro-dynamical theory of magnetism be well
founded, it is difficult to conceive how that internal circula-
tion of electricity, which has been regarded as necessary for
the production of magnetism, can be excited or maintained in
non-conducting bodies.
