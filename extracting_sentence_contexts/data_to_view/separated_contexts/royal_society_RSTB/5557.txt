JB. tor is a muscular fish which, like the salmon, can swim against swift
current. These three species are common in the plains, and there is no doubt that the
fish of the plateau are derived from those of the plains; in fact, B. tor ascends every
year for breeding purposes. As other instances the peculiar fish of the group Schizo-
thoracine, Cobitide, Sisoride, ete., of the Highlands of Central Asia may be cited. There is no doubt that all these fish have been derived from those that frequent the
slopes of the Himalayas.
