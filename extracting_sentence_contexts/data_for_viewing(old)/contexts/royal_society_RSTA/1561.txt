Figure 5. The SIs histograms are given for different x at the autaptic conductance, « = 0.2mS cm~2. In panel (a) t = 20 ms,
(6) c = 30 msand (c) t = 41 ms. (The readers should pay attention to the axis scale of each subplot.) When the autaptic time
delay equals approximately the period of weak signal 7, ~ 21 ms and its integer multiples, the ISls reflecting the electrical
activity of the neuron exhibit a harmony with the weak signal, implying high Q in figures 3 and 4. (¢ = 0.45, w = 0.3 ms~').

oscillation period of the H-H neurons, so the obtained Q value is high. The reason behind these
results can be explained as follows: autapse adds an extra time scale to the electrical activity of
an H-H neuron, and when this time scale matches the intrinsic oscillations period of the neuron
and the period of weak signal a resonance occurs. This fact induces high Q at the output of the
H-H neuron.

(c) The effects of inhibitory autapse on chaotic resonance

Some studies have revealed that the autaptic transmission can be realized through an inhibitory
autapse [39]. In this context, the effects of inhibitory autapse were reported in various studies. For
example, Pinto et al. [40] showed that inhibitory autapse enhances anticipated synchronization
in unidirectionally coupled neurons. In another study, it was demonstrated that autaptic
