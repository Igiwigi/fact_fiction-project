Sreak gets more rapid ib is found that the fluctuating portion of the discharge becomes
and less developed, and the discharge more and more nearly consists of the first
DSortion only. It is a matter of observation that as we attain to svill higher rapidity of
reak-action this becomes more and more the case, and that at very high speeds the
Fjscharge reduces itself to this firsb portion alone ; and thus we understand how it is
Ehat with a very high-speed break we obtain the most intensely sensitive discharges
From a coil.
= Tb will thus be observed that all the methods of producing the sensibive state agree
ot only im the intermittent character of the discharge, but also in the shortness
-f duration of the individual discharges themselves,* and his it is which has induced
e authors of this paper to consider brevity of duration as much an essential feature of
> individual discharges that produce the sensitive state, as rapidity or regularity of
terval between these discharges. The latter characteristics are, in fact, of more
portance for maintaining the persistence of the sensitive state during a finite interval
of time than for actually producing it, smce careful experiments fail to show any
inferior limit of rapidity of the periodicity necessary to produce such a discharge, In
* These faint sensitive striw projecting beyond the luminous column in a coil discharge, are the only
cage of a sensitive discharge of which the authors of the present paper are aware which is not produced by
one or other of the methods previously described.
f These remarks may seem to be inapplicable to the case of the HoLrz machino with the wheel-break ;
for here the intervals during which the tube forms part of the circuit are usually equal to those during
which it is nob 80. But it does not follow that the electricity is passing through tho tube during the whole

of the time that the tube is in circuit. For i will nob commence to pass until there has been such a
charging up of the terminals as is suflicient to effect a discharge.
