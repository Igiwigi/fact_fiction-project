PISTILLATA (PI) and UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO) are strongly = &

also in our male arrl7 CRISPR lines (figure 1b). This can, upregulated in arr77 CRISPR mutants on day 20. Volcano plot showing

however, be explained by the fact that the arrl7 CRISPR 29 549 expressed genes. Significantly differentially expressed genes (female S

lines present a male phenotype due to a loss of function versus arrl7 CRISPR lines) at day 20 (pag < 0.05 and abs(log,FC > 1.5)) &

mutation of the ARR17 gene at the protein level and not are depicted in red. P/ and UFO are highlighted by filled symbols.
