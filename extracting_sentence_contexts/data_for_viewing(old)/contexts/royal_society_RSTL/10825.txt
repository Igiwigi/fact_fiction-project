even for the same battery and transmitter : it seems to be influenced by the direction
of the current between the electrodes only when these are of unequal size.

Now it is well known that part at least of the resistance included under the term
© polarization,” is dependent on the state of res or motion of the liquid at the surfaces
of the electrodes ; and if changes occur in the motion, rectilinear or rotatory, of the
Jet particles, such changes might certainly influence this mechanical polarization, and
thereby affect the strength of the current. I have already given one experiment
which shows that vibrations induce changes in the relative velocity of the particles
along the axis of the jet. The following experiment furnishes an additional proof.
Just as the impact of a vibrating air-jet, playing in air against an orifice, may excite
ound, 80 the impact of a water jet playing against electrodes immersed in water, may
excite electrical undulations. In fact if both jet tube and electrodes of a polarizing
transmitter be immersed in_a vessel containing the same fluid with which the jet is
supplied, the transmitter will not cease to operate, provided that the electrodes are
brought much eloser to the orifice : for the continuous portion of the jet now becomes
much shortened, owing to friction against the surrounding fluid. The diagram
(fig. 10) represents the most striking form of the experiment.

The jet plays against the exposed end of a fine platinum wire, P, firmly embedded
in the centre of a small ebonite rod, R, which passes through the bottom of the trough
T. A side tube, L, carries off the overflow from the trough. The end of the
wire P, and a small platinum plate Q immersed in the liquid of the trough, form
the electrodes between which the current is passed (in either direction), The
telephonic effects with this arrangement are exactly similar in kind to those
