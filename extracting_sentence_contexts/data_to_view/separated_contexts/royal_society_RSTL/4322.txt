The 23rd of October was another day of strong deflections, and a partial register
was kept of them in London by Mr. Harcutr. They were equally strong on the
Midland line, and I have accounts of them as far as Newecastle. The 24th being
Sunday, there was no register kept; but they continued on the 25th, and were again
registered by Mr. HaTcuzs in London, who has favoured me with his observations ;
but beyond the fact of the unusual disturbance, they throw no additional light on
this snbject.

66 MR, W. H. BARLOW ON THE SPONTANEOUS ELECTRICAL CURRENTS

I have no magnetic observations on the 23rd, 24th, or 25th of October, but I have
since learnt that an unusual magnetic disturbance occurred on these days, and there
appears no doubt of the coincidence of these great disturbances in both instruments. On the three occasions mentioned, namely, the 19th of March, the 24th and 25th
of September, and the 23rd, 24th and 25th of October, aurora was visible; and in
every case which has come under my observation, the telegraph needles have been
deflected whenever aurora has been visible,

It only remains now to describe the experiments made to ascertain the line of
direction in which the currents alternate, and it will serve to render this part of the
subject more clear, to state in this place that, from numerous experiments, it appears
that from whatever cause the currents are produced, the direction of the current at
a given time in any wire depends on the relative positions of the earth connections,
if the insulation is good, however circuitous may be the route of the wire itself.
