In the adult animal the symphyseal
region has been resorbed, and the isolation of the palatine processes would follow
directly. The frequent existence of separate ossification centres in the palatal processes
of the premaxillary of mammals is not, in itself, good evidence that these parts
represent once separate elements; in the pig (as summarized by de Beer 1937, p. 336)
the maxilla ossifies from no less than five separate centres including two in its palatine
process. In point of fact fragmentation of dermal bones is rare and the assumption
that it occurs in Ornithorhynchus must be based largely on the relative simplicity of
the resulting interpretation, set against the difficulties which arise if it is denied. There is some precedent to be found in the parietals of man which, unlike those of other
mammals, ossify from two pairs of centres which occasionally fail to fuse in the adult. So far evidence about which there is important difference of opinion has been
avoided or discarded, but there is one set of observations which takes on a new
importance at this stage.
