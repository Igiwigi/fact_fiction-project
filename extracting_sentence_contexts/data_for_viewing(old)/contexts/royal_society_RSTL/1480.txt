was found to be just able, singly, to counterbalance- the light
of the lamp ; and this was found to happen when it had
arrived at the distance of 43,4 inches.


measuring the comparative Intensities of Light. 87

In this experiment, as the candles burnt with equal bright-
ness, it is evident that the intensities of their united and sIngle
lights were as 2 to 1, and in tliat proportion ought, according
to the assumed theory, the squares of the distances, 60,8 and

' 43-4 to be; and in fact, bo,8 = g696,64 is to 254 = 1889,56
as 2 is to 1 very nearly,

Again, in another experiment, (No. 2.) the distances were,

with two candles = 54 inches. Square = 2916.

with one candle = 58,6. - = 1489,96
Upon another trial (experiment No. g.)

with two candles = 34,6 inches. Square = 281,16

with one candle = 39,7. - = 1576,09
