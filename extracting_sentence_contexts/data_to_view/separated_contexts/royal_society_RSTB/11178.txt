It is
cheaper’. [55, p. 124]. It has recently been discovered that the CS—US interval in
eyeblink conditioning is encoded by a cell-intrinsic mechanism
in the cerebellar Purkinje cell [56]. In the vast literature on the
neurobiology of memory, this is the only case in which
the engram for a specified quantitative experiential fact (the
duration of the CS—-US interval) has been localized—and it
has been localized to a sub-cellular level. In this case at least,
the numeron encoding the duration of an interval resides in a
cell-intrinsic medium, not in a plastic synapse. These considerations—the metabolic and volumetric costs
and the fact that the CS—US interval is stored by a cell-intrin-
sic mechanism—lead me to seek answers at the cell-intrinsic
level, which is to say at the molecular level.
