DR. R. BROOM ON THE ORIGIN OF MAMMALS. _ ll

Anomodontia.

This sub-order was not only the first sub-order of the mammal-like reptiles to be
studied, but is the only one that we may say is thoroughly known. Anomodonts occur
in South Africa from the Middle Permian to the top of the Triassic and they are by fur
the commonest of the forms met with. Of every ten fossil vertebrate specimens found
in the Karroo, nine are remains of Anomodonts, and this notwithstanding the fact that
they are not common in the Paveiasaurus zone and rare in the Procolophon zone.

Dicynodon, with its female Oudenodon, may be taken as the type of the order, and
so homogeneous is the group that the more aberrant genera such as Endothiodon or
Cistecephalus only ditter but slightly from the typical form.

Over 40 well marked species of Dicynodon are already known, varying in size from
forms little larger than a rat to others about as large as a tapir.

Though the Anomodonts are quite off the mammalian line they nevertheless give
us more important clues as to the remote mammalian ancestors than do almost any
others except the Cynodonts. Yet quite manifestly, though they are peculiarly
