From the researches of M. Lepuc and Professor Morury it is probable that the
above numbers for hydrogen are a little, perhaps nearly one thousandth part, too
high. The correction to very small pressures has to be made in a different manner
for hydrogen and for the other gases, in consequence of the fact that the observed
ratio of densities corresponded not to 0° C., but to 16° C.t Now the observed values
of B for hydrogen and oxygen relate to about 11° C., so that if we correct « to 0° C.,
we are, in fact, altering it in the wrong direction. I have employed as the correcting
factor to 16° C. the value 1°00118.
