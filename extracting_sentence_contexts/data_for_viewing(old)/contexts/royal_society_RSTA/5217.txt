There have been some challenges to the idea that this kind of behavioural adaptation to
changing circumstances is inherently a negative outcome, or specifically a moral problem [15].
But, importantly, moral hazards are not simply an abstract philosophical concern: they have been
empirically documented in multiple decision-making contexts [14]. In terms of individual-level
decision-making, health insurance has been linked to the increased performance of unhealthy
behaviours [16]. In one striking example at the political level, studies have suggested that
humanitarian intervention can lead to an increased expectation of future foreign engagement by
rebel groups, thus promoting riskier strategies that increase the overall loss of life [17].

In the context of geoengineering, the moral hazard is not so much an economic risk but
a social, ethical and political one. Geoengineering might be perceived as an insurance policy
against climate change, undermining support for existing climate policies. In fact, there are
multiple levels on which a geoengineering moral hazard might operate. First, the prospect of
geoengineering could cause individuals to curb voluntary efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The
concept of behavioural ‘rebound’ is well understood (the idea that adopting an energy-saving
technology can sometimes increase energy use, undermining the overall impact of the technology
itself [18]). If geoengineering were perceived by the public as offering a licence to continue


carbon-intensive lifestyles, the ‘rebound’ associated with geoengineering technologies could be 3 |
even more significant. This behavioural version of the problem might be termed an individual

moral hazard. “a
