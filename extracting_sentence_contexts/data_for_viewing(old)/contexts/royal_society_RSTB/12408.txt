(c) Cyclic stressâ€”strain tests

Test strips were also subjected to cycles of extension followed
by return to resting length. Although the glue had a linear
stress-strain curve during elongation up to a strain of 5, it
showed marked hysteresis when unloaded (figure 4a). This
occurred despite not reaching the yield point at which neck-
ing started. There was a linear increase in stress as strain
increased, but when the strain was reversed, the stress
dropped to a value between 0 and 5 kPa. Notably, despite
the measured hysteresis, the glue did not show any visible
signs of plastic deformation. Throughout the entire return
to resting length, the sample appeared taut. In fact, when
the glue was manually stretched, then released, it snapped
back to its original shape almost instantly, as an elastic
band would. Note that these findings were for samples that
were not taken past the yield point at a strain of 5. The line-
arity during extension, the extent of hysteresis, and the shape
of the stress-strain curve were also the same in preliminary
trials at a strain rate that was roughly ten times greater
(0.5-1 s~?).

The energy dissipation occurred continuously during
extension and was not the result of reaching a critical value.
This can be seen by the fact that the hysteresis occurred
