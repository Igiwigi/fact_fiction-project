I 1. Covered-eyed Meduse.,â€”(a) From the fact that in the covered-eyed Meduse the
passage of a stimulus-wave is not more rapid than that of a contractile wave, we may
be prepared to expect that in these animals the action of the locomotor gangha is not,
in any proper sense of the term, a coordinated action ; for if a stimulus-wave cannot
outrun a contractile waye, one ganglion cannot know that another ganglion has dis-
charged its influence, till the contractile wave which results from a discharge of the
active ganglion has reached the passive one. And this I find to be usually the case ;
for, as previously stated, it may usually be observed that one or more of the lithocysts
are either temporarily or permanently prepotent over the others, #. e. that contractile
waves emanate from the prepotent lithocysts, and then spread rapidly over the swimming-
bell, without there being any signs of coordinated, or simultaneous, action on the part of
the other lithoeysts, Nevertheless in many cases such prepotency cannot, even with the
greatest care, be observed ; but upon every pulsation all parts of the swimming-bell seem
to contract at the same instant.
