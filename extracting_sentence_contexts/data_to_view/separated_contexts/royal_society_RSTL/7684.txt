these are two quartic surfaces having in common the lines (y=0, w=0), (y=0, 2=0):

attending to the line (y=0, 2=0), this is on the second surface, an oscular line,
== 4*; on the firs surface it is a nodal line, the one tangent plane being
6(4l—&)w.z+drz.y=0, the other tangent plane being 2=0, but the line being in
regard to this sheet an oscular line, 2z=5 a 4. Hence in the intersection of the two

surfaces the line counts (1+3=)4 times; similarly the line y=0, w=0 counts
(1+3=)4 times; and there is a residual intersection of the order (16—4—4=)8, which
is the cuspidal curve; &=8.

133. The cuspidal curye is a system of 4 conics; in fact from the preceding equations
written in the forms

eliminating 2w, we obtain

which shows that the cuspidal curve lies in 4 planes, and it hence consists of four conics ;
these are of course the reciprocals of the quadric cones which touch the cubic swrface
along the four conics which make up the spinode curye. A 134. The equation of the surface, attending only to the terms of the second order in
Ay, 2,w, is 274a%zw=0; it thus appears that the point y=0, z=0, w=0 (reciprocal of the
Splane X=0) (which is oscular along the axis joining the two binodes, or BB-axis) is a
Zbinode on the reciprocal surface, the biplanes being z=0, w=0, viz. these are the planes
Ereciprocal to the binodes (X=0, Y=0, W=0) and (X=0, Y=0, Z=0) of the cubic
Surface ; we have thus B'=1.
