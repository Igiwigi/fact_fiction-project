The stale ova and stale
7 were, of course, the same, but the fresh sperm and fresh ova with which
Ghey were respectively mixed, were from freshly opened, and therefore different,
individuals. As staleness of the ova gives rise to larvie of diminished size, and of sperm to ones
of, if anything, increased size, one might be inclined to expect that when both the
products were stale, the larvae would within certain limits remain practically
unaltered. This was in fact the case. Thus in Exps. 139, 154, and 162, in which
both ova and sperm had been kept respectively twenty-two, twenty-two, and nine
hours before fertilisation, the larvee varied by respectively + 2°0, — 1°8, and — 3-4 per
cent. from those developing from the same sexual products when fresh.
