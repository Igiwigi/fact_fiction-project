If the law of recapitulation be held to apply, one
must believe, from their late appearance both in the seedling and in the tips of older
roots, that the presence of primary resin canals in the root of Picea is not a primitive
or ancestral condition, but a more recent acquirement. Such a conclusion is in agree-
ment with the well-known lack of canals in the root of the fossil ancestors of the conifers,
the Cordaitean forms. In view of the evidence brought forward in an earlier section
of this paper as to the production of secondary resin canals, and also of the facts stated
as to the evolutionary plasticity of primary root meristem, it would seem reasonable
to suspect that here also we may have a response to pressure and irritation, resulting
from the pushing of the root-tip through the soil. Experiments planned to throw
light on this problem are proceeding, but as yet incomplete. Before dealing with the resin canals of the secondary wood of the root it will be of
advantage to review some of the special conditions that render roots liable to injury.
