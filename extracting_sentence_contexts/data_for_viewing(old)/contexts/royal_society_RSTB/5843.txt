frequently grows centripetally and covers the entire area below the area pellucida, but
in no case has it shown any signs of being able to take part in the formation of a foregut.
On the other hand, it is known from other experiments (see Part II, section 2) that the
neural plate is capable of forming a foregut from non-presumptive endoderm. It may
therefore, not be impossible that a foregut might be formed from yolk-sac endoderm
in favourable cases. But it is unlikely that a regenerated endoderm could ever be fully
functional in the sense of exerting a directive influence on the growth of the neural
plate similar to that which, as will be shown in the next section, is exerted by the normal
endoderm.

In connection with the formation of a false or regenerated foregut, the mesodermal
membranes seen in 227 and 402 are interesting. In both cases, the formation of a
membrane may be due merely to the fact that the cells were probably in contact with
the surface of a liquid filling the cavity below them. But, even if the formation of
the membrane is not to be taken to be a regenerative phenomenon, the shape of the
cavity, at least in 227, suggests that the mesoderm as a whole has left a space into
which a foregut could be fitted.

The experiments described here have been concerned with middle and late primitive
streak stages; very young blastoderms have not been used to any great extent, since
they are usually very badly distorted by the formation of blisters. This distortion
might perhaps make it impossible to prove the negative result, that epiblasts of less
than a certain age could not differentiate. Development has, however, been obtained
from a duck epiblast in which the primitive streak at explanting only stretched about
a quarter of the distance across the area pellucida. In another case, the formation
