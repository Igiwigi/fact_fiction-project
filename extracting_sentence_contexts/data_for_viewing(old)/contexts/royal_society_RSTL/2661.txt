outwards and backwards, and divides into two principal branches. The first passes
outwards, and is given to the latero-abdominal muscles, which contract the diameter
of the segment. One portion of the second branch supplies the triangular and trans-
verse median muscles, while the other (&) passes downwards and outwards and unites
with a portion of the third branch of the transyerse nerves (i), as before stated.

From this distribution of the nerves it is evident that some of the muscles are sup-
plied from two sources, and it can hardly be doubted that these have distinct func-
tions, The remarkable fact that the transverse nerves appear almost exclusively to
supply the trachez, while the moto-sensitive, which come from the motor tract and
ganglia, and communicate volition and sensation, supply the muscles, even of the
spiracles, cannot escape our obseryation as a striking proof that these neryes are of
distinct functions. When we connect these facts with that of the longitudinal portion
of the transverse nerves in each segment deriving a few filaments from the motor sur-
face of the cords, and with that of filaments from the transverse nerves being distri-
buted to some of the muscles in addition to nerves derived from the cords and ganglia,
we can scarcely hesitate to assent to the opinion that while the transverse nerves con-
nect the voluntary with the great organic functions of the body, they are more s8ub-
servient to the latter than to the voluntary or animal powers.

The Manner in which Respiration is performed.

It has been shown that in every act of respiration in insects nearly all the muscles
and nerves of each segment of the body are brought into consentaneous action, as the
muscles of the chest and ribs in vertebrated animals, like which the insect is able to
