regarded as almost the ideal case of fire documentation,
since one piece of pitch retained a human fingerprint, and
direct radiocarbon dating gave an age of ca 48000 BP, on
the limits of the technique, and compatible with a geological
age of approximately 80 000 years. The use of gypsum plaster
for hafting in the Middle East also implies the use of fire [88].

Occasionally, elsewhere, wooden artefacts may be part
burnt or burnt. At Kalambo Falls in Zambia burnt wooden
artefacts were found on Acheulean sites dating to ca 0.5 Ma

[89,90]. At Beeches Pit, mentioned below, a refitting flint arte-
fact set included two burnt specimens in the set of 27, a
circumstance not readily consistent with natural fire [91,92].

Such examples emphasize the importance of context,
and the point that an organized methodology is necessary
for fire enquiries. In archaeology, a first general treatment
was provided by Bellomo in the 1990s [93,94]; subsequen-
tly, micromorphological studies of sediments, magnetic
methods—including magnetic susceptibility and palaeomag-
netic techniques—and thermoluminescence measurements
have all proved highly useful [95,96].

No technique on its own completely addresses the pro-
