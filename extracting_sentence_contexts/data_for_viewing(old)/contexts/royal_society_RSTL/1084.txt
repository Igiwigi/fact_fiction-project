stance the opening was anterior, but close to the -scrotum ;
and Mr. Coors availed himself of this circumstance in ef-
fecting a cure ; a portion of the skin of the scrotum was
partially detached, and turned over s0 as to cover the opening,
the callous edges of which were previously pared away. The
operation in this case differed materially from the one which
I performed ; for in Mr. Coorxs's case, the raw Surface was
turned towards the urethra, whilst in mine the canal was
wholly formed of a previously cicatrized smooth surface,
which had undergone its utmost degree of contraction before
it was employed to form the canal. i

The fact I conceive is new, that, from a cicatrix of common
integuments, a canal may be formed capable of conveying 80
acrid a fluid as urine, and of fulfilling a!/ the functions of a
healthy urethra, without being liable to any subsequent varia-
tion in its calibre, It is important, also, in throwing some
light on the till disputed question of the muscularity of
the urethra; for since the patient quitted my care, he has
more than once indulged in sexual intercourse ; and he
assures me, that the jet of semen is as forcible as before
the accident. When we consider that nearly, if not entirely,
the whole of the ejaculator seminis must have sloughed away
with the portion of the urethra which perished, and that an
interval of above an inch of common integument at present
