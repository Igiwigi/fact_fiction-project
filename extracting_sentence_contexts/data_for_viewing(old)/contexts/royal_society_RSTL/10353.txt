PROTOPLASM THROUGH THE WALLS OF VEGETABLE CELLS. 853

particular attention drawn to the fact ; on the contrary, it has been generally accepted
that on plasmolysis the protoplasm is quite free from the cell-wall.

However, in repeating these experiments I find that in all the cases T have
examined the contracted protoplasm is always connected to the cell-wall by means of
very numerous protoplasmic threads.

The above phenomena were also discovered subsequently and independently by
BowER,* whose excellent paper on the suhject appeared shortly after my own. My
experiments were firs: made upon pulvini, but were afterwards extended to tissues
in general (figs. 34, 35, 36, 37).

The most detailed observations were made upon transverse sections of the pulyini
