superspace.’

The approach we have taken in the MasterCode Collaboration (See http://cern.ch/
mastercode/) is to compile all the available experimental, phenomenological, experimental,
astrophysical and cosmological constraints that bear upon the possible masses of supersymmetric
particles and explore their implications in frequentist statistical analyses of a range of
different supersymmetric models. The relevant measurements include electroweak data, flavour
observables, dark matter measurements including the overall cosmological density of cold dark
matter and upper limits on direct and indirect dark matter searches, and the (so far) null results
of LHC searches.

lit has been suggested that weakly interacting cold dark matter of the type suggested by supersymmetry has issues with
the absence of cusps and of satellite galaxies. However, it has also been argued that there is in fact no cusp-core problem
(e.g. [23]), nor any missing satellite problem (e.g. [24,25]). In the absence of consensus on these issues, here we stick with the
supersymmetric cold dark matter paradigm.
