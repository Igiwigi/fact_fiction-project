On applying an additional tension of 200 1bs., the motion of the needle of the
thermo-multiplier indicated cold ; on removing the tension, a reverse motion of equal
extent indicated the evolution of heat. 'The mean of seyeral trials gave me 9'-87, the
h, determined by immersing the junction in water of various tem-
peratures, was *01364. Owing to the large surface of the wood as compared with its
capacity for heat, it was affected by the temperature of the eurronnding atmosphere
nearly three times as much as the quarter-inch metal bars. I found, in fact, that during
the time occupied by a swing of the needle, viz. 45‚Äù, one-fifth of the thermal effect was
lost. Adding, therefore, one quarter to 01364, we find *01705 for the thermal effect,
which, it may be observed, errs a trifle in defect, owing to the conduction of a small
portion of heat along the wires of the thermo-electric junction.

87. In order to arrive at, the theoretical result, it was necessary to determine the spe-
cific heat of the wood in the condition it was in when used. 'This was done by raising
the temperature of a faggot of it in a bath of mercury, and then plunging it in a thin
copper can filled with mercury at the atmospheric temperature.
