their fat all absorbed, and their bodies emaciated ? We see
this fact exemplified in the hedge-hog, one of the most re-
markable of our hibernating animals, which retires to its hut
at the approach of winter, with vast stores of fat placed in
every situation where nature could find room for it. This fat
is its only source of nutrition for the winter, which, by
the time the sun rouses it to fresh life and activity, is ex-
hausted, and the animal comes forth thin and emaciated. But the case with birds is extremely different.
