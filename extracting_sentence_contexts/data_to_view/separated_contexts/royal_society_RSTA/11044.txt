A high constant represents
a rapid decrease of viscosity, and may usually be attributed to rapid depolymerisation
of the liquid. It is noteworthy that values of , comparable with those given in
our table for concentrated solutions of sodium hydroxide, were observed only in the
case of the alcohols: ethyl alcohol, n = 4°37 ; isopropyl alcohol, 7 = 4°9 to 34; amyl
alcohol, » = 4°3; all of which are known to exist largely in the form of complex
molecules. The constant b is related by the expression b = 1/T to the “ conductivity zero” T
of the solution (BousrreLp and Lowry, loc. cit., p. 44), and although this zero does
not represent an actual physical fact, it gives a valuable mental picture of the way in
which the increase of viscosity at low temperatures tends to destroy the conductivity
of the solution. The values of T are given in the eighth column of Table XIX., and
correspond closely with the conductivity zeros deduced from a simple parabolic
formula for the influence of temperature on conductivity. The constant a, tabulated in the third column of Table XIX., measures the rate of
decay of ionisation with rising temperature, and is greatest in the most concentrated
solutions,

Points of Inflexion.—The above expression for the influence of temperature on
conductivity enables us to calculate the positions of both the points of inflexion and
the maximum of conductivity of our general curve. ‘The results are given in
Table XIX., which shows under 6, and 6, the temperatures corresponding to the
lower and upper points of inflexion in the curve of molecular conductivity, whilst the
temperature of maximum conductivity is given by }(0,+6,).
