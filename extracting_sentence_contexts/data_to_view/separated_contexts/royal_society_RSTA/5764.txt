The corresponding
metric functions Q are then of the form

which follows from setting Q = 0 in (2.10). In the following, we need not consider the whole class of areal coordinate representations, and
instead, we find it sufficient to restrict to the special class for which Q is constant in both space
and time but not necessarily zero; we refer to these coordinate systems as Qconst.-areal gauges. In
fact, we further specialize to Qconst.-areal gauges that are obtained from a Qo-areal gauge in one
of the following two ways:

(1) Choose Q € R, fix arbitrary non-vanishing 417, a2; in R, and set
0 a2
A= :
(° or)

Jx€R and Jy=QJx, (2.14)

Then it follows from (2.12) that

and moreover, it can be shown, for Jx 4 0, that
Y -—QX, (2.15)

is the unique, up to rescaling, hypersurface orthogonal Killing vector field of g.


(2) Choose Q € R, fix arbitrary non-vanishing 411, 422 in R, and set

ayy 0
A= :
(cr, ‘)
In this case, it follows from (2.12) that

Jx=0 and JyeR, (2.16)

and it can be shown, for Jy 4 0, that
x (2.17)

is the unique, up to rescaling, hypersurface orthogonal Killing vector field of g. These two Qconst.-areal gauges yield polarized T*-symmetric solutions of the vacuum Einstein
equation (1.1) of the form (2.1) where Q is constant and the twist constants (2.3) and (2.4) have the
property

Jx=OandPeR, orP=OandjJxeéR, orJx=P=0, (2.18)

where P is defined by
P:=Jy — QIx. (2.19)

In the Qo-areal gauge used in [24], in which Q=Jx =0 and X is the hypersurface orthogonal
Killing vector field, the transformation (2) above is simply a rescaling, while transformation (1)
flips the coordinate basis Killing vector fields. In this gauge, both transformations result in exactly
one of the coordinate basis Killing vector fields being hypersurface orthogonal (provided there is
one non-vanishing twist).
