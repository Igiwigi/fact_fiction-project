THE SOFT X-RAY SPECTROSCOPY OF SOLIDS 111

6. METALS AND NON-METALS—EMISSION EDGES, REAL AND FALSE

In all the curves of figures 8 and 5, the most evident feature is a sharp drop in in-
tensity at or near the short wave-length end of the band. This feature will be referred
to as an ‘emission edge’. In the case of metals, the edge occurs at the short wave-
length limit of the band; the amount of radiation emitted of shorter wave-lengths
is very small. In the case of L-spectra the edge is doubled; this corresponds obviously
to the fact that we are dealing with two L-levels, the L,- and the L,-level. Since L,-
and L,-levels differ only in spin, it is safe to assume that the corresponding band forms
are identical; and the weakness of the L,-spectra makes it a fairly simple matter to
separate them out to give the pure L,-spectra. L,-levels, as we shall show subsequently,
do not provide any observable spectra. In the case of L,,-spectra of metals, the
intensity in the band drops suddenly from its maximum value; in the case of K-spectra,
the intensity falls more or less gradually and then drops suddenly at the emission
edge. As is shown in figure 4 the breadth of the emission edge depends on the tem-
perature; at liquid-air temperature it is less than about ;'5 eV, but rises at room
temperature to about 7 eV.

In the case of non-metals, there is a characteristic difference. The sharp fall in
intensity occurs, though in the case of sulphur in several stages. This large fall in
