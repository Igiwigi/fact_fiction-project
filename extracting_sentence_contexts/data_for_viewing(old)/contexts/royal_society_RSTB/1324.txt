Fenson be regarded as representing two sexes of a species. The authors, however, do
ts definitely abandon the old idea of the specific distinctness of the two forms.

A. Of the megalospheric form. (Megalosphere 200-400 ,.)
B. Of the microspheric form. (Microsphere 20.) The two terminal chambers are omitted in B.

406 MR. J. J. LISTER ON THE LIFE-HISTORY OF THE FORAMINIFERA.

In 1883, Munrer-Cuatmas and ScHLUMBERGER (25) communicated to
Académie des Sciences the fact that the phenomenon of dimorphism occurs also
several species of the Miliolide. Thus, in Biloculina depressa, v'Ors., there are t
forms (see wood-cut, p. 405): A, with a large central chamber 200-400 p in diame
and with an outside diameter of the shell of 2°10 millim.; and B, with a small cent
chamber 20 in diameter, and an outside diameter varying from 1°5 millim.
2°64 millim. The interesting fact was also brought forward, that in this group the:
is a very marked difference in the mode of growth of the two forms. While in ti
form A, the arrangement of the chambers following the central one is biloculine fro:
the first, in the form B the chambers. following the minute central chamber ai
arranged at first on the quinqueloculine plan, the biloculine arrangement not bein,
attained, in B. depressa, until the eleventh chamber is formed.

A similar dimorphism is stated to exist in the genera Dillina, Lacazina, Fabulari
