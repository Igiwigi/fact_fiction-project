temperature in different statistical ensembles,
focusing in particular on subtleties that arise

statistical physics, thermodynamics

Keywords: when ensembles become non-equivalent. The
thermodynamic ensembles, entropy, isolated ‘mother’ of all ensembles, the microcanonical
systems, weak and strong coupling ensemble, uses entropy and internal energy (the

most fundamental, dynamically conserved quantity)
to derive temperature as a secondary thermodynamic
variable. Over the past century, some confusion
has been caused by the fact that several competing

the literature, most commonly the volume and
surface entropies introduced by Gibbs. It can be
proved, however, that only the volume entropy
satisfies exactly the traditional form of the laws of
thermodynamics for a broad class of physical systems,
including all standard classical Hamiltonian systems,
regardless of their size. This mathematically rigorous
fact implies that negative ‘absolute’ temperatures and
Carnot efficiencies more than 1 are not achievable
within a standard thermodynamical framework.
