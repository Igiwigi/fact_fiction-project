Then for any
given A and ¢ there is either one only or no particle p for which O'(pAt) is true. Then the laws of physics are the properties of this single extraneous relation O.
But the use of this single relation apparently introduces no real simplification,
differing in this respect from the use of the essential relation which so simplifies the
statement of the axioms of geometry. The general relation O remains a mere alter-
native statement of the facts respecting the various specific relations of occupation. Concept I[.—This concept is a monistic variant of the classical concept suggested
by Russetx.* In the classical concept the particles only occur as terms in the
triadic extraneous relations.
