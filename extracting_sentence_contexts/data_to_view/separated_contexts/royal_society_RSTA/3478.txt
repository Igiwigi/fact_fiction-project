The curves show that the negative ionisation increases very rapidly with the
temperature of the wire (in fact the saturation current varies roughly as the 70th
power of the absolute temperature). It will be seen that the current never vanishes
absolutely, but only in an asymptotic manner, so that it should be observable at any
temperature provided sensitive enough instruments are employed. As a matter of
fact at low temperatures it would of course be masked by other effects, which become
large by comparison. The curves seem also to tend continuously to an infinite value
of the saturation current ; but the theory indicates that at higher temperatures the
current would increase much more slowly with the temperature. This falling off of
the rate of increase has not yet been observed with any of the conductors which have
been examined.
