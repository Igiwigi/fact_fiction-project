It is apparent that as the pressure decreases the
time to half-value increases rapidly. At a pressure of 49-80 atmospheres the time
to half-value was not reached in seven hours. As a matter of fact, for most points
on the curve the equilibrium values could not be obtained. For instance, on the
50-54 atmosphere isobar the time to half-value of 45 minutes was taken as the time
when the density had reached the half-way value to 0-2150 g./c.c. as originally

measured on the isobar by decreasing the temperature.
