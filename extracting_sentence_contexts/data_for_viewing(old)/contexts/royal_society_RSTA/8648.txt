’ width of this ranges from 10 to 200 miles, except at the Gulf of Carpentaria, where it
extends right across to New Guinea. The tide in this neighbourhood is diurnal, like
that in the South China Sea to the north of it. The contribution to the secular
acceleration of the moon is accordingly very small. ,The tidal streams do not exceed
1 knot, and as the area is much less than that of the South China Sea the dissipation
in the diurnal tide cannot be comparable with that already found for the larger sea.

ArriIcAN WATERS.

The Mozambique Channel.

The channel between Madagascar and the mainland is mostly about 500 fathoms
deep or more. There are few records of tidal currents in it; in fact the only record
given in the ‘ African Pilot,’ part 3, appears to be based on the statement of a single
observer, that the tidal streams in the channel are comparable with the permanent
current driven by the trade winds, which flows at about 2 knots. This cannot
however be uniform all over the channel, for the following reason. The height of the
tide along the African coast is about 12 feet, which is as usual measured relative to
low water at ordinary springs, so that the vertical amplitude of the tide is 180 cm.
Now the ordinary theory of tides in channels shows that the maximum velocity is of
