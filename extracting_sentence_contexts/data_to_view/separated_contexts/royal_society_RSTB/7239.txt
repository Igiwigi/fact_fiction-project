These bundles or fibre
fascicles may be grouped into composite sclerodermites or into trabeculae, or may exhibit
a subparallel arrangement with their apices (centres of calcification) in the septal plane
(see figure 77), In rugose corals the axial length of the individual fibre fascicles ranges
from 0:05 mm, in Columnaria (figure 54, plate 7) to well over 0-5 mm. in Codonophyllum
(figure 28, plate 5) and Palaeosmilia,


IN THE LIGHT OF THEIR MINUTE SKELETAL STRUCTURES _ 183

The lamellar type of skeleton is composed of lamellar layers separated by dark bands
and nowhere shows fibrous structure. It has been commonly assumed that all lamellar
types of skeleton are ultimately composed of fibres orientated at right angles to the lamellae
(Ogilvie 1897, p. 121; Hill 1936, p. 191). In fact, so far as the rugose corals are concerned,
except in the Caniniacea, to the structure of which I shall refer later on, this is certainly
not the case. Under a high-power microscope, the lamellar layers are seen to be com-
posed of calcite flakes* of subrounded shape, arranged more or less parallel to the plane
of the lamellae. These flakes I take to be the primary units of the lamellar skeleton, as the
fibre fascicles are of the fibrous skeleton.
