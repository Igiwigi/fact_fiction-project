a roll of a die, as they are for modelling uncertainty in the mass of a planet. Incidentally,
both forms of uncertainty are fundamentally subjective; one’s uncertainty about a roll of a die
depends on one’s knowledge of the exact initial conditions of the roll, in just the same way as the
uncertainty about the mass of the planet depends on knowledge of the observational data on the
planet’s orbit.

Finally, people trained in the sciences are uncomfortable with the very notion of subjectivity
in data analysis and modelling. This again is deeply misguided: all models involve assumptions,
and all conclusions drawn from data analysis are conditional on assumptions. The probabilistic
framework forces the scientist to be completely transparent about the assumptions, by expressing
all assumptions as distributions on unknown quantities. These assumptions can then be easily :
contested, and the same data can be reanalysed under different modelling assumptions (and =
priors). The fact that conclusions could change depending on the assumptions is essential to is
good scientific practice. Fortunately, given enough data, the effect of the prior is generally Ss
overcome by the likelihood, and posterior conclusions will converge [4-6]. This is directly :8
analogous to the progress of science, where of many possible hypotheses, only the ones consistent i=
with the data will survive. Bayesian modelling is subjective but not arbitrary: given a full al
specification of the model, and the data, there is only one way to reason about any quantity :g
of interest. :&

Modelling thus becomes a very simple procedure: :

— write down your assumptions (possible models, parameters, noise processes, etc.),
representing all forms of uncertainty using the language of probability theory and
