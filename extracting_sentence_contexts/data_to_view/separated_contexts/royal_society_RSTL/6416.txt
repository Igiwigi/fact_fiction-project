Sometimes there remains
around the stellate cell a more or less circular space enclosed by what seems to be the
inner surface of the original cell-wall, of which the outer portion has blended with the

surrounding tissue. In the account thus given of the development of the spinal cord, I have carefully
refrained from indulging in any theoretical yiews, and have confined myself solely to a
faithful description of what was actually seen. A few remarks, however, are required
in further explanation of some of the obseryed facts, and in reference to the conclusions
that may be drawn from them. We have seen that in its earliest stage of development, the spinal cord consists of a
canal surrounded only by one uniform or homogeneous layer of small cells or nuclei,
which are not distinguishable from each other in appearance, and are s0 closely aggre-
gated as to seem in actual contact. '
