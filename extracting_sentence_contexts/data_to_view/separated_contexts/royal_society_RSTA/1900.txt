The horizontal and vertical Stokes drift velocities for a porous layer with linearly-varying permeability, as in
equation (4.1).

interface which is a constant «*. Likewise, all of the other constants of equation (3.3) remain the
same. Furthermore, inspecting the form of the Stokes drift velocity expressions in both layers,
the drift velocities at a fixed value of z in the lower porous layer are unchanged by modifying
the thickness of the upper porous layer, a fact shown in figure 4.

(ii) Varying permeability of the upper porous layer

If we instead fix d* = 0.10 m, and vary the permeability of the upper porous layer, we obtain effects
throughout the profile, because the dispersion relation will change. Letting «* — 0, we recover the


classical results for a fluid of depth d, as derived by Stokes [1], because the upper layer becomes
an impermeable boundary. The vertical drift is therefore zero in this case because the waves are
not damped.
