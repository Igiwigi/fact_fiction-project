It is difficult
however to procure two magnets exactly equal, and of equal
force. But fortunately this is of no consequence, as a slight
deviation from perfect neutrality may be corrected by inclin-
ing the stronger needle a little more or less to the plane of
the plate. In fact the proposition is general; and by a
proper adjustment of the positions of two magnets however
unequal, with respect to the axis and to each other, they may
be made to neutralize each other. 15. As this adjustment however is nice, and as magnets
influence each other, and our object moreover called for the
utmost delicacy, we adopted a more refined application of the
principle just detailed.
