This lag gives rise to a component angular
velocity of the axis tending to increase the yaw 4, until a state of relative equilibrium
is reached, in which the yaw is slightly less than its equilibrium value, and the axis
lags slightly behind (7.e., above) the tangent OP. When the velocity is high and
the spin N not too large, M is large and the true position of the axis lies very near
the equilibrium position. It will be shown in fact, in Part IV., that the assumption

* For a shell whose spin and direction of motion are related like a right-handed screw the drift is to the
right of the plane of fire.

that OA is level with OP, and that 3 is given by (1.342), lead to a determination of the
drift which is sufficiently accurate for all trajectories of elevation less than 30 degrees. The drift is produced by the cross-wind force resulting from the above value of
the yaw.
