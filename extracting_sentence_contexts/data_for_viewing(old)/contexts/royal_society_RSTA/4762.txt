corresponding to ratios of B/G ~ 10° [52]. According to numerical calculations [53], such ratios
should be more than sufficient to obtain good elastic cloaking. Our numerical band structure
calculations [54] have shown that such three-dimensional pentamode metamaterials can even
exhibit a fairly large frequency region in which absolutely no transversely polarized elastic waves
exist. The dispersion relation of the longitudinally polarized waves becomes isotropic in the limit
d/a <1 [54]. Furthermore, anisotropic versions of pentamode metamaterials have been discussed
as well [55]. Their two-dimensional counterparts, i.e. bimode metamaterials, have also been
discussed theoretically [56].

To obtain complete dynamic control on the remaining longitudinal elastic waves, however,
one must not only tailor the bulk modulus B but also the mass density p [41] to thereby tailor
the phase velocity c= /B/p and the impedance Z = /Bp independently—ust like in acoustics.
Our approach [57] starts from the fact that the effective pentamode metamaterial bulk modulus
is mainly determined by the diameter at the thin ends of the double cones, whereas the diameter
at the thick middle part barely enters (for reasonable parameter choices). This is related to the
observation that the stress is concentrated to the thin ends (not depicted; see [57]). One can
