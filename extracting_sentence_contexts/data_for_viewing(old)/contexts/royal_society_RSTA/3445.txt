It is easy to find numerical examples of the distributions of Ri and Ri for which (4.8) is violated
(see example S.2 in electronic supplementary material, file S). As shown below, however, (4.8)
cannot be violated if a maximally connected coupling for the 1-2 system exists. It follows from
the fact that the statement of theorem 4.1 can be reversed: (4.4), (4.6) and (4.7) imply that D is
non-contextual. We establish this fact by first characterizing the distributions of R} and Rj for a
non-contextual 1-2 system (theorem 4.4 with corollary 4.5), and then showing that (4.8) always
holds for such distributions (theorem 4.6).

Theorem 4.4. A maximally connected coupling for a 1-2 system is unique if it exists. In this coupling,
the only pairs of ij in (4.3) that may have non-zero probabilities assigned to them are the diagonal states
{11,22,...,kk} and either the states {i1, 12, ...,ik} for a single fixed i or the states {1j,2j,...,kj} for a single
fixed j (i, j=1,...,k).

Assuming, with no loss of generality, that the single fixed i or the single fixed j in the
formulation above is 2, the theorem says that the non-zero probabilities assigned to the states
of the maximally connected coupling (shown below for k = 4) could only occupy the cells marked
