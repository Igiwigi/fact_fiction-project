w/v SM suspensions, for y ~90 s! the shear stress o ~0.5Pa, and taking a 1m, the Peclet
number is Pe = 122, well into the region of hydrodynamic-driven interactions. From a microscopic
point of view, in this region the hydrodynamic forces provoke the formation of hydroclusters in
which the particles are impeded to flow around each other, which leads to an abrupt increase
in viscosity. The analysis in [30] was done for concentrated (¢ > 10%) suspensions of spherical
particles. Although we have suspensions with not so high particle concentration, the particles
are far from being spherical and, consequently, the formation of clusters with difficult internal
movement at high shear can appear at a much smaller particle concentration than for spheres.
If we consider that, as demonstrated in previous works [31,32], in fibre-like suspensions the
particle-particle solid friction considerably hinders the relative movement of particles inside
bundle-like aggregates. In addition, as predicted in [30], when the particles are functionalized
with large molecules, imparting electro-steric repulsion between the particles, the viscosity values
reached in the shear-thickening region are considerably reduced. In fact, this decrease is evident
if we compare the maximum viscosities reached in the 7% and 10% SM suspensions (9.5 mPa s~!
and 10.7mPas™!, respectively) with those in SMA suspensions (6.9mPas~! and 9.6mPas~1,
respectively).

The next question arises about the strength of the MR effect in SM and SMA suspensions
with 10% w/v concentration. For this purpose, the corresponding rheograms (see electronic
supplementary material, figure S3) were obtained in the range of low—moderate magnetic fields.
For SM suspensions (electronic supplementary material, figure S3a), the general trends of the
rheograms obtained with magnetic field applied are similar to those in the absence of field: a first
