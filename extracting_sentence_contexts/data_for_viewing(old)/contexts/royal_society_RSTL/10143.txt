A similar remark applies to the lasb solution offered by Macxus of the differen
between us. In 1867, he showed that vapours were condensed by surface attra
to a greater extent than had previously been supposed. Blowing vapour-laden ai
into a metal tube, he found that heat was generated. He inferred, and right]
inferred, that this heat was produced by the condensation which occurred on the
interior surface. This condensation he found to depend on the condition of
surface, being greater when it was tarnished or coated than when it was polish
He saturated air with moisture at a temperature of 16* C., and then raised both i
and his pile to a temperature of 38%, When such air was blown against the dry face
of the pile heat was generated. Condensation therefore occurred upon a snrfacs
22 C. higher than the dew point of the vapour. Againsb this T have nothing to urge,
But the fact by no means justifies the inference drawn from it, which was, that the
vapours in my experimental tuhe were converted by © yapour-hesion ” into liquid
layers of high opacity to radiant heat. These layers, acting upon the calorific rays
impinging on the interior s8urface of my tube, produced the absorption which T had
erroneously ascribed to the vaponrs. More than this, the liquid layers were supposed
to be broken up into discontinuous patches which not only absorbed the heat but
scattered it, © Vapour-hesion,” it may be added, was found to vary with the liquid
which produced the vapour, being particularly strong in the case of alcohol.

Maaxus brought this generalization to the test of experiment, but failed to verify
it. He urged humid air against a dry mirror, from which radiant heat was reflected ;
but unless he wetted the mirror visibly no effect was produced on the reflected beam,
Still he held that reflection, oft repeated, rendered sensible an action which eluded a
