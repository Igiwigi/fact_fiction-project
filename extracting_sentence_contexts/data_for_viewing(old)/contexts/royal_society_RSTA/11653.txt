view the solid solution of tin in lead, when it contains more than 8 per cent. of tin, is
capable of existing in two forms which may be called « and B respectively. The
saturated (8) form of this solution, containing 16 per cent. of tin (approximately),
passes into the « form on cooling to 149° C., and at that point rejects a certain
amount of the dissolved tin in a finely divided “secondary” state. It is probable

that the solubility of tin in the « body decreases still further as the temperature falls,
but this decrease is certainly slight—its possible existence, however, makes it difficult
to give any estimate of the solubility of tin in the @ body at its transition temperature.
On heating, the reverse change (from « to B) only takes place gradually, a fact which
is partly accounted for by the slowness with which the 8 body takes up its full amount
of tin. When the concentration of tin in the 8 body is lower than 16 per cent., the
transformation on cooling is retarded until a lower temperature is reached; at the
same time the intensity of the reaction falls off until, with a tin content less than
8 per cent., the 8 form appears to remain stable down to the temperature of liquid
air. The fact that the intensity of the reaction falls off so markedly as the concen-

tration of tin falls below 16 per cent. suggests that the actual separation of the tin

itself is to some extent the source of the heat evolved, but it is not at present possible
to discriminate between the various possible sources of heat in a complex reaction.
