care being taken, when 7 bas different values for the same value of Q, correspond-

ing respectiyely to the two sides of the diagram, to choose the smaller in performing
the integration.

(28.) Corollary,—lTt is evident that the regenerator acts most effectually, when the
outlines of the indicator-diagram from A to D, and from B to C, are portions of a
pair of curves of equal transmission (determined as in Proposition IV.) ; for then, if
the operation of the regenerator is perfect, the changes from B to C and from D to A
will be effected without expenditure of heat ; the heat transmitted from the working
snbstance to a given stratum of the regenerator, during any part such as bc, of the
operation BC, being exactly sufficient for the corresponding part, da, of the operation

3 d.F
DA. In this case 70 for each value of Q between Q, and Q,, has the same value at

either side of the diagram. In fact, the effect of a perfect regenerator is, to confer upon any pair of curves of
equal transmission the properties of a pair of curves of no transmMiss0n.

(29.) ProposITION NI, —Tnroke. The greatest efficiency of a thermo-dynamic en-
gine, working between given limits of actual heat, with a perfect regenerator, is equal
to the greatest efficiency of a thermo-dynamic engine, working between the same limits
of actual heat, without a regenerator.

(Demonstration.) In fig. 18, let Q,Q,, Q,Q, be the isothermal curves denoting the
given limits of actual heat. Let AD, BC be a pair of curyes of equal transmission
of any form.
