“active” at comparatively low temperatures. In illustration of their results we need
only give the following typical instances of direct “ hydrogenations” effected by
passing a mixture of the substance in question with hydrogen over finely divided and
freshly reduced nickel. In this way hydrocarbons of the olefine series were quanti-
tatively converted into the corresponding paraffins at 160°, and benzene yielded
eyclo-hexane. Nitrobenzene was directly reduced to aniline, whilst nitromethane
was converted into methylamine at 150° to 180°, and into methane and ammonia at
350°. The most remarkable results of all, however, were obtained with a mixture of
carbon monoxide (1 volume) and hydrogen (3 volumes), which the authors state was
completely transformed into methane and steam when passed over finely divided
nickel at 250°.

Whilst there can be no gainsaying the facts relative to the extraordinary
“activity” of hydrogen when it is condensed or occluded by many surfaces, metallic
and otherwise, opinions will probably differ as to the cause of the “activity.” Many
will attribute it to the dissociation of the hydrogen molecule at the moment of
occlusion, whilst others will possibly connect it with some influence of hydrogen
upon the rate of emission of ions by the surfaces involved. The experiments of
Dr. H. A. Witson on “ The Discharge of Electricity from Hot Platinum’”* are very
suggestive in this connection. He found that hydrogen has an enormous influence on
the negative leakage from a clean platinum wire at high temperatures. Thus at
1350°, for a given potential difference, the leakage in hydrogen, at 0°014 millim.
pressure, was 25,000 times greater than the corresponding leakage in air. The
leakage was, moreover, proportional to the pressure and depended on the hydrogen
actually occluded by the metal. These experiments were made at much higher
