efforts, as the reliable methods of the proper phase reconstruction from scalar signals are still
missing.

We have demonstrated that the nonlinear coupling function has a shape quite different from
that of the first-order approximation, with many more Fourier components present. A novel
feature is a dependence of the nonlinear terms on the frequency of the forcing, in contradistinction
to the first approximation which is frequency independent. We have also shown that many
differences between the full nonlinear coupling function and its first-order approximation are
not so important for determination of the synchronization regions, although the full nonlinear
function provides better accuracy.

Finally, we compare our approach with the analytical technique for strongly perturbed limit
cycle oscillators of ref. [40]. Except for the trivial fact that our reduction is merely numerical,
we mention the essential difference: we rely on the unperturbed definition of the phase, ie. we
remain in the framework of the perturbation theory. On the contrary, the authors of [40] define a
generalized phase, i.e. a family of phases for different values of a systemâ€™s parameter. Next, they
consider the case when the strong component of the forcing is very slow and then exploit the
generalized phase to obtain a close equation in the adiabatic limit. Our approach is not restricted
to slow forcing.

We foresee that the presented approach can be extended to the determination of the phase
dynamics of coupled oscillators at strong coupling. An extra problem to be treated here is an
additional dependence of the forcing waveform on the strength of the coupling. This study will
be reported elsewhere.
