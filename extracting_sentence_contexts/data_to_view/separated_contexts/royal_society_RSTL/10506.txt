If this were 80, a free globular bubble, consisting of two
| - parts, a, coloured portion and a black © polar cap,” could not be spherical, but must
| consist of two 8pherical segments which meet at a finite angle. This condition is not
consistent with equilibrium, and therefore the black and coloured portions of the film
must have the same tension. |
We think this argument deserves consideration, but we have not thought tha ib is
80 conclusive as to obviate the necessity of experiment to determine the facts. Tn
the first place we are not aware that any evidence is on record that a perfectly free
spherical bubble can have a black © cap.” If the bubble is attached to a tube or other
solid support the argument no longer applies, as that part which is in contact with
the solid is not constrained to meet, the axis of revolution, and may therefore be an
unduloid or nodoid which can meet the spherical segment withont any discontinuity,
In order, therefore, that the argument might have the necessary basis of ascertained
fact it, would he requisite that bubbles should be formed without any s0lid supports,
and should under these conditions be observed to reach a state in which they were
partly black and partly coloured, Spherical bubbles when supported do not ordinarily
exhibit more than a very small circular patch of black, and it would probably be very
difficult to produce free spherical bubbles which should thin with 8ufficient rapidity
for the purpose in view. Even supposing that 8uch a result had been obtained, anything like accurate
measurement to ascertain the spherical form of the bubble would under the required |
conditions be difficult or impossible. Unless these measurements were made the |
experiment would be open to the objection that the bubble might not be truly
spherical, and that the same conditions which cause the sndden change in thickness at |
the edge of the black might also explain a very rapid change in curvature. |

It did not therefore seem wise to rely with implicit confidence on © priori reasoning
as to a region in the film which is the eat, of phenomena which are confessedly imper- |
fectly understood.
