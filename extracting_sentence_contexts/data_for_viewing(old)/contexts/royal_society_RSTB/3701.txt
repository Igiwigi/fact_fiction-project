The general course of acquirement and transmission of the character is illustrated
by the simple experiment shown in Table TIL.

Specimens 1-8 in the first vertical column were eight sisters, belonging to the
same control brood. They were born on February 9 and their L/W ratios
determined on that day. These are given in the column headed February 9. They
were then divided into two sets. Nos. 1-4 were put singly into the usual
control tubes, Nos. 5-8 were put singly into tubes of sterilised aquarium water, to
which were added centrifuged protophyta from Klebs’ culture solution.

The L/W ratios were again determined in the adolescent instar (February 16 for
the controls, February 14 for the others). These are given in the third vertical
column. A slight complication arises here, owing to the fact that in normal animals
the L/W ratio does not remain constant throughout life, but gradually increases,
Hence in order to make comparisons between measurements of the same animal in
different instars, it is necessary to allow for this natural increase. This is most
easily done by reducing the later ratios by a factor which represents the mean
increase for normal specimens for the number of instars which have intervened
between the two measurements. Thus it was found necessary to multiply the
adolescent (third instar) ratios by 0°807 to make them comparable with the first
instar measurements. All the eight ratios recorded on February 14-16 are therefore
the actual ratios, multiplied by 0°807. It will be noticed that in every case the
ratios of Nos. 5-8, feeding on the protophyta in the Klebs’ culture solution, have
dropped—i.e. the valves are becoming reflexed. The mean ratio for the four
specimens has fallen from 4°54 to 3°63.
