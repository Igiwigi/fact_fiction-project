In the first place they are all ex-
erted, even in the most highly organized living being, through a common instrumen-
tality, the simple cell. Secondly, the entire assemblage of cells inaking up the totality
of any organism, have all a common parentage; being linearly descended from the
Single primordial cell in which the organism originated. Thirdly, they are mani-
fested in connection with each other, in those single-celled organisms, which are the
lowest members of the two kingdoms respectively, and 'in which there is no sepa-
ration or specialization of function.—Hence we may express them collectively under
the general term of Cell-force; and seem entitled to affirm that each is a particular
modus operandi of the same force as that which is concerned in cell-formation #.

* It may now be considered as a well-established fact, that the simple fibrous tissues may originate in a
structureless blastema, and may be produced by its fibrillation, without passing through the intermediate con-
dition of cells. But these tissues cannot be regarded as possessing any truly vital endowments ; their proper-
ties being simply physical, and their uses in the economy merely mechanical.

+ This general proposition was first advanced by the author in regard to the operations in which orgaaic life
consists (and which are common, therefore, to plants and animals), in his © Report on the Origin and Functions
of Cells” in the Brit. and For. Med.
