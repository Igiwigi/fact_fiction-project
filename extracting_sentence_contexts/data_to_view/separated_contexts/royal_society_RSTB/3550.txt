A considerable proportion of them, almost one-half of those observed, are
found to occur in segments in each of which only one median giant cell is present,
and the transverse planes in which the lateral and median cells are situated correspond
in their position, both with regard to each other and with regard to the posterior
. limit of the segment, to those of the cells of an ordinary couple (figs. G, H, I). The
lateral and median cells are, in these cases, therefore really the two cells of a couple,
one of which has been differentiated in the median group of cells and the other in
one of the lateral groups of cells, an inference which is supported by the fact that the
lateral cell agrees very closely in size with the median cell with which it forms a

state of considerable contraction, as is evidenced by the unusual breadth of these segments and their short
antero-posterior extent. The anterior segments of the worm are moderately extended; were all the
segments similarly extended, the specimen would measure about 130 mm, in length.

* This measurement is from a preserved specimen which is in a state of moderate extension,
