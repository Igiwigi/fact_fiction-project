features, homologous with the axial “ mixed pith ;” but this can be nothing more than an

interesting speculation.

Whilst it seems clear that a group of ferns such as the Zygopteride are derived from
a common stock, and whilst we can indicate tentatively the primitive structural
features of any given genus, it is becoming increasingly unfashionable to attempt to draw

up phylogenetic schemes indicating the exact relationships of the various genera and
species within the group. This seems largely due to a recognition of the fact that the
rate of evolution of the different structural units (features, biocharacters) (43) within
the group varies from genus to genus, so that a relatively advanced type of petiole may
be associated with a relatively primitive axis, and vice-versa (cf. 39, p. 309). It appears
more logical to consider that stem, petiole and root exhibit a number of characteristic
evolutionary tendencies or potentialities, the rate of progress towards the highest
expression of each such tendency in any one genus being more or less independent of
the remainder (3, 23, 24, 43). In the zygopterid stem the chief structural tendencies
are towards medullation, though a wholly parenchymatous pith is never realised, and
towards a stellate stelar outline. In addition there is a tendency, expressed sporadically
in a few genera and only becoming well marked in Botrychioxylon, towards the develop-
ment of secondary wood. The available evidence seems to indicate also that the
ancestral mode of branching was by dichotomy, with an early adoption of the mono-
