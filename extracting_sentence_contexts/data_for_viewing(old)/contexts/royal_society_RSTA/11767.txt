experiments a further element comes into play. In order that the cold water (at
13° C.) might flow through the obturator without sensible heating, the flow tube
was jacketed, as previously described, with a larger tube through which flowed water
at the same temperature in much larger volume. This cold-water jacket terminated
at a point near g (see fig. 3, p. 207) on a level with the bottom of the obturator, and
formed a small cold area on which steam condensed. ‘To determine the total effect
of obturator heating with this new element, experiments were made at a temperature
of about 54°°5 C., similar to those before described, but with the new element of a
flow of cold water through the water jacket. Most of these experiments were made
after the two first series of continuous-flow experiments were concluded, as it was
not discovered till later that a deposition of moisture had taken place which varied in
each experiment. The earlier results were consequently erratic, and it was not till a
much later period that the cause was traced to the fact that the lower surface of the
obturator was so much cooled in the neighbourhood of the cold-water jacket as to
permit of the condensation of water upon it, the evaporation or fall of which
produced irregular results.

It was therefore decided to make a third series of continuous-flow experiments.
In these the end of the inflow water-casing was surrounded by a short piece of
rubber tubing g', which was shaped to fit it and which was cemented into the end
of the opening through the obturator with rubber solution. The under surface of
the obturator, just round the opening g, was also painted with a coat of rubber
solution. It was found that these precautions entirely prevented the deposition of
moisture on the obturator, and reduced the whole correction to so small an amount
that variations in its amount were of small importance.
