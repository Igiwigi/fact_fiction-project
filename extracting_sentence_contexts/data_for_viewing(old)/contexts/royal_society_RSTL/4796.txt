and the irregular rings thus formed continue to receive additions to their exterior
until their more salient and contiguous points coalesce. Small angular interspaces
exist for a while, but in process of time these also become filled up; and 'thus the
cells are reduced to the condition of mere cavities in a solid calcareous structure, in
which latter, by a careful management of the light, numerons small concentric
rings may be traced, surrounding the permanent cavities and marking the lines of
growth.

These centra contain none of the cancelli or Haversian canals seen in the ordinary
forms of bone; the conditions which lead to the formation of both the one and the
other have obviously no existence here. Bearing in mind the physiological relation-
Ship of these tissues in the Ray to those of the higher mammals, this deficiency of the
higher osseous elements will be readily understood. Another important fact also to
be remembered is, that the small circular cells existing in _these bones and dermal
plates, are not the homologues of the canaliculated lacunz, known as the corpuscles

of Purkinar. The former exhibit none of the beautiful radiating lacunz which are
8 characteristic of the latter objects. It is true, we have frequently a small tubular
canal connecting two such cavities together, but these are very different from the
beautiful stellate objects seen in the bones of an eel or the scales of a Lepidosteus.
The fact is, that though analogous they are not homologous. They differ in their
s$tructure, and till more in their origin; and the neglect of these differences has con-
