and secured them in two bottles, one of which I filled with water at 40° C., and the
other at 0°. I could detect no difference in the colour of the two for several minutes,
then the foot in the cold water became redder than the other.

Ihave tried to obtain evidence on this point in another way. I placed Echidnas
in a metal box in the ice-chest (temp. 23° ©.) for several hours. Their body tem-
peratures slowly fell; but, notwithstanding that they stood upon the cold iron, their
feet remained warm and were only 2°-3° C. lower than their rectal temperatures.
When I myself grasped the metal box my fingers soon became blanched and cold.

It appears that Echidna is devoid of both sweat-mechanism and vaso-motor adjust-
ment of superficial circulation in response to temperature. This was suggested by
the fact that the production of CO, was so nearly directly proportional to the
difference in temperature between the animal and environment, in other words, was
proportional to loss of heat.

Without means of losing heat by evaporation from the skin, or of increasing
evaporation from the lungs by additional respirations, Echidna is incapable of adapting
itself to an environment the temperature of which is above 35°-37° C., for it cannot
reduce its heat-production below a certain minimum which is itself dependent upon
the body-temperature. When exposed to a temperature of 35° C. its body-tempera-
ture soon rises above the physiological maximum (about 38° C.), this causes further
heat-production, and it dies of heat apoplexy.

This happened twice in the course of these experiments, and I have had unwel-
