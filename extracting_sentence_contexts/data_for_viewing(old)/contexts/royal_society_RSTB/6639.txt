well-marked structure like Meckelâ€™s cartilage or a pectoral fin spine. By such com-
parisons additional details can often be added to the restoration. The whole process is
exceedingly laborious, but it does give considerable certainty and leads to the dis-
covery of many otherwise unobserved facts.

As no existing account of any Acanthodian is reasonably complete, accurate and
intelligible, I have thought it well, in view of the great morphological importance
of their structure, to give straightforward accounts of the structure (so far as it is
known to me) of Climatius reticulatus, Euthacanthus macnicoli, Brachyacanthus scutiger,
Parexus incurvus, Mesacanthus mitchelli and Ischnacanthus gracilis from the Lower Old Red
Sandstone of Forfarshire, of Diplacanthus striatus and Cheiracanthus from the Middle Old
Red Sandstone of the Moray Firth and of Acanthodes from the Upper Carboniferous
Ironstones of Lebach in the Saar.
