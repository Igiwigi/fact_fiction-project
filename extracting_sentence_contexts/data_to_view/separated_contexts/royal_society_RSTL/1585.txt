In the mean
time the westerly point of stable equilibrium, in consequence of
the repulsive force of the magnet acting at a greater angle,
will move. farther towards the west : the three points ulti-
mately forming but one. If the line of the axes of 'the magnets revolve in a direction
contrary. to that of the sun's motion, or which is the same
thing, if the magnetic meridian describe an angle in the di-
rection of the sun's' motion, effects the reverse of these will
evidently take place. I had drawn these conclusions, and proposed applying them
to the observations on the daily changes in different directions
of the needle, when it occurred to me that it would, after all,
be more satisfactory, to apply to these observations, the facts
that might be actually observed, by making the distances of
the magnets and the line of their axes undergo the changes
I have specified, In consequence of this I made the following
experiments. A strong table being prepared, with the legs
firmly driven into the ground, at a distance from any building,

tions, and which, for the sake of distinction, I shall call No. 1,
