and to explain where we are able to make advances. Watson (1913) proves results
equivalent to those of Theorems 2 and 4* with g(t) subject to more restricted conditions,
viz. (i) that ¢(¢) is regular when .#(«t) >, and (ii) that there is a positive number A
such that, when | t| > XK and | arg (xt) | <47-+-A, ¢(t) possesses an asymptotic expansion

Oa s a,t"+Ry} (2:51)
n=1

for all N with | a, |<C,Cyn! and | Ryt'*! | <C,CYN!, where C,, C,, C,, C, are numbers

independent of t, n and N. Condition (ii) enables Watson to use the powerful theory

of asymptotic series which he had previously developed (Watson, 1912); in fact, when

this condition is satisfied, ¢(t) can be expanded in a convergent series of inverse factorials.

Hence in Theorems 2 and 4 my contributions are:

(i) It is enough for ¢(¢) to have an asymptotic expansion of the type (2°51) for some
N and without restriction on the magnitude of the coefficients in the expansion; from
this we may find an asymptotic expansion of /(x) to a corresponding degree of approxi-
mation.

(ii) The expansion of 4(¢) need not be in inverse integral powers.
