departure. 1 hope however to show in a future communication that this expresses a
very common relation between sets of lines, the constant A being in reality a com-
posite one. The question naturally arises do the new terms give rise to an F series
in the same way as the ordinary D? It should be at a distance about 267°13 in wave
number above that of F. The line 15713°3 (nm = 6362°25) is 266°90 above that of the
line 16401°5 (m = 6095°35) which is allotted by Pascuun to F,(3) and is clearly the
first of the lines in question. There is an F(4) line at 11630°8 (n = 8595°57) and
another at 11268'4 (n = 8872°01) is 266°44 above this. This may be the corresponding
line sought for, but if so the line 11630 must be F,(4) and the lines F, (4), F, (4)
would then be absent. These lines were at firstt assigned by PAscHEN to a new
doublet set of series, but later{ to combinations of his new singlet series with D, (~),
D, (©). This question will be considered as a whole later, but the suggested
explanation given above points rather to the fact that we have to do with a triplet
series in which the third number is too faint to be observed.

* D() stands as usual for D,( %) or Dy (~ ).
