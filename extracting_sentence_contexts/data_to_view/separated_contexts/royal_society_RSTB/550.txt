It is to be observed, however, that it was
under the conditions of arable culture, that is of artificially aérated soil, and with vege-
tation, that M. Drmtrar found great losses, whilst it is in wel] aérated soils, also with
vegetation, that M. Joutze finds such enormous gains. It is further to be observed that the large gains shown in M. Jounin’s results were
obtained chiefly in the growth of buckwheat, and not with plants of the Leguminous
family which are reputed to be “ Nitrogen collectors.” From our own results, taken
together with known facts as to agricultural production, and the fertility of soils, it
may be confidently affirmed that such gains as M. Jouxte finds within a period of
about 14 months, do not take place, either with or without vegetation, in ordinary
soils, in ordinary practice. 4. The Experiments of Dr. B. E. Dirrze.u.
