realistic noise model could greatly influence the quality of the reconstructions for a real dataset.
Table 1 summarizes the results of the above computations.

(ii) Space-dependent technological level

We will now look at the case where the technological level A(x, f) is not constant over both space
and time but is of the form seen in figure 9a. The corresponding capital distribution is shown in
figure 9b.

In figure 10, we can see that the reconstruction is again pretty good even without additional
regularization. Also, the reconstruction for higher values is better than in the previous case
with constant technology. This is simply due to the fact that higher values for the capital are
present in the data (figures 2 and 9a). We can further smoothen the solution by adding Tikhonov
regularization, but as the original reconstruction is already very good, it does not improve the
solution too much.

The behaviour for noisy data is the same as in the case of constant technology and therefore
we will not go into detail on this. Also, having a technology term that depends not only on space
but also on time (see (2.6)) has no influence on the reconstruction. In general, the technology
term only influences the capital distribution and therefore only indirectly the reconstruction of
the production function.
