1. Human supergenes and inversions

Supergenes are defined as clusters of tightly linked functional genetic elements
spanning hundreds of kilobases that control complex balanced phenotypes and
are inherited as a unit owing to reduced or absent recombination within them
[1-4]. Since recombination reduction is essential, the most common mechanism
of supergene formation are inversions [2,4], in which single crossovers between
heterozygotes lead to unbalanced gametes [5,6]. This allows the generation of
highly divergent haplotypes accumulating a large number of sequence differ-
ences, which can form coadapted gene complexes [5,6]. In fact, there are
many examples of inversion supergenes involved in adaptation in multiple
organisms, such as the polymorphic social behaviour of ants, the Batesian
