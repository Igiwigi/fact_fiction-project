I proceed to describe the stages which I have obtained in the formation of the
sheep's corpus luteum, When coition was known to have taken place, the fact is
recorded. The corpus luteum obtained from an animal killedâ€™ seven hows after coition differs
from the unburst follicle in its size and in the fact that the ovum and discus
proligerus have been discharged. It is a little more than half as large as the mature
follicle, and consequently does not protrude from the surface of the ovary. On the
other hand, the point of rupture is situated somewhat in a depression, Very little
blood is found remaining in the cavity of the follicle, but a few scattered corpuscles
are seen in the membrana granulosa, which was not discharged with the ovum and
discus proligerus, The blood corpuscles are apparently derived from vessels, the

valls of which have broken down, not merely near the point of rupture of the follicle,
but to a less extent around the whole theca interna.
