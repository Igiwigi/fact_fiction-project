depend upon the appropriateness of the composition of the animals actually anal
different conditions of maturity, to represent that of the animals (in their respective
ditions), to which the direct analytical data are to be applied. The results must, t
fore, be only looked upon as approximations; though, so far as we believe, the
now supplied constitute the most, reliable basis for estimates of this kind at present at
command. Indeed, in corroboration of the probable general correctness of the indica-
tions, it may be remarked, that, as fattened animals are seen to contain a much larger
proportion of dry substance than leaner ones, and as their dry substance contains a
larger proportion of fat, and less of nitrogenous and mineral matters, it is clear, that the
increase itself} must, contain a higher percentage of total dry substance and of fatty
matter, and less of nitrogenous and mineral matters, than the entire body of the fattened
animal. The estimates of the composition of inerease recorded in the Tables agree in
fact very well with what we might anticipate; and they are, with some slight qualifica-
tions, in the main consistent with the direct results arrived at, as to the composition of
the increase of the individual fattened pig. It should be remarked that the composi-
tions of the animals analysed, which form the basis of these estimates of the composi-
tion of increase, are given (see Table VIL.) on the fasted live-weight, 80 as to elimis
nate as far as possible the influence of the variable amount of contents of stomachs and
intestines. The percentages thus calculated to the fasted live-weight, are, however, for
the purposes of the Tables now under consideration, applied to the original and final
weights of animals, in the wafasted condition. 'The tendency of the correction due on
this head, would be slightly to reduce our estimated percentages of fat, and of total dy
matter, and slightly to raise those for the nitrogenous and mineral matters.

With regard to ozen, it was difficult to find the record of experiments, in which the
