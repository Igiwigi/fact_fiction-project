Table 1. Two versions of the honeybee’s tuneable behavioural algorithm as
used by Diwold et al. [45]. ‘Dance precision’ relates to the accuracy of the
bee's dance, while ‘recruitment precision’ refers to the probability that a
dance follower will locate the advertised site. In the A. mellifera version of
the algorithm, the decision is made once a site is visited by a threshold
number of bees (quorum), while the A. florea version requires a certain
level of vectorial consensus in the dances performed on the swarm.
