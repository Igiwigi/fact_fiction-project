On the basis of this information and based upon the revised terrain model of the Abydos
site, scientific measurements of the lander instruments will be re-evaluated, for instance: for
CONSERT the importance of surface layer reflections of the radio signal, for MUPUS the surface
illumination by the Sun, and for SESAME the acoustic reflections of the MUPUS hammering
signal in the surface layers. Data from other instruments (CIVA and ROLIS for details of the
lander surrounding) will work towards clarification of the detailed terrain morphology of the
landing site. Despite the fact that the prospects for lander operations at Abydos after January 2016 were
not promising (because the comet retreated from the Sun and thus the environmental conditions
for Philae were expected to turn towards hibernation level again), it was decided to keep
the lander telecommunication unit on-board Rosetta switched on and to continue sending the
communication trigger to the surface of the comet, listening for a reply by Philae. The unit was

finally switched off on 27 July 2016 10:00 UTC, which marks the end of the Philae mission to : =
comet 67P. =

With the descent and landing of the orbiter on 30 September 2016 the Rosetta mission was : 2
terminated, and, with the orbiter, the ‘key’ for contacting the lander was deposited on the comet. : &
The lander itself was left behind in its autonomous wake-up mode under hibernation conditions. _
Provided the lander survives, Philae start-ups may occur again during future returns of the comet : Ss
to the Sun; however, the lander will remain ‘quiet’, because it waits for the Rosetta communication : S
trigger before sending signals again. While reception of the lander carrier signal on Earth may be :s
possible under favourable conditions (for instance for close distances to Earth), contacting Philae : 5s

directly from Earth is far beyond the capabilities of existing radio telescope facilities.
