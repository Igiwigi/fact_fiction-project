This,
together with the lateness of the spore-formation in the individual life, have obscured
the evolutionary history. Still in certain cases spore formation does appear early ;
interesting examples are seen in Lycopodium Selago, where sporangia may be formed

notes that sporangia are formed on all the leaves, even of the young plant. The primitive sporophyte was probably of a radial type of construction, as are also
sporogonia, and microphyllous, with simple spore-bearing organs. The megaphyllous
state was probably of derivative origin.
