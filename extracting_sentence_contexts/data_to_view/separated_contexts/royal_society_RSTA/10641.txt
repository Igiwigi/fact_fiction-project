Lastly when s = 0, we have only cosine functions. As before

C = 1 — bBcos 26 — 4? (1 + cos 46) + Bp’,(1 — 48 cos 2) cos 2

E = + Bn’, cos 46
=1 — 158? — 18°p’, + tee ;

2 This must be equal to 4 and therefore - = 1-76 — ip’:
Now P's = — Fi, 2}, py = rhe [0 23] 4}.
& Hence z =r ieee fe k)— OS). swe (38).
t(i + 1)

Since in this case ¥; = eat

ee or C))

Thus the general formula again holds good. Tt is easy to verify that the other coefficients of are in fact reproduced. The principal use of the transforming factors, determined in this section, is that it
