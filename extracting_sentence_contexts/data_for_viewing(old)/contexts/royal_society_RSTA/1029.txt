becomes lower as time x (and also r) increases. Figure 2d illustrates a three-dimensional plot of
the distribution function and generalizes its behaviour shown in figure 2b,c.

4. Biomedical applications

The theory developed in this paper plays a decisive role in describing the nucleation of a
new phase and growth of crystals during aggregation in colloids and magnetic fluids, in the
production of insulin, proteins and other vital chemical substances. So, for instance, an important
part of investigations of protein growth is carried out using protein lysozyme, most often
extracted from hen egg white. The importance of studying this enzyme is connected with the
fact that it hydrolyses polysaccharides in bacterial cell walls. It can be used as an antiseptic
and as a food addition too [49]. Note that the rate of decay of the protein supersaturation in
crystallizing solutions of chicken egg-white lysozyme was studied by Kim et al. [50] when the
crystalline protein is more stable than the dissolved protein. The growth dynamics of another
important protein, canavalin (the jack bean storage protein), was studied by Caraballo et al.
