There are two ways to handle
this transient mixed heating. One is to simulate a time-dependent system directly (e.g. [120,131]),
but such simulation would depend on the particular choice of initial conditions. The other is to
translate transient mixed heating to equivalent steady-state mixed heating, by emulating the effect
of secular cooling with fictitious internal heating [132,133], and run a model until it reaches some
steady state; such a steady-state solution is usually independent of initial conditions. This steady-
state approach has been popular because it is easier to characterize steady-state solutions and thus
understand the underlying physics better. However, the effect of secular cooling is sometimes not
properly incorporated, and in that case, simulation results may not find their application to the
dynamics of the Earthâ€™s mantle [134].
