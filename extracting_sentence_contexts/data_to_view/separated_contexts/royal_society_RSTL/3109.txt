The diameter of Mars, as taken with the 5-feet Equatorial, was about ten
8econds. The observations were commenced at about seyen hours sidereal
time, whilst the nearest appulse was perhaps at about eleyen hours ; they were
not made for determining the place of Mars, but for noticing any phenomena
which the star might exhibit. The facts being now before us, the inferences may be comprised in a few
lines. Sir W. Herscatr's observation of the 27th of October 1783, and mine of
the small star on the 19th of February 1822, are at variance with Cassm1's
observation, but impugn not the accuracy of Rogmer's ; whilst my observa-
tions of 42 Leonis and of 37 Tauri, being apparently subversive of the obser-
vations both of Cassixt and of Romer, point out the © extensive atmosphere
of Mars” as a subject meriting further investigation.
