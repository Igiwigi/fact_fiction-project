the two is strikingly concordant.

In strong contrast with this conclusion is the evidence of the visceral skeleton.
The branchial arches in their number, limited to four, and in their position beneath
the skull afford a character, which finds no parallel among the Elasmobranchs, and
it is not till we reach the higher groups of Dipnoi and Amphibia, and then only in
larval forms, that we again encounter it, but in these it is precisely repeated.

With an agreement so close in this respect, we might reasonably expect to find an
equally marked correspondence between the jaws and suspensory apparatus, but, as
we have already seen, this expectation is disappointed. These structures in |
Palseospondylus remain, we believe, without any precise analogy. Reasoning upon
the observed facts alone the position of the gammation and pre-gammation is as
anomalous on a Selachian as upon a Dipnoan interpretation ; they suggest the idea of
a divided sub-orbital bar, but this, though ending close to the middle line of the skull
on the one hand, and to the auditory capsules on the other, is united to neither.
