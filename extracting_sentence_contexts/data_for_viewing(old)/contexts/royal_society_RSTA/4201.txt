Schwinger views quantum state disturbance in measurement as objectively significant
‘because at a higher level of classical measurement, disturbances produced by a measurement
can be admitted if they are known and therefore could be compensated for’ [15]. He viewed the
difference in the quantum case as due to the fact that

the measurement act involves a strong interaction [at the atomic level]. I repeat: on the
microscopic scale it is necessarily strong because we cannot cut the strengths of the charges
in half; we cannot change the properties of these fundamental particles; we must accept
them as they are—and so the measurement unavoidably produces a large disturbance,
which we cannot correct for in each individual instance, for we cannot control what
happens in each individual event in any detail... the program of computing what the effect
of the disturbance was and correcting for it is, in general, impossible. Accordingly, the
two basic tenets of the theory of macroscopic measurement are both violated. Either the
interactions cannot be made arbitrarily weak because of the phenomenon of atomicity, or if
we wish to accept this and correct for it, we cannot do so because we do not have a detailed,
deterministic theory of each individual event [15, p. 12].
