Both value B and the melting point measure
a limiting value of (C —I). The absence of any obvious relation to adsorption is,
however, paradoxical because the surface of break in these mixtures, sometimes, but
not always (XII), lies between the adsorbed layer (primary film) and the median
crystal plate (see Section 4). The facts suggest that, though a surface of slip may be defined as a plane surface
separating two portions of matter moving in opposite directions, a surface of break
may sometimes be far from plane because long molecules with their long axes oriented
in the direction of stress are, at the break, pulled apart, like teeth out of their sockets. The study of complex mixtures of substances such as are commercial lubricating
oils presents other aspects of the relation of friction to adsorption (ef. XII). 0250 Oil BArr
