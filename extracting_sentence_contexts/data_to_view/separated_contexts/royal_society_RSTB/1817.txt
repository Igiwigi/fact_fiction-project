Ed., p. 254) he remarks that the fact of each
sporangium having its own archesporium “ proves that in Maratiia, as in Angiopleris,
we have two rows of distinct sporangia, which have grown together by their lateral
faces.” We shall inquire subsequently whether the facts are always as stated, and
secondly whether this conclusion is really justified. Since Marattia is a middle type of the family, it was thought useful to trace the
origin and development of the sorus with the greater care, for purposes of comparison
on the one hand with Danaea and Kaulfussia, and on the other with Angiopteris. Moreover, this could be carried out with greater certainty, owing to a plentiful supply
of growing material of Marattia fraxinea (Smrru), which allowed of the earliest stages
being traced.
