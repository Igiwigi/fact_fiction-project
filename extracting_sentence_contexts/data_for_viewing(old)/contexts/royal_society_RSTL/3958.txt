It is very natural that the canse of this difference should be owing to the fact of
the muscular current circulating in a contrary direction to the other. And, in truth,
if the disposition of the elements which compose these piles be eyer $0 little changed,
s0 that the tendon of one of these elements be made to repose upon or near to the
interior of the muscle, the signs of eyery current become very weak or cease alto-
gether (fig. 10.).

I have prepared a number of anterior cubital mnscles, or muscles of the fore-arm
of frogs, which likewise have at their extremities, near the carpus, a very distinet
tendinous band. A pile composed of these muscles, disposing them as usual, with the
tendon resting on the muscular surface of the next element, gives constant and very
distinct signs of a current, the direction of which, in the musecle, is from the tendon
to the muscle. The following in the meanwhile is the generalization of the fact of
the proper current of the frog: the current is directed within the muscle from the
tendon to the superficies.

It remained for me to extend this fact to its operation upon the muscles of warm-
blooded animals, and the experiments accorded in such a manner as to leave no
possible doubt.

In these experiments I employed fowls, pigeons, rabbits and dogs. It is necessary
to operate with great rapidity upon these animals, since, as. in the muscular current,
the signs of the current which we are now studying cease very quickly. Not less
than six or eight elements are necessary for eliciting signs of this current sufficiently
evident to remove all doubt. In all these animals the muscular extremities turned
