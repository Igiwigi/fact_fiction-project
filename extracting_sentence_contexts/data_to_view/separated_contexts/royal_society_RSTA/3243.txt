The glass transition and limited fictive temperatures
as a function of the water content were determined
at 10K/min cooling/heating rates resulting in
Tg ranging from 245°C at nominally anhydrous
conditions to 83°C in the presence of 42mol% H20
in the glass. Through a generalized Gordon—Taylor
analysis, the factors k (7.27), kg (3.2) and the interaction
parameter A, (0.49) were derived. The limited fictive
temperature of a hypothetically, zero water containing

glass transition temperature, Gordon—Taylor
analysis, potassium—magnesium carbonate,
water, differential scanning calorimetry
