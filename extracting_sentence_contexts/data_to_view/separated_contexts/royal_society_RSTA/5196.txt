This is supported by the experiments that are in a
regime where the density is very high and shows little spatial variations. Our numerics are indeed
performed in this regime and show very little variations of the density even at the largest activity. Special attention should be devoted to the fact that the self-propulsion speed vg depends
linearly on the range R of a defect, this being defined as the defect-free portion of the system
surrounding a defect (and possibly coinciding with the entire system). Although two-dimensional
hydrodynamics is known to be plagued with anomalies, such as the Stokes paradox [50], this
behaviour does not result solely from the two-dimensionality of the problem. Point defects in
three dimensions would also yield a similar behaviour.
