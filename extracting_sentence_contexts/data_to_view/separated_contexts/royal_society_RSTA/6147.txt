An initial condition for such a system is given (top right) and the system evolves according to its microscopic :8
rules until an emergent pattern is observed. The reader might identify an analogy with the well-known Game of Life, a cellular : S
automaton proposed by John Conway in the 1970s [162] for which, more recently, quantum versions are being explored [163]. a

Note, however, that we do not require the state of the units to be binary, or even discrete. The analogy can be used to better
understand the rich basin of phenomena that can take place when a few microscopic rules and adequate initial conditions are
considered: in fact, it should be noted that not all possible LLMR and IC lead to HLP. See the text for further details. (Online

Note that the above classification applies well for two distinct types of emergent phenomena
we have been discussing: (1) the ones where the system Z itself emerges from its constituents,
as for the spontaneous organization into structural backbones mentioned in the previous section;
(2) the ones where macroscopic properties JT emerge because of the existence of a system (e.g.
superconductivity or the robustness of a network to random disruptions). Such a hierarchy
between emergent phenomena, involving large-scale structures and properties, can be used to
better understand the results of the studies published in this theme issue.
