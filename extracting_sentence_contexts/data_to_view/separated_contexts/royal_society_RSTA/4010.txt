If eutectics play an essential part in re-crystal-
lisation, these phenomena should disappear in the total absence of impurities capable
of forming eutectics. In a perfectly pure metal, re-crystallisation by annealing after
severe strain should not occur; but it is almost hopeless to obtain a specimen of such
purity as to justify the conclusion experimentally in this form. The degree of purity
required can be roughly gauged from the fact that 0°1 per cent. of carbon in iron is
easily visible as “pearlite” under the microscope ; so that, probably, an impurity of
one part in one million would vitiate the experiment. But our conclusion can be narrowed down to more practicable limits by putting it
in this way :—That if the presence of a eutectic is essential to crystalline growth,
then a crystalline boundary free from eutectic should be a barrier to all such growth.
