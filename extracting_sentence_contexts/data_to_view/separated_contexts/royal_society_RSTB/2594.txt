past ! On the contrary, it is one of several genera characterized by the fact that the
“spines” (growth-segments) of the septa are more or less unattached both in a
longitudinal and in a horizontal direction, About the middle of the septum the
tendency is for the spines to be compacted, but centrally and often peripherally the
tendency is for them to be freer. Lateral coalescence of the septal surfaces occurs
frequently. Besides, these genera show frequent signs of bilaterality.
