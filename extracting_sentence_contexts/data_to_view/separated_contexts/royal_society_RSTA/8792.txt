IN THE SPECTRUM OF MANGANESE. 163

6. THe Occurrence oF ‘ MULTIPLETS” IN OTHER SPECTRA,

In Sections 4e and 5 it has been shown that in the spectra of the neutral atom and
ionised atom of manganese many lines of the same character are related by certain
separations and form clearly defined multiplets. The accuracy of the separations, some
of them being identical with those of the ordinary series, together with the fact that
the lines of each group are of the same character, strongly suggests that the multiplets
have a real physical significance. Further evidence for their reality is afforded by the
occurrence of similar multiplets in the spectra of other-elements. Chromium.—The spectrum of the normal atom of chromium has been examined in
some detail, but the investigation is not completed, and no attempt will be made to
describe the whole system of series and multiplets.
