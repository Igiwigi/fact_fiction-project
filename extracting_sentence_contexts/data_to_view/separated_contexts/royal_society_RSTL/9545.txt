We know enough of gases to be certain that at
-a pressure of a quarter of an inch of mercury the ordinary laws of gases are in full
; that the average free path of the gaseous molecules is infinitesimal ; and the
number of collisions between them in any finite time inconceivably great, And yet
that pressure we can get phospharescence at a distance of at least two inches. | Although, therefore, we can no longer regard phosphorescence as 80 exceptional a
omenon as has been generally supposed, we are far from intending to underrate
ts importance as a characteristic phenomenon of electric discharge. But this impor-
1 is due to the fact that it becomes more and more prominent as the degree of
Zxhaust increases, and nob to its specially appertaining to any type of exhaust. And
'Rhis increase of importance is greatly enhanced by the consideration that the other
\Zharacteristics of the discharge, such as positive luminosity and the like, become
ually less and less marked as the degree of exhaust increases, till at length
Â» Ylmost the sole visible phenomenon of the discharge is the phosphorescence* in the
Zube caused by the streams of molecules which its passage excites.
