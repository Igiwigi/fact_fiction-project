If we compare these curyes with those of
fig. 11, Plate XLVI. representing the diffuse light, the singular fact becomes apparent,
that at the time of the vernal equinox the chemical actions which the direct sunlight
effects from the north pole to below the latitude of Petersburg is, during the whole day,
Tess than that effected by the total diffuse daylight; and that even in lower latitudes,
down to the equator, the same phenomenon is observed, if not for the whole, yet for a
portion of the day. A further comparison of formule (9.) and (14.), «hows that not only at the vernal
equinox, but at all times and in all places where the sun rises more than 20® 56' above
the horizon, from sunrise till it attains a given height above the horizon, the chemical
action effected by the diffase daylight exceeds that of the direct swlight ; and that as
the 8m gradually rises, a point is reached at which both sunlight and diffuse daylight
produce exactly the same amount of chemical action, whilst beyond this point the effect
of the sunshine is most powerful. This © phase of equal chemical illumination” between
daylight and sunshine, occurs twice daily, and represents a certain zenith-distance of the
$un (@), which may be found by a method of approximation from the formula

where the expression to the right denotes the chemical action effected by the Sunlight
at the pressure P (formula 14.), and that on the left hand gives the action proceeding
from the whole heavens (formula 9.).
