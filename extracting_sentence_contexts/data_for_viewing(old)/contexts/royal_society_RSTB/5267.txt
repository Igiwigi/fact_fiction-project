406 T. M. HARRIS ON SCHIZOPODIUM DAVIDI: A NEW TYPE OF

2. Schizopodium has a sort of secondary wood. ‘This wood has, however, been shown
to be intermediate between the centrifugal primary xylem of plants with mesarch
protoxylem, and secondary wood formed from an ordinary cambium.

3. The stele in Schizopodium has the shape of the xylem, which is commonly a star,
while in Asteroxylon the stele is round, even when the xylem is star-shaped. This
fact justifies the generic separation of Schizopodium from Asteroxylon, but is
not sufficient to place them in different families ; in stems with no sharp dis-
tinction between ‘inner cortex” and “‘ phloem,” the exact position of the
boundary cannot be of great importance.

Asteroxylon elberfeldense, KRAUSEL and WEYLAND (1923), has a cavity in the wood
filled with some delicate tissue, but it is not known whether this has the characteristics
of phloem or of cortex. In any case, the mixture of tracheids and parenchyma, which
occurs in the xylem of most ferns, is not known to occur in Asterozylon.

2. The Rhyniacew.—Rhynia and Hornea, Kipston and Lane (1917, 1920a), have
branching leafless axes, like those of Schizopodium, but a round stele instead of a star-
shaped one. It is not yet proved that the whole plant of Schizopodium was leafless, so
