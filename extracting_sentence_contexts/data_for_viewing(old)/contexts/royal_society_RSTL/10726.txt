method is that the galvanometer and the resistance-coils may be a hundred yards or
more from the rest of the © bridge ” without any chance of fluctuations of temperature
materially influencing the result, even when the most minute variations of electrical
conductivity are to be measured.

The deflections of the galvanometer were read in the usual manner by means of the
image of a fine wire fixed vertically across one end of a small blackened tube, into the
other end of which was fitted a lens for focussing the image of the wire on to the mirror
of the galvanometer; and the end of the tube at which the wire was situated was
illuminated by a paraffin lamp, placed 80 that the edge of the flame was in front of the
wire, the reflected circle of light with the fine dark line across the centre being very

clearly defined on the scale, though the latter was at a distance of 6 feet from the
galvanometer.* F ED

The adjusting magnet was almost always used to assis the directive foree of the
earth's magnetism on the needles, as it was found that by so doing the shifting of the
zero-point caused by the above-mentioned thermo-electric currents was considerably
diminished, and at the same time the instrument was sufficiently sensitive. The wires
8 and O, which were made as nearly as possible of the same resistance, were, after being
