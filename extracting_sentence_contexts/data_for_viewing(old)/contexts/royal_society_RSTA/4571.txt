Ontario, the provincial government had brought electricity to nearly all its citizens, and at costs
that were lower than the privately generated electricity available just across the Falls. And it was
this key fact—that public electricity was cheaper—that the industry began to fight.

3. The National Electric Lighting Association response

Industry leaders insisted that the alleged facts about Ontario power were not facts at all. (They

any suggestion that public generation or management of electricity was desirable, to strengthen

that anything other than private control of industry was socialistic and therefore un-American.
Specifically they argued that
