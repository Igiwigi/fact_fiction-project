Evolution cannot simply
invent a new structure, complete with a full developmental
schedule, and connect it up to an existing system. Instead,
brain evolution involves the elaboration and specialization
of existing structures and elongation of ancestral circuits
whose neuroanatomical topology is remarkably conserved
[41]. For example, circuits interconnecting the striatum, palli-
dum and cerebral cortex/neopallium are effectively the same
in both mammals and birds [42], despite the fact that their
respective lineages diverged about 310 Ma [43]. Indeed,
such major features of the human telencephalon are shared
with teleost fishes, which diverged from the lineage leading
to humans about 450 Ma. Because the neuroanatomical organization of these circuits
was laid down so long ago, we obviously should not attempt
to explain their functional roles from a perspective that focuses
exclusively on human cognitive behaviour.
