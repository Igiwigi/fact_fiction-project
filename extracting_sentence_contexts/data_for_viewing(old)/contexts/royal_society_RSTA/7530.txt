3. TYPES OF SINGULARITY

A large range of singularities can be regarded as particular cases of a type of surface
singularity considered by Somigliana (1914) (cf. also Gebbia 1902; Mann 1949; Bogdanoff
1950). Following Neményi (1931) we shall call this singularity a Somigliana dislocation.
It can be generated in the following way. Make a cut over a surface s (open or closed) in an
unstrained body and give the faces of the cut a small relative displacement, removing
