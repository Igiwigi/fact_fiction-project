seems to a certain extent requisite. The researches of this distinguished philosopher
have inyested electrical phenomena generally with a new interest, and exposed noyel
and important features in the theory of electrical action.

The investigations in this department of science, which I have now the honour of
presenting to the Royal Society, will, I hope, be found to contain matter of sufficient
interest to render them not unworthy of its acceptance.

2. The existence of an invisible agency in the natural world, designated by the
term electricity, may be inferred from the tendency of bodies toward each other, when
subjected to a peculiar kind of excitation, by means of various operations, such as by
the contact of dissimilar bodies, friction, changes of temperature, of form, and the
like. Many striking facts seem to warrant the supposition that this agency is de-
pendent on an extremely subtile species of matter, either of a compound or elementary
character, everywhere present, and operating according to certain laws, which it is
the province of experiment and analysis to determine.

3. This hypothesis appears, upon the whole, to be not ill adapted to an easy expla-
nation of appearances, and to the purposes for which hypothesis may be legitimately
