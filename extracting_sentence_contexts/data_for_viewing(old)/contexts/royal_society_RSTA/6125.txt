are violated.


1 depends on the state of subsystem 2, i.e. subsystem 1 observes subsystem 2 as it evolves, then
there is only one unit rather than two. Accordingly, equation (3.20) tells us that the global EP
rate can depend on this property of whether subsystem 1 observes the state of subsystem 2 as
subsystem 1 evolves, even though the conditional distribution of subsystem 1’s final state given its
initial state, Pla (tp) x(t), X2(t;)), is independent of the state of subsystem 2. In general, this effect
of the unit structure on the EP will occur whenever the two subsystems are initially statistically
coupled. See electronic supplementary material, appendix E for a discussion.

Equation (3.21) applies to any unit structure. In addition, for any unit structure M* over a set
of coordinates M C w, equation (3.15) and the fact that the union of a set of units is itself a unit
means that «° — o™ > 0. Therefore using equation (3.21) to expand o™ gives

o? = Yocum” >-arTM, (3.22)

Equation (3.22) holds even if M* Cc .N“*, and at the other extreme, even if no unit in M* is also in
N*.

4. Strengthened second law for composite systems

In general, to evaluate the in-ex sum of local EPs on the rh.s. of equation (3.21) requires detailed
knowledge of the precise rate matrices during the process. However, following Landauer, the
goal in this paper is to derive bounds that are independent of those details, depending only on
