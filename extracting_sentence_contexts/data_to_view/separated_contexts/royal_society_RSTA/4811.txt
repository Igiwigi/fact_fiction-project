For
the TADF emitter 4CzTPN-Ph, the delayed fluorescence could be attributed to the relatively low
kgisc and long lifetime of T; excitons. In the case of TPA-NZP, due to the triplet excitons being
harvested along the high-lying energy levels, krisc could be possibly close to or even larger than
the radiative rate according to Kashaâ€™s rule, and it is reasonable that no delayed fluorescence was
observed in both PL and EL processes. In fact, the large kgjgc of the hot exciton materials facilitates
the enhancement of device stability, which is a critical evaluation for the OLED performance. So it
is convincing that in TPA-NZP device, the high EQE of 1.7% and 1.6% was still maintained at the
brightness of 100 and 1000 cd m~?, respectively, which were among the best results in non-doped
deep-red OLEDs.

5. The design principle for the 5; state of hot exciton materials

As mentioned above, high-performance OLEDs should take account of several factors, such as
Ns, NPL aNd Nrec.
