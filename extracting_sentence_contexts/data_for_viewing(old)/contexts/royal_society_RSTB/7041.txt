(ii) Uterine connective tissue

Normal adult. Of the types of connective tissue examined, that situated immediately
beneath the endometrium of the corpus uteri, and known as the lamina propria, was found
to be especially suitable for a study of cell division. It contains an abundance of cells in
the network of reticular fibres, and these cells appear to be much more active mitotically
than those, for instance, of the submucous connective tissue of the alimentary canal and
of the dermis, although mitoses were seen in both of these last situations. The mitoses
observed in the lamina propria were entirely typical. The cells became swollen with non-
staining cytoplasm, and showed the normal metaphase figure arrested by the action of
colchicine. It should be recorded, however, that this change in the size and appearance of
the cell when in division made it difficult in most cases to be quite certain that the cell
involved was in fact a connective tissue cell and not a wandering lymphocyte. However,
as lymphocytes, once fully formed, were not seen to divide in other localities, such as the
wall of the duodenum where they are common, it was presumed that most, if not all, of
the mitoses observed were in cells belonging to the connective tissue. Counts, of mitoses
were made in unit areas of 0-01 sq.mm. in sections of the uterus, and the type of variation
to be seen during a normal oestrous cycle is indicated in table 42 and in figure 8. Cell
division was rare during the first and second days of dioestrus, but it became much more
common on the third day of dioestrus and in pro-oestrus. The wave of activity reached
its height during early oestrus, and was followed by a period of quiescence which lasted into
dioestrus. A slight, and perhaps insignificant, rise in the numbers of mitoses was observed
in metoestrus.
