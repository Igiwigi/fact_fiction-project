framework. Metapopulations are defined as a collection of
spatially restricted local populations connected by some
degree of migration (i.e. a patch network) [13], and their
dynamics can be described by mathematically rigorous
models using biological and landscape data from real
metapopulations [14]. Metapopulation models are most com-
monly used in conservation planning to help identify habitat
patches critical for the persistence of threatened populations,
earmark these critical areas for protection and study the
effects of habitat loss at the network level [15]. However,
populations of invasive species inhabiting and moving
across fragmented habitat often fulfil the criteria of a meta-
population [16-19], and are in fact more often likely
to satisfy the metapopulation modelling assumptions of
dynamic population equilibrium and low detection error
than are populations of threatened species that are rare and
in decline [20]. It follows that the traditional metapopulation
approach could be used ‘in reverse’ to identify habitat
patches important to invaders, prioritize those patches for
management and study how localized management efforts
might influence broader invasive population dynamics
across the network of patches [17,21].

Among the existing metapopulation modelling approaches
(e.g. [22-24]), the incidence function model (IFM) might be the
