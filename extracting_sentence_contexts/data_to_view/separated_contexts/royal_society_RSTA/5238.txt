Between the datasets on 3 June 2004 and 4 June 2004, the source mass stacks were all rotated
180Â° (around their vertical axis). The scatter in the first group of points also appears lower than
in the second group. This correlates with the fact that the day-to-day shifts in the measured stack
positions increased by about 50% after 14 May 2004. Before we started taking data on 12 May,
the source mass system had been running for some time and was well adjusted. After the motor
failed, we were never able to get the system quite as well adjusted as before.
