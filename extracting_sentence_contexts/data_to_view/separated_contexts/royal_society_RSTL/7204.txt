The average of the means of these four series of experiments, 0-436, 0-432, 0-431,
0-425, gives 0431 as the specific heat of the coal-tar naphtha A between 14” and 52*;
this value is taken in calculating the experiments in the following section.

28. If it were only a question as to the determination of the specific heat of this
naphtha, the method described in the preceding might be advantageously replaced by
another. For by this method the specific heat of the liquid must be found somewhat
too great, owing to the fact that in the empty space in the glass under the stopper a dis-
tinct quantity of yapour is formed, which condenses when the glass is dipped in the
water of the calorimeter (compare ( 25). Direct experiments, in which this forma-
tion of vapour was almost entirely avoided, have shown that the method used for the
previous determinations, that is, the use of glasses for heating the liquid in which a

relatively considerable space above the liquid remains empty, gives the specific heat of
readily vaporizable liquids somewhat too high, but that at the same time this influence
of the formation and condensation of vapour is very small in the conditions under which
T worked*,—The number 0-431 obtained in the previous determinations expresses the
thermal action due to the cooling of 1 grm. naphtha A through 1* in my experiments,
which thermal action depends to by much the greatest extent on the specific heat of this
liquid, and only to a very small extent on the condensation of the previously formed vapour,
In calculating the experiments communicated in the third section, that number is taken
as the expression for the thermal action of naphtha, which is put as proportional to the
weight of the latter.
