The first assertion follows from (3.6); the second from the first and (3:3). ’

Local theory. For any prime ideal p of §, let N,(m;1) denote the norm of m&,, with
respect to mR, (over R,).

TueoreM 4. If m,ne H, and if n has a finite R-basis, N,(m; 1) = ®,.N(m;n). Under the
same conditions

N(m;n) = N,(m;n),

where p runs through all maximal ideals of R.°

Proof. It is clear that N(m;n) ¢ N,(m;n), and in fact that R,.M(m;n) < N,(m;n), the
latter being an R,-ideal. On the other hand, consider any @,8 such that mR, >, . («),
nk, © R,. (8). There exists we R such that m2 R. (ua), uA0mod p; because n has a finite

R-basis, there also exists ve R such that om SR. (8), vAO mod p. From these relations it
follows that

(w)" N(a;8) = N(wa; 0p) N(m3n).
This shows that V,(m;n) ©R,.W(m;n), and completes the proof that
N,(m; 1) = R,. N(m5n).
The intersection formula follows from (8.1).

(3.8) Suppose that m,neH, and that n has a finite R-basis. If N(m;1) is an inversiv
