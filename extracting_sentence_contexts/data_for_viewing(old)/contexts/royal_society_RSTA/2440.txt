low toxicity, light weight and mechanically flexible materials (figure 4a), well-suited for low-
temperature operation. Performance is encouraging but still moderate, with zT values lower than
0.5 for both polymers and carbon nanomaterials (nanotubes — CNT, fullerenes and graphene)
[11]. Thermal and environmental stability are also concerns, especially for n-type thermoelectrics.
Given the solid potential of organic-based materials for sustainable thermoelectric applications,
it would be desirable to understand what is currently limiting their performance and devise
strategies to move forwards.

2. Limiting factors in the performance of organic thermoelectrics

In a very enlightening piece of work, Chabynic, Segalman ef al. discovered that the Seebeck
coefficient for a large number of organic thermoelectric materials was proportional to o~1/4, and
thus the power factor (S2o) increased with o!/? [12 (figure 3a). The fact that this empirical rule
was satisfied by many systems with very different chemical structures prompted strong research
activities in two directions. On the one hand, the most standard theories did not predict this
behaviour, so more advanced fundamental theories of electronic transport were advanced [13-
15]. On the other hand, it suggested that further improvement in power factor could come as a
result of further increases in the electrical conductivity: no maximum has been yet detected in the
S’o versus conductivity for organic-based compounds.

A large body of work has since been produced with the aim of improving doping both for
polymers [16-19] and CNTs [20,21]. The standard doping method, namely molecular doping,
has a number of challenges, including controlling the ratio between partial and integer charge
transfer, phase separation of the semiconductor and the dopant (e.g. figure 4b), vitrification
of the polymer which results in loss of the mechanical properties and difficulty to dope thick
