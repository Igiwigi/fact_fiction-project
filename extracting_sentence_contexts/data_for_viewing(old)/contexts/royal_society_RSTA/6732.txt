Within these limits of error it can, therefore, be assumed that the pressure due to a single
regular train of waves is sinusoidal on the sea bed and will be represented in the harmonic
analysis by a single frequency.

The swell observed on the coast is not in general a regular train of waves, and many
periodicities are present at the same time. There is no theory for a complex wave pattern,
but it is expected that the theory discussed above will give at any rate the order of magnitude
of the higher harmonics of each constituent wave train.

APPENDIX 2. FREQUENCY ANALYSIS OF PRESSURE RECORDS

Introduction

We have seen that the velocity potential of swell may be described as the sum of a num-
ber of sine-wave potentials whose frequencies lie in well-defined and slowly varying ranges.
The length of the records can be adjusted so that during any one record the frequency band
from each generating area remains roughly constant. An analysis of the records according
to their frequency characteristics should, therefore, provide material for the study of the
generation, rate of travel, etc., of the swell.
