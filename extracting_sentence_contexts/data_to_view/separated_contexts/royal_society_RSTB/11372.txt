Figure 5. (a) Comparison of the topologies of the predicted TF—TF networks with the literature-based network for the top-ranking algorithms. The transcription
factors PouSf1, Sox2 and Nanog are indicated by magenta dots. (b) Degree distribution for the TF—TF gene regulatory networks predicted by the indicated algor-
ithms, with aracne_15 and aracne_5O denoting the ARACNE algorithm with 0.15 and 0.5 as cut-off parameter and pcor_pls denoting partial correlation in the pls
implementation.
