the disadvantage in genetic fitness that accrues from reprodu-

precedence to the observation that, in fact, sexual reproduction
is extremely common and an adequate explanatory model is
an ugly conglomeration of multiple simple and beautiful
hypotheses. Each hypothesis on its own seems elegant and
yet unable to explain the data. Altogether, these hypotheses
may be sufficient, as described by Nick Lane, a fellow of the
Royal Society, in his book Life Ascending [129]. In fact, this
book received an award from the Royal Society, which is
sponsoring this issue.

Similarly, in metabolic scaling, the 3/4-power law of
metabolism has become the proposed universal law and, as
Douglas Glazier discusses [130], many hypotheses have been
