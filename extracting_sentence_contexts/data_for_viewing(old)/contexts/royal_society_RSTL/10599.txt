fairly prominent. Veronica Chamedrys, Centaurea nigra, and Cerastium triviale,
occurred in only insignificant amounts. In the second and 8ubsequent separation-
years, notwithstanding that the second (1867) was very favourable to the growth of
miscellaneous herbage over the plots generally, the Miscellanee collectively, and the
Rumez especially, were in very much smaller proportion, and amount, than in the first
separation-year. Of the other species, those which gained ground, or maintained
a fair relative position, after the discontinuance of the dung, were Plantago Tanceo-
lata, Ranuneulus repens and bulbosus, and Achillea Millefolinum. Ranunculus acrs,
Centaurea nigra, Veronica Chamedrys, and Cerastium triviale, though in smaller
amounts, alsÂ» showed tendency to increase. Conopodium denudatum, on the other
hand, gradually diminished. The tendency of change under the influence of the
decreasing available residue of the dung was, in fact, to decrease the unusual promin-
ence of Rumer, and to bring a larger number of species into position in the struggle.

Comparing the actual yield of the different groups and species of plants on plot 2
with their amounts without manure, ib is seen that in the firs separation-year there
5 was a very considerable excess of total Graminew, a deficiency of total Leguminos,
and a large excess of total Miscellanee, under the influence of the dung. Among the
grasses, Poa trivialis and Bromus mollis were in very large excess. Avend flavescens,
Dactylis glomerata, and Avena elatior, were in moderate, and Poa pratensis in small
excess. On the other hand, those which were in marked deficiency, compared with
the produce without manure, were Festuca, ovina, Agrostis vulgaris, Avena pubescens,
Lolium perenne, and Anthoxanthum odoratum. Tt is thus een that the grasses which
yielded an excess on the manured plot were, for the most part, of freer growth and of
