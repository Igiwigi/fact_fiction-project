All the plants of A. grandis used in this experiment were readily attacked by D. niisslini.
The young larvee settled quite freely and were certainly not impeded in any way by the
presence of short hairs on the young stem. It was noticeable, however, that they con-
centrated in greater numbers round the buds and stem nodes, than along the whole

length of the shoot, and again that in many cases the stem had swollen considerably in
size locally following the attack, and showed a similar character to that assumed by
Abies nobilis when attacked by D. picee. This has been observed on all the plants
affected, the terminal buds of which become quite globular in shape (text-fig. 10), and
show large numbers of larve settled upon them. In fact, wherever one finds a bud upon
which the Chermes have settled this swelling begins to appear within a few weeks.*

* This applies even to small buds occurring at different points on the stem.


AND ITS RELATION TO THE SILVER FIR. 55

The swelling of the stem is not only noticeable in the bud region, but may occur also
at the branch nodes, and also at other points on the main stem, which may therefore
show several nodular thickenings. Sections of such stems showed the following
characters :—
