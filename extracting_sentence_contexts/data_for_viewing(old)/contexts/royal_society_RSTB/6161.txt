from their nuclei and pass laterally and slightly ventrally through the descending
root and nucleus of the fifth nerve to emerge from the dorso-lateral aspect of the
tuberculum quinti just below the flocculus, fig. 8. There is no intracerebral
distinction between vagus and the cranial portion of the accessory.

into the paraflocculi. The nodule is continuous with the flocculi. The uvula has no relation
to any part of the cerebellar hemispheres.

The Seventh Nerve—The facialis nucleus of Echidna is usually described as comprising
separate dorsal and ventral parts as in the Sauropsida. There is, in fact, only one
facialis nucleus. This is very large and extends caudally almost to the anterior
pole of the nucleus ambiguus ; frontally it reaches the level of maximum develop-
ment of the fifth motor nucleus, fig. 13. The seventh nucleus has not yet attained
that characteristically ventral position which appears first in marsupials, and it still
lies dorsal to the superior olive, fig. 11. In the opossum it lies on a level with, and
posterior to, the superior olive. The cells of the nucleus are very large.

The posterior part of the seventh nucleus is massive, fig. 10. As it extends
forwards it ascends slightly and at the level of the anterior pole of the sixth
nucleus divides to be continued in dorsal and ventral projections. These pass
