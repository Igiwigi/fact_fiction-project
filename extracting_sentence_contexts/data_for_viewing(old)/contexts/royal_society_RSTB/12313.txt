embryonic morphogenesis competed for scientific approval
during much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries [8].

Aristotle is frequently represented as an early supporter
of epigenesis (for example, Peck asserts in a footnote on
p. 144 of Generation of animals that ‘Aristotle was an epigeneti-
cist’). Unfortunately, it is all too easy to attribute modern
understanding to ancient authors, giving later meaning to
their language that was not intended, nor even understood
at the time; the meanings of the terms epigenesis and prefor-
mation have changed almost continuously ever since they
were first used, and it is risky to recruit antique authors to
modern arguments [39]. And in fact, Aristotle’s position on
the question of epigenesis or preformation is never clearly
stated [40]. The philosopher is uncharacteristically modest
in confessing his inability to explain what is going on, saying:

And on this subject we are confronted by no small puzzle. [4]

However, we may glimpse Aristotle’s probable view in his
long and detailed consideration of the possible mechanisms
whereby embryogenesis might take place [4] [GA
733b24—735a29]. The discussion is not of course conducted
