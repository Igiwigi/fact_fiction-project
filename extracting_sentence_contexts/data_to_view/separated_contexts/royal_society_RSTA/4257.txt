A shape function
Subject Areas: could be any smooth 2z-periodic function. Based
applied mathematics on this model, we propose to solve an optimization
problem to extract the shape function. By exploring

Keywords: the fact that the shape function is a periodic function
sparse time-frequency decomposition, with respect to its phase function, we can identify
intra-wave frequency modulation, certain low-rank structure of the signal. This low-rank
shape function structure enables us to extract the shape function from
the signal. Once the shape function is obtained, the

instantaneous frequency with intra-wave modulation

Author for correspondence: can be recovered from the shape function.
