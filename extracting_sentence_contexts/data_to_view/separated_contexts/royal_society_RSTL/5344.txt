Upon the face of the formulte, z,,, and 7, which are in fact
only of the degrees r+1, and 7 respectively in z would appear to be of the degree
1+3+5+...+(2r—1), 1.e. of the degree >. Art. (47.). 1 may add the important. remark, which, does-not appear. to, have
occurred immediately to my friend M. Here when he! communicated-to 'methe
above most interesting results, that in fact, by'virtue of the law of inertia for quadratic
forms, we may dispense with any identification of the successive coaxal determinants
of the matrix to the generating function

MR: SYLVESTER! 'ON! FORMULZ/ CONNECTED WITH: STURM'S THEOREM; 485

with my formulz for the Sturmian functions; and prove ab mitto in the most simple
manner, that the snccessive ascending coaxal determinants (always of course supposed
to be taken about the axis of symmetry) of the matrix'to the form above written, or
to the more general form (which I shall:quote as G, viz.)
SE(e—h)"{0,. (ht +8.(h wk ol + One (fon) thu}? **11 ofy [vet Jeet an (G.)
(where @,, @....0, are absolutely arbitrary integra] forms of function with real
coefficients), will form a rhizoristic series in regard to fi (4. e. a series, the difference
between the number of the continuations of sign between the successive terms of
which, corresponding to, two different values of e will-determine the number of real
roots of es lying between such two assumed values), provided only that q be an odd
positive or negative /integer., Nothing can be easjer than the demonstration, fer
whenever g is greater than any one of the real roots as (/,)
Ist. Any pair of imaginary roots will give rise to two terms of the form
({+my/ =1)%(v+wy/—=1)* and ({>my/ —1).(0=wy/=1):;
or, more simply,
(L+My/=I).(v*+w*+200/—1)
and (L=My/=1).(v* —u* —2p0/ =1),

where v and w are real linear functions of wu, 1,,...v, The sum of which couple
will be

2(L.(v—v) —2Muwr) =Z:{(Lu—MveY—(L2+M)v} =p'—q*;

s0 that each such couple combined will for eyery value of = give rise to one positive
and one negative square,
