differentiated to the more differentiated state. With this increasing definition of the
strobilus there. is associated a larger number of the sporangiophores ; but it is to be
noted that where the number of the sporangiophores is larger, the number of the
sporangia which they individually bear is commonly smaller, though there is no strict
numerical relation. ?

How this larger number of the sporangiophores originated it is impossible to say
with certainty, but it is significant that where the number of the sporangiophores is
the same as that of the sporophylls (as appears to be the case at least sometimes in
S. majus), the sporangiophore is subtended by the sporophyll, as in the Lycopods and
the Psilotaceze ; where the number is double that of the sporophylls, asin S. Dawsoni,
the vascular bundles of each pair come off as branches from the corresponding foliar
bundle. In certain cases also the pedicels are coalescent at the base. Such facts as
these would be compatible with fission of sporangiophores, similar to that process
which has led not uncommonly to an increase in number of stamens in the flowers
of Angiosperms.+ But lateral fission, if it did oceur, cannot account for all cases of
more numerous sporangiophores ; in S. Roemeri they appear, from the description of

* It may be noted that the alternate and verticillate arrangements of leaves are both represented in the
gents Lycopodium, while some species show intermediate conditions between the two.

+ Chorisis of the pedicels has already been suggested by Scorr in the case of S. Dawsoni, “On
Cheirostrobus,” p. 27.
