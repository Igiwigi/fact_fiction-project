exercise was done to eliminate the X-ray attenuation due to the presence of air along the data-ray.
The intensity of X-ray radiation was measured with a 16-bit data resolution which distinguishes

65536 different intensity levels. This fact helps in detecting air bubbles and PVC particles of
0.1mm and correspondingly low phase fractions in the bubble column.

Projection data were collected for two different X-ray energies: 60 and 200 keV. The attenuation
property of an object is significantly different for these two energy regions which help in
calculating the three phases separately. The three phases used for this study were water, air and
PVC granules. Air supply was via 54 holes of 1 mm diameter at the bottom of the bubble column.
These holes were distributed uniformly over the entire cross section. Water supply was via seven
nozzles of 16 mm diameter. These nozzles were secured with a wire mesh to avoid falling PVC
granules. Individual granular PVC particles were cylindrical in shape with diameter varying from
3 to 3.5mm and their height ranged from 2 to 3mm.
