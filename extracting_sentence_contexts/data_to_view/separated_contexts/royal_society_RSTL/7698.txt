which is in fact identical with the expression (41). The locus of the points for which one of the principal tangents meets a given line,
$ay, the line (a,, b,, G6 fs Jn hy), will be found by eliminating A, B, C, D from the
equations (42), (43), (44), combined with the following condition :

But since the principal tangent is the intersection of the plane (A, B, C, D) with the
tangent plane, we have
