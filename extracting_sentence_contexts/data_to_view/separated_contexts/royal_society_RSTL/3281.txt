Evpwasrps, a contrivance in my opinion possessing more merit than has usually been
ascribed to it: I found that a speculum of four inches aperture, and eighteen inches
focus, after having been polished by hand as truly spherical as I could make it, was
invariably improved by working it on the elliptic polisher ; however, on applying the
same principle to larger specula, the result was less snecessful ; and after a great many
trials with a speculum of eighteen inches aperture, I found it would not answer. On
measuring the focal length of the surface at different distances from the centre of the
Face, it was certain that the radins of curvature always increased much too rapidly
towards the edge; and when the principle upon which the elliptical polisher acts is
considered, it is evident that such a result might have been anticipated, and that the
defect, though scarcely perceptible in very small specula, would have been very im-
portant where the dimensions were considerable. Having observed that when the extent of the motions of the polishing machine
were in certain proportions to the diameter of the speculum, its focal length gradu-
ally and regularly increased, that fact snggested another mode of working an ap-
proximate parabolic figure. If we suppose a spherical surface, under the operation of
grinding and polishing, gradually to change into one of longer radius, it is very evi-
dent that, during that change; at no one instant of time will it be actually spherical, and
the abrasion of the metal will be more rapid at each point as it is more distant from the
centre of the face. When, however, the focal length neither increases nor diminishes,
the abrasion will become uniform over the whole snrface, producing a spherical figure.
