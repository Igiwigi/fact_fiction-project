The results of observation are 1449, 159®, 207% They are not, however, entirely to be
relied upon, since the ethers of monobromacetic acid, and especially those possessing
higher boiling-points, are partially decomposed by ebullition. In a few substances other than acids, the substitution of C, H, for H is occasionally
attended by a decrease of 44® in the boiling-point; that of C, H, for H by a decrease of
63% Ordinary (ethyl) ether, C, H,, O,, boils at 34?, 4. e. 44 lower than ethyl-alcohol,
C, H; O,; methyl-amyl-ether, C,, H,, O,, at 72% (W1LLIAMS0N), 7. e. 63 lower than amyl-
alcohol, C,, H,, O,. If any doubt remained as to the expediency of representing ordinary
ether by the formula C, H,, O,=(C, H,)(C, H,)O,, instead of the formula C, H, O, this
observation might be of some importance ; but the comparison of the boiling-points of
alcohols and of s0-called simple and mixed ethers, shows that the aforesaid regularity is
not, general, a circumstance arising from the fact of the elementary difference C, H,, in
the series of ethers C, H,,, O,, involving a difference of boiling-points other than that
corresponding to the elementary difference C, H, in the series of alcohols C, H,., O.. The preceding Tables contain a great number of illustrations of the facts, that many
compounds containing benzoyl (C,, H, O,) or benzyl (C,, H;) boil at a temperature 78?
higher than the corresponding compounds of valeryl (C,, Hy O,) or of amyl (C, H,). The benzoy]l- and benzyl-compounds, when compared with the compounds of valeryl and
amyl, contain 4C more and 4H less, They boil mostly, in accordance with the rules
given (page 261), at a temperature (4 x 14%5)+(4 x 5®)=78? higher.
