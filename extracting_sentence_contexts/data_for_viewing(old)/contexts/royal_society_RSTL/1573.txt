Addition to the Croonian Lecture for the Year 1810,

In the experiments formerly detailed, where the circulation
was maintained by means of artificial respiration after the head
was removed, I observed that the blood, in its passage through
the lungs, was altered from a dark to a scarlet colour, and
hence I was led to conclude that the action of the air produced
in it changes analogous to those, which occur under ordinary
circumstances, I have lately, with the assistance of my friend
Mr. W. BranDE, made the following experiment, which ap-
