Maxwett has worked out the
consequences of the ggtter hypothesis in his well-known theory,* which is unrivalled
in its high degree of accuracy and (after some improvements by BourzMannt) in its
perfection of mathematical form. All the quantities not taken account of in the
theory (such as the time occupied by molecular encounters, and the effect of collisions
in which more than two molecules take part) are properly negligible under ordinary
conditions. The theory has the disadvantage, however, that the underlying
hypothesis is highly artificial (being chosen chiefly on account of mathematical
simplifications connected with it, rather than from any physical reasons), and does
not represent the real facts at all adequately.

type there contemplated as a Maxwellian gas.
