There is a corresponding set at 5410°97,
5408°80, 5405°08, with the same separations within error limits and intensities 3, 4, 3,
again with the centre strongest. The strongest lines of these two triplets form a
series with the observed value of D’(8). They are of a diffuse type and in fact

* These are not to be confounded with K.R.’s possible errors. The possible errors are probably
larger.
