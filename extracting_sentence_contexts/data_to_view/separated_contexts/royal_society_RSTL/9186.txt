Terms of the second order in the fide-generating potential. The whole of the previous investigation has been conducted on the hypothesis that
the tide-generating potential, estimated per unit volume of the earth's mass, is
wr (cos? PM—Z),* but in fact this expression is only the first term of an infinite
Series. I ghall now show what kind of quantities have been neglected by this treat-
ment. According to the ordinary theory, the next term of the tide-generating
potential is

m{r\3
Ve=ul(7) & cos PM—Z3 cos PM)
Although for my own satisfaction I have completely developed the influence of this
term in a similar way to that exhibited at the beginning of this paper, yet it does not
Seem worth while to give 80 long a piece of algebra ; and I shall here confine myself to
the consideration of the terms which will arise in the tidal friction from this term in
the potential, when the obliquity is neglected.
