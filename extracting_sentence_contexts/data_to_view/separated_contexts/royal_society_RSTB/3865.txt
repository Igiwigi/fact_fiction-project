Dantet Jones has applied the same principle to the correlation of the Sulphur
Coals in different parts of the Wyre Forest. It appears to me to be more than doubtful whether any such evidence can be
relied upon, in view of the wide vertical range which Sprrorbis is now known to
possess. There are four important facts to be borne in mind in this connection. Firstly, in my experience, Spirorbis occurs in shale more frequently than in lime-
stones. Such Spzrorbis-shales were recorded from the north-eastern margin of the
Mamble district by Roserrs in 1860.
