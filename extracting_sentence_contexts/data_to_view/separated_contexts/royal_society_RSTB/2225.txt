The upward and downward
spread suggests a relation to the intraspinal bifurcation of the afferent root-fibres
discovered by Frrrusor NaNsEN (1887),* and confirmed by CasAu (1889).t

The nerve-cells for the extensors of the knee, rarely as they initiate, 7¢., are
primary, in any spinal reflex, are frequently involved in the later progress of the
march. Thus flexion of the knee, combined with flexion of hip and ankle, is frequently
followed by and gives way to, extension of knee, hip and ankle ; extension at hip is
perhaps the most frequent of these extensions. It is noteworthy that in Cat, as I
previously pointed out in Frog,} the extension is rapid in onset, short in duration,
and rapid in disappearance—a kick in fact—as compared with the contraction in the
flexors. For instance, following flexion of the knee, extension frequently occurs in the march
of the spinal reflex, started from a pinch of the idio-lateral foot ; similarly, it may
rapidly follow extension of the hip; or, as a crossed reflex, it may follow and accom-
pany flexion of hip and knee of the opposite side, and in this last case may initiate an
alternating ‘“‘extension-flexion” reflex in the limb of its own side. The relation between
the neurons of extensors and flexors at elbow is much the same as between those of
extensors and flexors at knee, the flexors of elbow corresponding with flexors at knee.
