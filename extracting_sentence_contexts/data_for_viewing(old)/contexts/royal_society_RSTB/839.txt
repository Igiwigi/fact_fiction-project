left half of the tongue to the left internal rectus. In each case we have the combination
of two opposite movements for the production of one resultant action. The opposite
character of the movements of the two halves of the tongue was emphasized in a
very remarkable degree when there was epileptic disturbance of the cortical focus in
question. In the clonic spasm of the epileptic fit the two halves performed remark-
able “see-saw” contractions, that of the same side being shot forwards at the same
time as the opposite half was retracted. On several occasions we observed that
retraction of the opposite side not only began before the protrusion of the same side,
but actually in a few instances it occurred alone, thus showing that it is probably the
more important movement of the two. We are now in a position to examine into
the condition of the tongue as observed in hemiplegia. Unfortunately the clinical
examination of the tongue has hitherto not been conducted so thoroughly as its
importance warrants ; and in fact, clinical observation is usually limited to noticing
whether the tongue is deviated to one side when protruded, without further
exploration of other movements. ‘This is doubtless due to the fact that the move-
ments of the tongue generally have hitherto not been completely ascertained.
Although this makes the task of explanation very difficult and for the present
impossible, we take leave to point out that the accepted views are plainly contrary to
fact and will have to be altered.

(2.) Rolling over with the Dorsum directed towards the Cheek of the Same Side.—
This movement we found to be distinctly compound in character, both separated halves
of the tongue rolling to the same side. In the execution of this movement the
mucous membrane of each half of the tongue was turned so as to be directed towards
the left cheek, as a result the cut surfaces glided upon each other so that the two
