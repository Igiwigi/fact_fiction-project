From it mitochondria radiate out into the surrounding cytoplasm. The individual
mitochondria are rod-shaped or spherical and small. They exhibit the characteristic
staining reactions, which it is hardly necessary to enumerate here. After Da Fano’s
method they appear golden in colour in untoned sections, and stain well after toning.
In material prepared by Nassonov’s method they are well fixed, and stain well with acid
fuchsin.

They increase in number with the growth of the cell, probably by fission. The mito-
chondrial cloud is at its maximum stage of development in oocytes of 100 to 140p in
diameter. At this time a more definite and homogeneous structure differentiates, in
the middle of the mitochondrial cloud, which I propose to call the mitochondrial yolk-
body (Plate 17, fig. 13; Plate 19, fig. 32). On account of its exact similarity in staining
reactions, its place of origin in the centre of the mitochondrial cloud, and the fact that
there are much fewer individual mitochondria apparent in the cell immediately after its

formation, I conclude that it is formed directly from the mitochondria by a process of
fusion, more or less complete, of a large number. It is spherical in shape and varies
in size from 50-70» in diameter. It consists of a central easily stainable portion, very
homogeneous in texture, and of a narrow outer zone, which is much less stainable. One,
two or more small vacuoles, all approximately of the same size, can be seen in the central
region. With iron-hematoxylin or other suitable stains one or more minute densely
staining granules can often be seen in or around each vacuole. It would be easy to
