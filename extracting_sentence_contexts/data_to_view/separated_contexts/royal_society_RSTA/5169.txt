The converse is true for the Fountoukis and Nenes scheme, which overpredicts the number
of activated drops (cf. figures 1a and 3d); however, the Fountoukis and Nenes scheme still
underestimates the albedo because it does not consider the effect of swollen aerosol on the cloud
radiative properties (cf. figures 1b and 3e). This finding has been discussed by Simpson ef al.
[13, §3.3]. In general, though, the albedo changes caused by adding salt particles are significantly
underestimated by both schemes, which is due to the fact that neither of the parametrization
methods treats unactivated aerosol in the calculations of albedo. It is evident that both of
the parametrization schemes were not designed for the range of inputs that are relevant for
geoengineering applications, in which there can be a large quantity of unactivated aerosol
particles, and as a result they perform poorly when compared with the parcel model (figure 1a-c). For the Abdul-Razzak et al. scheme, the number of activated particles and hence cloud albedo
reduces as galt is increased (figure 3a,b).
