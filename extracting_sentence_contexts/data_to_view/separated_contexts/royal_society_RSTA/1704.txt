To this
end, we consider the equation

& (c(0) — Kis) =A (2()— Kis) +L, 10,
2(0) =x, (4.13)
2) =o(0), t<0,

where A: D(A) C X > X generates a strongly continuous semigroup on X, f+ 2; in the history
function defined in definition 4.3, the operator K is given by (4.7), and L: W!?(R-,X) > X is the
operator defined by

0
Ly=| dulce,

where 1: R~ —> £(X) is a function of bounded variation such that the total variation |n|(R~) <
+oo. On the other hand, we set
L=Lp@- (4.14)

Equation (4.13) can be reformulated as the DBVP. In fact, it suffices to take Ep = &, 2 =D(Qm),
and G=4p. Thus the neutral equation is equivalent to a Cauchy problem of the form (3.2). On the other hand, proposition 4.2 shows that hypothesis of theorem 3.2 are satisfied.
