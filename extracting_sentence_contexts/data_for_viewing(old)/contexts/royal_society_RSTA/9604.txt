The photographs show that the positive tip was about 3-5 mm in diameter.
This was for a current of about 7 amperes, giving a current density rather over
0-7 amp per sq mm, agreeing well with ALLEN’s* value 0-746 amp per sq mm
which we have always used in conjunction with Forrest’s} value for the luminosity
of the positive “ crater,” i.e., 173 candle-power per sq mm in a direction normal to
the face.t Combining these results, we get the value 232 candle-power per amp
normal to the surface, or 164 candle-power per amp at 45°, which we have always
used in calculating the intensity of our standard source.

When this value is used for standardizing potassium and sodium cells and the latter
are then employed to measure daylight, the scales of intensity obtained do not
differ so widely from the visual scale as one might expect from the fact that, as
the colour temperature of the carbon tip is only about 3780° K, whilst that of
sunlight at the earth’s surface is about 5600° K, the light from the glowing carbon
is relatively weak in the blue end of the spectrum. But the are light is much richer
in blue than is that of a filament lamp, whose colour temperature may range from
2350° (vacuum) to 2900° (gas-filled).

Both Forrest and ALLEN used a special Y arrangement of carbons with two
negatives, so that the positive “ crater,” which they showed was very nearly plane,
could be viewed normally. Such a complication does not appear to be necessary
for our purpose, and would greatly detract from the simplicity and cheapness

which are among the arc’s advantages. With the simple are of suitable length and
