as were used by M. G. V1LLE in his experiments, and which he kindly sent oyer to us

J.—The supply of Carbonic Acid to the Plants. "

Owing to the small proportion of carbonic acid in the atmosphere, and to the fact,
that a part of it would be absorbed in passing through the apparatus just described, it,
was necessary to give a supply of it to the plants artificially. It was obtained by the.

action of chlorhydric acid upon fragments of marble in the vessel T, Plate XII1., or T',

fig. 1, Plate XTV. In regulating the supply of carbonic acid, the points to be observed were, to keep the.

the plants, and at the same time to provide a sufficient quantity for the demands of
vegetation at the most active periods of growth.
