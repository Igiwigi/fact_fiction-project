We can, thus, dissociate, by interrupted excitation, the effect of the vagus on the
auricles and on the excitability of the ventricles. To summarise, discontinuous exci-
tation of the vagi produces continuous effects on the auricles, but discontinwous wpon
the excitability of the ventricles, In other words, the vagus action on the excitability
of the ventricles ceases with cessation of the current. We might give further evidence of the fact that vagus excitation lowers the excita-
bility of the ventricle, but imagine that we have in the above supplied sufficient
convincing proof of this. We therefore conclude that vagus stimulation lowers the
excitability of the ventricles, so that they are not only less responsive to the weakened
stimuli reaching them from above with each auricular beat, but also that their
independent rhythm begins more slowly than would otherwise be the case. The fact, that continuous strong excitation of the vagi does not arrest the ventricles
for more than a limited time, shows that the influence of this nerve in lowering the
excitability of the ventricles is not a lasting one.
