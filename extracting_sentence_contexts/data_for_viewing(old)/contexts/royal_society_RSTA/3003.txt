The DC Josephson effect in pinhole junctions with ballistic electron transport was considered


by Kulik and Omelyanchouck (K-O) [18]. They calculated the dependence of the supercurrent
flowing through the point contact as a function of the phase bias across the point contact, i.e.
the current-phase relation, I,(*). Their result reduces to the standard Josephson current-phase
relation, I; =I, sind, in the Ginzburg-Landau region, |T — T;| « Tc, but deviates significantly
from I; «sin at low temperatures, developing a discontinuity at # =72/2 at T=0, with a
divergence of the slope dls/di#|y»=2 ~ —(Tc/T)Ic(0) for T « Tce. Although K-O did not explicitly
discuss the role of the sub-gap Andreev bound state spectrum in their original papers, the
anomalies in the current-phase relation of the Josephson point contact are reflections of the current
transported by the spectrum of Andreev bound states and the dispersion of the Andreev bound-
state energies with the phase bias across the weak link. In fact Andreev bound states play a central
role in all transport properties of Josephson weak links, but as will be discussed below and in §3,
their roles in charge and heat transport are fundamentally different.

For a perfectly reflecting boundary with a small aperture of radius, a « §,,, shown in figure 4, : =
the total current transported through the weak link is so low that the phase gradient in the : S
