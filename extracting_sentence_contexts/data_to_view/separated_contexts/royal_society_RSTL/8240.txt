one external. bone, the unciforme,
giving support to the two outer digits (the fourth and fifth), so in the pes we perceive
also an entirely homologous set of three cuneiforms (first, second, and third), each
supporting a separate toe, and one external bone, the cuboid, giving support to the two
outer digits of the pes (the fourth and fifth). Where all the five digits are completely
developed this rule admits of no exception whatever in the whole range of Mammalia ; but
where, as in Ungulata, the number of the digits becomes sometimes greatly reduced, the
relation of the carpal and tarsal bones to the remaining digits is slightly changed, though
all the three cuneiforms are till retained, and I know of no instance where one of
them is wanting. | This persistence of cuneiforms is a strange fact; for in the carpus,
which is. generally less reduced than the tarsus, the trapezium (homologue of the
first cuneiform) is certainly lost in Horses and Ruminants, while its homologue in the
tarsus is 8till retained in a recognizable state. These relations, slight as they may
Seem, are important; we must know all the details and the true homology of the
