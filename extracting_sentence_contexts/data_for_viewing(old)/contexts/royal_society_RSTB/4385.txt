paratively elongated and oblong—in man of the Neanderthal type, it is short,
extremely wide, and well arched. Further, the teeth show no signs of that peculiar
specialisation in the form of the roots and pulp cavities which distinguishes the teeth
of the Neanderthal race.

The geological evidence of the age of the fossil, though more valuable than was
thought at the time the skull first came under notice, is admittedly imperfect, since
it depends so largely on an untrained observer's narrative of events and conditions
existing over thirty years ago. That there is some support afforded by the con-
dition of the fossil in comparison with bone deposits of undoubted Pleistocene age
from similar neighbouring strata, has already been mentioned. Further and more
accurate investigations along this line are in progress, the results of which will soon
be available. But in the light of the anatomical facts here set forth, the claim to
high geological antiquity—the assignation of this fossil to the Pleistocene—is very
strongly supported, and may indeed be regarded as established.

The direct evidence of the antiquity of Man in Australia has been very imperfect,
or, indeed, non-existent, prior to the discovery of this skull(15). No clear and
unimpeachable evidence of the remnants,of the human frame or of the work of
human hands belonging to the Pleistocene in Australia had hitherto been brought
forward.

A possible exception to this general statement is the human molar tooth found in
