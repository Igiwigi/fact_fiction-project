6. Tf z, y be integers, then mm, n having the several even integer values from — 9
to += respectively, it is obvious that m+«+2zx, n+B+2y will have the same
series of values with m+«, n+P respectively ; and ib thence follows that

Similarly if z, w are integers, then in the function

n
(ol bans) (1, »)

the argument of the exponential function contains the term
Jniſmben+y+2:+ n+8v+8+29};
this differs from its original value by

lrilm+4a.22.+.n+B.20),
=rilmz+mw)+Ti(az+Bwu),

and then, m2 and 7 being even integers, mz+20 is also an even integer. and the term
Ti(mz+mnw) does not affect the value of the exponential : we thus introduce into each
term of the series the factor exp. mi(az+Pw), which is in fact =(—)**** ; and we
consequently have

IE Fong (u, J=(—wma(% * (u, »);

or, uniting the two results,

this sustains the before-mentioned conclusion that the only distinet functions are the
16 functions obtained by giving to the characters «, Þ, y, 8 the values 0 and 1
respectively. Odd-integer alteration of characters.
