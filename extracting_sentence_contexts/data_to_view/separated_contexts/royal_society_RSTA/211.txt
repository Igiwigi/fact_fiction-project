The rate determining factor for the recombination of a
positron with an antiproton is their relative velocity. However, as antiprotons are
approximately 2000 times more massive than the positrons, their velocity is small
relative to that of the positrons, even when they are much more energetic. In fact,
an antiproton with an energy of 2eV has the same speed as that characteristic of
an ensemble of positrons held at a temperature of 15 K. Thus, the antiprotons do
