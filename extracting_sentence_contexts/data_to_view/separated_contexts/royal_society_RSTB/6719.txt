ACQUIRED IMMUNITY AND THE CARRIER PROBLEM In 1932 Salaman (1932) put forward evidence in support of the suggestion that
“carriers” might be created artificially by the co-existence of more than one or two
unrelated viruses within the plant, each of which might be individually pathogenic. This view would at first sight appear to be contradicted by the fact established inde-
pendently by Murphy and McKay (1931) and Salaman (1932), viz. that two viruses
each of which acting alone was relatively harmless, might when present together
produce a serious disease. In the one, union determines pathogenicity, in the other
neutralization of symptoms, the immediate environment in either case being similar.
