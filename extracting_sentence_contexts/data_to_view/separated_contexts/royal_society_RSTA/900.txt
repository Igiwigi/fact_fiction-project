However, envariance in a guise slightly different than before (when it accounted for
decoherence) implies that mutually exclusive outcomes have certifiably equal probabilities:
suppose S starts as |) =|) +| J), so interaction with A yields | t)|A+) +|{4)|Ay), an even
(equal coefficient) state. (Here and below we skip normalization to save on notation.)

A unitary swap | t)\)|+|1\t | permutes states in S:

——-,

It) Ap) + LY) Ay) > 1 4)1At) +1 NAY). (4.52)

After the swap | |) is as probable as |A;) was (and still is), and | t) as |A,). Probabilities in A are
unchanged (as A is untouched) so p; and p, must have been swapped. To prove equiprobability,

we now swap records in A:
a
14) IAp) +14) Ay) —> I IAyI +1 1144). (4.5b)

Swap in A restores pre-swap | tay + |J)|A,) without touching S, so (by fact 3) the local
state of S is also restored (even though, by fact 1, it could not have been affected by the swap
of equation (4.5b)). Hence (by fact 2), all predictions about S, including probabilities, must be the
same! The probabilities of | +) and | |) (as well as of |Ay) and |A,)) are exchanged yet unchanged.
