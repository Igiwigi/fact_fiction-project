The circuit was completed by a galvanometer of long
period. Under these circumstances when one pole of a very long steel magnet is thrust
suddenly through the opening, there shonld be no effect observable if the insulation
is good ; but if any of the turns of one of the coils are short circuited the other coil
will of course have the advantage, and the galvanometer will indicate a current mn the
corresponding direction. Tt was found in fact that the second coil preponderated, and
that 13 extra turns had to be pub upon the firs coil to obtain the balance. With

per precautions this method of testing seems satisfactory, being approximately
independent of the equality of mean radii of the coils compared. A second test was s8uggested and executed by Mr.
