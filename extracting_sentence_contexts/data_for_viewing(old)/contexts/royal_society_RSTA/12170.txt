§ as elementary magnets, so that instead of neutralizing each other's magnetic etfects,
P they will reinforce one another; on this view substances ought to be about equally
s)magnetic at all temperatures, instead of showing as iron does a sudden loss of the
° quality. We must therefore find some other bond for the atoms of a molecule,
in addition to the hydrodynamic one and at least of the same order of magnitude.
= This is afforded by the attractions of the electric charges of the atoms, which are
8 required by the theory of electrolysis. But even now about half of the molecules
ct would be made up so that the atoms in them assist each other’s magnetic effects,
2 unless we suppose each molecule to contain more than two atoms, arranged in some
B sort of symmetry. There is however no course open but to take all matter to
= be magnetic in the same way, the only difference being in some very special circum-
‘6 stance in the aggregation of the molecules of iron compared with other molecules.
5 The small magnetic moment of molecules of most substances may in fact be explained
7g more fully on the same lines as their small electric moment (§ 64). The vortices will

be quite permanent as regards both atomic charge and electric intensity, so that the
8g explanation of diamagnetic polarity given by WEBER, on the basis of currents induced
- in the atomic conducting circuits, cannét now stand.*

4 * [Added June 14.—It has been suggested that the atomic electric charge might circulate round the

ving under the influence of induction. It would appear however that such a circulation could have no
a | physical meaning, for it would not at all alter the configuration of strain in the sum rounding medium,
