I think, also, that in the
latter case it was decomposed ; but there are many interfering cireumstances which
require examination before a positive conclusion can be drawn.

693. When the ordinary protoxide of antimony is subjected to the yoltaic current in
a fused state, it also is decomposed, although the effect from other causes s00n ceases
(402. 802.). 'This oxide consists of one proportional of antimony and one and a half
of oxygen, and is therefore an exception to the general law assumed. But in working
with this oxide and the chloride, I observed facts which lead me to doubt whether
the compounds usually called the protoxide and the protochloride do not often con-
tain other compounds, consisting of single proportions, which are the true proto com-
pounds, and which, in the case of the oxide, might give rise to the decomposition
above described.

694. The ordinary sulphuret of antimony is considered as being the compound with
the smallest quantity of sulphaur, and analogous in its proportions to the ordinary
protoxide. But I find that if it be fused with metallic antimony, a new sulphuret is
formed, containing much more of the metal than the former, and separating distinetly,
when fused, both from the pure metal on the one hand, and the ordinary grey snl-
pburet on the other.
