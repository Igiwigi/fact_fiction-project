in vitro scratch assay, a simple scrape in a cellular monolayer generating a
strip-shaped gap, allows for studying cell migration during wound healing
and analysing the front-rear polarity. With these tools, apicobasal and front-
rear polarity have been extensively studied in numerous literatures, and now
scientists have a comprehensive understanding of molecular mechanisms,
owing to these simple in vitro models. The polarity along a third axis, the
left-right (LR) axis, has yet to be studied in-depth at a cellular level in a
well-controlled manner, until the recent development of several in vitro cell
chirality systems [1-7].

The establishment of the LR axis is critical for living organisms [8]. In fact,
all vertebrates exhibit asymmetry along the midline of the body (also known as
handedness or chirality) in the positioning and morphology of internal organs.
A deviation from such an arrangement often has severe consequences,
especially when one or two organs are in mirror positions (i.e. situs ambiguous).
When all internal organs are on the opposite side of the body (i.e. situs inversus),
the individual can be healthy, although some may suffer from diseases such as
Kartagener syndrome. Previously with animal embryos, several models have
been established to account for different mechanisms that drive symmetry
breaking by considering dominant factors such as the leftward fluid flow on
the ventral node driven by the directional rotation of cilia [9-11], voltage
