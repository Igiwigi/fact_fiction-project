one species to another. It has also been claimed that the angle varies considerably within
a species or in a single plant, but it will be shown that this variation is not always so great
as is supposed. Another feature in which the spirodistichous systems of monocotyledons
differ from most spiral systems of dicotyledons is in the asymmetry of the leaves. This
asymmetry is not always obvious in the blade of the mature leaf but can usually be seen
in transections through the bud, where it appears that the morphological ‘median’
strand of the leaf divides the leaf into two lateral parts which differ in tangential extension
and sometimes in radial thickness,

From these facts it is clear that the hypothesis of the first available space cannot easily
be applied to spirodistichous plants. According to this hypothesis ‘each leaf arises in the
first space that becomes both wide enough and far enough below the growing point’
(Snow, M. & R. 1931, p. 16 and 1933, p. 360). This hypothesis is based on the theory of
van Iterson (1907) and has been supported by various experiments (Snow, M. & R. 1931,
pp. 33, 35). Van Iterson’s theory was in turn based on Hofimeister’s observation (1868)
that each leaf arises in the largest gap between the previous leaves. But van Iterson
expressly stated that his theory could not be applied to plants with asymmetric leaf bases
since he had worked it out only for plants in which the bases of the youngest leaf primordia
were circular in outline.

Schumann (1892,) however, did attempt to apply Hofmeister’s rule to plants with
spirodistichous phyllotaxis. He maintained that the greatest available space in plants
