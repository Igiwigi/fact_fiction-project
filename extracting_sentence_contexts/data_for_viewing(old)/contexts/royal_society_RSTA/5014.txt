3. Experimental researches in electricity : 2

The paper that is the focus of this article is the first, and most famous, of a series of thirty papers :s
Faraday wrote and published in the Royal Society’s Philosophical Transactions between 1832 and :8
1856 under the title of Experimental Researches in Electricity, each taking up where the previous left
off. This first one was read to the Royal Society on 24 November 1831.5 However, it was around
this time that the Royal Society introduced a new refereeing procedure for papers submitted for
publication in its Philosophical Transactions, which was to delay the appearance of Faraday’s paper
in print by several months, much to his frustration [8].

On 14 January 1832, worried about being beaten to the post by the French, he wrote to the
Secretary of the Royal Society urging him to try and speed up the publication process ‘or else
these philosophers may get some of my facts in conversation, repeat them & publish in their
own name before I am out’.® Although the exact date of the appearance of the paper in print is
unknown, the earliest evidence we have for it is 9 April 1832.”

The experiments described in the paper all showed, with increasing sophistication, that a
current could be induced all the time there was relative motion between the conductor and
the magnetic field. With hindsight and the appropriate language we use today, we say that a
current is induced in a conductor when it is inside a changing magnetic field. For this to happen,
it does not matter whether it is the conducting wire or the object producing the magnetic field
(either a permanent magnet or another wire with an electric current flowing through it) that is
actually moving.

The first experiment Faraday discusses in the paper demonstrates simple induction and is
