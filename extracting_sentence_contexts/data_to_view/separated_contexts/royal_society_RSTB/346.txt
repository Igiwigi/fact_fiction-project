Not only so, but the extremity of each short arm is
very broadly truncated ; a form that hitherto has only been seen in my Bowmanites
Dawsoni. In fig. 19 the central triangle a is composed of a cluster of trachex
grouped in no special order, except that the central ones are larger than those
occupying the periphery of the triangle. In my fructification this central truncated
triangle constitutes the sole vascular axis, a fact easy of explanation. Referring
to my Memoir V., Plate 1, I have shown that in the very young twig of my Astero-
phyllites, fig. 1, this triangle constituted the only trachezal bundle, but as the vege-
tative twig grew in age and size, it developed exogenously zones of tracheze which
were successively added, investing the triangular centre, as in figs, 2, 3, and 4, resulting
in the conditions seen in Plate 2, figs. 9, 10, and 11 of the same memoir. The present
figure 19 is as nearly as possible in the condition of the figure 9 just referred to.
