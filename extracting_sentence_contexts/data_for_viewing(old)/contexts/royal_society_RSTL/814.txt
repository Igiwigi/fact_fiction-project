The identity of these two expressions is easily recognised :
when w is a multiple of 6, and therefore of 2, they both
reduce themselves to a, ; when #—1 is such a multiple, to b, ;
when z—8 is a multiple of 6, x— 2 is also one of 2, and
therefore z is 80 ; consequently both functions reduce them-
selves to a, , and $0 on for every form of ox.

Thus every coefficient of the proposed equation may be
reduced to one whose period of circulation is N ; and this
being done, the equation comes under the general form inte-
grated in (9g). The second series whose law is stated in
Art. (2) leads to an equation of this kind. In fact the

equation
#—(489 +689, +c89.)u,, —(«S +852) u,,=0

coincides in succession with the whole series of equations
there assigned ; and if we write instead of the coefficients of
this, the following,

6 6
a $9 +bS9, +89, +a89, +b8®, + c 89,
«5 +882, +-89, +882, + 289, + 88,
they are reduced to a common period of circulation, and the
