The body B, pure at 20 atoms of aluminium, to which we attribute the formula
Au,Al, was obtained in the form of a brittle rod of white with a faint yellow
tinge. It has a silky conchoidal fracture. Although containing little more than
3 per cent. by weight of the white aluminium, the colour of the gold is gone,
in fact there is no free gold in it. This alloy is more easily attacked by etching
reagents than pure gold, or than the D and E bodies, hence, after etching, we
never see it as a white body but as yellow or brownish purple from a film of finely
divided gold. D and E are pure white bodies, both before and after etching with
bromine or aqua regia.
