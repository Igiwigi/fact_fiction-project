from division of the superficial cells. I venture to think that GoxBEL’s
fig. 14 (‘ Bot. Zeit.,’ 1881, Plate 6) is quite open to the same interpretation, a
the cell marked (t) is the result of division from the next outer, and not from th
inner cell, An examination of numerous sections of sporangia of S, spinos
strengthens the view that, at times, early periclinal division of the superficia
may contribute to the internal tissue of the sporangium, though I have not foun
point so clearly demonstrated in this species as in S. Martensii, My concl si
that the first periclinal division does not constantly define the archesporium, and
separate the internal mass of the sporangium from the sporangial wall, but
observed with constancy in Hquisetwm, and occasionally in other plants (L.
and alpinum), by periclinal divisions of the superficial cells additions may be 8
quently made to the archesporium, but these additions are not constant.
Whatever may be the actual facts on the above point, there can be no doubi
after the archesporium has grown and undergone further segmentation, peril
divisions take place in the peripheral cells of the resulting mass of tissue, |
divisions separate off the tapetum from the sporogenous cells (figs. 87, 88, 89).
as Gorse has already pointed out (Joc. cit., p. 698) the tapetum of Selaginella
in its mode of origin from that of Lycopodium, but when we look back to the earth
phases, and recognize the periclinal divisions discussed in the preceding paragral
the distinction of the two types appears to be not so deep a one as he described
