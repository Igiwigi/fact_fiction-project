through five tides, by which time nearly the whole of the loos&shingle had dis-
appeared, including all that had been collected by the groins at Folkestone., The
water being particularly clear, I was enabled to perceive distinctly the action upon
the pebbles, and their motion downwards. I observed, that although every waye

became broken and dispersed as usual, yet they followed in such rapid snccession,
that each wave rode oyer its predecessor while on its return, and thus produced a
continual downward current, which carried with it the pebbles that were disturhed.
That the pebbles were not removed far from the line of low water, would appear
from the fact, that on the subsiding of the 8well, it being succeeded by a light breeze
of wind from the westward, the accumulation immediately commenced, and was
restored to its former quantity by the action of four tides. I have subsequently had
some favourable opportunities for making other obseryations on the effects produced
by different rates of succession of the waves, and particularly at Dover, during the
late gales, where the same actions were noticed. There I watched for an opportunity
of witnessing that rate of succession which exhibited the destructive and accumu-
lative actions in their smallest degrees; and I observed, that when ten breakers
arrived in one minute, the destructive action was but just evinced ; and that when
only eight breakers arrived in the same period, the pebbles began to accumulate ;
which facts harmonized with my observations made at Sandgate and Folkestone, viz.
that the difference between the two actions was determined by the rapidity in succession
of the waves upon the $shore.
