cles of the lymph, or chyle merely, and that therefore the circulating fluid of the Invertebrata is © mere chyle,
not. proper blood,” proper blood being, as he defines it, * a red coloured fluid containing characteristic corpus-
cles.”

This view appears to me to be distinction without essential difference, and to have arisen,—lst, from an im-
perfect acquaintance with the corpuscles of the lymph of the Vertebrata, and their relationship to those of the
blood of the same division of animals on the one hand, and with the corpuscles of the circulating fluid of the
Invertebrata on the other ; 2ndly, from laying too much weight on the presence or absence of colour as a di-
*tinctive character; thus making no distinction between the © red corpusele” of the blood of the Mammifera,
and the * red corpuscle ”of the blood of the oviparous Vertebrata in consequence of their similarity in colour,
though there is between them an exssential organic difference ; whilst between the * red corpuscle” of the
blood of the oviparous Vertebrata and the nucleated cell of the circulating fluid of the Invertebrata, in conse-
quence of a supposed total absence of colour in the latter, a decided distinction is made, though there is, in fact,
between them no essential organic difference.

Waiving, however, the organic difference between the * red corpuscle” of the Mammifera and the * red
corpuscle” of the oviparous Vertebrata, and the organic resemblance between the ** red corpuscle” of the ovi-
parous Vertebrata, and the little or not at all coloured nucleated cell of the circulating fluid of the Inverte-
brata, I would observe in regard to the presence or absence of colour, that nothing bearing on the question can
be inferred from it, even in a physiological point of view, seeing that the nature and use of the red colouring
matter of the © red blood-corpuscles” are as yet too little known.

The colour of *' red blood-corpuscles ” is now acknowledged not to be owing to the iron entering into their
compoxsition, and therefore it is not, as has been supposed, a manifestation of the existence of any endowment
which may be possessed by the *red corpuscles” by virtue of the iron which they contain, But even if this had
