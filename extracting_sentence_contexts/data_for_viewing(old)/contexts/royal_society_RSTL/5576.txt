and that a pile of five or six of these elements acts on the nerve of a galvanoscopic frog
and excites contractions. I have compared the electromotive power of a muscle with
that of a nerve, both belonging to the same frog. It is hardly necessary to say that this
was done by opposing to a halt-thigh as many nervous elements as were required in order
to there being no differential current. In two experiments I found that one half-thigh
predominated over seven nervous elements, and that nine of the latter predominated over
one half-thigh ; in a third experiment eleyen or twelve neryous elements were required
to predominate over the muscle. I left these piles under a glass bell, the air of which
was saturated with moisture ; T could not perceive any marked difference in the relative
duration of the electromotive power of muscles and nerves.

$3. Let us now pass on to the development of electricity in the act of contraction.
The first fact of this kind, which, for the sake of brevity, I shall continue to call induced
contraction, was discovered by myself in 1842. I shall give here a very concise summary
of the chief characteristics of induced contraction, although already known, having recently
been led to repeat my former experiments, and to determine these characteristics with
greater precision.

In order to succeed in these experiments, it is necessary to operate on frogs in a
vigorous condition, and prepared very, rapidly. The fundamental experiment is made
by laying the nerve of a galyanoscopic frog upon any muscle of a living animal. In order
to simplify the experiment, I employ a single thigh of a frog, to which remain united the
lumbar nerve and a portion of the spine. On provoking contractions in the thigh, either
with an intermittent current sent through the nerve, or by stimulating it in any other
way, simultaneous contractions take place in the galvanoscopic frog. The disposition of
