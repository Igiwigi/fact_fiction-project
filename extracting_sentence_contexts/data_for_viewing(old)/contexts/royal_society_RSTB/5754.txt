the polarimeter by 0-2-0-3 per cent., the full 5 per cent. would be shown in the acetyl
figures. The formation of glycerol in the fermentation of glucose by yeast is now a
well-known fact. BucHNeR and MEISENHEIMER (1905) obtained an average figure of
3-8 per cent. of glycerol on the weight of sugar fermented. In order to test the point,
a third test was carried out in which glucose was present without mannitol. 8-75 gm.
of glucose were treated with yeast and the final solution of the products obtained
made up to 250 c.c. The rotation of this solution was -+-0-033° using the mercury
yellow light, equivalent to 0-0375 gm. of glucose in 250 c.c., which is negligible
in comparison with the acetylation value of the solution which was found to be 0-49
and 0-42 gm. glycerol in 250 c.c., equivalent to about 5 per cent. of the glucose used.
The difference between the glycerol results suggests that some glycerol is lost in the
evaporation with hot air,

An attempt was made to obviate the errors introduced into the acetylation estima-
tion by the formation of glycerol from glucose during fermentation. This was effected
