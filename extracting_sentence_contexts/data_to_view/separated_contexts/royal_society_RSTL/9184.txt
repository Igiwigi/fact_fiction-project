These are the two values of the cube root of the earth's
rotation, for which the earth and moon move round as a rigid body. The first gives a day of 5 hours 36 minutes, and the second a day of about
554 m. 8. days. The latter is the state to which the earth and moon tend, under the influence of
tidal friction (whether of oceanic or bodily tides) in the far distant future, For this cage
Taomso0N and Tarr give a day of 48 of our present days;* the discrepancy between
my value and theirs is explicable by the fact that they are considering a heterogeneous
earth, whilst T treat a homogeneous one. Since on the hypothesis of heterogeneity the
earth's moment of inertia is about 4Ma?, whilst on that of homogeneity ib is $Ma?, and
gince the 2 which occurs in the quantity s enters by means of the expression for the
earth's moment of inertia, it follows that in my solution p has been taken too 8mall in
the proportion 5:6, Hence if we wish to consider the case of heterogeneity, we mus
solve the equation a*—126647+48462=0. The two roots of this equation are such
that they give as the corresponding lengths of the day, 5 hours 16 minutes and 40-4 days
regpectively.
