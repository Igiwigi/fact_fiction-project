(1858) would not be so easily explained, had not the Nitrogen in the drain-

remaining at the end of the experiment been determined. Our object in doing

was twofold :;â€”

1. To ascertain whether the luting at the bottom of the shade had allowed rain-water
to pass, thus affording a source of combined Nitrogen to the plants.

2. To xee if the plants growing in s0il to which combined Nitrogen was added, had
eyolyed any ammonia.

It was, of course, not possible to accomplish both these purposes. But the fact that
ammonia was found in the condensed water only in the cases where there was a loss in
Ithe total quantity of combined Nitrogen would lead to the inference that both the pre-

ence of ammonia in this water, and the loss of combined Nitrogen in the experiment,
Jrere due to the same cause.
E The condensed water showing the amount of combined Nitrogen recorded in the Table
aXIV.) was that which had been evaporated and condensed during the last four weeks of
Srowth (1858); and during this period the high temperature, and the advanced stage of
She plants, were fayourable to the evaporation of ammoniacal water. A considerable part,
