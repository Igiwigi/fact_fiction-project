The values of (A,+A,)/w* are therefore
added to the table. It is clear, however, that when the spectroscopic observations
are good, the relation here established will enable very accurate measures of the
atomic weight to be obtained. In fact, with the possible accuracy attainable in
spectroscopic measurements, it may be hoped to obtain far more reliable values of these
constants than by weighing, except in those cases where they are small. The table,
for example, affords considerable support for BRAuNERâ€™s estimates, except, possibly,
in the Mg group, where the irregularities are due to spectral causes. The case of Zn
dnay be taken as an example here.
