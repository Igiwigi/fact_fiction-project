portion of the guard tube is carried by a stout wire passing through a clamping screw
at the back of the lower end of the left-hand brass rod R. This portion of the guard-
S tube is hinged and is shown open in fig. 10. After being put in position the tube is

= closed round the platinum wire, which projects down from the needle but so as not, of
course, to touch this wire.
= The upper portion of the guard-tube is made in two halves which are carried by the
= arms A, A (fig. 7) attached to collars sliding with a bayonet-joint motion on the rods
& R,R. By raising up these collars and turning them round the two halves of the upper
% portion of the guard-tube can be opened as seen in fig. 11, and the mirror and the
8 wire attached to it got at. In fact, by opening and turning aside both the lower and
a the upper portions of the guard-tube, the mirror, needle, and its attached wire, can be
A left hanging freely from the silk fibre suspension, and it can be seen whether they are
hanging properly, or whether they require adjustment.
The two upper portions of the guard-tube are made skew, as shown in fig. 11, in
order that when the mirror is parallel to the needle, and the latter symmetrical with
the quadrants, the glass supports of the latter may clear the glass supports of R, R.
To avoid confusion in the illustrations the fine wire spirals connecting the opposite
: pairs of quadrants together, and with the terminal screws at the tops of the glass
rods supporting the terminal rods 7, 7, have been omitted.
We have to thank Mr. Maruer for taking a leading part in designing and con-
structing this improved quadrant electrometer.
