layer, the model predicted that the energy needed to swim
behind another fish is increased [71]. However, the energy
needed to swim at the speed of the whole school is lowest at
an angle of about 30Â° relative to the fish in front (figure 2)
[68,71]. Hence, the optimal configuration corresponds to a dia-
mond pattern, in which the second row is predicted to save
50% of energy compared with the leading fish.

Laboratory observations of the three-dimensional structure
of schools of saithe, herring and cod [72], however, did not con-
firm the diamond pattern hypothesized by Weihs [71],
although some observations of small schools did show a simi-
lar pattern [73]. Despite the fact that fish generally do not seem
to school in a diamond pattern, the possibility that the vortex
street shed by single fish in a school may be exploited by
neighbours has been supported by other studies based on the
tail-beat frequency (TBF). The speed of BCF swimming fish is
strongly related to their TBF [69,74]. Work comparing the
TBF of trailing and leading fish shows that, for any given
speed, trailing fish show 7-14% lower TBF than leading fish
[75-78]. The reduction in TBF is likely to result from the posi-
tive effects of the vortices shed by neighbouring fish, although
more work based on flow visualization (digital particle image
velocimetry (DPIV)) would be necessary to quantify the
relationship between vorticity and change in the TBF. This
