Indeed, the creation of the latter genus
was due entirely to an error of observation, for even in the type-specimen the petiolar
bundles are typically Htapteris-like, as Corra showed a century ago, and not ><-
shaped with hooked antenne, as we have been accustomed to believe, after Pav
BERTRAND, since 1909. The mode of branching of the petiolar strand is also identical
in every respect with that of Htapteris. These facts raise questions of nomenclature and relationships which are briefly
discussed. Both Etapteris and Botrychiorylon are no doubt firmly linked with
Zygopteris ; and in ordinary circumstances would be merged in Corpa’s much older
genus. But recent experience within the Zygopteridese imposes caution against a
merging of the genera at the present stage.
