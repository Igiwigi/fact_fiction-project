they are laid down, that there is a diurnal inequality, in consequence of which the
tide following the south transit of the moon becomes alternately the greater and the
smaller, as the moon's declination changes from south to north, and the reverse. The
times when this inequality is large can be picked out more decidedly than the times
when it vanishes, and I therefore determined the epoch by means of the greatest in-
equality, supposing the times when it vanishes to be midway between two snecessive
maxima, as may be seen in the preceding Table.

Rejecting those cases in which the inequality is very small or altogether irregular,
it appears that the inequality vanishes twelve days after the moon's inclination yanishes.
This is certainly a very extraordinary result ; for it is difficult to conceive how the
effect of the moon's action can require s0 much time to manifest itself. Yet there
can hardly be any doubt of the fact; for it is verified in 11 semilunations out of 17,
and is inconsistent with none; the variations in the interyal being not greater than
might be expected, supposing the law to be true. It may be observed, that by these
variations the inequality is in some cases thrown back more than a whole semiluna-
tion. 'Thus the inequality which prevails before April 26, and vanishes about that
day, is not produced by the series of declinations which vanish on April 24, but by
the series which vanish on April 11. To suppose the reyerse would be impossible ;
for that would make it necessary to suppose that the inequality vanishes on Feb. 27,
in consequenece of the declination vanishing two days /ater, or March 1 ; that is, that
the effect precedes the cause.
