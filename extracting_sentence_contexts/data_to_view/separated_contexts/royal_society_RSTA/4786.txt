In this approach, gravity is naturally formulated within this more
general setting, and flat-space properties extracted by taking a (non-trivial) limit. Since then,
further work on ambitwistor strings by Geyer et al. [41] has forged a strong connection between
twistor geometry and the work of Cachazo et al. [42] which has given the most powerful extension
of the determinantal structure, including contact with both KLT and BCJ relations. The questions raised by this investigation are not in fact restricted to the gravitational setting. Even in gauge theory we are faced by the problem of how to escape the restriction to ring-ordered
partial amplitudes, so as to express the relationships between components from different ring-
order sectors, and to express the non-planar components of amplitudes. The situation seems to
call for some striking new idea that will connect these various questions and approaches.
