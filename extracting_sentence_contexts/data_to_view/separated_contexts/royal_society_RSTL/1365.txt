Now if the solar rays themselves conveyed all the heat
we find on this globe, it ought to be hottest where their course
is least interrupted. Again, our a&ronauts all confirm the
coldness of the upper regions of the atmosphere ; and since,
therefore, even on our earth the heat of any situation depends
upon the aptness of the medium to yield to the impression of
the solar rays, we have only to admit, that on the sun itself,
the elastic fluids composing its atmosphere, and the matter on

its surface, are of such a nature as not to be capable of any ex-
cessive affection from its own rays; and, indeed, this seems to
be proved by the copious emission of them ; for if the elastic
fluids of the atmosphere, or the matter contained on the sur-
face of the sun, were of such a nature as to admit of an easy,
chemical combination with its rays, their emission would be
much impeded. Another well known fact is, that the' solar focus of the
largest lens, thrown into the air, will occasion no sensible
heat in the place where it "has been kept for a considerable

It will not be necessary to mention che nn, as.L
can think of none that may be made, but-what.a'proper con-
sideration of the foregoing 'observations will easily remove ;
such-as may be urged-from the dissimilarity between the lu-
minous atmosphere of the' sun and- that. of our globe will be
touched upon hereafter, when I consider the objections that
may be assigned against the moon's being an inhabitable sa-
tellite. I shall now endeavour, by analogical reasonings, to support
the ideas I have suggested concerning the construction and
purposes of the sun; in order to which, it will be necessary
to begin with such arguments as the nature of the case will
admit, to shew that our moon is probably inhabited. This sa-
tellite is of all. the heavenly bodies the nearest, and therefore
most within the reach of our telescopes.
