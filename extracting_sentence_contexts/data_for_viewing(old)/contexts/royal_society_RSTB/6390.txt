(5) The light of the moon was measured directly during most of 1934 and 1935
by a photographic instrument specially designed for the purpose. The instrument
has been recently fully described (WiLL1AMs and Emery, 1935) and it is unnecessary
to go into detail here. The principle is that a line image of the moon, produced
by a cylindrical lens, is focussed on to a fixed strip of photographic paper. As the
moon moves through the sky the lens follows its direction by means of a clockwork
mechanism and the light from the moon thus forms a band on the sensitive strip.
When the moonlight is bright the strip is darkened and when there is no moon the
strip is unaffected.

A comparison of the results of the star recorder and the moonlight recorder shows
that the former is much more sensitive to cloud. The clouds that obscure the
pole-star still allow a considerable amount of light to pass from the moon. In fact,
measurable light from the moon penetrates all but the thickest cloud. This is
supported by the results below, which show that the lunar influence on certain
insects is detectable even on cloudy nights.

To summarizeâ€”the five methods used for obtaining a measure of the night cloud
were (1) personal observation, (2) Rothamsted star camera (1934 and 1935), (3)
Greenwich star camera, (4) difference between air and grass minimum temperature,
and (5) photographic moonlight recorder (1934 and 1935).
