By adding a little more acid the
needle turned round several degrees in the opposite direction. This experiment
completely overthrows the assumed principle that the galvanic effect increases
with the conducting power of the fluid interposed between the metallic plates,
since by increasing the conducting power of the fluid the effect was diminished,
and by a proper increase was completely destroyed. It is a curious fact, that
if nitric, sulphuric, or muriatic acid be used instead of the nitrous, the results
will be. quite the reverse. Having thus, I trust, satisfactorily shown that the electric theory is founded
on false principles, I shall now very shortly examine the truth of the most ge-
nerally received chemical theory of galyanism.
