They prove incontestably, that the agency in question, whatever it may be, operates
primarily on the individual segments of the fibrillee. When a contraction is very forcible and going on at the same moment at several
points of a fasciculus, it may happen, if the pressure on the extremities prevents their
approximation, that the intermediate flaccid portions are stretched even to laceration,
as scen in fig. 75. from the Frog. This fact may serve to illustrate those remarkable
cases of muscular rupture from inordinate action, concerning which much has been
writtenÂ®*,

In the Skate, the following appearances once presented themselves. Dark waves
of contraction, caused by the successive approximation and recession of one side of
the discs, began to play backwards and forwards along one margin of the fasciculus. These gradually included the whole breadth of the fasciculus, and then coalesced ;
permanent rug at the same time forming in addition, each about z4gth inch broad,
and including twenty or thirty of the approximated strize.
