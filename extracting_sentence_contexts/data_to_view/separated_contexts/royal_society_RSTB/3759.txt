In the earliest stages, the deformation of the bract:
and the pressure of the flower is followed in developmental figures (fig. 5); and the
resultant chamber left between successive scales in fig. 2. In the case of the
staminate flower, with ovule of much the same size, growing under closely similar
conditions, between very similar scales, room is still found for the whole andreecium
and perianth members in the chink above and on the flanks of the ovule which takes
the pressure; so that mere pressure in the bud will not account for the extensive
reduction of the ovulate flower, which, as in the case of higher Angiosperms,
reduces by obliterating all parts except those which have a present essential function. It is, in fact, the biologically important seed-dispersal wing of the perianth which
