That is, the action of u; on X results in a ‘twisted’ version of the spectral presheaf, denoted ;.
The component of ¥, at the context V is the Gelfand spectrum of u;Vu_}.

Hence, if a context V is moved by u;, then the corresponding Gelfand spectrum % y will also be
moved, which means that we do not map the quantum state space into itself. We need a second
step mapping the spectrum Z,,,y,,_, back into Xv, and, globally, mapping Y, back into X. Acting
by u_¢ on Z; would achieve this, but only in a trivial manner, because the composite ii—; 0 ily is
simply the identity on Y, independent of t. Clearly, we need a different construction.

We make use of the fact that the context V is isomorphic to the context u;Vu_; as a commutative
von Neumann algebra. Gelfand duality [3] implies that ¥, is isomorphic to Y\. Concretely,
let us write

Vu

Uyy : V — upVu_t (35)
a> u;au_y ,

for the isomorphism between the unital, Abelian von Neumann algebras V and u;Vu_;. Then

Suv Zuvu_, — Xv
