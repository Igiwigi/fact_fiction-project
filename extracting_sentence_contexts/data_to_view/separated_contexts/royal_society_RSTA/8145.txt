The observed facts are that hydrogen shows a strong absolute magnitude effect at
temperatures below A,* (increasing intensity accompanying increasing luminosity)
and the c-effect in classes A and B (increasing sharpness accompanying increasing
luminosity). The second effect is well shown in Payne and Witi1aw’s line-contours
(loc. cit.) for stars of type B;. If following Unséup we take increasing sharpness to
indicate a decreasing number of fully-viewed atoms, then the observed facts correspond
to a kind of mixture of the effects shown by our two diagrams. At low temperatures,
the hypothesis « « P is confirmed; the curves for the lower g-values lie above the
