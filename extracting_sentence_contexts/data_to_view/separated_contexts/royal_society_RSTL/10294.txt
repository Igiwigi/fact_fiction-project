The influence of carbonic acid, he says, is not the same as that of nitrogen,
but resembles it ; direct experiments show that it is impossible to replace the excess
of combustible gases in part by carbonic acid, without altering the coefficient of
affinity. Carbonic acid, which has a higher specific heat than the simpler gases, pPro-
duces a greater effect than an equal volume of nitrogen, hydrogen, or carbonic oxide. This fact, confirms the earlier conclusion that the coefficient not only depends upon the
percentage of oxygen, but also on the temperature of combustion. Steam acts in
a manner analogous to carbonic acid. Such are HonRsTMANN's conelusions as to the
function of inert gases in the explosive mixture.
