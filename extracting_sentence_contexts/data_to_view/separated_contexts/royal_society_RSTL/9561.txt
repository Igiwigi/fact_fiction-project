Now we have already established the fact that the immediate consequence of afford-
ing relief to any portion of the surface of a tube through which a discharge with
positive air-spark is passing is to cause rapid impulsive discharges of negative elec-
tricity from the inside of the tube, and we have also seen that these discharges
are accompanied in high yacua by the usual streams of molecules. Hence it is
1] ural, in seeking to account for the phenomenon we have described above, to look to
2: negative discharges and their accompaniments for the solution. And that this
is the proper source is shown by the fact that a similar phenomenon appears with
- negative special where there are also similar impulsive negative discharges, while in
itive special and negative relief which give rise to positive discharges there is either
such phenomenon, or it is manifested on 80 much more insignificant a scale as to
Foie to its being only a secondary effect. = Considering then that the poxitive relief and the negative special give effects which
Suro as identical in the case of phosphorescent discharges as in that of ordinary dis-
\Sharges, we may fairly consider that we are on safe ground in applying our previously
*Dbtained results to them ; and we therefore conclude that a negative discharge from
the inside of the tube transversely to its length is the necessary condition for the
Fxistence of this phenomenon of virtual shadows. We shall now show that it is due

Ky is beating down being caused by the transverse streams of similar molecules coming
