When the eggs have been deposited, the cireumstances which affect their fecunda-
tion are precisely similar to those which affect the spermatozoa,—the temperature
of the surrounding medium, and the length of time during which they remain im-

mersed in water after expulsion from the body. © The length of time during which
they are susceptible of impregnation has relation to each of these conditions; and
these have now acquired additional interest in the establisghment of the fact that the
spermatozoon penetrates into the envelopes of the eggs, and that, consequently, the
rate of expansion of the envelopes has a further direct relation to-its function;

The following experiments will illustrate the foregoing obseryations ;—

It may here be remarked, that although, as in my former paper, the date of the
experiment is recorded, it is 80 only for the convenience of reference; and not with
any regard to priority of period at which the experiments were made; the details
being given only in illustration of the general statements enunciated.
