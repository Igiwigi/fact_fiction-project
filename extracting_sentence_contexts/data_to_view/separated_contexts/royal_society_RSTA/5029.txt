With such long residence times in the
ocean, and concentrations being dominantly controlled by solubility and buffering, these major
ions have maintained a near-constant relatively high concentration on million year time scales
and for much of Earth’s history. Although there is an intimate relationship between the degree of
employment for life and complexity of life, whereby the number of proteins using for example
Ca increases exponentially as life advances from single bacterial cells to compartmentalized
eukaryotic cells, and ultimately to multicellular forms [4], this is unlikely driven by changes
in the environment. In fact, as we shall explore below, the increased use of Ca occurs
contemporaneously with the increased use of both Cu and Zn and, we shall argue, is enabled as
a result of the advent of those trace metals into the environment triggering enhanced complexity
of life. By contrast to the major ions that, today and always, have the highest concentration in
the oceans and life, the transition (and trace) metals have the potential for an extraordinarily
flexible redox state, owing to their partially filled d-orbitals in the ground state. This flexibility
has two important implications for life.
