omic reasons why the Tasmanians may have reduced their
reliance on fishing. For example, Andersson & Read [31] have
pointed out that the Tasmanians’ non-consumption of fish
could have been due to the fact that fish were not needed for
protein because of the ready availability of shellfish and seals,
and are not a source of carbohydrates. Under these conditions,
they aver, the investment required to obtain fish may actually
have been maladaptive. An alternative economic explanation
for the Tasmanians’ decision to fish less often has been outlined
by Hiscock [32]. The implication of these arguments is that, even
if it were the case that the Tasmanians did not ever eat fish, we
could not infer anything about the impact of population size
on cultural complexity from that fact. The other issue is that it
is not uncommon for stable or expanding populations to avoid
fish despite having ready access to them. For instance, stable

isotope evidence indicates that the first farmers in Britain did
not consume marine resources even when they lived close to
the sea [33]. Given that the population of Britain seems to have
expanded dramatically in the early Neolithic [34], this also
clearly indicates that a failure to fish cannot be assumed to be
maladaptive.

In contrast to the situation with regard to fishing, we can be
confident that the Tasmanians stopped producing bone tools
