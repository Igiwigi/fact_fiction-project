experiments on the compressibility of alcohol in the neighbourhood of the zero point.
The value given in Lupron’s tables is ;}4 per 10° grms. per sq. centim., or ‘0000906
per atmosphere of 1033°3 grms. Mr. SkinNeER by recent experiments made in. the
Cavendish Laboratory on alcohol at 13°°5 C, between 1 atmosphere and 1°3 atmo-
spheres obtains the value ‘000093 per atmosphere.

It seemed desirable, if only to serve as a check on the experiments, to mention
the attempt that I made to determine directly the yielding of the glass vessel. For
this purpose the alcohol was boiled out until only a very small residue was left, when
mercury was allowed to enter which completely filled up the whole instrument. This
mercury, whose compressibility is some fifty times less than that of alcohol, was then

* Asa matter of fact, the stem DE was unfortunately broken in setting up the apparatus for exhibi-
tion in the rooms of the Royal Society, at the Soirée of June 18, 1890, but this was afterwards
repaired without any interference with the neighbouring bulb,

subjected to pressures of 10 and 12 atmospheres (above the external atmospheric

pressure), and the retreat of the end of the mercury column along the tube was

noted. The following measures of this recession were obtained for a pressure of 10
_ gauge-atmospheres of 15 pounds per sq. inch.
