It is likely that these issues will only be resolved with the availability of
higher-resolution structures of either a complete CESA protein or the entire CSC.

microscopy

The large size of the CSC should make it directly visible using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). However, to date, there are no such reports despite the fact that these complexes are
concentrated in the plasma membrane at sites marked by cortical microtubules. Despite using a
wide variety of different methodologies, including high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution,

hetero (left-hand side) or homo (right-hand side) trimers of CESA proteins. (b) Freeze fracture TEM of the plasma membrane
