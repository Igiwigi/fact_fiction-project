The mean value of invariable HR pattern (BBI-E1, 5.1 + 7.4) of the REL group was closer to
that of the CON group (3.0 + 3.9), leading to no significant (but in trend) differences between these
groups, but were further away from the mean values of the SZO group (15.4 + 17.2), leading to
this significant difference; this seems to be mainly the result of the altered HRV in the REL group
and not of respiratory variability. However, we would like to especially emphasize that the REL
group have fast alterations of increased and subsequently decreased (RESP-P) and alternating
(RESP-LA1) respiratory frequency. This result may be due to the fact that the measurement
procedure is stressful for the REL group or that they were worried about their diseased relatives
(SZO) who require comprehensive clinical treatment. The changes within the cardiorespiratory system in schizophrenia seem to be disease-inherent : =
characteristics and might reflect arousals during the psychosis stage in acutely ill schizophrenic : yy
patients. Because their relatives are obviously not in the same emotional and psychotic state it (3
seems to be more evident that the alterations of CRC found in the SZO group are closely connected aes
to the emotions such as sadness, happiness, anxiety and fear that appear during this disease. 22
However, this could not be proved within this study and has to be therefore investigated in : Ss
other studies applying, for example, functional imaging to analyse cortex activity in connection : S
with different behavioural situations.
