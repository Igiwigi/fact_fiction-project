to higher frequencies in the presence of RMP. The waveforms in (c) for n = 2; K* = 2.8, 2.9 show a dramatic drop in their
amplitudes fora slight change in K* from 2.8 to 2.9, indicating a ‘bifurcation’ behaviour. The corresponding power spectrum (d)
also reveals drastic changes at K* = 2.9 with the appearance of sharp peaks at 2.4 and 3.4 MHz. (Online version in colour.)

to 500 kHz. Moreover, there is a broad smaller peak around 800 kHz that is unlike the n =2 but
resembles qualitatively the n = 3 pre-transition spectrum. Post-transition, n = 4, K* = 1.8 exhibits
some similarities to the n=2 and the 1 =3 cases: firstly, the overall amplitude level seems to
be lower. There are three spectral peaks below 1 MHz and a flat broadband feature from 500 to
750 kHz. Then, unlike n = 2, =3, there is a relatively sharp Gaussian spectrum around 3.6 MHz.
We have carried out simulations with 1 up to and including n = 6, but do not present them here
due to a lack of space.

The fact that the waveforms and spectra of the system subjected to an RMP with fixed n as
K* are varied undergo a bifurcation-like change in an otherwise ‘smooth’ evolution is illustrated
in figure 3a-f. In figure 3a, the temporal means (i.e. a time average) of the waveforms for n =2
and each K* chosen are plotted. It shows that, starting with K* = 0 (i.e. the ‘Reference NO RMP
case’), after an initial slow linear increase up to K* =1, the values trace (as K* is increased by
0.5 at each step) a rising curve, apparently flattening around K* = 2.5. Then, at K* = 2.8, we see
a sudden drop of the temporal mean to a significantly lower value at K* = 2.9. This then is the
‘transition’ experienced by the system. As we continue increasing K*, there is a smooth but small
drop to a minimum (around K* ~ 3) followed by a relatively smooth but steeper rise to a peak
around K* =3.5, where the time mean is almost back to its earlier value at 2.8. In figure 3c, the
corresponding time mean results obtained by CUTIE are shown for the n=3 RMPs. As noted
earlier, the steep transition is shown at 1.2-1.3, as K* is varied. However, unlike n = 2, there is a
smooth increase to a further flat maximum followed by a smooth decrease to a lower final value
