We have een that the anterior
oxyutic glands contain, as a rule, somewhat larger granules than the posterior, and,

further, that in some of the former, granules like those of the csophageal glands not
infrequently occur. If, then, the granules are connected with the formation of
ferment, we should expect a definite weight of the anterior gastric region to contain
more ferment than an equal weight of the median gastric region. This, in fact, is
the case (see experiment given below) ; part of the difference in amount is, however,
probably due to the difference in the size of the glands in the two regions. Lastly, we can consider the pyloric glands. The acid extract of the dried mucous
membrane does contain some pepsin, for it dissolves carmine-fibrin more quickly than
hydrochloric acid alone ; but the amount is very small, and we know that a small
amount of pepsin is found in nearly every tissue.
