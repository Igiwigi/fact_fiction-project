hardly be due to this cause, for the Lizards give the best fit of the four tables, the cal-
culated figures being extraordinarily close to those observed. It may be noticed that
in each table the numbers of the largest genera, those in the terminal group, are in defect
as compared with expectation, but the deficiency is very small in one case at least
(Table VI), and the experience too limited to suggest a general rule. In the case of
the Chrysomelide, moreover, the lack of precision in interpolation has partly contributed
to the result, for it will be seen that the mean of the fitted distribution (Table IV, lines 3
and 8) is slightly too low. Desire of the systematist to break up a genus which he regarded
as unwieldy might well tend to cause a deficiency of very large genera, but such a deficiency
can hardly be held to be proved by the present tables.

So far as the tests go I think it must be admitted that the formula given is capable
of representing the facts with considerable precision, more closely indeed than we have
any right to expect. One might well have expected the personal factor in classification,
the practically cataclysmic destruction of species at numerous epochs in geological
time, and all the varied changes that have diversified the organic history of our planet,
to have left so many irregularities in the distribution that any formula could at most
have given a very rough analogy with the general run of the data. But apparently
the formula arrived at can do far more than this. Why this is so seems to me to be a
point which requires some discussion. I return to it briefly below.

Having shown, however, that the formula is capable of closely describing the facts,
we can revert to Table IV, and the actual values of p and +. It will be seen in the
first place that the values found for + range only from 4-26 to 6-28, the unit of time being
