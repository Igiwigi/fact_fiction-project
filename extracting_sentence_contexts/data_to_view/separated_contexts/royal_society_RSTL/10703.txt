The difference between the two muscles is that for the heart musele
the energy liberated as external work bears a direct proportion to the tension exerted
by the load, while for ordinary musele this is not true. The lift of an ordinary
muscle when contracting is represented, in the case of the heart muscle, by the extent of
the contraction, measured by the volume of blood ejected, Since within the range of
arterial pressures given the volume of blood thrown out at each systole remains the
game, it follows that the extent of the contraction is unchanged. The most probable
interpretation of this fact is that the contraction in each case is maximal, and
completely empties the ventricular cavity; a conclusion which is in accordance with
the work of Bowpircn, KronEgckE, and others on the isolated Frog's heart. ON THE HEART OF THE DOG. 151
