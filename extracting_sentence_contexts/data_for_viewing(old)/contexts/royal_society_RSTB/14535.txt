tive experiences [28-32]. On the other hand, distributional
theories argue that the meaning of any concept is determined

by linguistic co-occurrences. For example, the concept DOG is
defined by co-occurring concepts such as WALK,
BARK and FURRY, in the same way that the word DEMOC-
RACY is defined by co-occurring concepts such as POLITICS,
STATE and REPRESENTATION.

What matters for our purposes is that the close relationship
between abstract concepts and language use is a constant
across different accounts. In fact, language also works as a
glue that helps categorize everyday disparate experiences
under the same concept [28], for example describing both
being able to make political statements without fear of impri-
sonment and not having to work at a boring job in order to
pay the bills as FREEDOM. Furthermore, given the variability,

ately distributed. Bavelas et al. [15] showed how storytellers
benefit from their listenersâ€™ feedback, arguing for their role
as co-narrators. Narrators told their story less well when
distracted listeners provided suboptimal feedback. Feedback
might be used to divide extended turns (such as anecdotes)
into appropriate units that make it easier to signal and
