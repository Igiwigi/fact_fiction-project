in its central region, does not exhibit a distinct fossa ovalis such as we find in the
Mammalia.

Ventriculus.â€”The ventricle is a stout-walled sac presenting somewhat the shape
of an equilateral triangle when viewed from the ventral surface, and it is about
18 mm. long. It is sharply marked off from the atria by a well-developed coronary
sulcus. Its apex is very bluntly rounded, and in one of the specimens examined
bore short processes resembling the gubernaculum cordis that Bepparp has stated
to be present generally in the Lacertilia(3). The base of the ventricle is not quite
at right angles to the long axis of the heart owing to the fact that the right
shoulder is far more rounded off than the left. On the other hand, however, the
left auricle overhangs the ventricle more than the right. The dorsal wall of the
ventricle is more flattened than the ventral.

The arterial trunks come off slightly to the right of the middle line from a small
anterior projection of the ventricle which, I think, is to be regarded as a remnant of
the conus arteriosus for, although it does not bear characteristic conus valves, it
nevertheless has valves and constitutes a sort of common trunk from which the
arteries arise.

The lumen of the ventricle is quite small owing to the thickness of the wall,
which is spongy and composed of an interlacing network of muscular trabeculee into
