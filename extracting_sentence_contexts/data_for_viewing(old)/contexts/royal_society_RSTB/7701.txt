levels at various temperatures in a given gradient have no universal application. While
information on the temperature-activity relations of locusts remains incomplete, it has at
any rate been shown that very rapid temperature changes have not a direct, but an inverse
ortho-kinetic effect; a fall of temperature provokes movement and a rise stops it, over the
range of moderate temperatures (Kennedy 1939). Some further information is available
concerning another kind of activity, feeding, in Schistocerca gregaria. Husain, Mathur &
Roonwal (1949) found that the amount of food consumed per day was at a maximum
between 33 and 37° C, falling off at lower and higher temperatures, the maximum rate of
development being at about the same intermediate temperature.

If maximum activity were to occur at excessive temperatures, as a fixed law, that would
imply that activity itself was something ‘abnormal’, imposed on the animal directly from
outside, and that complete inactivity was the normal state. In fact, complete inactivity is
abnormal behaviour for locusts. In the field the maximum sustained activity occurs at
moderate temperatures, as it might also, judging from the work on other insects, under
appropriately arranged laboratory conditions.

Inasmuch as they show maximum activity at moderate, and minimum activity at exces-
sive temperatures, migrants in the field behave in a way that corresponds with the behaviour
of non-migrants. Thus Volkonsky (1942) coined the expressive term ‘euthermy’, defined as
the external conditions (the range of available temperatures) permitting non-migrant locusts
to maintain their body temperature at the preferred level. He showed that in such conditions
individual congregans hoppers of Schistocerca gregaria wandered freely within the habitat,
which they did not do at lower or higher temperatures. The amount of undisturbed activity
among various non-migrant solitaria or congregans populations of the same species observed
