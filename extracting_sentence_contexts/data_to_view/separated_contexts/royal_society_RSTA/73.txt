See theorem 3.7 in [9]. a

A more detailed analysis of this model can be found in [8]. It is shown how different
parameters of the model, such as the depreciation rate and the technology terms, affect the
capital distribution over time. Furthermore, the simulation results show that a concave-convex
production function is in fact capable of recreating the effect of poverty traps.

3. Identification of production functions

As mentioned above, the choice of the production function is crucial for an economic model,
as its shape will greatly influence the capital distribution. However, there are many different
possibilities to make this choice and often it is not clear which production function will fit the
situation best.
