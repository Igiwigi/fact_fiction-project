Associated with each
dichotomy is an inevitable disturbance of the normal 2/5 phyllotaxis ; this is,
however, restored higher up, though very gradually. This and other questions
relating to the phyllotaxis will be discussed at a later stage. Another remarkable fact is the extremely small angle of divergence in the
bifureating stem. This is clearly indicated by the serial sections drawn in

text-fig. 9; the sister axes lie almost parallel to each other, that is, practically

(Three sections have been prepared, two transverse and one longitudinal.)

Specimen 3 (No. 1089, Museum of Geology, University of Sydney).—This is the
largest specimen in the collection, with a cross-section 20 x 154 cm. and a
length of about 134 cm. It includes 11 leaf-bearing stems, two of which show
signs of bifurcation.
