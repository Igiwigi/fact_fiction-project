heavy projections from bilateral superior parietal areas,
inferior parietal hubs that further broadened the overall
influence of intra-parietal connectivity, and bidirectionally
connected middle temporal and insular hubs (figure 4). The
presence of these distinct SPN hubs and their respective
directional connectivity profiles likely allows the balanced
integration of multimodal processes necessary for speech
perception and processing, sensorimotor transformations,
and motor output. While the roles of the inferior frontal
gyrus and primary motor cortex are at the centre of discussion
when considering neural control of speech production [12,39-
43], our data show that the major information flow within the
SPN is in fact directed through the superior/inferior parietal
cortex, which subsequently influences other speech-associated
cortical areas and seemingly integrates them into the neural
network for speech production. Notably, in the SPN compared
with the SyIPN, prefrontal areas, including the inferior frontal
gyrus, appear to receive denser (figure 3) and longer-ranging

(figure 5) projections from parietal and cerebellar regions that
likely influence and contribute to more refined speech moni-
toring and motor preparation.

In summary, we combined fMRI data with a novel compu-
tational approach of rDCM and graph-theoretical analysis to
