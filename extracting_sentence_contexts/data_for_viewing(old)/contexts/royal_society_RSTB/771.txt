to its preaxial border a less obvious, but undoubted procoracoid tuberosity (pr.cor.t.)
is shown in fig. 230; and in every specimen the acrocoracoid tuberosity or spina
coracoidea (ac7.cor.) is a prominent feature. Moreover, the tendon of the subclavius
(Plate 19, fig. 293, subcl.) passes immediately mesiad of the last-named elevation,
precisely as in Carinatze.

The coraco-scapular angle varies from 150° to 122°. It is largest (150°) in the
skeleton in the Wellington Museum marked A. maaima (probably A. bulleri,
fig. 225); it is 142° in one specimen of A. australis (fig. 227) und in the supposed
A. haastii (fig. 226); between 127° and 130° in another specimen of A. australis
(fig. 228), in one of A. bulleri (fig. 229), and in one of A. owent (fig. 231); and
122° in two specimens of A. bulleri (fig. 230) and one of A. oweni (fig. 232).
There is, therefore, no constancy in this respect in the various species. The fact that
the angle is as small as 122° in Apteryx, while it rises to 97° in Notornis and to 100°
in Ocydromus and Diomedea (26, p. 250) quite bears out Fiprincer’s statement
that as a character distinguishing the Ratitee from the Carinatz, it is of considerably
less importance than the relative size in the two groups of the acrocoracoid. Fir-
BRINGER gives the range of variation in the coraco-scapular angle as 130° to 160° for
Ratits, and 45° to 106° for Carinate, giving a difference of 24° between the two
groups ; the foregoing observations reduce the difference to 16°.
