An asterisk will be found attached to four of the stars in the list ; these are stars,
which, on comparing their mean positions as ascertained in the course of this inquiry,

with those given by other observers, exhibit changes of such an amount in their angle
of position as to afford satisfactory evidence of orbital motion. This fact being admitted, it is plain that these stars cannot be rendered available
in the present inquiry; it was deemed unnecessary therefore to extend to them the
method of reduction employed in the case of the other stars ; the observations, how-
ever, are given with the others in their proper place. The third and seventh columns of the table contain the arithmetical mean of the
individual measures, both in position and distance, obtained on the day specified in
the first column. The quantities inserted in the fourth and fifth columns headed © probable error ”
and © computed weight,” refer to the positions only, and have been computed from
