When the rotation is small,
the configuration, instead of being strictly spherical is slightly spheroidal. The
series we are considering is therefore the analogue of the series of MAcLAURIN
spheroids of an incompressible fluid, So long as the rotation remains small, we may
separate the two terms of the rotation-potential in the manner explained in ยง 31. We may, in fact, suppose our analysis still to apply as if the configuration remained
spherical, and the only effect of the rotation is to increase the value of the stability-
function, For larger values of o*, all our results are subject to a correction of the
