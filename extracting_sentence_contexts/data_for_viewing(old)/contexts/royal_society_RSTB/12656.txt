studies lend support to the notion that a map between cogni-
tive modularity and brain modularity does in fact exist, but
its specific form may be different from that postulated several
decades ago. The existence of such a map also suggests that
adaptible brain modules may support adaptible cognition.
Indeed, the predicted support of modularity for adaptibility
is particularly evident in recent work demonstrating that the
modules within functional brain networks flexibly reconfi-
gured over time in support of human learning [108-111],
planning and reasoning [112], and cognitive flexibility [113].
From a theoretical perspective, the relation between network
modularity and adaptible function can be understood in a
more mechanistic manner by considering the fact that network
architecture directly constrains the trajectories that a system can
take through the adaptation landscape [114].

hierarchically modular networks

If the professor we have been following understood the archi-
tecture of the brain, would that understanding change how
they chose the content and structure of their lecture or discus-
sion plan? Most experts could describe, if asked, the direct
relations between any pair of the 15 concepts they chose to
cover in the class period. In other words, the expert could
