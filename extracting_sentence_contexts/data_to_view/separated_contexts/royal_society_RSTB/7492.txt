The specimen is classed as left-handed or right-handed according as the axes so chosen are
left-handed or right-handed. A new classification has of course to be defined for each species. The fact that there exist organisms which do not have left-right symmetry does not in
itself cause any difficulty. It has already been explained how various kinds of symmetry can
be lost in the development of the embryo, due to the particular disturbances (or ‘noise’)
influencing the particular specimen not having that kind of symmetry, taken in conjunction

with appropriate kinds of instability. The difficulty lies in the fact that there are species in
which the proportions of left-handed and right-handed types are very unequal.
