Before proceeding to describe our experiments in this direction, it will, however,
be convenient to ascertain how we can reasonably explain the phenomena so far
observed.

Tn our earlier experiments* on the diffusion of atmospheric carbon dioxide through
varying apertures in the cover of a dish which was partially filled with an absorb-

ing alkaline solution, the fact that the velocity of diffusion per unit area increased
as the aperture was diminished did not excite any surprise, since it was clear that
the gradient of density of the CO, of the outer atmosphere, and of the air above
the absorbent, was necessarily an increasing one, a state of things which would
naturally result in a somewhat increased flow. When, however, the area of the
aperture was made very small compared with that of the absorbing surface, and the
partial pressure of the CO, in the air of the dish had consequently been reduced
almost to a vanishing quantity, it was found that a further diminution in the size
of the hole was still attended with a very marked increase in the rate of flow per
unit area, and that this increase was far larger than could be reasonably accounted
for by any ordinary differences of density gradient in the CO).

It became still more impossible to regard this as a sufficient explanation, when
