I fully agree with Klein that on this point we should rather trust Gau& himself, who called his
Thesis ‘Demonstratio nova’, thus showing that he does not pretend to be the first to give such a
proof. Of course, Gau8 starts with criticizing all preceding proofs. The objection he raises against
the Euler-Lagrange proof is that they already assume that the roots of an algebraic equation
exist somewhere, to apply the Viéte formulae, and derive that then these roots are in fact complex. Retrospectively, after the work of Kronecker, this proof is correct to all effects. The problems in
d’Alembert’s proof are slightly more serious, but I would assess it as essentially correct, as we
know the later work of Weierstrass.
