cent. of ordinary terrestrial plants do not close their stomata at night.* As above

explained, Humea elegans and Sparmannia africana are counted as closing their

BS stomata, though in artificial darkness they remain open. The same is true of three
a species of British Orchids examined, namely O. maculata, Morio, and latifolia.

2 Nyctitropie Plants.

5 These are placed in a different class, because Srant, in his interesting paper,t
3 found that the stomata of sleeping plants are very commonly open at night.

5b The difficulty of the question is shown by the following facts:â€”In writing out
op the subject in the winter of 1897-98, I concluded that there was practically no
difference between nyctitropie and other terrestrial plants in the matter of nocturnal
closure.{ The balance was, however, rather in favour of the non-sleeping plants,
among which I found about 12 per cent. clearly open at night, among the sleepers
only one species out of eighteen observed was clearly open, but about 20 per cent.
were just perceptibly open. In the spring of the present year I determined to make
more observations, and these showed my former calculations to be incorrect. When
observations are made on plants at a fairly high temperature, the difference between
sleepers and non-sleepers comes out clearly.

bright light (not sunshine) gave with the hygroscope 25 to 30, while a control plant in duller light was at
12 to 10. Similar differences occur in 2. Ficaria, and doubtless in other species.
