figs. 3 and 4. From the fact of the presence of these vessels, which
converge towards and form convyolutions internal to the articular cartilage, it may
be inferred that they supply the cells of the latter with a nutrient fluid. As the arti-
cular cartilage increases in thickness, and the ossific nucleus which is developed in
the epiphysal cartilage becomes larger, these vessels gradually recede from between
them, and they leave a considerable mass of non-yascular cartilage between the osse-
ous nuclens and the synovial membrane; all of this appears to be articular cartilage,
which is now nourished by the vessels in the interior of the nuclens. See Plate XIII.
