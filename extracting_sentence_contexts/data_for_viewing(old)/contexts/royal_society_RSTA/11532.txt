a vertical axis. It was divided internally into degrees. The eye was directed to any
part of the surface by means of a small phosphorescent bead at the end of a stick ;
and a small electric lamp, which could be switched on by a simple movement of the
hand, gave light sufficient to read the position occupied by the bead at any desired
instant. The intensity of the light illuminating the ground glass was altered by
any of the four methods mentioned above. The annulus was usually employed to
effect the alteration, and it could be rotated at the will of the observer by a long
handle attached to the rack and pinion motion of the rotating gear.

13. Similarity of Fields for Different Colours.

The order in which the experiments were made will not be followed, for, as a
matter of fact, amongst those to be first described some were among the latest, and
others among the earliest made. It was essential to know whether the fields for each
colour were of the same form when the illumination was so adjusted that one point
in a field of one colour coincided with one point in the field of a different colour.
The following two sets of observations made by myself, and the succeeding ones
made by one of my assistants (W. B.), will give the answer to the inquiry.

An aperture of *525 inch subtending an angle of 2° 30’ was inserted behind the
ground glass, and the light falling on the eye when D was the ray selected, was 4°5
amyl-acetate lamps at 1 foot. (In future this light will be designated as AL, and
this particular illumination would be 4°5 AL.)

The following rays were used to illuminate the aperture: red lithium (A 6705)
