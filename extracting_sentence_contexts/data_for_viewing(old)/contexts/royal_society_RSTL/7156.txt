slit to mathematical lines.

If the images touch each other, the aperture of the slit and the two sodium-lines are
seen at the same angle.

14. The first fact which we discoyered in operating with our tubes, guided by the
above explained principles, was the following one :—

There is @ certain number of elementary subsfances, which, when differently heated, fur-
nish two kinds of spectra of quite a different character, not having any line or any band
in common.

The fact is important, as well with regard to theoretical conceptions as to practical
applications—the more s0 as the passage from one kind of spectra to the other is by no
means a continuous one, but takes place abruptly. By regulating the temperature you
may repeat the two spectra in any succession ad libitum.

We will now treat more explicitly the case of Nitrogen, which first unfolded to us its
different spectra. These spectra, obtained in the easiest and most striking way, have
been examined by us in every point of view. The other cases of double spectra may
hereafter be spoken of in a more summary manner.

15. We examined nitrogen prepared in different ways, even in the state of greatest
purity ; but we found that, in order to get pure spectra of it, it was not necessary to
free the gas from all traces of air *. Therefore we may select the following prepara-
