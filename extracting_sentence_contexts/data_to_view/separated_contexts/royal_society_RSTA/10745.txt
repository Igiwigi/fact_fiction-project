Polished and etched sections of these ingots were
found to contain very varied and complicated patterns that sometimes appeared to
have no connection with the singularities of the freezing-point curve. For example,
a tin-rich crystallisation which appeared to be primary, was found to increase to a
maximum amount as we descended a branch of the curve, and in more than one
region undeniable primary crystals which stood out in relief on the outside of the
ingots were found, when polished half-through, to be full of smaller and quite
different crystals. In fact, it became evident that the final patterns we were
examining were of the nature of a palimpsest in which several different records were
superposed, some of these being due to recrystallisations that had taken place after
solidification. Two other considerations pointed to the same conclusion, the first was
derived from the very valuable cooling curves, published by Roperts-AustEN and
STANSFIELD in 1895, which revealed the fact that far below the temperature of
solidification considerable evolutions of heat occurred in the alloys as they cooled. The second was derived from Professor RoozEBoom’s paper on the “ Solidification of
Mixed Crystals of Two Substances,” published in the ‘ Zeitschrift fiir Physikalische
Chemie,’ of December, 1899.
