more clearly how the events leading up to Price’s working out
of the equation provide an illustration of the intricate ways in
which science may reflect life.

Philosophers of science argue over the extent to which non-
scientific factors play a role in the various aspects of scientific
production, from influencing problem choice all the way to
insinuating themselves into the very bones of scientific theories.
Many works have shown that specific political, social and ideo-
logical agenda, as well as ‘zeitgeist’ more broadly, frame both
how scientific problems are recognized and the manner in
which they are approached. Others have gone further to claim
that scientific facts are the products of scientific inquiry, rather
than direct descriptions of realities ‘out there’; that they are ‘net-
worked’, and considered either ‘false’ or ‘true’ not based on the
strength of any inherent veracity but rather on the strength of the
networks that produce them—the tools, practices, institutions,
rhetoric that render them intelligible and present them to
consensus [35-39].

The case of ‘the Price equatior/ illustrates how a preoccupa-
tion with the Cold War arms race, computer-age ‘optimization’,
and a form of historically situated mechanistic scientism paved
a road upon which Price advanced towards his evolutionary
formalization. It also shows how the motivation for attacking
