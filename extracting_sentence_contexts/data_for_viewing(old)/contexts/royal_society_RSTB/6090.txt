A.—The Prootic Region.

(i) Descriptive—The development of the three prootic somites of the Selachian
embryo into the extrinsic eye-muscles and the relations between these and the cranial
nerves, first demonstrated by BALrour (1876), have been shown by subsequent workers
to be true in general terms for all groups of Craniates. The development of the eye-
muscles in birds has been studied by Rex (1897, 1901), Epanworrn (1907), and ADELMANN
(1922, 1926, 1927), so that the facts need only brief description, the observations
now recorded being corroborative of theirs. It is, however, necessary to go into this
matter here, for the main object of this particular investigation is to determine the
serial number of the segment in which the occipital arch of the skull arises in the duck,
and for this purpose it is essential to establish the fact that the prootic somites are true
somites, corresponding serially with those in the more posterior regions, and that the
prootic somites are three in number.
