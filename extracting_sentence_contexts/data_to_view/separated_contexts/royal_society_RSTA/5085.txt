Since that date we have made a large number of new
experiments in which the thicknesses of black films of different composition have
been determined both by electrical and optical methods. Some of the observations
were described to the Society in a paper “ On Black Soap Films,” which was read on
March 1, 1890, The main object then before us was to enquire whether the rate of
formation of the black depends on its thickness. Before the paper was published,
facts came to our knowledge which appeared to show that however this might
be, there was an undoubted and much more clearly marked relation between the com-
