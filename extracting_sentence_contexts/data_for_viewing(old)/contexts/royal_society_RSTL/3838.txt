excavated in the very substance of this, would seem to furnish the appropriate chan-
nel for its nutrition. And that such is its object, will be shown in a future memoir
to be almost certainly proved, by the comparison of facts then to be addaced from
the structure of other genera.

108. Monstrosities—Although the number of specimens of this type which I have
had the opportunity of examining is but small, yet two among them exhibited the
same kind of monstrosity as that which is common in Orbitolites ; namely, the super-
position of a vertical plate upon the horizontal disk (Plate XXX. fig. 3). And in each
it is sufficiently apparent that this plate has originated from the central cell, and that
its increase has taken place pari passu with that of the horizontal disk.

109. General Summary.—If, now, we review the principal facts relating to the
structure of Cycloclypers, and compare them with those furnished by Orbitolites on
the one hand and by Nummulites on the other, we sball see that, notwithstanding

its resemblance to the former in external aspect and plan of growth, it is far more
closely allied to the latter in those features of its organization which indicate its
physiological condition. It has been shown that in Orbitolites the communication
between the different portions of the sarcode-body is s0 free, that the whole may be
