The
picistence of such currents, nevertheless, gave me much anxiety in the earlier experi-
“Frents with molten metals which were begun in the year 1881, and will now be described. * From the outset of this research both molten lead and bismuth were chosen as
Bhitable fluids in which the diffusion of other metals could be studied. Advantage
“gras also taken of the fact that at temperatures well above the melting point, neither
Bf these metals unite with iron. The precious metals, also, when alloyed with lead or
Sismuth, do not show any tendency to unite with iron unless it is very clean and
bright. Tubes of wrought iron, therefore, proved to be most useful in conducting
She i inquiry.
