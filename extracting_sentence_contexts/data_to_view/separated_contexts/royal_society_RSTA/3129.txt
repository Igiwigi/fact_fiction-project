This can be explained by observing that Hilbert did not explicitly relate the programme of his

paper with von Neumann and Nordheim with his sixth problem. It seems that the authors of this : =
paper, although clearly understanding that the quantum model is based on a new probabilistic : S
formalism, did not realize that the emergence of this new formalism naturally raises the following 2
problem: either the new formalism is superfluous and everything can be dealt with using the old aed
probabilistic formalism, which is the thesis of the hidden variable theories, or it is necessary. But in 22
this case the difference between the two mathematical formalisms is a clear indication of the fact [4
that they are based on different axioms. If this is the case, then the first step towards the solution : =
of Hilbert’s sixth problem is to individuate which axiom of classical probability is violated in : S
a quantum context and the second step is to individuate which new probabilistic axioms are : S

sufficient to deduce the quantum model. Both steps were realized in the context of quantum
probability and will be reviewed in this paper.
