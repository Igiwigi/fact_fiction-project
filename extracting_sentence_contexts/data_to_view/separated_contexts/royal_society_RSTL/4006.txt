These results occur equally when nerves, which have not pre-
viously been subjected to any discharge, are acted upon. 'This is easily put to the
proof by merely discharging the bottle several times through other frogs before be- |
ginning to act upon those which had been purposely put aside without the shock |
being passed through them. It is s0on seen, after a few touches, that that limb |
alone contracts the nerve of which was exposed to the action of the direct dis [
charge. We may therefore conclude that the action of electricity upon the mixed nerves of
an animal living or recently killed, is reduced to the two following facts :—

1. 'The electric discharge traversing a nerve awakens muscular contraction ; but
this contraction is much stronger when produced by the direct discharge than when
it is excited by the inverse discharge. |
2, The electric current circulating through a nerve of a living animal, or an animal a

newly killed, produces a variation in the excitability of the nerye: if the current is 1
direct, the excitability is diminished and destroyed ; while, on the contrary, the exci- |
tability is preserved and increased by the passage of the inverse current. o

It is needless to observe that these latter phaznomena can be verified in the dead þ
animal only within such limits as are necessarily fixed by the cessation of the vital pl
conditions essential to the preservation of the properties of the nerve. It will be ob- hl

served that I have not taken any account in this memoir of the sensations awakened
by the passage of electricity in the nerve. To complete this memoir, it only remains for me to show how the different pheno-
mena, produced by the passage of the electric current through the nerye, may be
arranged in groups founded upon the two principles quoted and deduced immediately
from experiment.
