arcs of three ellipses, the excentricities of which vary according
to a certain law. Hence it appears, that there are two different methods by
which the analytic art may be advanced; either by artifices
peculiarly its own, or by aid drawn from the properties of figures
and curve lines; if, for instance, FacNnant's theorem be proved
for an ellipse, by processes purely geometrical, then, such a
theorem, expressed in analytical language, becomes immediately

reasonings strictly geometrical, a relation can be established be-
tween the arcs of three ellipses, whose excentricities vary ac-
