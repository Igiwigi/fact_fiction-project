(A39)

where I"(z), (1 — B, At) are Gamma function and incomplete Gamma function, respectively.

The behaviour of this function is depicted in figure 16. In addition to the representation (A 39),
the inverse transform of (A38) can be expressed through the Mittag—Leffler function [33] as
follows:

galt)=e “'(t) PE, 1_p(A), (A 40)

where Ey,g(z) is a Mittag-Leffler function defined by the series Ey,g(z) = P29 2*/I'(ak + 6).

Owing to the fact that equation (A 37) has a unique solution, expressions (A 39) and (A 40)
define the same unique function. So, equating expressions on the right-hand side of equalities
(A39) and (A40) leads to the following presentation of the Mittag—Leffler function for a =1:
Ey, p(2)=1/1(B) +2) Fe[1 — F(B,2)/F(B)1-


Function g(t) and similar functions are commonly referred to as memory functions [13]
Memory functions can be also associated with one more function y(t) as follows:

Vplt)=A Poa) —1. (A41)
Accounting for (A 39) gives
