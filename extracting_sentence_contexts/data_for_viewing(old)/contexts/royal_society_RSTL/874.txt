copper, excepting that it was rather paler; it also proved to be
perfectly ductile.

Two pounds of gold were afterwards alloyed with tin and
copper; the former was in the proportion of eight grains in the
ounce, similar to the last experiment ; and, in like manner, the
alloyed metal was found to be perfectly ductile; so that the bar,
which at first was + of an inch in thickness, was rolled as thin
as a guinea, and, when thus rolled, it still remained so oft, that
it was punched and stamped without being previously annealed.*

* It has been suggested, that tin might be advantageously employed as an alloy for
Myer coin ; but, by some experiments which I purposely made, I found the fact to be
the reverse; for, when silver was alloyed with the standard proportion of tin, it proved

brittle, and did not ring well; and the same defects preyailed, when an alloy com-
poed of equal parts of tin and copper was employed. -

74 Mr. HatcnerT's Experiments on the various Alloys,

It is therefore certain, that tin, in s8mall quantities, or even
in the proportion of eight grains in the ounce Troy, is not by
