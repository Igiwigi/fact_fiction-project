—No experimental data are given in support of either opinion. S The discordant results furnished by the heat-experiments just described, and the facts
eestablished by investigating the composition of the gun-cotton operated upon, led to the
Sinstitution of a very considerable number of experiments with the view of ascertaining,
if possible, whether the establishment of change in gun-cotton by its exposure to high
temperatures has to be ascribed to the instability of trinitrocellulose itself, or whether
it is to any extent ascribable to the injurious influence of less permanent bodies existing
as impurities in the ordinary product of manufacture. A careful comparative examination was instituted of the effects of exposure, under
equal conditions, to 100® C. upon a number of samples in portions of which the matters
Soluble in ether and alcohol had been determined. One gramme of each sample was
first dried in a water-bath at a temperature of 50?
