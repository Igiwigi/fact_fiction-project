The classical interaction
could consist of an exchange of arms of the string at such meeting points. The problem with this
proposal is that the question whether strings coincide at one point will involve the dependent
degrees of freedom as well. If these are determined by quantum equations (the string- and
superstring constraints in operator form), then it is difficult to see how these interactions can
be seen as classical interactions in the automaton.Â° The difficulty is further exacerbated by the
fact that the procedure is not Lorentz invariant by construction; indeed, making the discretized
cellular automaton Lorentz invariant is rather difficult, and this difficulty shows up when we try
to include the string interactions. This difficulty is also related to the question of background dependence. Our model, as yet,
is assumed to have a flat background.
