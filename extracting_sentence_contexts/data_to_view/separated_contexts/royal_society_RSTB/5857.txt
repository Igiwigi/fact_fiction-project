On the other hand wounds which were more nearly median,
usually led to the development of I,k only, as in Nos. 16, 22, 24 and 25 (see Table II). The explanation of these facts, which are at first surprising, is probably that the space
available for leaf-formation was usually smaller on the anodic side of the wound (see
section 11). For unless I,a arose well before I,, the space available for it was limited
by I,, which lay closer to the anodic side of the wound than to the kathodic side. It
may be noted that in No. 32 in which the wound was approximately median and yet
I,a developed as a leaf as well as I,k, I,a did arise before I,, and I, was unable to prevent
itsdevelopment.
