It will be seen that on 14 of the 75 specimens tested, a figure of 600 Brinell or over,
indicating glass-scratching hardness, is obtained. Quenching thus played a prominent
part in Farapay’s experimental work. Light of these hardened specimens are found
in Groups E.1 and 2, thus pointing to these specimens of specially prepared form being
intended for heat treatment experiments. The hardness figures obtained on these
groups in fact seem to provide some further clue in this connection, although still not
a complete one. Thus it will be seen that it is the first four specimens only of each
group, E.1 and E.2, which are of over 600 hardness. These are the ones having three
nicks cut in them. Nos. 45/H.1-5 and 53/E.2-5, each with two nicks, are of an inter-
mediate hardness, 450 and 460/520 respectively. The remainder, Nos. 46/E.1-6,
47/E.1-7, 48/E.1-8, and 54/E.2-6, 55/H.2-7, 56/E.2-8, 57/H.2-9, 58/H.2-10, 59/E.2-11,
are all of comparatively low hardness not exceeding 250, Here, however, the connection

with the marking ceases, because some of these have two nicks, like Nos. 45/E.1-5
and 53/H.2-5, and some only one,
