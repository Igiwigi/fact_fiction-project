Perhaps the fright might have contributed to ;
have produced ſome of theſe effefts. For my own part, |
my head-ach, which ſeldom leaves me before evening, *
was intirely and immediately removed. A report pre-
vailed, and it was poſitively afferted, that a boy at Roch- :
dale, who had been long deaf, had recovered his hearing ;
at the inſtant of the earthquake; but, upon the moſt
ftri& inquiry, the fact does not appear to be ſufficiently
authenticated. | |
Different people in the ſame rooms were affeQted in
various degrees, and felt the ſhock more or leſs violently. Neither the vibration nor noiſe were perceived by
moſt perſons who were travelling on the roads or walk=-
ing in the ſtreets.
