0°13 x 38
32°2 x 0°98 x 10-8 ~ 19700 Ibs.
The maximum pressure which should be exerted by a perfectly fluid bullet having the
same mass and velocity is

0°35 x (1240)?
= 6 4
aa 6,700 Ibs

The time taken by the bullet to travel its own length is 8°4 x 10-® seconds. Thus
if the bullet were perfectly fluid, the whole momentum should be trapped in a piece
9 inches long, whereas in fact only 86 per cent. is so trapped. The errors inherent
in the method of experiment, which have been discussed in the last section, will all be
less at the lower velocity. On the other hand the rigidity of the bullet will be
relatively more important and probably suffices to account for much of the difference
between the theoretical and observed times of impact.

The 700 feet per second bullets showed a maximum pressure of 5450 lbs., as
compared with 5320 Ibs. calculated. 54% per cent. of the momentum was trapped by
a 9-inch piece. It was not possible to experiment with longer pieces, so that the time
of impact in this case could not be determined.

It should be observed here that just after the piece has been shot off it tends to
pull the rod after it by magnetic attraction, which of course still continues after the
