Only in three dogs in thirty-five (8°5 per cent.) could movement be produced in both
legs—i.¢., sides—by stimulating only one side of the spinal cord. That this double
effect was not due to the direct spreading of the current to the posterior column of
the other side was proved in each case by the fact that application of the electrode
to a point or points nearer the middle line and at the same level produced no
movement whatever. In one of the cases the same double result was obtained from
stimulating one posterior column even when the spinal cord had been split completely
through at the anterior and posterior fissures as far down as three segments below the
point where the cord was excited. In this particular preparation the cord was trans-
versely divided* just above the point first stimulated, and after vertical splitting the
halves were drawn apart, but on then splitting the cord through another segment the
double effect vanished, though the lateral effect remained.
