This approach allows using the VO fractional operator as a
nonlinear switch-like term that determines if existing bonds are broken or new ones are created. While this fractional operator could, potentially, be designed to account for memory effects (as an


example, to track the evolution of the rate of stretch in a bond), in this study we did not account
for it. In fact, we used a steep exponential function to achieve a rapid change of the bond state
(i.e. to achieve either formation or annihilation). We merely note that the VO can also be crafted
to account for an irreversible (permanent) bond annihilation. Such a case was explored in [42] in
the context of classical mechanics, where irreversibility due to plastic deformation was captured
by using direction-dependent terms in the order variation.
