I have since examined the salt, or product, whatever it may be, in the dry state, and under more
favourable cireumstances, and have found it sensitive, though not by any means in a high degree. It exhibits also the absorption bands which seem to run through the salts of peroxide of uranium, In connexion with the insensibility of a solution of nitrate of uranium in ether, it seems interest-
ing to mention a fact which I have since observed, namely, that the sensibility of a solution of
nitrate of uranium in water is destroyed by the addition of a little alcohol. Note J. Art. 217.
