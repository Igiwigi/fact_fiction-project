protocerebral mesoderm. This together with the fact that no neuromere is present,
leads one naturally to the conclusion that there is no segmental significance to be
attached to the at first bifid epipharynx. I contend therefore that the embryology of
Pieris fully substantiates the orthodox conception of the six-segmented constitution
of the insect head. Head segmentation is notoriously a subject beset with many pitfalls to the embryo-
logist, especially in studies of the more specialised groups of insects.
