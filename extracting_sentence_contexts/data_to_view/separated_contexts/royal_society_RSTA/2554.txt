It was not until 1920 that Gauss’ proof was completed.’


e Let me quote several momentous statements chosen at random from the 1821 Cours
d’analyse by Cauchy [8], where he ‘set the foundation of rigour’ for modern Analysis:
‘Each continuous function is differentiable almost everywhere’, ‘The sum of a convergent
series of continuous functions is itself continuous’, ‘A function of several variables,
continuous in each variable is continuous’, ‘Any essential singularity is a pole’. Browsing this textbook for a few minutes, you will easily find dozens of similar
statements, ‘accompanied by complete and detailed proofs.’ (Of course, I know Lakatos’s
objections [9] that Cauchy made no mistakes, but was arguing in terms of non-standard
Analysis. Iam not convinced, since most early authors praise Cauchy precisely for getting
rid of infinitesimals.)

In fact, Cauchy was notorious for making really bad mistakes (as Abel sarcastically puts it: ‘It
appears to me that Cauchy’s theorems suffer exceptions’). Especially in Algebra, he made quite
outrageous claims, accompanied by several dozen pages of computational proofs by obfuscation. We skip the famous Lamé-Cauchy case, where Cauchy persisted in publishing his ‘proof’
of the unique factorization for cyclotomic integers long after being confronted by Kummer’s
counterexamples [10].
