The septum lucidum was uninjured. The rest of the brain was intact. An analysis of these three experiments elicits, with individual differences, certain
common and fundamental facts. They show conclusively that an animal deprived of
its frontal lobes retains all its powers of voluntary motion unimpaired, and that it con-
tinnes to see, hear, smell, and taste, and to perceive and localize tactile impressions as
before. It retains its instincts of self-preservation, retains its appetites, and continues
to seek its food.
