But, to return
from this digression. Having found that the intensity of the calorific rays emitted
by a hot body, at any given temperature, depends much on the
surface of such body,â€”that a polished metallic surface, for in-
stance, throws off much fewer rays than the same surface, at
the same temperature, would emit, if painted, or blackened in
the smoke of a lamp or candle, I was desirous of finding out,
whether the frigorific rays from cold bodies are affected in the
same manner, by the same means, and in the same degree. It was to ascertain that point, that the experiment No. 20 was
made: and, although the result of that experiment afforded
abundant reason to conclude, that those substances which, when
hot, throw off calorific rays in the greatest abundance, actually
throw off great quantities of frigorific rays, when they are cold;
yet, as the relative quantities of these rays could not be exactly
determined by that experiment, in order to ascertain s0 import
ant a fact, I had recourse to the following simple contrivance. Exper. No. 24.
