In many cases a merocyte may be seen
to divide before emerging from the yolk (figs. 53, 57, 63). Stages in the origin of the
second blastomere from the yolk have evidently been observed by Lana, who regarded,

derm ; that this is not so is evident from the fact that it does not coincide in position
with the point of completion of the blastoderm in this form or any other examined. Fig. 69 shows the blastopore which becomes, later, closed by an emerging merocyte
(figs.
