influence of granular and super-granular flows. If the coronal field lines remained anchored to the
same pair of footpoints over days or weeks, the coronal magnetic field would appear extremely
tangled and complex. The coronal field outlined in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images shows
little sign of such tangling—in fact, it appears smooth enough to have been ‘combed’. While it
is still possible that complex tangling occurs at length scales below our present resolution [1],
footpoint motions occur over all length scales and presumably so should the tangling. There
is little evidence for it on the largest scales, which appear increasingly well fitted by potential
fields over time [2]. This fact gives a clear indication that coronal field lines are constantly being
reconnected: uprooted from one footpoint and reattached to another.

Based on this reasoning, we propose that magnetic field lines in a given portion of the corona
are undergoing topological change at some rate &. Two questions are raised by this proposition:
Firstly, how is topological change related to heating? Secondly, what fraction of overall coronal
heating can be attributed to topological change? We address these two questions in the following. : =

2. Heating from magnetic reconnection 1

To illustrate how the topological change of magnetic field lines could result in plasma heating, we 2S
consider a simplified, two-dimensional model of flux emergence sketched in figure 1. In the initial 7
state, figure 1a, a small bipole, P2-N2, sits beneath a larger, existing bipole P1-N1, and the coronal Dy
