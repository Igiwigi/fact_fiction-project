The difficulty of the first alternative, if it be a difficulty, is that the lower portion
of the upper intervertebral muscle, as a necessary consequence of its position relative
to the joint, would function as a flexor, the upper portion as an extensor. And
further, Ophiarachna is regarded as a high type. These points must remain for the time matters of speculation, Whichever view
we take, the important fact remains that there is nothing in the structure of
Onychaster to prevent our regarding it or some Onychaster-like form as standing
in the direct line of descent of modern Ophiurids. Through the study of Onychaster
we are able to interpret the joint of modern forms as a derivative of a primitive
pair of vertical ridges, and, further, a pair of ridges is just what would result from
the increase in vertical extent of a plate-like vertebra in which the articulation is
made by means of a pair of pegs—a condition which we find foreshadowed if not
