highlight particular considerations for the procurement problem under study.

SA is in fact an adaptation of the well-known Metropolis—Hastings algorithm (see [22] and
references therein). That is, its goal is to obtain a sequence of random samples from a probability
distribution from which direct sampling is computationally challenging. The particular idea in
SA is that the mode(s) of these distributions are the minimizer(s) of the objective function f, and
hence the resulting samples will tend to be located in parts of the parameter space which are
approximately optimal.

Note from (3.2) that a proposed move to a smaller f value is always accepted. A proposed
move to a larger f value, by contrast, is accepted with a probability which depends on T; (and
which converges to zero as Tj | 0). The constants T; are chosen to decrease to 0 at an appropriate
speed. In fact, T, may be called the temperature at time k and the name ‘simulated annealing’ arises
from an analogy between the algorithm and the controlled cooling used in the annealing process
in metallurgy.


There are two main questions of interest regarding SA:

(i) Does the Markov chain (%;)x<j converge to an optimal parameter 6*?
(ii) How quickly does this convergence take place?

The first question of convergence can be answered theoretically in certain specific cases. The
papers [23,24] present sufficient conditions under which SA converges on a finite parameter
space. There are also results about convergence in the case of a continuous parameter space [25]. In
