£2 Error of mean — 01083 — 00380

The $tation near the observatory, though apparently not free from disturbing
influences, gives from the corrected values a result almost identical with the computed
quantity, since it is within the range of its probable error, whilst the result, for the
observatory itself is more than half a degree in excess. This difference of Declination,

combined with the fact that the errors of the observed Dip at both stations are positi!
and their errors of H. F. both negative, might justify the assumption that the disturbi
cause is situated at no great distance from the observatory, and probably at some depth
and to the W. of the N. meridian. The probable errors of the observed Dip and H. PF.
at the observatory were not very large, being respectively +7' 15” and —0-0070. It may be of advantage, in particular for the discussion of the errors of the Total
Force, to present here in a tabular form a geological description of the stations of
observation.
