and how much cuticular. In the following instance the cuticular transpiration was
practically nl and a very minute amount of stomatal transpiration was demonstrable.

MR. FRANCIS DARWIN ON STOMATA, 541

Two ivy leaves were gathered and allowed to wither for 19 hours, Yucca
hygroseopes were then luted with wax on to the upper and lower surface, when
movement of the index occurred only on the lower side and was doubtless a stomatal
effect. This fact would probably have been demonstrated by the cobalt test or by
weighing, but not by means of the horn hygroscope. It is worth pointing out that the
cobalt test is practically applied by Srant in two ways, zc, when the leaf is merely
placed between glass plates, and an effect is looked for in one or two minutes, and
secondly when the sensitive paper is covered by a small vessel luted on to the leaf.
These two methods roughly correspond in effectiveness to the horn and Yucca hygro-
geopes ; but the horn hygroscope is, I think, more sensitive than the cobalt method.*
Thus a leaf of a garden Chrysanthemum gave on cobalt-paper a red print of part of
fhe leaf while the rest remained blue ; with the horn hygroscope the blue parts = 7,

e pink 13, that is to say, the horn hygroscope shows transpiration in the blue part
a the leaf where none is shown by the cobalt. All methods must finally be tested by
Seighing. Thus if a leaf is coated with wax on its stomatal surface, weighing will give
