place with the formation of the blastodermic vesicle and development of the yolk sac
are similar to those that occur in Monotremata at a corresponding age. The albumen
soon disappears, and the vitelline membrane comes to lie close to the shell. No
sooner is the albumen layer formed than it begins to pass through the vitelline mem-
brane to nourish the ovum, and after the albumen layer has disappeared another
layer has become very conspicuous inside the vitelline membrane. ‘This layer is a
coagulum formed from nutritive fluid on its way to feed the developing embryo, and
shows its fluid nature, in the same way as pointed out in Monotremata, by passing
into the open portion of the blastopore, and between the cells of the blastoderm.
The distinction between the vitelline membrane, now considerably increased in thick-
ness, and this coagulum is difficult to trace all round the ovum.

This fact has led Se_enKa to describe the vitelline membrane as disappearing at an
early stage, and the albumen as being directly continuous in development with the
coagulum, The membrane, composed of the shell and the vitelline membrane, persists
up to the stage when the blastodermic vesicle becomes fixed to the walls of the uterus.
It is possible that it may persist for a longer period over the non-vascular unattached
area of the yolk sac and allantois (vide my paper, ‘ Quart. Journ. Microsc. Sci.,’ 1884),
The blastodermic vesicle enclosed in the membrane just described, measuring 15 mm.
in diameter, floats freely in the uterus, and is exactly comparable to the laid egg of
Monotremes. I have not found any trace of villi on the surface of the shell in
Marsupials.
