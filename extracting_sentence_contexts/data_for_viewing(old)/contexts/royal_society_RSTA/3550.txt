between an in situ heating experiment (where a single precipitate is observed at a local approach)
and DSC cycling (a large number of precipitates involved in a global approach). By TEM, the
beginning of the dissolution process is observed at temperatures lower (figure 2a) than that
indicated by the heating rate curve in figure 2c at a global scale. However, images show that
the hydride main volume dissolves in the temperature range of figure 2c. Similar results were
obtained by in situ TEM performed in zircaloy-4 samples richer in H, where only FCC 5-hydride
precipitates were observed. This indicates a good agreement between global measurements (DSC)
and in situ TEM observations at a local scale.

The decrease in concentration of hydrogen atoms available to precipitate can explain the
difference in energy between dissolution and precipitation after a thermal cycling for a global
approach. Moreover, the accumulated effect of multiple misfit dislocations depinning after a large
number of cycles can lead to the precipitation of hydrogen-poor hydride phases. In fact, the
simultaneous presence of the initial hydrogen-rich phase (the FCC d-hydride) and a hydrogen-
poor phase (the y-FCT) was observed at the hydride-substrate interface after cycling, as shown
in figure 3. The re-precipitation of the 5-hydride after 20 thermal cycles is still highly coherent
