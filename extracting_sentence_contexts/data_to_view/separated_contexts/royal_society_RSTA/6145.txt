A similar distinction
was already present in the work of Mark Bedau, who identified two hallmarks of emergence

where phenomena are either (i) somehow constituted by, and generated from, underlying [2
processes; or (ii) somehow autonomous from underlying processes [161]. The existence of >
strongly emergent phenomena would require new fundamental laws of nature for their : 8
explanation. In fact, it is argued that only the weak emergence is scientifically relevant, consistent a
with materialism and metaphysically innocent to provide a ground for a science of complexity : <
[161]. The possibility that a simple initial configuration might evolve into unexpected patterns 3
allows us to overcome the reductionist approaches while preserving the possibility for rich :3
phenomena at distinct levels of explanation and, consequently, an ultimately physicalist picture D8
of the world [160]. We capitalize on these arguments to rationalize an operational definition. : s

Let a system S be made up of a finite number of many units u that interact among them :3
