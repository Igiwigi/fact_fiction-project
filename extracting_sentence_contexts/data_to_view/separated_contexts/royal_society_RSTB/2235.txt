In the Dog I have sometimes failed to find any motor

Sroot or set of motor roots which gives flexion at the knee, extension always pre-

Sdominating ; yet flexion at knee is easily obtained in the dog as a reflex from almost

Suny nerve in the whole limb, or by a stimulation of almost any part of the skin of

sithe limb, as was noted by FreusBere,* in his well-known account of reflexes obtain-

‘Gable from the lumbo-sacral cord of the dog. Again: the blow on the tendo patelle

‘awhich evokes the direct (WxstPHat,t Waxtert) spasm of vastus medialis and

rureus§ called “ knee-jerk,” fails to elicit any true reflex contraction of those muscles,

-zalthough frequently evoking a true réflex contraction of the hamstring muscles,

which, as Lomparp]| has shown, succeeds the direct extensor spasm. That this

hamstring contraction is a true reflex can hardly be doubted, in view of the extreme

Sfacility with which the hamstrings are reflexly excited, and also in view of a fact I

Ehave often seen, that the hamstring contraction evoked by the tendon tap occurs

"peven when the dissected hamstrings, altogether freed at their lower ends, are lying

Slack, and when their own afferent roots have been cut through. 3 Again, the movement evoked by a lower sacral or coccygeal afferent root is often

San abduction of tail in absolutely the reverse direction of that given by excitation of
the corresponding motor root.
