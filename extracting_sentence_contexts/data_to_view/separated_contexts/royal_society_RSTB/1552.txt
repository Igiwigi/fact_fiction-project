Consequently the movements of the tripus in Auchenipterus
= will not depend on a normal articulation, bit solely on the flexibility and elasticity of
& its peculiar articular process. ‘Then again, in most Siluride with normal bladders, it is
EI the radial fines of the tripus which cause that ossicle to move inwards towards the
: complex centrum when the lateral distension of the anterior chamber has ceased to
i separate the two, but in Auchenipterus the function of the radial tibres, which, from
their relatively feeble development and nearly straight antero-posterior course, Is
© possibly less efficient than in other Siluroids, must be powerfully supplemented by
the elasticity of the articular process. As in all probability the tripus is to be
regarded as the modified transverse process of the third vertebra it will at once be
obvious that if presents a striking resemblance to the corresponding process of the
fonrth vertebra, In each case there is a flexible and elastic root directly coutinaous
with the neural arch of its vertebra and in distal continuity with a movable plate
of bone—the body of the tripus in the one cnse and the oval plate of the “ elastic-
spring” apparatus in the other. The fact may also be recalled that as regards the

thinness of its root and the curious obliquity of its origin from the neural arch the

transyerse process of the fifth vertebra, although neither Hexible nor elastic, strongly
resembles the two preceding processes. In reference to the movements of the tripus if seems to us not improbable that the
relation of its erescentic process to the slit-like groove between the oval plate and the
elastic root of the transverse process of the fourth vertebra must also, to some extent,
limit and control the lateral motion of that ossicle, even if it does not altogether
prevent the possibility of any such movement, when the protractor musele is quiescent
and the plates are not pulled outwards and upwards.
