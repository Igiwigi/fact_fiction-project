In this respect, therefore, the African
elephant seems to differ from the Indian. At other times of year activity of the temporal
gland was less general, and the observation of peak activity of the gland at the time of year
when mating is thought to be most frequent suggests that the two are indeed related, as has
been generally supposed. It must be concluded that beyond the fact that mating does occur at all times of year
and is probably more frequent during the dry season, there is a dearth of reliable informa-
tion about the breeding habits of the African elephant, or, for that matter, of the Indian
species in the wild. It is evident that the movements of elephants are governed to some
extent by food and water requirements, but to what extent they are related to breeding
habits, if at all, is uncertain. Continuous observation of a group of elephants would perhaps
be the ideal way of solving such problems, and if it were feasible it would certainly yield
a great deal of interesting information.
