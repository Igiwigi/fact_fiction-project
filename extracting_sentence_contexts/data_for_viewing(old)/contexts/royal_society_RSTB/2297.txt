of the threads, except that there is not that marked difference which we had pre-
viously observed between the lower and upper sides of the cotyledon. This is
largely due to the growth in length which the cotyledon has undergone, which causes
the wall to become thinner and the thread groups to be separated. It is also possible
that in the process of thickening of the hypodermal cells, and during the formation
of the intercellular spaces, some thread areas may have been obliterated.

In the palisade tissue the principal change is the separation of the cells from one
another to form the plates of tissue already mentioned,* and the ease with which the
walls concerned in the separation part from one another, notwithstanding the fact
that they are well connected by threads, is certainly most striking. The obliteration
of the threads which follows this separation takes place very quickly, and there
appears to be no communication between the intercellular spaces and the cell content,
but whether the pores in the walls persist, or whether they become filled by mucilage
or cellulose, cannot be observed, since the threads at this stage no longer stain. The
free surfaces of the halved walls are, however, covered by a thin, darkly staining
euticularized layer, which clothes and protects the newly exposed membrane (fig. 7,
Plate 31).

The tissues of the pericycle undergo a good deal ot modification ; a large number
of cells becoming lignified, leaving those with unaltered cellulose walls irregularly
scattered amongst them, and it was observed that the changes associated with ligni-
