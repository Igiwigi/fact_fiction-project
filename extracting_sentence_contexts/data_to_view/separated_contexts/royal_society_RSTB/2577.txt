Further, the mesenteries pass continuously over the synapticular wall into the
“ Randplatte,” or edge-zone, of the polyp. Turbinaria, on the other hand, at once distinguishes itself in the fact that, at
the peripheral portion of each polyp where mural invaginations are formed, they
form contemporaneously with or even prior to the invaginations in which septa are
produced. This fact I have deduced from a series of sections. In all types men-
tioned above, the synapticule form subsequently to the septa, and microscopic
sections show that the calcareous deposit around the septal centres of calcification
serves as the starting-point of a synapticula, the prop on which the mesenterial
body-wall temporarily supports itself in the course of its further invagination. In
the converse case represented by Turbinaria, the sections show a mural ring of
calcification centres around the polyp, from which at certain points processes grow
out and serve in their turn as the starting-points of septa.
