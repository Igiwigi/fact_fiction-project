GLEs) only on occasion. Thereby, although all GLEs are accompanied by major SEP events at
lower energy, a considerable number of SEP events which can lead to a serious radiation risk are
not accompanied by a GLE [87]. This highlights the fact that in the future an integration of the
available forecasting tools from low-energy SEPs to relativistic GLEs should be made possible. Moreover, multi-spacecraft observations of SEPs, combined with the growing need for human
exploration in space,> gave ground to efforts for the accurate quantification and prediction of the
radiation environment in other planets (e.g. Mars) [84], and within the IP space, in general [88].
