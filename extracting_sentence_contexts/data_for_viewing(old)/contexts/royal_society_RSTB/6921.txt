In a later stage of pregnancy, about half-term, the mean diameter of the corpus
luteum is 14mm. The central cavity is practically obliterated, and the peripheral cells
are similar to those just described. The more central cells are, however, smaller and
rather lenticular in shape, measuring only 30-40, in mean diameter. The characters
of their nuclei and contents appear to be unaltered (fig. 66, Plate 9).

The corpus luteum in a late pregnancy, nearly at full term, is 9mm. in mean
diameter. Many of the luteal cells are somewhat shrunken, and there is a considerable
degree of proliferation of connective tissue cells filling the spaces between them. The
nuclei have undergone no change (fig. 67, Plate 9).

In the early stages of lactation no further degenerative changes are to be found; in
fact the corpus luteum often presents a surprisingly healthy appearance (fig. 68,
Plate 9). As lactation progresses the central part of the corpus luteum first shows signs
of decreasing activity. Here the cells are shrunken to a mean diameter of 20, or less,
and become comparatively widely scattered in a background of connective tissue. At
the same time the peripheral parts of the corpus luteum remain functional in appear-
ance. As lactation proceeds these changes become progressive, and at the end of
lactation the luteal cells are only 15-204 in mean diameter, and are widely separated
by connective tissue. At the same time their contents become darker, both in their
staining reaction, and in the tint that they impart to the corpus luteum when viewed
by the naked eye (fig. 69, Plate 10).

After weaning the process of regression continues, but at a slow rate. The luteal cells
gradually shrink in size and decrease in number, while the proportion of connective
