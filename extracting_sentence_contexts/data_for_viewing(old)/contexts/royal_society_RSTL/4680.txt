vertically. It would have been almost impossible, however, to obtain slabs of any con-
siderable extent from many of the harder and more intractable rocks on which I have
experimented. But the fact is, that no great accuracy is required in experiments of
this nature ; for if the conductive power of any piece of rock were determined with the
ultimate degree of accuracy, it would only tell us approximately, and not, accurately, the
conductive power of another piece of rock of the same kind, however close might be their
resemblance in mineral structure; s0 that it must be always necessary, when the con-
ductive power of any proposed substance is required with great accuracy, to determine
that power by direct experiments on the substance itself. I have endeayoured, however,
to take every precaution necessary to secure all the accuracy required with reference to
my more immediate objects in these researches.

In order that the error resulting from the observations of temperatures may be as
«mall as possible, it is manifestly desirable that ?,—7 and #, —f, should both be as large
as possible, and not very different in magnitude. But this condition, if the conductive
