The preceding comparisons relate to Q(t) which, as defined by equation (52), is the inte-
grated pressure gradient over the width of the slit. It is of interest to examine, therefore,
whether the same degree of agreement exists for individual values of the pressure gradient
at specific points in the slit. For this purpose we can note first that for incompressible flow,
as assumed in the asymptotic solution, the pressure gradient through the slit is given by

Q(2)

for any time ¢. This equation corresponds to a constant shape for the distribution of y over
the slit, whereas in the pulse problem the distribution of ¥ will undoubtedly vary with time.
However, for the particular instant ¢ = 1, it is easy to show from equations (49) and (50)
that + is in fact also given in the pulse problem by equation (96) but with Q(t) = 1.

Hence at the instant ¢=1 the percentage agreement between exact and asymptotic
solutions is the same for all individual values of y as for Q(t), namely, about 3%. Since
thereafter the values for Q(é) in table 7 show a general increase of agreement with increasing

time, it seems reasonable to expect a similar trend for individual values of the pressure
gradient y in the slit. As a check, calculations have been carried out for time ¢ = 2 and are
