The
only phenomenon at all comparable with it is the conversion of a haploid mycelium of
the basidiomycete, Coprinus lagopus, into the diploid state in the presence of diploid
hyphe of the same fungus, as described by BuLLEr (1931). In both processes a minute
fragment of one mycelium is sufficient to change a large growth of the other; the
converted mycelium assumes the character of the one responsible for the change ; the
converting influence spreads very quickly and at approximately equal rates in both
(20-04 per minute in Coprinus lagopus and 17-5 uw per minute through young DH,, if
the course taken is assumed to be straight) ; and young mycelium responds more readily
than the old. These similarities in experimental facts suggest a correspondence in the
mechanism of the two conversions. BULLER (1931) puts forward the theory, partly based
on the results of LEnrELpt’s (1923) cytological work with T'yphula erythropus, that when
a diploid mycelium of Coprinus lagopus comes in contact with a haploid, fusion occurs
and a nucleus of the opposite sex from that of the haploid nuclei passes from the diploid
to the haploid, becomes associated with a nucleus of the latter and thus “ diploidizes ”
one cell. The “ stranger ” nucleus then divides.
