rative masses within, should be particularly noticed. Tt will be seen to be placed, by
Several segments, behind these masses. This thickened ring is bounded by sharp borders
before and behind. It involves six or eight annuli of the integuments. On its abdo-
minal surface two suctorial cups are observable. It is most certain that these cups are
not perforated at the bottom ; they cannot therefore be, as supposed by some anatomists,
the outlets of certain tubes within *#. They are in truth designed only to hold the indi-
vidual in apposition during the generative congress. That there is no organic connexion
between these cups and the reproductive masses, may be further proved by carefully
examining (internally) (previously dissecting away the intestine) the condition of the
ciliated tubes in the intervening segments. They are not developed like those in the
generative segments; they belong to the class of the © ordinary” segmental organs.
These intervening annuli are not crossed in this worm, as described and figured by
HrrNG in Tambricus agricola, by the vasa deferentia and oviducts. In fact they are
altogether excluded from, and beyond the limits of the reproductive segments.

Now, in studying the visceral contents of each ring within the limits of the generative
region, it will be best to proceed from behind forwards.

The dissector thus comes first upon the largest and most prominent (fig. 6, #, 7) of all
the generative masses. They are testes. This can only be proved by the examination
of the products contained within them, under the microscope. They have a white.
glittering, oily colour. In figure they are intestiform, the coils, of which there are two
or three, being tied together by means of a mesentery. The capsule consists of a proper
membranous tunic, and is seen to be thinly supplied with vessels when carefully floated
and suspended in water ; these two testicular masses, which lie across and fill up several
