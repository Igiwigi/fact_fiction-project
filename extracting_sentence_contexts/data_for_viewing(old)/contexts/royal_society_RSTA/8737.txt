in which neither the electric nor magnetic energy contributes an explicit term. This
is the first definite indication we have that the modified function with which we may
operate to find the equations of motion of the electric and material elements is
explicitly independent of the expression for the energy in the ethereal field. We
may, in fact, see that, just as in the dynamical problem examined above, the whole
circumstances of the motion in the real co-ordinates of the system can be derived by
the variational principle, using the integral .

just as we used the Hamiltonian integral, taking in it E, A,, As, ¢ as functions of’ the
time and space co-ordinates only. It is of course possible to establish this directly,
for it is easily verified that the difference between the integrand just employed and
the previous one, viz.,
