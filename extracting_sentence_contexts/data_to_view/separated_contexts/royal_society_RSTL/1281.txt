great an
extent. The different phenomena presented by the processes of dis-
tillation. in different metallic tubes, may lead to new explana-
tions of this intricate subject, and though the facts cannot be
easily accounted for, except on the supposition that nitrogene
is an oxide, yet till the proportions and weights are distinctly
ascertained, the inquiry cannot. be considered as far advanced,
for in an experiment, in which the processes are 80 compli-
cated and delicate, and in which the data are. 80 numerous, it
is not easy to be satisfied that every source of error has been
avoided, and that every circumstance has been examined-and
reasoned upon.
