6. Conclusion

Despite using the very simple model of particle interactions, our DEM simulations have provided
a surprisingly wide range of fracturing patterns occurring in tensional loading regime. Some
of the observed features were already expected, as they are known from the classical fracture
mechanics. Some others were unexpected.


Considering the posed question as to whether the accumulated internal energy of the sample
prior to fracturing is the elastic energy of the deformed sample or a kinetic energy of moving
particles, we have found that most of the energy is transferred to the sample by its quasi-static
deformation. Only in the case of very fragile materials is the mechanism of energy transfer by
excitation of particle movements efficient. It follows from the simple fact that samples built of
such materials cannot withstand any larger deformation.

The internal energy of the sample built up during the loading stage was released twofold.
In many cases, when particle bonds exhibited some flexibility, it converted directly to a single
dynamic fracture or a multi-fracture system. Sometimes this fragmentation was slowed down at
a later stage of evolution by a collision of separate cracks. In such cases, an insufficient amount of
energy stored in samples resulted in the creation of low velocity (distressed) barriers prohibiting
dynamic fracturing and leading to development of fibre-like structures which slowly break down.
One interesting feature of such kind of cracking was the occurrence of ‘aftershocks’—episodes of
sudden release of elastic energy by coherent breaking of a larger group of localized bonds. We
have also noted that fracture development quickly released the accumulated elastic energy in a
large volume of the sample built of this type of material.
