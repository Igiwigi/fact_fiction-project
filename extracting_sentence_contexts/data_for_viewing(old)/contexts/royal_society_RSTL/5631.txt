density at 4* C. is not without its influence on the amount of sensitiveness ; the change
of refractive index between 10® and 5® being 00002, while that between 5* and 0? is
only 00001. This fact, however, will come out more plainly on a reference to the
following Table, which represents the refractive indices of one of the series of observa-
tions made with especial view to this point. The indices are calculated to five places
of decimals.
