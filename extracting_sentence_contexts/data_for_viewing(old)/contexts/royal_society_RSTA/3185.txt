(Inhom. non-ex., Hom. ex., Eck. stab.)
— stripes exist and are Eckhaus unstable, no half-stripes exist
(Hom. ex., Eck. unst.)
— no stripes exist (Non-ex.).

Note that half-stripes selected by the jump-type inhomogeneity have wavenumbers that are
bounded away from the Eckhaus instability, but overlap significantly with the zigzag-unstable
region.


(c) Growing domains and zigzag selection

The fact that the minimum selected wavenumber kmin is zigzag unstable has dramatic
consequences for pattern selection. However, the effects are not immediately visible in
simulations because the system does not select a unique wavenumber. In particular, we would
need to impose a phase condition 6 ~ 1/2 to select kmin. This would represent an additional,
external mechanism for selection. Instead, we pose our problem in the context of slowly growing
domains and apply theory from [24]. In the second part of this section, we illustrate the results
with direct numerical simulations that indicate that the system self-selects a zigzag pattern.
Systems with slowly growing domains have been observed to exhibit pattern selection, e.g. in
developing organisms in biology [2]. In [24], several model equations similar to ours are examined
with a moving parameter jump m(x—cf) or on a linearly growing domain with boundary :
conditions. The main result is that the selected wavenumber k depends on the speed c according to :3
