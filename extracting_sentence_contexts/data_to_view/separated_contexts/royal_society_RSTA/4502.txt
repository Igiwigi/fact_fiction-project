Merchants of Doubt

1. Introduction: doubt as an academic problem

In the 1950s, the tobacco industry established a programme to defend its product against the :
scientific evidence of its harms. Working with the public relations firm Hill and Knowlton, : =
industry executives realized that they could compete with the body of fact that was emerging 5
from scientific research by insisting that the science was not yet settled—in effect, by putting ‘the 1B
body of fact’ in scare quotes—and so it would be wrong, or at least premature, to restrict customer : wu
choice by banning their product or even discouraging its use. 78
Scholars including Allan Brandt, Robert Proctor, Sharon Eubanks, Stanton Glantz and Lisa : w
Bero have documented the tortuous history of tobacco industry doubt-mongering, both as a DN
commercial art form and as a criminal enterprise [2-5]. These scholars have shown that, over =
more than half a century, the tobacco industry deliberately delayed and diluted efforts to [&
control tobacco use and protect public health by raising doubts about the biomedical science .
that demonstrates its harms (harms that include diverse cancers, heart disease, various forms
of respiratory illness, sudden infant death syndrome and many other forms of mortality and
morbidity). Markowitz & Rosner [6,7] have shown how similar strategies and tactics were used
over many decades by the vinyl chloride and lead paint industries.
