A, the transposed matrix of

substitution for the further variables is

9Q(2—Y)(2+Y)Q-!;
and compounding this with the matrix Q of the bipartite and the matrix
Q"(2—Y)(2+Y)"'Q
= of substitution for the nearer variables, the theorem will be verified if the result is equal
3 to the matrix Q of the bipartite, that is, we ought to have
Q(2—Y)"(2+Y)022(2—Y)(2+Y)"'2=0,
: or what is the same thing,
Q(2—Y)-(2+Y)2-(2—Y)(2+Y)"'2=9;
this 1s successively reducible to
(2+Y)2=(2—Y) =(2—Y)02-(2+Y)
N"(2+Y)2"(2—Y)=N"(2—Y)2"(2+Y)
(1+2”"Y(1—2"Y) =(1—-2"'Y)(1+97Y),

which is a mere identity, and the theorem is thus shown to be true.

then

12. It is to be observed that in the general theorem the transformations or matrices
of substitution for the two sets of variables respectively are not identical, but it may be
required that this shall be 80. Consider first the case where the matrix Q is symmetrical,
the necessary condition is that the matrix Y shall be skew symmetrical ; in fact we have
then

tr. Q=Q, tr. Y=—Y,
and the transformations become
(z, y, 2)=(2"(2=Y(Q+Y)"'QXT, Yp 2),
(x, y. 1)=(2"(2—Y(Q2+Y)"'QFx,, I 4).
