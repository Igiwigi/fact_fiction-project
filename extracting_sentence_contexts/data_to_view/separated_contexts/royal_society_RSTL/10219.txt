The accompanying
Table IX. shows the variations of E.M.F. of CLark No. 6 on April 28, when very
\rudely treated. The other connexions remaining as usual, the poles of the cell were
Joined through a resistance-box, by means of which the cell could be short circuited
with any external resistance from 0 to infinity. The numbers entered (such as 4994)
are proportional to the difference of potential between the poles, being in fact the
resistance between the points of derivation on the LECLANCHE circuit. Tt will be
8een that in the course of a quarter of an hour the cell recovers, to within a few ten-
thousandths of its value, from the effects of being short cireuited for several minutes
through such resistances as 1000 ohms. From the electromotive forces during the
Short circuiting it appears that the internal resistance is high, nearly as much as 300
Phms.
5 The manner in which the CLARK cells have borne the tests applied to them justifies
»he hope that they may be found generally available as standards of E.M.F.
