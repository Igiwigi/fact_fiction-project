No advance which involved
exposure to rough treatment by waves or adversaries was possible for an organism
endowed with so mechanically unsound a fabric. In ambulacral structure, as in most other morphological features, the Cidaridze
have maintained that conservatism of type that characterises the root-stocks of most

classes of animals; and this fact alone is sufficient reason for the reference of all more
elaborate developments back to the Cidaroid ambulacrum as a starting-point. (e) The Diademoida. *

The non-Cidaroid Euechinoidea Regularia comprise a large and varied series of
forms which have been, on the whole, markedly progressive in evolution from their
inception in Triassic times to the present day.‚Äù
