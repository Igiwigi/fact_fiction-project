The lower mean sea level measured west of the La Hague Cape (that could be called ‘Goury
hole’) must be detailed to confirm differences between the measurements and simulation and the
proposed explanation that involves the mean current facing the La Hague Cape. The observations also provide the opportunity to better account for the bottom friction effect. In fact, in MARS this parameter is represented by the roughness height z0 with the formulation
of Soulsby (1995). z0 is a calibration parameter which is set constant everywhere in MARS2D
(0.0035 m). This parametrization could definitely be improved by adjusting this parameter
with the real space-dependent bottom friction effect. A better representation of this parameter
governs the reliability of the simulated hydrodynamics.
