It is well known that it is almost impossible to entirely get rid of the
last traces of hydrogen from a vacuum tube. This view is confirmed by the effect of nitric acid on the negative leak, for nitric
acid oxidises hydrogen. It is also in agreement with the fact that the negative leak
in air at low pressures falls off during long-continued heating of the wire. The rate
at which the leak falls off diminishes as the leak gets smaller, so that with wires well
cleaned with nitric acid the rate of fall is not very great. Platinum wires not specially cleaned evolve gas when heated in a vacuum, and
since hydrogen is the only gas which platinum is known to occlude in any quantity,

athis gas is no doubt hydrogen. _ It is practically impossible to get rid of this evolu-
â€œtion of gas merely by long continued heating and pumping out.
