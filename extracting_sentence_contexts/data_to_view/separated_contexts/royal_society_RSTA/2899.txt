It can

be proved in a similar manner that ¢(s) vanishes everywhere in the interval (8, b). Finally, we can show that, at points of the open interval («, 8) which do not belong

to &, both 0(s) and $(s) vanish. In fact, if a, is any one of these points, there are

clearly points of % both on its right and on its left. The argument we have just
employed will then establish that, by reason of the former, (a) is zero, and that,
by reason of the latter, # (a) is zero. §16.
