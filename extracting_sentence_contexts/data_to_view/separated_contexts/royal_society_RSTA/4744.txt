This issue is not a ‘mere’ proceedings, though, but also contains a number of
contributions by researchers who were not present at the workshop. Calmet [1] considers a potential energy dependence of Planck’s constant f and the
corresponding modified quantization rules from a phenomenological point of view. The fact that
Newton’s ‘constant’ Gx is energy-dependent and becomes renormalized (in a tentative quantum
theory of the gravitational interaction) suggests considering a potential energy dependence also
of h. It turns out that at low energy of ca 100 MeV, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon
puts a rather strict limit on the energy dependence of Planck’s constant, while arguments from
inflation show that also at very high energies of ca 10!° GeV, h must be non-zero. Cruz Morales & Zilber [2] present progress towards a reformulation of key aspects of quantum
mechanics using model theory.
