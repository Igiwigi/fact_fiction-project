de Kleyn rule with respect to concomitant flexion or extension of the limbs also
invariably obtains.


ACTION OF THE UTRICULAR MACUL 245

In making this enumeration we have concentrated rather on the effect upon
the axial skeleton, ignoring the occurrence of all minor differences in position
of the individual limbs. One reason why it is incumbent to single out these attitudes
as entities (even though the two asymmetrical forms often combine one with another)
is that it is characteristic of horizontal canal stimulation to induce lateral curve and
of asymmetrical vertical canal stimulation to induce spinal torque. Of special
interest is the fact that any sideward lean of the head (relative to the plane of the
substratum) invariably involves spinal torque.

Destruction of Both Labyrinths

Observers have vied with each other in attempting to describe the disabilities of
movement associated with this operation in the frog. From our present point of
view, the outstanding fact is that its ability to hold any stationary posture is
untouched.* Manipulate the animal into any attitude within the range of ranine
accomplishment. Having posed it to satisfaction, leave it alone. The frog of itself
holds and may long continue to hold the imposed attitude. Whatever be the
role of the labyrinths during movement, it is plain that they are not necessary
for maintenance of a given posture. Basing our deductions upon the work
