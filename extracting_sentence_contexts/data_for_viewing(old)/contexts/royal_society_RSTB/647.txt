sides. The effect of division of the seventh root resulted in a more extensive paresis,
as it was evident that besides the slight tendency for the elbow to rotate away from
the trunk on that side, there was some interference with the motor power of the
lower segments of the limb, which made the lameness more noticeable than in the
last instance. The most pronounced effect was that which followed division of the
eighth cervical root, which is considerably the largest which enters into the formation
of the brachial plexus in the Dog, the paresis being especially marked about the wrist,
and the animal walking with a slightly high stepping action on the side of the
divided root. Very little effect was produced by division of the first dorsal root, the
resulting lameness being exceedingly slight and passing off very rapidly.

That reunion of the divided ends of the nerve roots was not the cause of the
improvement in motor power which took place in each instance is proved by the fact
that on post-mortem examination there was not the slightest sign of such reunion.
Further, microscopic examination showed well-marked degeneration, both in the
distal end of the roots divided, and in the nerves derived from these roots. As has
already been shown, a muscle which obtains its nerve supply from several roots has
some of its fibres innervated from one, while the remainder are innervated from
another or other roots, so that the recovery cannot be explained by supposing that
the same number of fibres are acted on as before, and that they gradually become
accustomed to respond more powerfully to the stimulus, although that is necessarily
less intense. At the end of three weeks the muscles supplied by the divided root
were found to be considerably atrophied and softer than normal; and there was
marked diminution of resistance when passive movements were carried out at these
various joints on which these muscles acted. Moreover, during general epileptic
