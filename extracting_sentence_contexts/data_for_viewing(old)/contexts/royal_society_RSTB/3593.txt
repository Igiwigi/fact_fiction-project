Text-Fic. 10.—Diagrams through another stem of Yezonia constructed as in text-fig. 9.

and somewhat oblique, seems to have been about 1 cm. by 6 mm. Very near to it
is a smaller stem, which may have branched from it, but there is no evidence of this
in the sections. In fact, though so many specimens are in our hands, we have none
which shows evidence of branching, though in one case there is a longitudinal section
of a twig nearly 3 cm. long, and it should certainly have shown it, therefore, had
branching been at all frequent. In one slide there is a half-cirele of bundles, in what
might be a leaf base, or might be a branch. These bundles, however, are not to be
seen in either of the neighbouring slides of the series, so that if they had been those
of a branch, it must have left the main axis at a very high angle.

Young Stem.—There is only one section of an unthickened axis, that in slide 1G 9,

In the unthickened axis the only point to be noticed is the vascular tissue, the
rest of its structure seems to be identical with that of the older stems,
