The rest of the

Sstriking in this particular, because the bilateral lesion there was very extensive ; more-
over, the loss of intelligence was far less persistent, although at first not less distinct. ‘3 The experiment is quite conclusive against the localisation of auditory perceptions
gin the superior temporal gyri alone.
