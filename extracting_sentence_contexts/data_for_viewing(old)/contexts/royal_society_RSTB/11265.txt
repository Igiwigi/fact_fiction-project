cessing demands exceeds the capacity of a suffering system.
This explanation is plausible and, indeed, may account for
some findings. Thus, if traditional wisdom were to be taken
seriously, errors with arithmetical facts after lesions of the
dominant hemisphere would be due to a disturbance to
devoted retrieval mechanisms or stored representations [8].
By contrast, a lesion in the contralateral, non-dominant hemi-
sphere could provoke in some cases a generic processing
shortcoming that would affect any relatively demanding
cognitive task, leading also to problems with simple
(i.e. one-digit) calculation. This explanation lacks empirical
support, however. In turn, a demonstration of the fact that
the processes in each of the two hemispheres are indeed
specific is also missing.

Neuroimaging studies, again in the instance of arithmeti-
cal facts, seem to invariably evidence bilateral activation,
most often not entirely symmetrical and, crucially, in some
cases superior on the right hemisphere [9]. By a logic analo-
