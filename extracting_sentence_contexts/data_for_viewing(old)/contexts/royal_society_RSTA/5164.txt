be minimized with elimination of foundations, reducing negative environmental impacts.

Different designs are being actively tested off the coast of Denmark, France, Germany,
the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK [6,7]. Out of 40 deep-water wind
projects, more than 60% are located in Europe [3]. These prototypes are still at an early stage,
far from mass production and commercialization, but are gaining attention. Presently, four full-
scale offshore wind turbines on floating substructures are operating, one in the North Sea, one
in the Atlantic [2] and two in the Pacific [8]. It is reported that, in addition to the four full-
scale deep offshore turbines, there are three grid-connected experimental floating substructures
and 35 deep-water designs under development worldwide [3,8]. The INWORK report presents
the global floating offshore wind foundation development in the USA, Europe and Japan [8].
According to this report, five full-scale floating offshore turbines are planned to be installed in
2014, two in 2014/2015 and three in 2015, worldwide. Despite the fact that a number of these
solutions are available in concept [8-10], a complete understanding of the behaviour of floating
platforms is not present and still demands significant investigation [11]. These offshore structures
have widely variable and complex dynamic responses due to intense and complex environmental
loading dominated by high wind and wave forces at the locations of their operation [12-15].
Monitoring of this complex dynamics is important for offshore wind energy solutions because
the exposure to wind, wave and combined wind-wave loading can be widely variable [16-19]
and may lead to significant practical issues for successful implementation of this technology at
its site [20,21]. Additionally, when deployed offshore, a wind turbine may also pose problems
related to operations and maintenance [22,23] due to significant lack of access after installation.
Therefore, quantitative estimates based on the dynamic responses and assessments of markers
related to such dynamics at an early stage of development are only possible through appropriate
simulation and scaled testing in laboratory conditions [21].
