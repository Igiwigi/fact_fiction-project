5, Anterior extremity of fourth parietal or sagittal convolution. From this swmmary it is evident that, whilst in all these animals corresponding
portions of the limbic and the whole of the frontal lobe are framed upon the game
plan, the ascending parietal convolution partakes of this formation in the Pig and
Sheep alone ; the first and partly the second parietal convolution is (in front of the
Sylvian fissure) 80 constructed in all these animals, whilst a well-developed area of the
8ame formation occupies the anterior extremity of the fourth or sagittal convolution in
the Cat. It is interesting to note here the fact that the crucial suleus forms in all
these animals alike a boundary line betwixt the two typical laminar arrangements of
the vertex, and marks at its commencement the transition of the one formation into
that of the other in the limbic lobe. In summarising, as above, the areas of the five-
laminated cortex, with its coextensive nested geries of ganglionie cells, due regard
must be paid to the varying richness in development of the latter formation. In the
diagram accompanying this memoir attention has been paid to this point, the dark
shading indicating the rich developments of this formation ; the paler shading covers
regions where the same formation is poorly developed.
