Unlike the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in
fluids, we have demonstrated that the nonlinear elastic effects saturate the dynamic instability
of the bifurcated solutions, displaying a rich morphological diagram where both digitations and
stable wrinkling can emerge. The results of this work provide important guidelines for the design
of novel soft systems with tunable shapes. In fact, the possibility to use external stimuli to control
both the geometric and the elastic properties in smart materials, such as hydrogels or dielectric



elastomers [26], can be used to provoke morphological transitions on demand [27]. Morphological
changes in such soft devices may be employed, for example, to selectively change the surface
roughness (e.g. to perform drag reduction in fluid-structure interactions [28]) or to fabricate tailor-
made patterns (e.g. to design adaptive material scaffolds [29]). Authorsâ€™ contributions.
