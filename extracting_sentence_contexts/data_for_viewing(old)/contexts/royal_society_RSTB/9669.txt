fore that the kinds of stigma present on the archaeological
limestone from BL and FN3 could be mainly indicative of activi-
ties involving stone against stone. Accordingly, we are hopeful

that new experimental work on stone anvils will yield positive FN3. At each site, in situ reduction is attested with all

Experimental knapping has been a crucial aid in identifying well-struck flakes. Small flakes tend to be non-cortical with
