These weak
echoes are probably due to considerable variations in depth within the area of the bottom
illuminated by the sound beam. They usually occur near the bottom of a valley. The fact that
many of these appear to be V-shaped is because echoes are received from both sides of such
a depression. For instance, if soundings were made while steaming over a valley of the
cross-section shown in figure 5a, a record as shown in figure 55 would be obtained. It is
