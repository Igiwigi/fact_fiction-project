Further, in the forming enamel there is not the slightest evidence of the presence
of any cytoplasmic structures such as Tomes and Mummery believe to be present, and
the appearances on which they base their belief are open, as will be shown later, to
quite a different interpretation.

The appearances described above constitute the more obvious morphological changes
through which Marsupial enamel cells pass during functional activity, a much more
exhaustive account, together with a discussion on their physiological significance, being
embodied in a paper dealing with the cytology of the enamel organ in Vertebrates
which is in course of preparation.

The essential difference in the life-cycle of Marsupial enamel cells from those of
most other Mammals, lies in the fact that in the latter no stage is characterised by
any marked difference in the cytoplasm or nuclei of the ameloblasts.

Tn the case of Marsupials, however, we find that there is a stage where the greater
part of the cytoplasm has become transformed into metaplasmic material, the cyto-
mitoplasm alone remaining.

The marked changes in the nuclei of the ameloblasts form another distinguishing
feature, for the size of the nucleus is undoubtedly related to the functional activity of
the cell, and therefore to the amount of undifferentiated cytoplasm, so that without
going so far as to accept in their entirety Herrwic’s views as to ‘“ Kernplasma-
relation,” we may safely infer that the great decrease in size of the nucleus is due to
the fact that almost all the cytoplasm has been changed into metaplasm.
