like of the Cycadofilices. Apart from the secondary thickening, the structure of the
stem in Heterangium is closely similar to that in the recent Gleichenia, while the
foliage is altogether Fern-like, and in fact almost certainly identical, as Srur’s descrip-
tion shows, with that of Sphenopteris elegans.t It would thus appear that Medullosa,
though so complex and highly specialized in many of its representatives, may well
have been derived, by fairly direct descent, from a simple Fern-stock. This does not,
of course, imply that any known form of Heterangium was the ancestor of any Medullosa
—a most improbable supposition—but that the Medulloseze generally may have sprung
from plants related to, and with the same type of stem-structure as Heterangium. Such
a view agrees better with the facts than would an attempt to derive the Medulloseze
from the Cladoxylez. The latter, indeed, conspicuously resemble the former in having
polystelic stems with secondary growth, but the structure of the individual steles is
strikingly different, notably in the fact that the primary wood of Cladoxylon consists
exclusively of scalariform trachese, without conjunctive parenchyma.{ I should, there-
fore, incline to regard the Cladoxylez as representing a parallel line of development
to that of the Medulloses, rather than as primitive members of the same series.

In the organisation of the leaves, and in the course and structure of the leaf-trace
bundles, Medullosa anglica diverges widely from the Heterangium type, and stands
on the same level with M. Leuckarti, assuming, as I think the evidence justifies,
that the petioles of the latter really had the structure of Myelowylon Landriotii. It

* The arrangement of the adventitious roots in Medullosa is also closely similar to that in some of the
recent Tree-ferns. See the figures of Cyathea in De Bary’s ‘ Comp. Anat.,’ figs. 140 and 141.
