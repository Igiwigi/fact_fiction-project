thereof, Zess the number of points which give special solutions: the order of the point-
system is, as has been seen, equal to the product of the orders of the k-fold locus, the

t-fold locus, &c., tess a reduction depending on the nature of the common (4—g)fold
locus, and the difficulty is in general in the determination of the value of this reduction.

11. 1n all that precedes, the number of the parameters has been taken to be @; but if

the parameters are taken to be contained in the equation of the curve homogeneously, then
the parameters before made use of are in fact She ratios of these homogeneous para-
meters; and using the term henceforward as referring to the homogeneous Parameters,
the numbers of the parameters will be =o+1. 1
12. I assume also that the equation of the curve contains the parameters linearly :
this being 80, the condition that the curye shall pass through a given arbitrary point
implies a linear relation between the parameters ; and the condition that the curve
Shall pass through / given points, a /-fold linear relation between the parameters. Tt
follows that the number of the curyes which satisfy a given -fold condition, and besides
pass through @—# given points, is equal to the order of the -fold relation, or of the
corresponding #-fold locus ; and thus if we define the order of the þ-fold condition to be
the number of the curyes in"question, the condition, relation, and locus will be all of the
8ame order, and in all that precedes we may (in place of the order of the relation or of the
locus) speak of the order of the condition. Thus, subject to the modifications occasioned
