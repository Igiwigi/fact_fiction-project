We know, however, that during the replacement of a tooth the bone
is resorbed around the roots and that the replacing-tooth moves down into an
enlarged alveolus. In any animal which died during this process there would be a
greater chance of the loss of a replacing-tooth than of those teeth which are held in
the jaw in a normal manner. It is also necessary to explain the fact that it is the odd numbered teeth which are
being replaced in the anterior region, while the even numbered are being replaced
in the posterior region. If, as seems to be indicated by the second specimen, the
replacement of the second series follows very shortly after the first series, it is not
unreasonable to suppose that the replacement of the first series (in this specimen the
even numbered teeth) may not have been completed throughout the jaw before the
replacement of the alternate series commenced. VII—Discusston

The evidence on tooth replacement afforded by the material described may be

summarized as follows :—
