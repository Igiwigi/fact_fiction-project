a distance, which is equal to that through which the particle itself has moved. This
transfer will be accompanied by a corresponding movement in the electrical forces
throughout every part of the circuit formed (1627. 1634.), and its effects may be
estimated, as, for instance, by the heating of a wire (853.) at any particular section of
the current however distant. If the water be a cube of an inch in the side, the elec-
trodes touching, each by a surface of one square inch, and being an inch apart, then,
by the time that a tenth of it, or 25'25 grains, is decomposed, the particles of oxygen
and hydrogen throughout the mass may be considered as having moved relatively to
each other in opposite directions, to the amount of the tenth of an inch; 1. e. that two
particles at first in combination will after the motion be the tenth of an inch apart.
Other motions which occur in the fluid will not at all interfere with this result ; for
they bave no power of accelerating or retarding the electric discharge, and possess in
fact, no relation to it.

1652, The quantity of electricity in 25:25 grains of water is, according to an esti-
mate of the force which I formerly made (861.), equal to above 24 millions of charges -
of a large Leyden battery ; or it would have kept any length of a platina wire 4+ of
an inch in diameter red hot for an hour and a half (853.). This result, though given
