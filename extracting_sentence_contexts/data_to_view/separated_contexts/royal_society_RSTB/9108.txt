First, Freeland did not
report his sample size, making it difficult to evaluate how
robust the initial results are. Second, Gillespie et al. [72] ana-
lysed over 1600 red colobus faecal samples collected between
1997 and 2003 and found that individuals were infected with
up to five protozoan parasite species, but at a low prevalence
(a species maximum of 4.4% of the samples were infected
with given protozoan species). Thus, if Freelandâ€™s sample
size was small, it is possible that he concluded the population
did not harbour protozoans when in fact it did (ie. a false nega-
tive). Long-term monitoring to determine if there are cycles in
protozoan prevalence levels would help clarify if there has
been a change, as would monitoring other isolated red colobus
populations. However, without knowing the original sample
size examined by Freeland, we view it as premature to state
conclusively that a change in disease state has occurred.
