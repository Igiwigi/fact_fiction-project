standard of structure, the name coccolith is now given by geologists to a number of
very diverse objects; in fact, it has come to be applied to any small, perforated,
plate-like body, either consisting of calcium carbonate or of some presumable
replacement of that substance. Geologists have in this matter departed from the
view of Huxuny, derived from his interpretation of the structure of coccoliths in the
deep sea deposits.

We have shown that these coccoliths are the constituent plates of C. pelagica and
C. leptopora, and that they possess a very well marked type of structure, viz., two
limbs joined together by a central collar. The real test of a coccolith is thus its
double structure. Judged by this standard, by far the larger number of bodies
described by geologists as coccoliths, have no claim to be so considered. There is, in
fact, no evidence that they are derived from even allied organisms.

In order to place this matter beyond doubt by an examination of authentic
geological coccoliths, we were supplied by Professor Jupp and Mr, Caapman with
material for comparison with that obtained from the surface organisms and the deep
sea deposits.

Houxtey has figured a true coccolith with double structure from the Sussex chalk
(‘Quart. Journ. Mier. Sei.” 1868), and he states further that he has observed
coccospheres in the chalk. Soxnas (‘ Geol. Mag.,’ 1876) has figured what he describes
as « coccosphere from glauconitic granules in the Cambridge greensand, but the record
of true coccoliths is exceedingly scanty—partly, no doubt, owing to geologists having
paid no attention to the profile view of these bodies. Sonnas, for example (loc. cit.),
