insertions. It should be noted, however, that because the
SINE insertions in the 24 orthologous primate and mouse
gene pairs are random in 3'UTR location and likely to have
been acquired at different evolutionary times, rather than
exemplifying convergence, some insertions may be adaptive,
contributing to species-specific regulation, or may drive a com-
pensatory change in gene expression that sets the 3‘UTR back
towards the ‘default’ mode of regulation. Further experimentation is required to understand what
defines a STAU1 or STAU2 binding site, which can be
distinct but can also be shared [21], as well as additional
features of single 3'UTR Alus that trigger SMD because most
do not [22].
