The thin bark-layer (&) seen in fig. 42, has wholly
disappeared, and the two projections of the outer bark (4 4) are rapidly converging to
produce that complete closure of the interruption to its continuity which is seen in fig. 44.

"If we now turn to bundle 2 and interpret it by the light afforded by the preceding
description, we shall see that it is about to undergo similar changes. The bundle
itself exhibits little change of position in the several sections, but the prosenchyma-
tous bark has altered its form so that the bundle is in nearly the 8ame condition
in fig. 44 that bundle 1 exhibits in figs. 38, 39, & 40. We here learn several
important facts. The first is that whilst the vascular bundles retain the ame un-
changed positions throughout a considerable length of the stem, they each in turn
move outwards and disappear at the periphery of the bark: the second is that the

- irregularities in the outline of the bark are not wholly due to external pressure, but to
I the snccessive development of a series of peripheral appendages, the bases of which have
S risen from the bark in the form of sharp, projecting, longitudinally disposed ridges with
Ybroad bases. During the progress of these changes we always find that, immediately
Sexternal to each vascular-bundle, the parenchymatous layer of the bark consists of a
Slarge mass of yery regular and translucent parenchymatous cells, as represented in
SPlate XXIX.' fig. 35, t, and an expansion of which tissue has evidently constituted the
Brea bulk of the appendicular organ, whatever it was, since similar masses of paren-
zzchyma retain the 8ame position in the enclosed areas external to bundle 5 in
ZPlate XXX. figs. 41 & 42.
