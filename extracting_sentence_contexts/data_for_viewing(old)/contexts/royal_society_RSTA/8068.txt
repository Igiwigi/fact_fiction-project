The mere fact that the recorder showed a negative charge during the passage of the
rear part of the cloud does not necessarily mean that all the drops brought down negative
charge. The result merely means that both positive and negative drops were falling,
but the total charge carried by negative drops which fell in two minutes on the receiver
exceeded the total charge carried by positive drops. As a matter of fact, the observa-
tions of ScuwEND,* who measured the charges of individual drops, indicate the presence
of both positively and negatively charged drops. If, therefore, as a consequence of
the removal by raindrops of the excess of negative charge and also a generation of
positive charge by breaking of drops, which goes on at the same time in the rear part
of the cloud which is overhead, the field becomes positive, there must then be in that
part of the cloud an excess of positive charge, and the raindrops must also brmg with
them an excess of positive charge. This is exactly what is shown by the charge record
for the thunderstorm of September 7. An excess of positive charge in the rear part
of the cloud cannot, however, continue long, for not only are the raindrops removing
this excess, but an increased activity in the central region of the cloud is bringing in a
fresh accumulation of negative charge. We therefore get again an excess of negative
charge, and thus the excess charge fluctuates between positive and negative. The
