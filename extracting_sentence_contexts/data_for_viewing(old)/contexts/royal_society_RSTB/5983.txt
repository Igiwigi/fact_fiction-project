sequently uniform throughout their length. The maximum suction at the base of the
limbs simply enhances this water movement.

The filter setae on the edge of the second endite and on the distal part of the basal
endite project posteriorly but, as the edge of the latter curves forwards at the base of
the limb, so the sete come to point first downwards into the food groove and then
slightly anteriorly, fig. 2, A. The set can thus be divided into two groups: the distal,
which project backwards and lie close against the median face of the basal endites of the
limb behind, and the proximal, which project towards the body close against the walls
of the food groove, fig. 2, B. Now, considering again the forward movement of any
two successive limbs. At the commencement, the hinder limb will touch the front limb
at about the level of the second endite. The distal group of sete of the front limb will
thus lie close against, and, in fact, will be sucked against the flat surface of the basal
endite of the hinder of the two limbs. They cannot, therefore, act to any great extent
as filters, but on the other hand, the proximal group of set project downwards across
an open space and merely separate the median space from the lateral inter-limb space,
fig. 2, A. There is nothing to hinder water passing through them and hence it is through
them that maximum filtration must occur.

At the commencement of the suction phase, therefore, filtration is confined to
a small area at the base of the limbs; all the water entering the inter-limb space must
