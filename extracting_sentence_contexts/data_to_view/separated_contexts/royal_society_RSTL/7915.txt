There are, however, the 5 derived syzygies

A(A*G—I12ABD—4B*C—EF?)=0, &c. (see Table No. 89)

designated by 5Z/; since these are equiyalent to 4 syzygies only there must be 1 identical
relation between them (designated by s), viz. this is the equation 0=0 obtained by
adding the several syzygies, multiplied each by the proper numerical factor as shown
Table No. 89,

344. Again, for the line
(8, 14) | 5 | A*N, AB*E, ABL, ACK, ADI, AEH, AFG, BCI, BDF, CDE | 62), s |
there are here 10 composite covyariants, but only 5 irreducible coyariants ; there should
therefore be 10—5, =5 syzygies; we have in fact the 6 derived syzygies
A(AN—BE—6DI+2EH—FG)=0 &e. (ﬆe Table No. 89)

designated by 6E'; these must therefore be connected by 1 identical relation (desig-
nated by o), viz. this is the equation 0=0 obtained by adding the several syzygies,
each multiplied by the proper numerical factor as shown Table No. 89.

345. These two cases (-) are in fact the instances which present themselyes where a
correction is required to my original theory. The two identical relations in question
were disregarded in my original theory, and this accordingly gave the two non-existent.
irreducible covariants (a, ..(a, y)'* and (a, ..Y(v, y)”. And reverting to No. 336, these
give in the denominator of A(z) the factors (1—*a®)(L—d*s"').
