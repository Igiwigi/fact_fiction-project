However, owing to the high percentage (approx. 87%) of
records with no specific information, we are uncertain of
the patterns of usage of ANMs. Thus, we assume if plastic
items can be more easily used with structural functions
than other categories such as cloth or paper, this is an intri-
guing possibility albeit an untested one. In fact, plastic is
the only ANM suggested to provide a strengthening benefit
for birdsâ€™ nests [31,76] and the four main plastic subcategories
in avian nests could make them optimal as structural
materials considering their characteristics such as hardness
or length. More specific information on the usage of ANMs
by birds is urgently needed to test their functions in nests. We found that nest type was as an important life-history ; :
trait that significantly affected the use of ANMs by birds.
