476 MR. BOWMAN ON THE MINUTE STRUCTURE AND

This structure can usually be seen best in specimens prepared when recent, but I
have preparations which show it perfectly preserved in parts long steeped in $pirit. From its extreme tenuity, it would hardly be likely to attract any attention, were it
not that, without extraordinary care, it is apt to be detached in different ways from the
bundle invested by it, and s0 to become an isolated object. But when its existence
is known, it may often be discovered in unbroken fasciculi, as obseryed by Murres,
under the form of a straight linear margin, uninterrupted, and independent of the
strize; which, however, will very probably seem at first to pass completely across,
though they terminate, in fact, within this edge. Some accurate observers have
doubted the prominence of the beads of the fibrille, because they have been unable
to see their bulge at the extreme edge of the fasciculus, a circumstance which may
depend on the existence of this sheath. It may also be frequently seen encircling the areas of fasciculi in the transverse
sections of dried muscle (fig.
