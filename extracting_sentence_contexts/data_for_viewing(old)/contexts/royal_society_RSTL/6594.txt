@;, 7, 7, be the components of w along fixed axes, and w,, w,, w, be its components along
moving axes which coincide with the former at time 7, then WL = ets

and we have just seen how that proposition follows at once Fan the fundamental
theorem in section 35, and from the self-evident fact that D,(Q, Q)=0.

41. Recapitulating then the results of the two last sections, we see that a particle's
system-acceleration is equivalent to det (D(Q), R) minus the centrifugal force, and that,
the absolute acceleration of the particle is compounded of the relative acceleration of
the particle, its system-acceleration, and 2 det (Q, V,), V, being the particle's relative
velocity.

Tf we now look back on the analytical expressions obtained in section 38 for the com-
ponents fe 56 absolute acceleration, it will be easy to see their full meaning. The

It is evident that this amounts to saying that D(Q) has St for its components ;
