Another remarkable aspect of the paper is the degree to which the experiments connected with
the mathematical results for linear stability. In fact, Drazin and Reid comment that ‘the closeness
of the agreement between his theoretical and experimental results was without precedent in
the history of fluid mechanics’ [7, p. 105]. In fact, Taylor’s stability analysis and experiments
get to the root of the equations of motion for a viscous fluid that were formulated by Claude-
Louis Navier [12] and George Gabriel Stokes [13], which we now know as the Navier-Stokes
equations. A crucial issue that arose in the late 1800s was the measurement of the fluid viscosity,
which is precisely the problem that Couette and Mallock were considering experimentally in their
carefully designed concentric, differentially rotating cylinder apparatuses [8,9]. Of course, it was
the Taylor instability that made the results for these measurements confusing.
