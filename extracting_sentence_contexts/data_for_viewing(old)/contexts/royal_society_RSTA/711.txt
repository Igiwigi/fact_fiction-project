remote parts of this large ocean basin, as well as the efficient removal by particle scavenging in
some marginal areas [44].

Neodymium concentration profiles increase with water depth in most regions of the global
ocean (figure 3b), with the exception of marginal seas and areas of strong convection and/or
modified particle-seawater dynamics, which instead show invariant vertical concentration
profiles (e.g. Arctic Ocean, Nordic Seas, Labrador Sea, Atlantic subpolar gyre, Caribbean,
Mediterranean). The often-quoted statement that deep water Nd is generally lower in the North
Atlantic and higher in the Pacific and correlates with silicate (see [9] and references therein) does
seem to exclude data from the South Atlantic, Southern Ocean and Indian Ocean (figure 4). Zheng
et al. [40] concluded that linear correlations of dissolved REEs and Si in Atlantic deep waters
are due to predominantly conservative behaviour of both elements rather than similar chemical
behaviour. This point is further supported by the data compiled in figure 4b. In fact, Atlantic deep
