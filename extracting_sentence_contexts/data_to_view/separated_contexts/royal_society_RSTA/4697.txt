19. The value of \, namely $7, which has here been assumed, is not merely
dictated by the form desired for the final result. That value has in fact already
been specified as the first approximation in quite another connexion.* As this is
the crucial point of the theory, it may be allowable to present the argument in
detail. â€˜The total electric force acting on a single molecule is derived from the
aggregate potential V = & (pu, d/da 4- py, d/dy + p,d/dz) r-1, where pr, py, pf: are
the components of the moment p of a polarized molecule.
