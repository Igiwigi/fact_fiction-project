These indifference
curves are indicated for small and large NW by dashed lines. The shaded area
represents the combinations of jz and o? that are evolutionarily accessible,
while the unshaded area represents phenotypes that are inaccessible due to
developmental, energetic, environmental or other constraints. The evolutionarily
stable strategy in such a system will be a point on the boundary of the set of
accessible states where the slope of the boundary is N, as this is the point in
the figure that maximizes the effective fitness We = ju — oN.

greater value of y1, despite the fact that this allele would also
have a higher value of o”. Thus, with genomic imprinting, we no longer have a
purely stable ESS. Assuming the boundary of accessible strat-
egies is smooth, if we start at the ESS for an unimprinted
locus, the population will be subject to invasion by alleles
at imprinted loci.
