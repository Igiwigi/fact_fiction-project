[[H, H,JP]=0;
but this is identically satisfied by virtue of the connected condition. Instead, however, of solving the equation as a complete system, let us, with Jacopr,
deduce a new integral of the first partial differential equation of the system, 7. 6. an
integral distinct from I, Hs, ... Hm which, in virtue of the condition given, are already
integrals of that equationâ€”in fact, common integrals of the system. For if we make
P=H, in any of the equations, that equation will be identically satisfied. Represent by AEM
this new integral.
