drop of spirit, the resulting waves of contraction are almost sure to pass across the
isthmus, even though this has been exhausted in the manner just described.

$ 3.—Another fact, which I have several times observed during my sections of Aurelia,
also deserves to be recorded. TI have observed it under several modes of section, but
it will be only necessary to describe one observation.

In the Aurelia, of a portion of which the accompanying woodeut 1s a representation,
8even of the lithocysts were removed, while the remaining one was almosb entirely
isolated from the general contractile tissue by the incisions aa, bb, cc. The lithocyst
continued to animate the tissue area wa a w-, and through the connecting passage /
the contractile waves spread over the remainder of the subumbrella tiggue 2222.
80 far, of course, the facts were normal ; but very frequently it was observed that
the contractile waves did not start from the lithocyst, or from the area © za, but

from the point 0 in the area 22. After this origination of the contractile waves from
the point o had been observed a great number of times, I removed the lithoeyst.
The effect was nob only to prevent the further origination of contractile waves in the
area © 7 z, but also to prevent their further origination from the point o—the entire
umbrella thus becoming paralyzed. Hence, before the removal of the lithoeyst, the
