Any such
Bstatistic may be written as, say, u{Gr(O, 9)}, where Gr(O, m)) indicates that ny basic cells
speach of size (1) are arranged in a certain definite configuration, and u,{Gr(O, o)} indicates
€ that the statistic in question has to be constructed from the n, values of z drawn in the form
sof the specified grid. For the sth micro-state there will be N’ such values (given by
t= 1,2,..., N’) which forms a frequency distribution of the given statistic for the sth micro-
‘8 state. The fact that all these values belong to the sth micro-state is explicitly indicated by the
@suffix s in the form u,{Gr(O, vp)}, where ¢ goes from 1 to N’ for any particular value of s,

Ss
and s goes from 1 to N. These NN’ values of u,,{Gr(O, %o)} form a complete set of sample values
= of the statistic under consideration.

= 62. Consider now unrestricted sampling; and to fix ideas attention must be focused on
& the sth micro-state.
