This leaves undissolved the sulphate
of soda, and after filtration and evaporation gives a brown glutinous mass, which
has all the properties of the sugar produced by the action of acids on rubian. It is
this sugar, which, by the continued action on it of the caustic alkali, gives rise to the
formation of the dark brown flocculent substance, insoluble in alcohol, which is found
mixed with the four preceding products of decomposition. This fact is sufficiently
proved by the composition of the latter substance, which is identical with that of the
brown substance produced by the action of strong acids on ordinary sugar. MR. SCHUNCK, ON RUBIAN.
