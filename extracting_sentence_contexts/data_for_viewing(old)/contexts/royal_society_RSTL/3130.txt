position of the existence of an electric fluid or fluids. It may be impossible to have
the one fluid or state in a free condition without its producing by induction the
other, and yet possible to have cases in which an isolated portion of matter in one
condition being uncharged, shall, by a change of state, eyolye one electricity or the
other: and though such evolved electricity might immediately induce the opposite
state in its neighbourhood, yet the mere evolution of one electricity without the other
in the first instance, would be a very important fact in the theory which as8umes a
fluid or fluids: these theories as I understand them assigning not the slightest reason
why such an effect should not occur.

1176. But on searching for such cases I cannot find one. Evolution by friction, as
is well known, gives both powers in equal proportion. So does evolution by che-
mical action, notwithstanding the great diversity of bodies which may be employed,
and the enormous quantity of electricity which can in this manner be evolved (371.
376. 861. 868.) The more promising cases of change of state, whether by evapora-
tion, fusion, or the reverse processes, still give both forms of the power in equal pro-
portion ; and the cases of splitting of mica and other crystals, the breaking of suJphur,
&c. &c., are subject to the same limitation.
