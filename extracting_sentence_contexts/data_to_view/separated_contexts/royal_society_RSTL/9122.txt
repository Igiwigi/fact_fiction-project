The moraine detritus, in the sense I take it, is not therefore the product only of the
moraine profonde of AGass1z, but is the sum of all the debris carried down by a glacier
and projected in its front, or 8nbsequently ploughed up by the advancing glacier, and
overlaid by the rolling stream of ice.* Tt is this which forms that unstratified mass
of decomposed and ground-up rock, rock debris, angular fragments and pebbles, and
subangular striated fragments—grey and argillaceous in this district, bub varying, as
is well known, in texture and colour in others, according to the nature of the local
rocks—which 80 often lies upon the glaciated rock surface. It is to this 8ub-glacial
product that I should restrict the term * Till,” or else designate ib as land-till,

Under the various cireumstances here noted, the terminal moraines of separate
glaciers may have remained isolated or have become confluent ; may have been passed
over by the ice, or pushed indefinitely forward ; or they may have been piled or heaped
up between conflicting glaciers. These seyeral contingencies will, T think, account,
more readily than would subsequent partial denudation, for the many otherwise inex-
plicable positions in which the moraine detritus is meb with—in the valleys, on the
8ides of hills, and on the top of passes ; wherever, in fact, the advancing glaciers have
filled valleys, have been forced up on to higher ground, or have anywhere met and
contended. The result of this has been, that generally in the narrower and in the
steeper valleys, where the ice-flow was little impeded, the moraine debris has been
swept forward and removed ; that in the broader and flatter valleys it has been left in
isolated patches and ridges at various levels, while in the larger plains it occurs in more
continuous and extended gheets.f The same causes would, in some places, produce
contortions in the Till, and in others would press it out into great lenticular masses,

In the Spean Valley, moraine detritus forms mounds at intervals all down the
valley, bub their character is much masked by subsequent water action, owing to
which they are covered with gravel and often levelled on the top 80 as to form terraces. The large accumulation of this debris in front of Glen Treig, and at the entrance of
the Rough Burn Glen, I attribute to the arrested glacier action resulting from the

meeting of the glacier from Glen Treig with the one descending from the glens on the
oppoxite side of Strath Spean; while the terraces fronting these and the Gulban mound

* Tt is in this wider gense apparently that the term moraine profonde is nsed by Hocarp and
Doreuss-Avsser; but as that term is generally understood in Agass1z's more contracted sense, its use
geologically seems to me objectionable.

+ This would explain the difficulty, alluded to by various writers, that arises from the absence of glacial
moraine detritus in many highly glaciated tracts of the Highlands.
