effect has been called ‘the effect of specific localization’ [43]. The explanation of this fact includes
the idea that the discharge localization is managed by the rule of minimal electrical field, required
for the discharge maintenance, along the line of breakdown. It can be supposed that the discharge
‘prefers’ the path in the fuel, oxidizer or between them depending on conditions and the phase of
discharge development. If the medium is non-homogeneous, the favoured path may not be the
shortest one.
