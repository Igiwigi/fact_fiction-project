redistilled from carbonate of potash the product appeared to be principally al-
cohol, but the presence of ether was very evident.â€”This experiment proves the
formation of ether from sulphovinic acid when no sulphuric acid was present
as snch at the commencement of the distillation.

With regard to the questions at the commencement of this paper, it appears
to me from the facts detailed, that in the usual process for obtaining ether, the
ether is not formed altogether from the direct action of the alcohol and sul-
phuric acid considered independently of the sulphovinic acid present ; for the
quantity of free sulphuric acid is small compared to the quantity of alcohol
present, two-fifths only of the acid remaining, while of the alcohol more than
two-thirds remain; and further, sulphovinic acid alone is readily converted into
ether and sulphuric acid, (ce 8.) and during the distillation of ether in the
ordinary way the sulphovinie acid is always re-converted more or less completely
into sulphuric acid (4. 5. 6.) it probably therefore assists much in the process.
With regard to the third question, the opinion may be snpported that the for-
mation of sulphovinic acid is a necessary and intermediate step to the produc-
tion of ether from alcohol and sulphuric acid ; and although I do not mean to
assert this view, yet it deserves a few remarks.
