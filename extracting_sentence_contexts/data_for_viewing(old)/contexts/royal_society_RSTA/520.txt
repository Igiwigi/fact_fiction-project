alternative raw materials and of RE sources. We will discuss in the following sections the role of
CO, utilization in this general panorama.

Globalization of chemical production is a major element characterizing the current landscape,
but there are several indications of how moving to a de-globalization will characterize the
future of chemical production. In fact, widening the type of raw materials, with emphasis on
local resources (due to various economic and social pushes), will determine a move towards
de-globalization and tighter integration with other industrial sectors (symbiosis, synergy, etc.),
as already observed in some cases. This will determine different regional ‘pressures’ to use
alternative raw materials. In regions such as Europe that lack other resources, CO? (re)use will
play a major role in maintaining competiveness and in moving to a low-carbon economy [31-34].
It is important to take account of all these aspects when considering the role of CO in a future
scenario for chemical production, which may be different in Asia with respect to Europe or the
USA. The following considerations will apply especially to Europe, due to the higher social
and political pressure (translating into targets for substituting fossil fuels, use of RE, etc.) on
addressing the GHG issue, use of renewable energies and the move to a low-carbon economy.
Furthermore, there is a lack of other raw materials; therefore, waste biomass and CO) can be
considered as Europe’s own resources. However, it is likely that Europe will be the driving force
