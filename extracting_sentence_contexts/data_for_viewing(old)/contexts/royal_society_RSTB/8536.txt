cost-effective means of providing early mitigation, but also has the potential
for poverty alleviation [1]. While forests and agriculture are addressed separ-
ately in international discussions in terms of projected risks, impacts, and
adaptation and mitigation strategies, there is widespread recognition of the
inter-connectivity of forests and agricultural system in Africa, and the integral

Today, there are over a billion people living on the continent [3]. Africa
has over 6.6 million km? of forest [4] and is reported to have 1.9 million km?

make up more than a quarter of the continent. Depending on the country,
50-85% of the population is involved in agriculture, and depending on the
context, agriculture is often cited as one of the major drivers of deforestation
and degradation. Despite the fact that net annual forest loss has declined
globally, Africa has had one of the world’s highest rates of deforestation
