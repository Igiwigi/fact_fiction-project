The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling of flows in porous media is relevant in a wide

range of applications [1]; from the groundwater movement in aquifers to smaller-scale systems : =
associated with transport in soils. In all cases, the simulation accuracy gets strongly determined : =
by the discretization of the bounding geometry [2]. While the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) : zB
displays numerous advantages as a CFD tool, see [3,4], it formulates on an uniform Cartesian 1S

mesh, by default. Therefore, the task of prescribing boundary conditions over arbitrarily shaped
surfaces requires particular care in order to avoid the inaccurate staircase discretization. This
task is further complicated by the fact that LBMâ€™s working variables correspond to mesoscopic 8
populations, rather than macroscopic fields [5]. Thus, the LBM realization of hydrodynamic :
boundary conditions tends to be made implicitly, through conditions set at the level of the aaa)
mesoscopic populations. Such difficulties explain the relentless interest in this topic, which :
continues an active area of research [3,4,6]. The motivation of researchers is common: to formulate [4
LBM boundary schemes that are simultaneously accurate and easy to use. These two assets gain even Dh
greater relevance in the modelling of porous media flows, typically governed by Stokes flow, and :S
that is bounded by complex and irregular geometries [7-9]. For that reason, below we briefly :s
revise the state of affairs on the LBM implementation of the no-slip Dirichlet boundary condition. ,
Broadly speaking, two families of LBM boundary schemes can be identified to realize the no-slip
condition; they differ according to their operation principle.

The first strategy is the link-wise approach that expresses the unknown incoming populations
