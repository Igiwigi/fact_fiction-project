Thus, one must not be deceived by the appearances of Eupsammid transverse

Fungide than with the Madreporide in spite of Epwarps and Hatnn’s classification

this seems all the more reasonable in the light of the parallel fact that its Paleozoic
antetype, the Cystiphyllide, has marked affinities with the Palwozoic antetype of
the Astreidee and Fungide, namely, with the Cyathophyllidee.
