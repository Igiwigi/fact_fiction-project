Their long axes are
placed horizontally, and they appear to be in connection with the white fibres which
& cross the middle line on the under side of the commissura mollis. Athough the
largest of the cells form an ill-defined group by themselves, others almost as large are
¢ found throughout this region, and extend across the middle line in the commissura

[This paper contains little more than a series of detached observations, which are
= published with some reluctance. Although I had been familiar with the main facts
‘a in the cerebral organization of Ornithorhynchus for some years, I had postponed their
+3 publication in the hope of obtaining a supply of well-preserved specimens, from which
E it would be possible to construct a complete monograph. The interest which attaches,
.2 however, to the description of the corpus callosum as a chapter in the history of
@ science, and the peculiar features in the disposition of the rhinencephalon, which may
> serve to throw light upon the relation to one another of the two portions of the
S cerebral hemisphere, seemed to justify a preliminary communication.
£& Since this paper was written, Dr. Jonson Symryeron has published observations
g which confirm my conclusion that the corpus callosum is absent in Ornithorhynchus.
