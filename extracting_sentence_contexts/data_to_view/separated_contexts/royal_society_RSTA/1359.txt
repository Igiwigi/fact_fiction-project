Although magneto-elastic materials have been studied for some
time, their theoretical understanding and modelling in the context of flexible ferromagnetic
nanostructures and ferromagnetic colloids is still in progress (e.g. [121,124,125]). Obtaining
appropriate reduced models for thin magneto-elastic films, stripes and wires and investigating
magnetization patterns and elastic response due to applied fields is an interesting and challenging
task.

(c) Two-dimensional magnetic materials and multilayers

Atomically thin magnetic layers exhibit a range of new phenomena not present in conventional
thin magnetic films or bulk magnets, for instance, anti-symmetric exchange, perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy, etc (e.g. [109,113,126—-128]). This is due to the fact that interfacial and
material boundary effects become increasingly dominant, resulting in new physical phenomena
and leading to the appearance of novel magnetic microstructures such as edge domain
walls and vortices, chiral skyrmions, etc. Use of atomically thin layers to assemble magnetic
heterostructures opens up an opportunity to create magnetic materials with prescribed properties
[128]. Understanding the physics of these multilayered structures leads to a range of new
problems including derivation of physically sound and analytically accessible models, and their
investigation using mathematical tools of modern analysis.

(d) Magnetic skyrmions

Skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures which have been observed in ultrathin
ferromagnetic films with non-zero interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moria interaction [109,113,129].
