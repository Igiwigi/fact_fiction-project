thickness, ‘022686 centim.
It consisted of soluble prismatic sulphur (probably without admixture of octahedral
sulphur), with 5 per cent. of insoluble sulphur. Colour, clear lemon-yellow. When
~ the plates were separated the greater part of the film was still transparent, but
Nit became opaque on rubbing or attempting to detach it from the plates. We think
git probable that since the film was much broken and torn up in forcing the plates
eI apart, that it was in the transparent form during the experiments, at all events before
Sit was heated. In this case, it must be considered to have consisted entirely of
a monoclinic and amorphous sulphur.
= An elaborate investigation of the properties was made but, as nothing new turned
5 up, the table will afford sufficient information, The resistance is uniformly higher
2 than in the case of the film of similar composition of November 9th, 1892. We
attribute this to the fact that, having now a great deal more material, we probably
<7 succeeded with the purification rather better than before. Of course the test of
"8 burning two hundred grammes weight was carried out, and resulted in such an
S:almost inappreciable residue that we must have succeeded better than was to be
'3 expected in keeping the dust off during the burning, or rather boiling.

«& * Sulphur is conveniently filtered by means of glass wool in.a zinc funnel. A bit of platinum wire
