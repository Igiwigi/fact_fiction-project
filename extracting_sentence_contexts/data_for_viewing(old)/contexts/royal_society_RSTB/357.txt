My plant to which M. Broneniarr refers, is a strobilus, not an ordinary stem.
Herr Cu. E. Weiss, of Berlin, believes it to belong to the genus Bowmanites estab-
lished by the late Mr. Bryney.* No remains of the specimens described by Mr.
Biyney appear to be now discoverable, but since the important little sketch, Plate
12, fig. 3, of Brynry’s memoir, was made by Mr. Bowman, who was an accomplished
botanist—made too when all the fragments of the original specimen were in his own
possession—I presume that it may be accepted as representing a true form. If so,
it certainly approaches nearer to what we find in my plant than any other hitherto
described. If so, however, the objects which Mr. Binney designated macrospores,
must be regarded as sporangia, which the rows of similar interbracteal spheres in my
Volkmannia Dawsoni certainly are.

Notwithstanding the above facts, this subject would have been left in a very
unsatisfactory position had not Professor Cu. E. Weiss fortunately obtained in
Germany a specimen, which he has named Bowmanites Germanicus.t These
figures correspond so closely with those of Mr. Bowman reproduced in Mr. Bryney’s
memoir, that the genus Bowmanites can now be accepted as representing an
extremely distinct type of Calamarian fructification, But until my memoir on
B. Dawsoni was published, nothing was known of the internal organisation of this
fruit ;{ and until now, nothing was known of the structure of its vegetative organs.

But my friend, Mr. Georce Wixp, of Bardsley, near Ashton-under-Lyne, whose
name has so often been recorded in these Memoirs, brought me the section represented
in Plate 15, fig. 19, and which is beyond all doubt a transverse section of a stem of
