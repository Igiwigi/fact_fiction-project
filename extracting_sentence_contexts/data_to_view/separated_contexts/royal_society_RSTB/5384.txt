On the two dorsolateral sides of the centrum there are fibrous connective tissue cells. There are cartilaginous cells within the osseous ring of the intervertebral element, which
is the ball, and the outer ring is the socket (fig. 32). The Adult Atlas (first) Vertebra. (Text-fig. 1.)

That the so-called odontoid process is the intervertebral element is certain, from the
fact that it is a projection of the vertebral body, on the two lateral aspects of which
there are the cups for the articulation with the occipital condyles. On the anterior
portion of the dorsal surface there is a median ridge-like structure, the neural spine,
whose posterior wall forms the supradorsal. There are two lateral shelf-like projections
of the neural arch, which are formed by the projections of the connective tissue arches.
