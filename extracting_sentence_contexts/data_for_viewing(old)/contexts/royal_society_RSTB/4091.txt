The Larva (External).—Gastrula elongates and blastopore migrates ventralwards ;
stomodzeal pit and circumoral depression form near middle of ventral surface ; preoral
and postoral bands merge at first into an antero-dorsal strongly ciliated area ; these
bands next continuous as in auricularia, then divided producing bipinnaria type.
The typical larval ciliated processes grow out, all relatively long, slender and freely
movable, especially the postero-lateral pair. The brachia have the preoral band
continued over them, and have truncated ends bearing six to eight papille.
Sucker well marked with usually two papille on each side of it; posterior part of
larval body becomes disc-like and shows five arm rudiments in crescentic series ; an
certain other starfish (4. vulgaris, Fixup, 23; and A. glacialis, GortTE, 32), may well be related to the

fact that the anterior coelom has had added on to it the task of forming the paired middle and posterior
ccelomic regions (p. 234) in larve which are increasing rapidly in length,

interval (aboral brachiolarian notch) between the antero-dorsal and antero-ventral
arm rudiments (rudiments II and 1),

Ciliation persists from blastula stage onwards, but becomes lessened over general
surface ; ciliated bands are locomotor except transverse portion of preoral band ;
special adoral ciliation consists of peristomal ring and cesophageal loop and acts towards
