9 and 10, Plate 4. The blastopore itself
would then be represented, in the knot of Specimen Y, by the line of continuity
between the vesicular ectoderm and the knot-tissue around the central cell-plug. And the latter is, in fact, surrounded and limited by a sulcus, the peripheral
boundary of which would represent the blastoporic rim. In text-fig. 6, we present
a schematic surface-projection of the central plug in relation to the rest of the
knot, showing its overlapping anteriorly.
