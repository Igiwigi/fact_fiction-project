be Cr, Cr», Crs, ..., and the viscosity of the whole » = Cyr = CR, if R is the radion
of the whole, since R = Sr.

We have determined the values of the radions for K, Na and Cl ions in Part IIT. (g)
of this paper. In extending the conception of the radion to the molecules of the
solvent or to other molecules, its magnitude in any particular case must be measured
in the same ionic units, and by reference to the scale furnished by the ions whose
radions we have determined. Thus we know, upon our theory, the radions of K and
Cl ions, which are approximately equal, and we find that the introduction of such
ions into water makes, speaking roughly, no change in the viscosity of the water. This
tells us at once (if we neglect the small change in the water radion which is probably
produced by the solute) that the radion of water'is of about the same magnitude as
the radions of the K and Clions, As a fact, the introduction of these ions slightly
diminishes the viscosity of water and hence the radion of the uncombined water in
the solution should be somewhat greater than the radions of K and Cl ions.

There is good reason for believing that the introduction of a solute into water
somewhat lowers the radion of water, since the process of abstraction of water
molecules by the solute breaks up some of the molecular complexes of the un-
combined water and therefore lowers the average molecular size of the un-combined
water. The investigation of the amount of this lowering is a complex matter, and
we shall neglect it, as it does not seriously affect the general character of our results,
though it involves a slight loss of accuracy.

The fundamental constant C of our viscosity equation is calculated from the
