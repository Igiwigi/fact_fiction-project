When the rolling begins, the
higher parts of the masts, by reason of their inertia, remain behind the lower por-
tions, and the masts bend ; as the rolling proceeds they receive an independent motion

* If the ship be under sail, the rate at which she sxils and the distances of the waves from one another, mea-
sured in the direction in which she sails, are also among the conditions on which her rolling depends.

+ This cyclical antagonism and concurrence of the independent oxcillations of the waves and the ship will
interfere, to a certain extent, with the tautochronism of the ship's oscillations. CONCLUSIONS APPLICABLE 'TO SHIP-BUILDING. 637

from their elasticity, influenced, besides this canse, by their weight and length, and
this motion assumes the form of an independent oscillation, affecting more or less
the oscillatory motion of the vessel itself. If, at the-instant when the ship would otherwise begin to roll back, the elasticity
of its /masts is 'in the act of carrying them forwards, there will be a violent strain of
the sbip, which would not take place in a ship 80 constructed or 80 loaded as to
create that synchronism of the independent oscillations of the vessel and its masts,
which is implied in the fact that she does not strain herself in rolling.

42. The properties of different ships with regard to the strain they suffer in rolling,
and whether, in respect to the seas which are of most frequent occurrence, they roll
easily or heavily, are probably well known, s0 that, it would be possible to fix upon
some ship of each class which might in this respect serve as a standard with which
other ships of that class might be compared. The time of oscillation proper and
peculiar to this ship might also be ascertained by experiment.
