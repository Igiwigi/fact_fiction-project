It is therefore possible that it really represents a detached
anterior part of the parachordal, analogous to that found transiently in birds, and may
be a relique of an original segmentation of the parachordal cartilage. D. M. 8S. WATSON ON THE ACANTHODIAN FISHES 125 The jaws of Acanthodians are remarkable for the fact that in all of them the lower
jaw is longer than the upper, exactly as the ventral part of each of the other visceral
arches is longer than its dorsal end. The jaws are also remarkable because both upper
and lower may be, and presumably at some stage of development always were, formed
of two cartilages which, as Reis and JAEKEL have shown, are directly comparable with
the corresponding elements of the branchial arches. (The bone supporting the otic
process of the palato-quadrate in Acanthodes is probably a neomorph.)
