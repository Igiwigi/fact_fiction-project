in this study [16] together with pointing jitter adds noise to the structure factor amplitude
determination in crystals with a very small mosaic spread which has as a consequence that all
spots are partial and extraction of accurate structure amplitudes is hindered. A very workable
approach in the processing of such data is to record the mean energy determined by a bent
crystal spectrometer on a shot-to-shot basis which is routinely used in SFX crystallographic
data processing [17-24]. Both Monte Carlo as well as post-refinement use the recorded mean
energy as a single parameter needed to address the fluctuating X-ray spectrum, which has a
very fine structure [22,25]. It has been surprising therefore that when running the XFEL in a
self-seeded mode a strong improvement in the SFX data processing statistics was not seen [26]
as would be expected. Reliable quantification of all physical contributions to the uncertainty of


the measurement is in fact not yet obtained and future investigations would be of great interest
to the SFX community. Instead, the field is relying on averaging as a principle technique when
executing and processing multi-crystal SFX datasets of still images with high partiality, and
predictions of the sensitivity of difference measurements cannot generally be made with sufficient
statistical certainty.

General protocols have now been developed for the successful execution of flash-induced
time resolved structural biology [27-29]. Provided that appropriate optical measurements
are done on actual crystals, the technique is in principle only limited by the value of the
primary quantum yield, if all other requirements are met for good-quality crystallography of
micro-crystals. Of course, the amplitude of the real-space displacement, the scattering cross
sections, X-ray wavelength, space group symmetry and dimensions and Debye-Waller factors
are further considerations that determine the magnitude of the electron density differences.
