In the book that I am writing on this subject, I give numerous examples of intermediate figures
in the history of science whose work may have been pivotal even if it may have been regarded as
‘wrong’ in retrospect. My favourite example is the case of the theoretical physicist and mathematician William
Nicholson, who was the first to propose the quantization of angular momentum in atomic
physics [28]. Although this fact is reasonably well known, at least to historians of physics, what
is not so well known is Nicholson’s accompanying theory based on a completely ‘wrong’ set of
assumptions about proto-atoms that exist in space and give rise to our terrestrial elements. By
means of this theory, Nicholson succeeded in accommodating numerous lines in the spectrum of
several stellar nebulae and also that of the solar corona. In addition, he was able to successfully
predict the existence of some prominent new lines in the spectrum of these astronomical bodies
and phenomena.
