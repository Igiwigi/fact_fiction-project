limited number plus the fact that no new insecticides have
been approved for vector control by WHO in the last 30
years has greatly increased the threat of resistance and the sus-
tainability of chemical insecticides for vector control. Pyrethroid
insecticides are particularly vulnerable as they are the only
insecticide class recommended for ITNs [27,28]. Between 2008
and 2010 more than 254 million ITNs have been delivered to
malaria endemic countries in Africa [9,29,30], which has
resulted in a significant reduction in the disease mortality
and morbidity [31,32].
