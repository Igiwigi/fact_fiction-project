existence of degeneration furnishes us with positive evidence as to the presence of a
direct path, its absence does not exclude the existence of such a path.

The embryological method, which affords a very fair control of the degeneration
method, was instituted by Fiecusi¢ and has since been extended by BecutErew and
others. It gives a fair indication of the proportionate number or quantitative relation
of the elements which go to make up any one channel, whether direct or indirect,
but beyond this, and the all important localisation of positiqn, it does not carry us.
By a special histological method, intraduced by Goxal, the anatomical relation of the
paths in the developing cord have recently received a fuller demonstration, at his
hands as well as Koutiker’s, Ram6n y CaJAt’s and others,

Tt will be convenient to tabulate the facts according as they relate to

Functional Activity of Centres.

As regards Centres, the position assumed in the introduction* is, we believe, as a
matter of fact, tacitly in the minds of observers, if not admitted, and the influence of
“basal centres” is not so overwhelmingly important as originally supposed by the
older observers. To conveniently combine, therefore, the results without doing
