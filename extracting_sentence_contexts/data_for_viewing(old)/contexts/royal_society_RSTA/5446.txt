This example illustrates a much more general property of quantum invariants.
Often they are captured by a generating function that allows two different
expansions. These two expansions and the corresponding interpretations are an
example of a duality transformation. Such dualities point to deep symmetries
underlying quantum field theory. Naively, a quantum field theory is described by
a path integral over a space of classical fields. However, many phenomena such
as duality symmetries are not readily explained within that framework. In fact,
it is well known in physics that a single theory can have various weakly coupled
descriptions in terms of very different sets of fields. Even fundamental properties
such as the gauge group are not invariant.

Other ‘quantum results’ involve seeing structure in algebraic topology by
packaging cohomology groups of related spaces together. There are many
examples of this type of activity. A beautiful case is the S-duality of a special
class of V = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories (Vafa & Witten 1994). These
encode a set of invariants that are close cousins of the Donaldson invariants. The
generating function of these theories takes the form
