climate has varied in the past. Shindell’s (2007) paper argues that the modern-
day climatic variations associated with rapid warming of oceans, ice sheets,
methane hydrates and the impact of human societies can be studied through case
studies of dramatic events of recent climate history. He uses palaeoclimate
modelling and the evidence of marine sediments to analyse the cessation at the
end of the ice age of the North Atlantic Ocean thermohaline deep ocean
circulation. During the Younger Dryas warming period, starting about 10 kyr
ago, the global climate briefly returned to glacial conditions when in the year
8200 BC, a huge freshwater lake on North America flooded into the North
Atlantic Ocean. Equally important are vegetation—climate dynamics, which for
example determined the end of the African Humid Period. In the middle of our
current interglacial (warm period) ca 5.5 kyr ago, the Sahara suddenly dried out
and became the extensive desert we have today. The fact that vegetation changes
can happen at the time scale of decades is illustrated by modern data from Lake
Chad. In 1963, it was the sixth largest lake in the world; by 2001 reduced rainfall
had shrunk it to the tenth largest in the world.

Ice sheets are also not as stable as once was thought which is significant for the
future of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets. With continued climate
change causing melting of these sheets would lead to such enormous volumes of
water being discharged into the ocean that there could be a 4-6 m of rise in sea
level around the world. Another dangerous consequence could result from the
release of large quantities of methane hydrates from beneath the ocean.
Geologists have deduced that such an event occurred in the past, ca 55 Myr
(ago), in response to sustained global warming and at that time added another
