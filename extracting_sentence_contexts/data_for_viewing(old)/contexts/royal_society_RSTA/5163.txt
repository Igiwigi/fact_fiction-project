is not straightforward owing to the smeared representation of the structure. Despite extensive
literature on the numerical modelling of FSIs, this post-processing difficulty has been scarcely
addressed [22,23]. This study shows that one of the main differences between DB and immersed-
body type approaches is the location of the pressure extrema. In the DB approach, the maximum
pressure occurs at the cylinder boundary, which is in accordance with experimental observations.
In the IS approach, the pressure lines close in the shell as shown by figure 3. Thus, the pressure
extrema are located close to the first node of the fluid mesh where the shell concentration field
equals zero. This occurs at a distance R* ~R+ A+ 1. from the cylinder centre, where R is the
cylinder radius, A is the thickness of the shell surrounding the cylinder and /, is the edge length
of the fluid-mesh elements around the shell. This is only an estimation of R*, because it further
depends on where the shell and fluid meshes intersect one another within one fluid element.
As a result, the aerodynamic forces in the IS results are obtained by integrating the pressure
and viscous forces on the surface of the fictitious cylinder of diameter D* = 2R*. Table 1 shows
the drag coefficient obtained using the DB and IS approaches. The results obtained by the two
methods are very close, and also match the values reported in the literature [24,25]. This is also
apparent from the time evolutions of the lift CL and drag Cp coefficients at Re = 200, as shown by
figure 4. The continuous line shows the result for the IS method, circles show the solution of Rajani
et al. [26], and triangles show the solution of Meneghini et al. [27]. The agreement is acceptable,
also considering the dispersion of the results given by other studies, see for example [28]. Finally,
based on the frequency of oscillations of the drag coefficient at Re = 100, the Strouhal number was
found to equal St = fD/uo = 0.166, which is also in agreement with the literature.
