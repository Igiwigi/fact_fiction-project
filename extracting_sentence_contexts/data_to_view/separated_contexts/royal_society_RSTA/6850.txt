In practice, however, the values of 9W/dJ, and dW/dJ, obtained from
them are so inaccurate, particularly at the lower values of J, and J,, that this theoretical
advantage is largely lost. However, even though this possible ambiguity in the form for
W must be admitted, it remains true that the various load-deformation relations considered
can be interpreted, within experimental error, in terms of a single form for W. The fact that this form for Wis such that 0W/d1, is not zero represents a departure from the
prediction of the kinetic theory of rubber-like elasticity which leads (Treloar 1943) to the

expression w- Cll, —3), (19-2)

in which C is a constant. This raises the question of the molecular mechanism which gives
rise to the departure—a problem which will not be pursued here. Much of the discussion of the individual experiments has been concentrated on the finer
details of the experimental results, with the effect that certain broad features may have been
obscured.
