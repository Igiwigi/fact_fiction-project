changes are included. On the views there deyeloped, every chemical change is con-
8idered as determined |by the mutual attraction of particles, or groups of particles, in
opposite polar conditions. No & priori presumption can be raised that certain particles
are susceptible of this polarization, and others not ; this point can be determined by
experiment alone: and I brought forward several examples, the applicability of which
is now very generally admitted, in illustration of the point that the elemental bodies, at
the moment, of chemical change, exhibit the same phenomena of polarization and are
subject to the same laws of dizeresis and synthesis as all other chemical substances. On
these ideas, as we regard the weight of two volumes of oxygen, that is to say the weight of
a molecule of oxygen, O,, as differing from the weight of two volumes, that is, the weight
of a molecule of water, Hy O, in the fact that this weight contains 16 parts of oxygen in
the place of 2 of hydrogen, s0 do we regard the event of the synthesis or dizeresis of
oxygen as differing from the event of the synthesis or dizeresis of water, in the fact that
in the one change the two atoms of oxygen fulfil the same functions, and are respectively
in the same polar conditions as the two atoms of hydrogen and the one atom of oxygen
in the other.

'This theory is of a purely relative character ; it is connected with no special hypo-
thesis as to the nature of oxygen or water, but it states that, if we make a certain
