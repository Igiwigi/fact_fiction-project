'The stream lines will of course in general be closed curves, having their extremities

To find the point where the two sets meet on the tore, we notice that the stream line

© there goes to infinity, and its value is the same as for a point on the axis, ib is, in fact,
a part of the same stream line. For this p=0 ; hence the point on the tore, where
this stream line meets it, is given by the value of v, which satisfies the equation

the point of division must lie inside a tangent from the centre to the tore.
