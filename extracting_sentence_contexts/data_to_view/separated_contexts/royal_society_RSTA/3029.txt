conditions did have a positive control on DMSP production (table 3), but were of much less
importance than the community composition and total organic biomass, both of which were
influenced strongly by sea-ice melt. On the contrary, phytoplankton use DMSP as an osmolyte,
and hence reduced concentrations are to be expected when algae have to adapt to lower salinities
in an ice melt event. The fact that the opposite is shown in the present study indicates the release
of ice-associated algae with high concentrations of DMSP as the primary driver of the changes in
DMSP that we observe. While it could be expected that the release of intracellular DMSP—and
conversion to DMS—would increase upon ice melt as ice algae are introduced to relatively fresh
melt water, there was no correlation between DMS(P)d and salinity in the present study. A more detailed investigation of the phytoplankton-pigment fingerprint also showed a
correlation between DMS(P)t and DMS(P)d with zeaxanthin (data not shown).
