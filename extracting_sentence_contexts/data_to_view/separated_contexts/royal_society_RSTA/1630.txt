Determination of Roots of A; = 0. To determine the roots of the equation A, = 0 it is necessary to assume a value
for 6 and a value for P, and to calculate the values of the determinant formed by
taking the first 1, 2, 3, 4,..., rows and columns of A;. Owing to the fact that
all the diagonal terms after the first two are equal to 1 the actual numerical value of
the determinant converges to a definite limit. Taking a value of 4 and a series of
suitable values of P, the value of P for which A; changes sign is found by interpolation. This is the root of A; = 0 which corresponds with the particular value of 4 chosen.
