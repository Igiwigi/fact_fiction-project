S Ficure 9. Calculated mass distribution, Atlantic section.
Lower surface of crust 1, on Airyâ€™s hypothesis ; 2, calculated.

1:18 toallow for the fact that the topography has been assumed compensated outside zone O.
These figures represent the mass-distribution condensed on a plane at this depth and it
can be seen that the centre of gravity of the compensation for the Airy hypothesis with
T = 40 km. is not far from 36 km. In both cases the density of the crust has been taken
as 2:67 and that of the substratum as 3-27. We see that the calculated thickness of the crust
is less below the shallow water and greater below the sloping edge of the shelf than would
be found if the compensation were local. A thinner crust is also found at the western end
of the section, as would be expected in view of the positive isostatic anomaly found here.
