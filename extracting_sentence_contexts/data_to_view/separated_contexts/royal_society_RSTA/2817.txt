The line 6269'28 is separated from 6266°36 by 6°44, and is
therefore possibly the lateral (+28) D,, (5). The table shows of course the known essential difference between the behaviour of
the elements of Group 2 and that of Groups 1, 3, 6, signified by the signs of « in the
formula. It consists in the fact that in Group 2 the orders are formed in succession
by the addition of multiples, whilst in the others it is by subtraction, with the
exception that Cu and Ag of Group 1 are additive. But there are certain other
features which appear between the different sub-groups when higher orders are
looked at. The alkalies all show a gradually decreasing decrement with a sudden
dive.
