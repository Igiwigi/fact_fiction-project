These three themes challenge classical attitudes held by proof theorists in the past, and we
expect them to gather even more momentum in the future. The content of this issue should serve
as a good starting point for future work, particularly for future young researchers in the field.
Because of this, the articles have mostly been written with an open-ended attitude and indicate
various open problems.

Before moving on, let us mention some promising Modern Perspectives in Proof Theory, which
in an ideal world would have also been covered in this issue.

(a) Provability logic and its models

Provability logic studies the abstract properties of the provability relation. A good source for the
subject is Boolos [12]. By using the tools of modal logic, one can state simple facts about it, such
as Gédel’s incompleteness theorem:

oT > OO,

an instance of the more general Léb axiom, O(O¢ > ¢) > Di. Solovay [13] proved that the
provability logic of Peano Arithmetic can be axiomatized by Kripke’s axiom K, Léb’s axiom and
the rules modus ponens and necessitation. The resulting modal system is called GL. Segerberg [14]
proved the relational completeness of GL. Solovay’s proof is general and works for other systems
such as ZFC, but it notably fails for systems which are much weaker than PA and/or constructive. A
solution to the problem of characterizing the provability logic of Heyting Arithmetic has recently
been announced by Mojtahedi.
