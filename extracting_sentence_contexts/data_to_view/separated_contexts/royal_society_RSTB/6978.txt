The latter
I shall consider later (p. 120). The former has two possible channels for exit: down through
the rostral valve into the long peduncular vessel, or, more posteriorly, into the dorsal
prosomal space. That it does in fact take the former route is shown by the existence of the
valve itself. Since the days when Harvey first demonstrated the function of valves in blood
vessels, anatomists have taken the existence of a valve in a blood vessel as proof that blood
moves through the valve in one direction, that direction being determined by the arrange-
ment of the flap or flaps of the valve. The paired flaps of the rostral valve of Lithotrya are
so arranged that the blood can pass between them down into the peduncle, but not in the
reverse direction.
