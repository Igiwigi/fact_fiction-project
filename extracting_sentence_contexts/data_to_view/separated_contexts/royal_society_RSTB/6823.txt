These cells are thought to belong to the

with broad, dark outlines. These cells are distinct from those of group (2) above,

are not a cutinized layer, but an unresistant layer occasionally impregnated with fat
during decay. A REVISION OF WILLIAMSONIELLA 325

strated is the cutinized apex of the micropyle which is almost fully developed.
