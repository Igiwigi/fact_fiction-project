Comment. Two particular results follow from this theorem, the first of which will be used
repeatedly below. Using the fact that (s?S! | var | s?S') = 0 from table 9, part VII, it follows
from (b) that

ghere X and Y are similar connected sets of co-detors with S' symmetry, with all their
@ementary functions orthogonal to sd and sB.

5 Using the fact that —C(sA?S'sBsC'S!w, sAsCS!sB?S!0) = —1 (12)
gad (sA?S! sBsCS! w | var | sAsCS! sB?S!) = 2[sAsC | sBsC]? (13)

(sA?S! sBS! XS! | var | sA?S! sB?S! YS!) = (X| var | Y), (11)

Ghese results follow from a detailed examination, but will not be proved here as they are
Ea, consequence of a theorem which will be proved in the next part of this series),
ad (0 , it follows that
