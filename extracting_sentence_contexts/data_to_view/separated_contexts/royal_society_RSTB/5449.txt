â€˜To each side of the middle line a great change
has taken place, certain cells have enlarged greatly and taken up a position on the inner
side of the germ band against the mesoderm. The outer ends of these cells may still
remain inserted between the remaining cells of the ectoderm, indicating their origin. The large cells, of which there are at first three rows on each side, are sharply distin-
guished from the remainder by the fact of their paler-staining cytoplasm and their large
vesicular, nearly spherical, nuclei (fig. 24). This is the first step in the differentiation
of the ventral nerve cord, and at the stage reached we have recorded the segregation of
lateral rows of neuroblasts from the outer smaller dermatoblasts of the covering
ectoderm. Though these lateral neuroblasts play a major part in forming the ventral nerve
cord, certain cells which lie between the two lateral neuroblast tracks are also neurogenic,
viz., those of the median cord.
