lines and mixtilinear triangles therein exhibited cannot be called
natural signs, since they are only imperfect and inadequate
representations of other imaginary lines and triangles, of which
the mind must form what notion it can. Not, however, to infer
want of perspicuity from inefficiency in the cause assigned, if
we employ the geometrical method, or view its employment in
investigation, concerning motion, curves, &c. it will not appear
a perspicuous method ; and, if instances of its obscurity were re-
quired of me, I could find them, even in the immortal work of
the Principia. Whether we consider the fact, or speculate about
the cause, I think the geometrical method can only be allowed
to have superior evidence in investigations of a simple nature. That the analytical calculus is more commodious for the de-
duction of truth than the geometrical, will not perhaps be con-
tested; and, an examination into its nature, would shew why it
is 80 well adapted for easy combination and extensive gene-
ralization, No language like: the language of analysis, one of
the greatest of modern mathematicians has observed, is capable
of such elegance as flows from the developement of a long
series of expressions connected one with the other, and all de-
pendent on the same fundamental idea. If we view what has been respectively done by each method,
in the explanation of natural phenomena, the superiority of the
one above the other will appear immense : yet the cultivators
of geometry were men of consummate abilities, and possessed
this great advantage, that the method or instrument of thought
and reasoning which they employed had, during preceding
times, received the greatest improvement.
