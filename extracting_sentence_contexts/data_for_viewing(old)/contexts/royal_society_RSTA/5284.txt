transition between the drift and oscillatory localized states, belongs to the saddle-node instability,
as the potential energy has a maximum value there.

If w exceeds the values corresponding to curve 2, the solitons first drift to the right over a
short spatial interval, which is limited to half a period of the periodic loss-modulation function
L(x), which is followed by damped oscillations (figure 1f). Eventually, this swinging soliton
transforms into a stationary one, located to the right of the input position (x=0), as seen in
figure 1f, where the output position of the new soliton is Xout © 2.3. When @ exceeds the critical
value corresponding to curve 3 (ar = 0.54), the soliton decays under the action of heavy losses
(figure 1g).

The drift and swing of solitons arise as a consequence of the gradient force induced by the
spatially inhomogeneous loss. In fact, the inhomogeneity of the loss breaks the gain—loss balance
of the dissipative soliton, causing the soliton to drift to an appropriate position in order to
maintain its stability. In the course of drifting, the profile of the dissipative soliton keeps changing
owing to the combined effects of the gain and loss, and of the diffraction and self-focusing
