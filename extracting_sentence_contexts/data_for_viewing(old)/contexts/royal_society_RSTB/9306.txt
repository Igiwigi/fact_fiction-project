Total numbers of white blood cells are preserved (or even
elevated) in malnourished children, while the number of
dendritic cells, which are required to present antigens to
adaptive immune cells, tends to be reduced compared. with
well-nourished children [12]. The majority of studies show
some functional impairment of neutrophils and reduced
levels of complement proteins [12], both of which are critical
components of innate defence against bacterial infections.
Malnourished children are able to mount a robust acute
phase response to infection; in fact, some studies have reported
that, even in the absence of infection, malnutrition is generally
a pro-inflammatory disease [12].
