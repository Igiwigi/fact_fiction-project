The
proportionality between the displacement and the pressure is apparent from the
diagram, and is approximately linear. In Section 7, p. 224, this point is further
examined. â€˜The diagram further illustrates the fact that the lines are capable of
resolution into two groups according to their rates of displacement, a feature which is
more fully treated later. The diagram includes both reversed and bright lines, but does not distinguish
between them. Without exception the former fall into the group with the
smaller displacement.
