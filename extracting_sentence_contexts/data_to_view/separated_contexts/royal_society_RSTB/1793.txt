It is at the period when the difference in character of the tapetal and sporogenous
cells becomes clearly marked, both by form and contents, that these anomalies, of
which in early stages it is difficult to be sure, may be studied with some degree of
certainty. The sporogenous tissue does not appear to be always strictly limited to
so regular groups of cells as those previously described : thus in fig. 21, a packet of
cells, evidently the result of subdivision of one, projects beyond the neighbouring
group, though it shares their characters ; this case, which is uncommon, was veritied
by comparing the whole series of microtome sections through that loculus, and there
is no doubt of the fact. We may compare this with what has been described in
Isoetes in a former Memoir (‘ Phil. Trans.’
