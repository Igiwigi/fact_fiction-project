In like manner the degree in which extension of the field affects
the anterior and posterior borders is much greater than that to which it affects the
dorsal and ventral borders. (Vide supra, p. 687, and experiments on pp. 688, 689,
with figs. 3 and 4.) â€˜

One is now in a better position for determining the nature of the distortion

triangle, with the apex at the hallux, and the base on the front of the thigh
exhibiting a deep notch in it. This notch is an exaggerated repetition of the
similar notch seen in the anterior border of the IVth lumbar field. In order to
determine the extent of this posterior border it is necessary to use the facts already
| found. One has found that in the case of the IVth lumbar field a piece of the dorsal
edge turns outward over the ilio-sacrum to the thigh, that is to say, the mid-dorsal line
. of the body turns abruptly outward and begins to descend the outer aspect of the
thigh. One has also found that the ventral border of the immediately preceding
root-field, the [Vth lumbar, instead of lying at the median line of the venter, lies at
ia the median edge of the thigh, over the septum between the adductor and flexor
a muscle groups of the thigh.
