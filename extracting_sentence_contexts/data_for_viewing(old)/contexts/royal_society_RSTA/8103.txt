Let us now temporarily choose for origin O the centre of rotation of the infinitesimal rigid

body displacement of the tooth. (This can always be done unless the displacement of
the tooth is a pure translation, a case which we shall discuss later.) We have then

and the pressure gradient is

Xeferring to (70), we see that K/K has a simple interpretation ; if we replace the
section of the membrane by a fictitious wire whose linear density is equal to 1/h®, then
K®/K® is equal to the square of the radius of gyration of this fictitious wire about the
centre of rotation O. Accordingly. by (74) and (65). we may state this result :

THEOREM V.—In the general two-dimensional problem, the points of the membrane
at which the pressure p has maximum and minimum values are situated on a cirele whose

centre is the centre of rotation of the tooth, and whose radius is equal to the radius of
gyration about that centre of rotation of a fictitious wire coincident with the section of the
membrane by the plane of the displacement, and having a linear density equal to the cube
