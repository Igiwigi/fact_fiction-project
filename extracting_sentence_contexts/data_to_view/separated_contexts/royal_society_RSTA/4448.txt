These benefits can arise simply from the fact that nanoparticles may, through a combination of
their small size and adjustable surface chemistry, be made highly dispersible or soluble [1-4],
allowing simple solution-based processing for the formation of coatings, thin films or dense
structured ceramics. Moreover, materials confined to the nanoscale often display properties vastly
different from those of their bulk counterparts. The reduction in size may lead to changes in
structure and an increase in surface defects, as demonstrated in the case of ceria [5,6].
