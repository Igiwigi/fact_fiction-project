electrodes might possibly always be brighter than the other. Accordingly a plan
was adopted of continually reversing the current in the primary coil by means of a
wheel attached to the commutator of the coil, which was made to rotate by means
of a motor. Unfortunately the exposures required in the photographic work were
thereby greatly increased. The experiments, however, show that the average
illumination obtained from each electrode is, for all purposes with which we are
concerned, practically the same.

Eve OBSERVATIONS.

The accuracy of these observations has been found to depend, to a very large
extent, upon experience on the part of the observer in dealing with the relative
intensity of the lights placed side by side. It is, of course, a familiar fact in
photometry that it is very difficult to form a judgment as to the equality of two
illuminated surfaces when the illumination is either very feeble or very powerful ;
and accordingly this is a source of considerable inaccuracy in such determinations.
It is not desirable in either case to examine the relative intensity attentively for any
length of time, as it is obviously possible, by viewing two feebly illuminated surfaces
side by side for a sufficiently long time, to imagine that they are almost equal when
really they are not so, and this remark appears to be particularly applicable to such
cases in which the two colours are of slightly different tints. Instances have arisen
in which it has been impossible to arrive at any result whatever as to the relative
intensity. In such cases, however, the difference of tint was conspicuously marked.

It is preferable, when the observations are made by eye, to make a large number
