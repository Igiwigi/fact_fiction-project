A straightforward calculation yields the density matrix describing this mixture

= (P+Q7)/4A? 4g ((Q—2ge)?+(Q'—2ge)?)/4A?
= e +e . 5.7. Pex= oR ( ) 6.7)
The distance between pex and ®¢, the state of the pointer after coupling to an eigenvalue, is
———_—__— €
Dal@e, pex) =arccos ( (Pel pexl®e)) = $+ Ole). (6.8)

This is a significantly larger distance than (5.5). In fact, the distance (5.8) is of the same order as
(5.2) and cannot be neglected for small e. While the pointer states (5.4) and (5.7) for a small enough € correspond to similar probability
distributions, they are fundamentally different. As in the case of an eigenstate (5.1), the final
pointer state (5.4) corresponds to a shift of the original distribution given by a single number, the
weak value.
