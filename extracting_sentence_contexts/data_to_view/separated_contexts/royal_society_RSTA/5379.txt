This is exceedingly unfortunate, as it renders the establishment
of the algebra of vectors without metaphysics a very difficult matter, and in its
application to mathematical analysis there is a tendency for the algebra to get more.
and more complex as the ideas concerned get simpler, and the quaternionic basis forms
a real difficulty of a substantial kind in attempting to work in harmony with ordinary
Cartesian methods. Now, I can contidently recommend, as a really practical working system, the
modification I have made. It has many advantages, and not the least amongst them is
the fact that the quaternion does not appear in it at all (though it may, without
much advantage, be brought in sometimes), and also that the notation is arranged 86
as to harmonise with Cartesian mathematics. It rests entirely upon a few definitions,
and may be regarded (from one point of view) as a systematicaliy abbreviated
Cartesian method of investigation, and be understood and practically used by any one
accustomed to Cartesians, without any study of the difficult science of Quaternions. It is simply the elements of Quaternions without the quaternions, with the notation
simplified to the uttermost, and with the very inconvenient minus sign before scalar
products done away with.
