can be analysed by immunoblotting. However, it should be
noted that many surface-exposed proteins in bacteria are
inherently protease resistant, so negative results cannot be
interpreted with confidence, even if proper controls have
been done.

Using extracellularly added antibodies follows the same
logic as surface proteolysis. Antibodies can bind only
surface-exposed epitopes and this binding can be detected
either by using antibodies labelled with fluorescent dyes or
enzyme conjugates. Whole-cell antibody-based assays
include dot blots, whole cell ELISA, immunofluorescence
and FACS analysis [114-116]. However, cell fixation tech-
niques can disrupt OM integrity as well as producing other
artefacts and it is best for antibody labelling to be performed
with live cells [117].

Labelling techniques, especially biotinylation, are widely
used for proteomic discovery of surface-exposed proteins
because they do not require the generation of protein-specific
antibodies: labelled proteins can be easily affinity purified
and analysed by mass spectrometry [118,119]. Quantitative
proteomics can be also employed to study surface-exposed
proteins by comparing relative abundance of the protein
before and after the protease treatment [120]. Employing a
