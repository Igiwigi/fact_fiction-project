= This constitutes the latest stage which we have had.
Z  GrcexBauR (No. 6) has described the vertebral column in a somewhab older larva
<= of 18 centims.
S The chief points in which the vertebral column of this larva differed from ours are:
E (1) the disappearance of all trace of the primitive vertebral constriction of the noto-
E chord ; (2) the nearly completed constriction of the notochord in the intervertebral
= regions; (3) the complete ossification of the vertebral portions of the bodies of the
vertebre, the terminal so-called intervertebral portions alone remaining cartilaginous;
(4) the complete ossification of the basal portions of the hamal and neural processes
included within the bodies of the vertebrte, 80 that in the case of the neural arch all
trace of the fact that the greater part was originally nob formed in cartilage had
' become lost. The cartilage of the dorsal spinous processes Was, however, till
| persistent.
The only points which remain obscure in the later history of the vertebral column
| are the history of the notochord and of its $heath. We do nob know how far these
Â© are either imply absorbed or partially or wholly ossified.
