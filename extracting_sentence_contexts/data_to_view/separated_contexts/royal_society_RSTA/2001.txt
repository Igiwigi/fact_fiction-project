We have not explored to what extent our conclusions are model-independent. Additionally, some experimental and computational studies have suggested that acidosis may
play an important role in intracellular calcium handling, potentially generating pro-arrhythmic
delayed afterdepolarization events [58,59]. The simplifications adopted by the TT3 model prevent

it from capturing these dynamics, and our results may underestimate the impact of acidosis : =

In fact, the effects of ischaemia sit across multiple types of physics and multiple spatial scales 1B
that we have not taken into account. Hypoxia has been co-observed with oxidative stress, and : =
this combination involves multiple scales of cellular metabolism and leads to further reduction 8
