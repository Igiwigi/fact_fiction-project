has a derivative which does not vanish ; and hence, by a well-known theorem of the
differential calculus, that this function cannot be zero more than once in (y, 5). It is,
therefore, evident that by contracting (y, 5) sufficiently we can ensure for it the
additional property that (15) vanishes at no point belonging to it.

Returning now to the equation (14), and supposing that s is confined to the
interval (y, 6), we see that

f)=-feovoa/| sua.

Hence, since both the numerator and the denominator on the right are
differentiable, and the latter does not vanish in (y, 8), the function f(s) is
differentiable in this interval. In fact, by applying the ordinary rules, we obtain

f'(s)=0 (y=s38).

But this is impossible, because by our hypothesis f(s) cannot be constant in any
interval. We conclude, therefore, that x (s, ¢) is a definite function.

§20. It may be remarked that the conditions (1) and (2) of the preceding
paragraph may be stated in another and more convenient form. For, if a discrimi-
