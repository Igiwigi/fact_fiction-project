remained monotypic, how many of them have become ditypic, how many have become
genera of 3, 4, 5 species, and so on. he answer obtained to this question is that the
proportional frequencies of genera of 1, 2, 3 species may be expected to form a descending
geometric series (7.¢., a series with a common ratio less than unity). After one doubling

interval the frequencies should be proportional to 3, 4, 4, 4, and so on, the common
ratio being 4: after two doubling-periods the series should be }, #, ¢, and so on, the
common ratio being ; if @ is the first term of the series the common ratio must be
(1-a) to make the sum of the series unity. Clearly we are not in a position to compare
this deduction with the facts, for we cannot pick out any group of genera, let alone a
group of similar genera, which are all precisely of the same age.

We have, therefore, to proceed to the much more general problem. In the above,
generic mutations are ignored, attention being fixed on the primordial genera alone.
But during the long lapse of time generic mutations as well as specific mutations will
be thrown, and any observed distribution will include both the derived and the pri-
mordial genera : what will be the form of the distribution of size of genus in the resulting
aggregate? This question is considered in two successive sections of the paper. In
Section II the limiting form is found when the time elapsed from the beginning of evolu-
tion is taken as infinite, and then in Section III the practical problem is solved for finite
time. The mathematical results here are complicated : I would refer the non-mathe-
matical reader in the first place to Table II, p. 43, where a series of calculated distri-
