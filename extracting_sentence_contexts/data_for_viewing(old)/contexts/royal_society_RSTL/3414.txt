the parts of this very irregular surface, and even at its ends to examine fibrillee which
stand out from its central portion. All these fibrillee are marked by the alternate
light and dark points.

It bas occasionally happened, especially in the case of museles with bulky primitive
fasciculi, that in the manipulation with needles, preparatory to examination, a recent
fasciculus has been partially wounded, $0 that its interior is displayed. A specimen
in this state is presented in fig. 9, from the Boa. The fibrillze here seen are all marked.
This fact proves that marked fibrille exist in the interior of the fasciculus, and is not
at all controverted by the circumstance that sometimes the surface of snch a lacera-
tion does not show a structure of this kind, the violence inflicted by the instrument
being sufficient to account for the destruction or mutilation of parts of 80 much
delicacy.

If further evidence be wanting, it may be drawn from the writings of authors. It
is highly probable that Hooks *, when he hinted to the Royal Society that © he knew
of a method of making succedaneous muscles, to give one man the strength of ten or
twenty if required,” had in view these marked fibrillze, which he thought a series of
bladders. ProcyasKarÞ was 80 certain that the fibrilla were marked, or as he thought
flexuous in the interior of the fasciculus, that he framed a false hypothesis to explain
it, imagining that vessels, nerves, and cellular tisswe penetrated within the fasciculi,
