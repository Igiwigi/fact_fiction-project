Therefore, the original hopes for explanation of the large-scale homogeneity through the
homogeneous Mixmaster model did not work. Currently, the opposite direction is often cited
as popular, the ‘order leading to chaos’ point of view is generally preferred, cf. [2], p. 212.
A concrete suggestion for a ‘quiescent cosmology’, that is a universe with an isotropic initial
singularity instead of a chaotic initial state, was made already in 1978 by J. D. Barrow in [136],
and subsequently studied in detail by many workers in the field, cf. e.g. [137-139], and references
therein.

(f) The finite-action conjecture

The studies related to possible modifications of general relativity in conjunction with the works on
the existence and nature of cosmological singularities in the 1960s led to doubts as to the general
validity of many of the previous conclusions in cosmological models, and in fact to a host of new
and unexplored directions of research.

A unique characteristic of these early developments was the introduction of techniques
from global differential geometry, topology and dynamical systems into the field of general
relativity. The problem of the existence of cosmological singularities was adequately solved by the
singularity theorems in general relativity, but the nature of singularities remains a central problem
in relativistic cosmology until today.

However, many are convinced that the predicted singularities in all important cases are
accompanied by infinities in the curvatures and the thermodynamic properties of matter, and
therefore at the singularities general relativity breaks down beyond repair. Thus, many feel that
the proved existence of spacetime singularities in general relativity does not really point to a new
