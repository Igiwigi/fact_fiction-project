A mass of liquid having the form of a distorted circle, with its longer axis vertical,
formed around each needle at the point where it entered the film. The horizontal
wire of the cathetometer telescope was made to touch this circle at the top and bottom,
and the mean reading was taken as that proper to the needle. The ratio between the
mean diameter of these liquid masses and their distance apart was a necessary datum
in applying a correction to the direct results. 'This correction was necessitated by the
fact that the equipotential lines, which in the undisburbed film are horizontal circles,
are distorted in the neighbourhood of the liquid masses formed by the insertion of the
needles,

If @ be the mean radius of these circles of liquid,
b their distance apart,

then calculation shows that the observed resistance of the film between the needles
must be increased by the following percentages :â€”

percentage to be added = 6:1, 48, 34, 2'6, 2'2. The films, although they were all made from the s8ame solution and thinned under
apparently identical conditions, behaved very differently one from another.
