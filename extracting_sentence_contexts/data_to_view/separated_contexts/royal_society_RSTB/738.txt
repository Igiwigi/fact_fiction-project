152 PROFESSOR H. M. WARD ON THE GINGER-BEER PLANT,

masses in question enclose any other bodies, and the iodine test particularly convinces
the observer that, in the state I am referring to, the convoluted masses contain
nothing in the nature of a filament, rodlet, coccus, or spore of any kind; they are
masses of dead substance. I have found no dye stain them satisfactorily. Tn the other condition of the specimens, however, the microscope at once shows the
presence of the brilliant rodlets or filaments, straight, curved, or even coiled into
corkscrew-like forms of numerous turns; and the above-named reagents place beyond
all doubt the fact that the convoluted or vermiform masses of gelatinous matrix are
the swollen sheaths of the long or short rodlets and filaments just referred to,

This point established of course led to the conclusion that we have to do with a
form of Schizomycete with remarkably pronounced sheaths, and the facts observed
suggest that at certain stages, or under certain conditions, the sheaths may be found
devoid of the Schizomycete, either owing to the death and disintegration of the proto-
plasm and cells proper, or—an idea that arises subsequently—because the living
schizomycetous rods, &c., escape from the sheaths. As a matter of fact, I was led to the second conclusion, quite naturally, from the
results of the cultures which established the existence of the dead sheaths. Over and over again it was observed that, when minute pieces of the Ginger-beer
plant, as a whole, were employed for infecting the sterilised media—whether solid or
liquid, in tubes or flasks—the course of events was almost invariably the same,
namely, as follows :—During the first forty-eight hours or so the yeast multiplied
rapidly, and soon rendered the liquid media turbid ; and then fermentation came to a
head, and soon ceased—the yeasts falling to the bottom, or, in cases where the
Mycoderma was favoured, forming a thick film on the top.
