Chem. u, Mikrosk., bd. 2. s. 161, 173. OF INDIGO IN HUMAN URINE. 309

singular that I should 80 frequently have met with indigo in urine, the occurrence of
which has hitherto been deemed s0 rare, and not have fallen in with a single case
of cyanourine or uroglaucin, the presence of which might be considered, from the
inquiries of Braconnor, SCHERER and HeLLts, to be s0 much more common. Taking into consideration then the whole of the facts and observations recorded
in this communication, the following conclusions remain to be deduced :â€”

1st. That blue indigo is frequently formed in human urine ; the quantity being
subject to the greatest yariation. In some cases it is 80 considerable as to impart a
deep green or bluish-green colour to the whole urine, and to form a pellicle of nearly
pure indigo over the whole surface of the liquid.
