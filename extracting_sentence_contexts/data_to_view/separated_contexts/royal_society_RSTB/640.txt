Possibly
the points of difference between Forcur’s observations and my own are not so
numerous as would appear from what has just been said, as his schematic repre-
sentation, in order to show that each nerve root supplies muscles on both the anterior
and posterior surface of the limb leads to slight confusion as to whether certain of the
muscles are meant to be represented in certain roots; notably is this the case with
regard to the deltoid, which I find it difficult to imagine as represented in the eighth
cervical, much less the first dorsal nerve root. Corollary to Part IIT,—The question which next arose for consideration was whether
or no a single bundle of fibres representing a single simple movement ever remains
distinct in a nerve root during its course to the muscles it supplies without inos-
culating with other nerve fibres. That each bundle does remain distinct is, I think,
proved by the following facts :—-

(a.) If a bundle of nerve fibres is separated in a nerve root, it can, in the Dog, be
followed by dissection through the plexus and along the course of the nerve in which
it runs, to its termination either in a muscle or in the skin. *
