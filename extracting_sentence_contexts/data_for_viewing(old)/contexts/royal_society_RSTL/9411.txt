antagonistic to the effects of contraction. Though the work of that paper is correct, as I believe, yet the
fundamental aggumption is incorrect, and therefore tho regults are nob worthy of attention,


AND ON THE REMOTE HISTORY OF THE EARTH. 517

[Tt will however appear, I believe, that this secular change of ellipticity of the
earth's figure will exercise an important influence on the plane of the lunar orbit and
thereby will affect the secular change in the obliquity of the ecliptic. The investiga-
tion of this point is however as yeb incomplete. ]*

The other small tefm which I sball consider arises out of the ordinary precession,
together with the fact that the tide-generating force diminishes with the time on
account of the tidal] reaction on the moon.

The differential equations which give the ordinary precession are in effect (compare
equations (26))

and they give rise to no change of obliquity if 7 be constant, but
