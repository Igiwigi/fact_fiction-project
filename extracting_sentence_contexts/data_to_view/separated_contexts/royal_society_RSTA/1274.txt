Since UM k=1 Ti ;, 8 open and I(é) is a continuous function, it holds that

inf [(&)= inf [(é). FU Th bea Th
Moreover, since I(&) is continuous and Ut 1 Th ik Compact, the infimum is attained. The fact that
Ut Tj, 2a Ut Tj}, immediately implies that

inf [(é)< inf = I(&).

On the other hand, assume by contradiction that
