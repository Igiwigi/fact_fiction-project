When sulphate is formed in 8nch small quantities that it may be neglected, the simultaneons reactions
8npposed to occur are 1, 2, and 3, by quantities of the powder proportionate to the numbers +4, 4, and 4,
but when the snlphate amounts to 12 or 14 per cent., the simultaneous reactions s8upposed to occur are
Nos. 1, 3, 4, and 5, with quantities of powder corresponding to the numbers 4, about 4, 4, and Â£;. As
there is only one single instance out of twenty-nine analyses of powder residues in which the sulphate was
found to amount to as little as 4'6 per cent. of the solid products (the next lowest proportion being
nearly double that amount), it can scarcely be assxumed that M. BerrueLor's firs arrangement of
reactions can represent any but a most exceptional result. Again, the acceptance of his arrangement of
four equations in the proportions he indicates as accounting for the formation of the chief.products when
the sulphate amounts to 12 or 14 per cent. of the total constituents, involves the aszumption that a some-
what considerable proportion of charcoal shonld remain unoxidised ; in fact, nearly 2:5 per cent. of
carbon should be found in the residue. The detection and determination of such a constituent of powder-
residue does not inyolve any difficulty, yet there were only three instances ont of eighteen residues (in
which the 8ulphate was considerable in amount) where the charcoal was present in cstimable quantities ;
in two of these ib was below 1 per cent., in the other it was only 0'01 per cent. In a few other residues
only traces of charcoal were discoyered ; the larger number contained none.

These points are referred to in illustration of how imperfectly M. BerrneLon's nob very 8imple arrange-
ment of theoretical reactions correspond to the results actually obtained, even s0 far only as the chief
prodnets are concerned.
