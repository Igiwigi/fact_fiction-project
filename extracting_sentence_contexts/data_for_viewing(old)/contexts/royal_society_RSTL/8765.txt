one another by a flap of connective tissue (65). This flap of connective tissue, visible
also in fig. 2, is continuous with the slightly specialized connective tisxue which lies
between and separates the two series of successional teeth ; and an apparent use for it is
very obvious, though only actual observation can determine whether it has any other.
It would seem probable that it serves to keep the advancing tooth to its own side, as it
would be almost impossible for a tooth of the one series to get round it and 80 become
wrongly placed on the side appropriated to the other series; it would also serve, by
limiting the space in which the advancing tooth lies, to keep it straight—that is to say,
to prevent it from diverging to the one side or the other in its own length.

In fig. 1 the tooth already used (1) is about to be cast off, and its successor (2) has
already passed out, of the region where teeth are being developed, and is doubtless
becoming rapidly attached. In fact fig. 4 is a section from the very same specimen,
though, unfortunately for the comparison, the section has been mounted with the other
surface uppermost, 80 that the sides are transposed. However, » on the left of fig. 4 is

the very same tooth as » on the right of fig. 1, the first-named section being taken close
