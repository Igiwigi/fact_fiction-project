There can be no doubt that potassium, calcium, and scandium follow legitimately
their predecessors in the vertical columns, lithium, beryllium, and boron, and that
they are in almost certain relation with rubidium, strontium, and (but not so
certainly) yttrium. If argon be a single element, then there is reason to doubt
whether the periodic classification of the elements is complete; whether, in fact,
elements may not exist which cannot be fitted among those of which it is composed. On the other hand, if argon be a mixture of two elements, they might find place in
the eighth group, one after chlorine and one after bromine. Assuming 37 (the

approximate mean between the atomic weights of chlorine and potassium) to be the
atomic weight of the lighter element, and 40 the mean atomic weight found, and
supposing that the second element has an atomic weight between those of bromine,
80, and rubidium, 85:5, viz., 82, the mixture should consist of 93°3 per cent. of the
lighter, and 6°7 per cent. of the heavier element.
