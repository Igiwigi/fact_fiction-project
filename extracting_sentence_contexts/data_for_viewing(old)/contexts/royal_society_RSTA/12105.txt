thickness of the film, i.e., is not due exclusively to a peculiar molecular constitu
depending on the thickness. If this were so, the molecular conditions peculiar to
particular thickness would be immediately re-established as soon as the film reg ain
that thickness after disturbance.

We think that the next step should be to try to separate the effects due to t
pellicle and to the capillary forces if both co-exist. The pellicle is possibly due
chemical actions between the liquid and the atmosphere. An apparatus is in cour
of construction which will enable us to experiment in other gases more satisfactorl
than hitherto. For the moment we venture to lay our results before the Socie
without a full explanation. .

We believe that the main fact, viz., the change in the conductivity of an unsal

soap film is entirely new. We hope that the observations which we have made on it

will be of interest.
â€˜It is difficult to assign a reason why the addition of salt to the liquid should
uce so great a change in the results. In part, the better conducting salt
probably masks effects which when soap alone is used become predominant, but we
think it likely that in part at all events it actually prevents the changes to which
