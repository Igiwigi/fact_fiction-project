which surrounded the foramen magnum and roofed the hind brain for some distance.
This bone is perforated probably for the exit of occipital nerves, its relationship to the
vagus is not shown. It may be compared directly with the basi-occipital and ex-
occipitals of Acanthodes taken together. Apart from proportions the two agree well,
indeed very strikingly, in the identical character of the great backwardly opening
foramen which is interpreted by SrEnsio as the course of the radix aortae. The
anterior occipital described by STENsto (1934) in Leiosteus is clearly the homologue of
the featureless ventral bone below the otic region of Acanthodes.

The only representative of the otic region is a small isolated bone perforated by a
jugular canal and a hyoid vein in Pholidosteus friedeli. The position of this fragment
cannot be fixed and I believe that Srensto has placed it a good deal too far from
the middle line. I base this view on the fact that Srensio’s suggested restoration
of the relation of the neural cranium to the dermal roof (STENsto 1934, text-fig. 15)
cannot be right because it makes no allowance for the thickness of the dermal
bones.

In Deinichthys (HEINTZ 1932, text-fig. 13) the position and possible lateral extension
of the neural cranium in front of the occipital region are defined by deep flanges
descending from the dermal roof. The similar structures in Coccosteus have the same
distribution and in addition show entirely different surface features in the regions in
contact with the neural cranium and in the rest of the visceral surface of the skull
roof. Consideration of this evidence suggests that the ‘‘neural process” of Hemnrz in
Deinichthys abutted against the outer end of a post-orbital ridge which is the most
anterior part of the otic region in Pholidosteus.
