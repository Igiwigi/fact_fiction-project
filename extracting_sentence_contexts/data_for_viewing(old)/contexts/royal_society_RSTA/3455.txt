in comparison with [19-21], the dynamical behaviour of the decision functions (DFs; see below)
changes drastically. In particular, a sort of overall noise appears because of the presence of some
interference effects in the system.

2. Why quantum(-like)?

The original general idea of Bagarello [18] was to formally use creation and annihilation operators,
the basic building blocks of QFT, in macroscopic systems so one can possibly consider dynamical
systems. These operators can be used to represent very complex dynamical processes composed
of elementary acts of creation and annihilation of new states of systems. These states can be of
any nature: physical, mental, biological. This is the minimal interpretation of the QFT-inspired
approach. From this formal viewpoint, the application of the mathematical formalism of quantum
theory is just a matter of convenience, and in fact it proved to be useful in several applications in
different contexts [18-21].

In our concrete model, the states under consideration are possible strategies of players G1
and G2. The creation and annihilation operators are explored to model the process of how players reflect
upon their strategies. These reflections are composed of elementary acts of transition of the player’s
mental state from one strategy to another (‘annihilation’ of the previously chosen strategy and
‘creation’ of the opposite strategy). We remark that this model, as well as the quantum physical
model in general, is epistemic, i.e. it does not represent the internal (and extremely complex)
processes in the neural system leading to such transitions. It provides only the formal operator
representation of these transitions. However, this formal model is rather rich mathematically; see

7It is important to stress that in quantum theory ‘interactions’ cannot be imagined as actions of forces, as we know them
