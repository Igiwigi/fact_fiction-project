retrograde motion would have been uncandid, because it is
one which is strongly opposed to all the reasoning that it
contains. To abstain from giving any explanation, however
imperfect, that might reconcile it with my view of the sub-
ject, would be to leave untouched a very powerful, and almost
Solitary argument against the explanation which I have pro-
posed both of magnetic and electric rotation. I shall there-
fore attempt to show, not merely that it is not repugnant to
the principle which I have already explained, but that that
very principle may, in certain circumstances, produce the
retrograde motion, and that in others nearly similar, it shall
not take place; thus not merely showing the possibility of the
fact, but accounting for its apparently capricious nature.

In figure 2, N represents the end of an excited needle,
Situated above a metal plate C, and having a muslin screen
G interposed between them. All three being at rest, the
screen and the metal plate will become electric by induction,

and one of the two following arrangements must take place :
either the electricity developed on the screen and on the plate
will be of the same species, in which case it will be contrary
to that of the needle N; or the electricity on the screen and
the metal plate will be of different kinds, in which case one
of them must be of the same species, the other of a different
