Bt Chamber through the Flint-knife and Reindeer Galleries to the Steep Slide Hole,
aft the bottom of which was successively on the plane of the lower margins of the
#20ves themselves; while another stream came in at the road entrance and flowed to
he same Hole.”
Ate. BrisToWw, on the other hand, inclines to attribute some portion of the formation
the cave and the introduction of the shingle to marine action, at the time when the
was lower, and when, by the same marine action, the present valley was being exca-
*#ed,; and he observes that © the grinding-action of the waves and shingle may have
sted in widening a preexisting fissure and joint in the limestone, and have tended
ngterially to increase the dimensions of those parts of the cave which were being formed
»Batmospheric influences, coupled with the flow of water resulting from the filling and
»zptying of the cave at, eyery change of tide ;” and in his communication to the Com-
= he points to the fact that the © pebbles of quartz, rounded fragments of the slate
ks of the district, &c. (forming the pebble bed in the cave) are precisely similar in
tharacter and appearance to those forming the raised beach visible on the neighbouring
2oast, as well as to the shingle on the shore of Mudstone-Bay sands north of Brixham.”
Mr. PENGELLY considers that, in the case of the side grooves just referred to, © the tides
and wayes could not have allowed the preservation of levels s0 restricted,” and that in
confined spaces like the narrow galleries of a cavern, the wayes of the sea would have
arranged the materials differently to what they would on an open beach. There is an
entire absence in the cave-shingle of shells, whether marine (such as would prove the
presence of the sea) or freshwater (such as might be introduced by the action of a running
stream). Fragments of the former would have been more likely to have been preseryed
