occur in these regions. As the turbid spheres surrounding each nucleus enlarge, the
coarser cell inclusions become driven farther and farther from each nucleus, and

finally are heaped up round the periphery of the protoplasm, and especially in the
neutral planes which delimit the different oospheres. It is in these neutral planes
that the cell walls arise. The protoplasm forming them stains differently from
that which fills the greater part of the rest of the oogonium, a fact noted also
by Srraspurcer. We find in preparations stained with dyes which colour cellu-
lose, that they are especially absorbed and most persistently retained in these
planes, and also by the granular protoplasm near the periphery of the oogonial
contents as a whole. Ultimately membranes are formed which divide the oogonium
into as many chambers as there will be oospheres produced. We notice that the
membranes are formed first in the protoplasm, and do not become attached
simultaneously to the oogonial wall, though this happens very shortly after their
appearance. We were thus led to enquire whether each egg may not secrete a
wall all round itself, the peripheral portion being, however, in close contact with the
oogonial wall. But after a careful study of a large number of preparations we have
come to the conclusion that a peripheral membrane independent of the oogonial wall
is not formed at this stage, although later on the oospheres are found to be enclosed
