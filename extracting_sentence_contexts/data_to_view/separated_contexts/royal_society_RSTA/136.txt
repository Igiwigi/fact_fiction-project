maximizing the schedulable region, and minimizing network cost. In fact, some
current P2P applications already implement variants of these controllers. Such
controllers can work with current TCP; however, the RTT bias inherent in TCP
can lead to network inefficiencies. The use of flexible routing combined with smart congestion controllers can
overcome many of the current architectural limitations of the current Internet.
