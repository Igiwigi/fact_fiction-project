It is remarkable that, when « lies close to the value 5, both the coefficient of y? and
the term independent of p in (121) very nearly vanish. In this case, therefore, H,
varies very nearly as yp‘, in marked contrast to its value when « is small, viz., unity. This fact has an interesting application later. The Oscillations of a Gas within a Rigid Ellipsoidal Envelope. The most interesting elementary solutions of the wave equation are those denoted

These functions represent the possible modes of motion of a gas within an ellipsoidal
envelope.
