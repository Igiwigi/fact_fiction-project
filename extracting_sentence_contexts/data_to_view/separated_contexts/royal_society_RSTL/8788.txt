STRUCTURE AND RELATIONS OF CERTAIN CORALS. 93

Professor VERRILL, in the paper above quoted, as he has done before, combats the con-
clusions of Prof, Agass1z, that the whole of the Tabulata belonged to the hydroid polyps. This fact, he 8ays, has only been proved for the Millepores : the remaining Tabulata
should be joined with the true polyps, with which their relations are very near and
intimate. The transverse partition-walls, the presence of which was held by MiLNg-
Epwarps and Hae as a characteristic distinction, are structures of a very low order,
that occur in widely different forms, and are only brought about by the simultaneous
emptying of the generative products from the radial chambers. Where the emptying
is not, thus periodically simultaneous, a separate transverse septum is formed in each of
the chambers shutting off the space thus become vacant.
