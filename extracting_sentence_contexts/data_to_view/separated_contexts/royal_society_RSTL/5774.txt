They are very much larger
Shan the hexradiate centres of the compound stellate spicula, but as they are evidently
Ihe normal forms of that tribe, I shall describe the general characters of these - large,
Sjmple, hexradiate forms before those of the more complicated stellate ones. E ATTENUATED RECTANGULATED HEXRADIATE (Plate XXV. fig. 32),â€”The first state in
Syhich we find them is in that of an inequi-acerate spiculum (Plate XXV. fig. 24), in
Avyhich condition they are in fact the two axial radii of the hexradiate form which they
timately attain when in their fullest state of development. In the next stage we
ind a bud-like projection isswing from the side of the thickest portion of the inequi-
Vieerate spiculum (fig. 25), which is ultimately developed in the form of a rectangulated
I spiculum, as in fig. 28.
