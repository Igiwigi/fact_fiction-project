At the time of fixing, this shoot had given rise to seven new
leaves (figure 8), the small protostele (ss) being traceable as undifferentiated prestelar
tissue to a level just below the apical meristem. As with Osmunda and Todea, a notable
feature in Angiopteris was the reduction in the size and anatomical complexity of the new
shoot which developed from the isolated apical meristem. In its morphological develop-
ment the new growth, in fact, approximated closely to a young sporophyte plant or a young
lateral shoot bud (Wardlaw 19466). The other experimental materials of Angiopteris which
were sectioned showed closely comparable developments, e.g. the polycyclic dictyostele
was reduced to a medullated protostele (figures 36, 37, plate 32).

(c) Pteridium aquilinum

This leptosporangiate fern is characterized by a dorsiventral rhizome and by a vascular
system of some complexity. The shoot apex is small, sunken and delicate and surrounded
by mucilaginous hairs.
