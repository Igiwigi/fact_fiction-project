distinguish states that started as superpositions with different phases for w and 6. Consequently, : S
information about S is lost—it is displaced into correlations between S and €, and local phases of : &
S become a global property—global phases of the composite entangled state of SE. : 2

We have considered this information loss here without reduced density matrices, the usual 1S

decoherence tool. Our view of decoherence appeals to symmetry, invariance of S—entanglement-
assisted invariance or envariance under phase shifts of pointer state coefficients, equation (4.2).
As S entangles with €, its local state becomes invariant under transformations that could have
affected it before.

Rigorous proof of coherence loss uses quantum core postulates (0)-(iii) and relies on quantum
facts 1-3:

1. Locality: A unitary must act on a system to change its state. A state of S that is not acted upon
does not change even as other systems evolve (so 1s @ (ley Xe] + ele) \(e)|) does not
affect S even when S and € are entangled, in |Wse).

2. The state of a system is all there is to predict measurement outcomes.

3. A composite state determines states of subsystems (so the local state of S is restored when the
state of the whole S and € is restored).

These facts help to characterize local states of entangled systems without using reduced density
matrices. They follow from quantum theory: locality is a property of interactions. The other two
