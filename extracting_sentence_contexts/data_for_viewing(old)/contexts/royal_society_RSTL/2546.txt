and in no instance did a range of eight tenths of an inch come under my observa-
tion, even in comparing the maximum of one year with the minimum of another.
Whilst in England, at Edmonton and Cheltenbam, in 1827, the extreme range of the
barometer was respectively 1:88 inch and 1:75 inch. In 1828, at Edmonton, Chel-
tenham, and Weycomb, the range was 1:44 inch, 1:41 inch, and 1-61 inch respectively.
An inspection of my tables will show that in four years, in the five monso0n months,
from the maximum height 28:1343 inches, thermometer 76*4 in October 1827, to the
minimum height of 27:570, thermometer 75? in July 1830, the range amounted only
to +5643, difference of thermometer attached 14. In looking over Mr. GoLpixGnam's
tables for twenty-one years at Madras, the greatest annual range (with a solitary ex-
ception of 1430 inch in a terrific hurricane in May 1820,) amounted to 9640 in 1818,
and the greatest monthly range was in October of the same year *7940 ; the smallest
annual range was *4620 in 1814; in fact, the annual range very rarely exceeded
six tenths of an inch.

I found the mean monthly pressure of the atmosphere at its maximum in the
coldest months, December and January ; it gradually diminished until July or Au-
gust, the most damp months : and gradually increased again until the cold months.
Mr. GoLpixcnam's means of twenty-one years give nearly the same results ; the maxi-
mum pressure 30:085 inches, thermometer 75168, being in December or January ;
it then diminishes until May, June, and July, the mean height of the barometer,
29860, thermometer 86-907, being nearly the same in those months. But it is to
be remarked, that two of these months, which at Poona are the most damp, at Madras
are the hottest of the year: the minimum pressure, therefore, was as independent of
moisture at Madras, as it was independent of extreme heat at Poona. From July the
