In view of the small amounts of “‘ peroxides ”’ present, it was hardly expected that
the analyses for these compounds would reveal the same consistency ; but with
scrupulous attention to details (such as boiling out of the discs, frequent cleaning of
the sampling valve, etc.) it was possible to obtain satisfactory reproducibility.

During the tests both for aldehydes and “ peroxides,” the readings for Shell petrol
and Shell plus ethyl fluid were alternated, so as to ensure identical engine conditions
for the two fuels.

The results of the tests are shown graphically in figs. 10, 11 and 12. On the same
figures are shown the oxygen curves reproduced from figs. 5, 6, and 7.

The following facts are outstanding.

Aldehydes.—With Shell petrol alone the aldehydes reach a maximum concentration
at a time coinciding approximately with the moment at which flame reaches the
sampling valve, the occurrence of the maximum being more retarded with respect
to this moment as the throttle opening is increased. ‘This maximum concentration
is of the order of 5 parts in 1,000 when the throttle is 6° open, and of 7 parts in
1000 for the three larger throttle openings. During the greater part of the last half
of the compression stroke the aldehyde concentration is practically constant, and
of the order of 1 part in 1000. This quantity increases slightly as the throttle
opening is increased. When the crankshaft has reached a position of some 10°
before t.d.c. the concentration begins to increase, and rapidly reaches the maximum.
Then as combustion proceeds, the concentration decreases until a value of about
