Consequently
the limits are not determined with such certainty as in the other cases. Nevertheless
Mg and Ca quite fall into line with the others, and even in Ra it is possible to give
some indications of the value of the density of the solid metal. The fact that the terms depend on multiples of atomic volumes as ordinarily
calculated may be interpreted in one of two ways. Either that the periods of the
vibrating configurations do actually depend on multiples of: the essential atomic
volumes or that multiples do not enter here, but that the packing together of the
configurations when they are aggregated into solid masses is closer or less close. Â£.g., compare Zn with factor 9 and Hg with factor 6.
