photosynthetically driven primary productivity across up to 40% of the world’s surface oceans
[36]. If hydrothermally sourced Fe can persist long distances through the oceans, then its
upwelling into the surface ocean could be responsible for enhancing primary productivity in the
iron-limited Southern Ocean [37,38].

Of course, Fe is not the only TEI impacted by submarine hydrothermal venting. During the US
GEOTRACES GA-03 section, sampling of the non-buoyant plume above the TAG hydrothermal
site on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) revealed enrichment in the plume for several elements
including 3He [39], Fe and Mn [23], Al [40] and Hg [41]. By contrast, 230Th and 73!Pa [42] showed
reduced concentrations as a result of in-plume scavenging processes. This effect was also seen to
reduce the concentrations of Cu [43] and Pb [44] in the plume samples compared with those
immediately above or below in the water column. A small lowering of the Si isotope signal
was also seen but no Si concentration anomaly was visible [45]. The fact that enriched chemical
signals were also observed to the west of the MAR is consistent with the general features of
material transport described by Thurnherr et al. [46], namely inflow from the eastern flank of the
Ridge coupled with enhanced diapycnal mixing above the hydrothermal plumes, whose impact
is carried westward by beta-plume dynamics [47]. Strikingly, the 7He : Fe ratio at TAG [39] differs
substantially from that observed from the faster spreading East Pacific Rise (EPR) [24], and is more
similar to that observed in the South Atlantic [19]. While the Al: Fe ratio in the TAG plume (0.73-
1.15) is similar to the EPR plume (approx. 1) the Mn: Fe ratio is much lower at TAG (0.5-0.54)
than in the dispersing EPR plume (1.45). At the EPR both of these values change as the plume
is diluted away from the vent site (Al: Fe increases to 1.9 and Mn: Fe drops to 0.26) implying
relative scavenging losses of Mn > Fe > Al in the EPR plume [24]. However, in the case of TAG it
is difficult to connect these ‘far field’ signatures to specific vent sites, given the strong meridional
