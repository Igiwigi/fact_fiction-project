This is perhaps more difficult to imagine in lateral than in longitudinal
motion, but as basis for a first approximation has the same validity in both. The fourth and sixth equations of (18-9) give that

Lv’ +1,s'q’P+1s'q'R = 0,)
r (20-3)
and nv’ +n,s'q'P+n,s'q'R = 0,
to the first order. Now it is a well-known fact that, of the six rotary derivatives con-
tained in (20-3), /, stands out as predominantly large. In fact J, is a quantity of order
— 1, while of the other five derivations only /, is at all large, namely, like 2. We therefore
suggest that, in our first approximation, we can take P = 0.
