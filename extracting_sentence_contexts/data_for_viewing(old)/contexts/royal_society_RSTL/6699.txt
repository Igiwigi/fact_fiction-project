62.

The quantity of gas in the front chamber was now doubled, that is, it now had an

atmosphere of tension ; the withdrawal of heat then was expressed by the number
68.

Ip In the last experiment we had double the number of atoms loading themselves with heat
S and carrying it away; if their motion had been as quick as that of the atoms when half
£ an atmosphere was used, they would have withdrawn sensibly double the amount of heat ;
= but the fact is that half an atmosphere carried off 64, while a whole atmosphere carried
S off 68; hence the absolute swiftness of the atoms in the case of the denser air must be
S very much less than in the case of the rarer. In fact, the amount of heat withdrawn
