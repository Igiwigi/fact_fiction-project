conics in the plane having four-point contact with the 8urface at A. The line AC will,
as is well known, have the same pole in regard to all these conics—that is to 8ay, the
point B will be the same for the whole system. If we now allow the Plane to turn
round the axis, the point B will trace out a curye in the tangent plane. The equation
to this curve is got by eliminating a between equations (3') and (4'); namely, it is

0=(B(BO)—(BX(O). . oo oO

We see, therefore, that 7he locus of the poles of an avis in regard to all the four-point
conics whose planes pass through it is a cubic curve in the tangent plane touching the
chief tangents at A, which point is therefore a node on the curve.

We might have inferred this from the fact that on any line through A there is only
one point B, while this point coincides with A in the case of the two chief tangents;
since at a point of inflexion all the four-point conics contain the inflexional tangent.

Number of siz-point conics through an avis.

We have now to determine B 80 that the equations (3'), (4'), (5), (6') may be simul-
taneously satisfied. We know already that B must lie on the cubic (4”); it is necessary
therefore to find some other locus on which it has to lie. First of all, then, we must
eliminate A between (3') and (5') and between (3') and (6') ; the results are,

(B*)(CY=(BY(CY*—(B*C)(B*(C)+(B*Y(C?) =p, say ;
(B*)(CY=(B*(CY'—(B*C)(B*N(C)+(B*Y(BC")=9,, 5ay.
