processes fed by solar radiation, and it is essential for life
on our planet. In addition, it is the origin of hydropower,
which is mainly exploited by dams containing large
volumes of water from rainfalls and thaw.
Wind power has a similar root: solar radiation
interaction with the atmosphere and hydrosphere creates

renewable energies, solar energy, an important mechanism of energy transformation, from
concentrating solar power, energy storage thermal to kinetic energy, i.e. wind. This fact simplifies

the machinery to convert wind kinetic energy into rotor
kinetic energy.

Solar radiation can also be exploited directly, either

effect, have much stronger physical limitations.

PVs are based on the PV principle applied to a
semiconductor junction, and have a series of advantages
