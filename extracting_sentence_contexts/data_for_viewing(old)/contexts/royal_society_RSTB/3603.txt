group is but little known (SoteREDER, 1908, p. 243), noting, however, the marked
differences between the genera Sabia and Meliosma. It is with the species Sabia
Japonica that the fossil agrees. Meliosma differs considerably from the fossil, and
lacks the sclerised ring composed of the hard bast patches and the sclerised outer
parts of the rays.

Sections were cut of Sabia of various ages, corresponding to the fossil stems, and they
all agreed very closely. The only two points of difference of any importance between
the fossil and the living plants were found in the pith and the older wood vessels.
There seemed no evidence that the fossil pith contained anything corresponding to
the numerous secretory cells in the pith of the living plant, while the size of the
vessels formed after the first yearâ€™s growth seemed rather greater than those of the
fossil. The latter point may depend on the fact that the outer part of the wood of
the fossil stem was crushed and poorly preserved, so that the measurements of the

vessels had to be taken from the inner half of the secondary wood, and were therefore
probably less in size than those in the more external portions. As the likeness
between the stems is so complete in the important features, there is no need to
recapitulate all the details in which the fossil and the living Sabia agree.

The anatomical peculiarities of the Sabiacee seem to be so much better marked
than those of most of the Angiospermic families that there seems to be a reasonable
likelihood that the fossil belongs to the group, even though we have only the anatomy
of the stem to go by, which is so insufficient in most cases.
