At the
end of two minutes it is enlarged to one-third, and in three minutes to one-half the
diameter of this body. In four minutes it exceeds three-fifths, and in s/w minutes
two-thirds, and it continues to imbibe fluid and expand at the same rate, until, at from
ten to fifteen minutes, it very nearly equals in thickness the whole diameter of the
yelk; and at half an hour (fig. 9) it is one-fourth greater than this. Prevosrand
Dumas* noticed the expansion of the envelope during the first s:z hours, but entirely
overlooked the rate of expansion during the most important period, the first hour,
and noticed only the general fact that the diameter of the envelope, at the end of the
first hour and a half, was as 5 to 2:5 at the time of spawning, and that it had nearly
acquired its full size at the end of three hours. My own observations agree with this
latter statement. The expansion of the envelope is greatly retarded at the end of
the third or fourth hour, until after cleavage of the yelk has taken place, when it
again proceeds, but much more slowly than at first.
