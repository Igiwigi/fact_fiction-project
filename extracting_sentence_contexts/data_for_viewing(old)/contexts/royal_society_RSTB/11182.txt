to overlook the crucial fact that what is added or subtracted is
obtained by multiplication. When the cost of a litre increases
by 50%, the new price is 1+0.5=3/2 times the old price.
When that price then drops by 50%, the new price is (0.5 x
1.5 = 0.75) of the original price. Although the same percentage
was both added and subtracted, the second operation did not
