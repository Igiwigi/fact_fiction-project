putative history of system dynamics the result Y; of any potential measurement can be derived.
To take an example, suppose a particular measurement y; gives the total number of infections in a
1-week period. Here all the infection transitions in (which contains complete information about
the dynamics of the system) would be added together for that week to give Y;. The small constant
£g;(dependent on the time series g; to which i belongs) is introduced to ensure validity even when
yj or Y; are zero.!!

When y; and Yj; are equal the contribution to the EF in equation (2.6) is zero. When they are
unequal the contribution is always positive (and for small deviations, close to the square of the
fractional change in the quantity). The weights w; in equation (2.6) set the relative importance
of different measurements. In particular, they place greater weight on larger observed values!”

°The value 1 in equation (2.5) is arbitrary. While x(y |£) is strictly a probability density, the fact that it is unnormalized does
not matter because the posterior probability in equation (2.4) is only known up to a constant of proportionality.

1For example, taking the difference between Y; and y; and squaring would result in something akin to a least-squares
approach.

"Its value is set to 2% of the highest peak from the time series to which the measurement i belongs. This was a simple way to
suppress the effect of noise in measurements with low values.

2-This reflects the fact that daily transitions, like case and death data, are expected to be Poisson distributed, and so larger
values are expected to be less susceptible to stochastic variation than smaller values.
