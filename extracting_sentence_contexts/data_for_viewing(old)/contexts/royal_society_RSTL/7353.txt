manner in which the sarcode passes, by many bundles, from the older chambers into
the newest in those individuals of Polymorphina lactea which throw out tubular stag-

horn processes from their last chamber (P. tubulosa, D'Orb.); for, as may be seen in fig. 52,
Jhe newest chamber, namely, that which bears the cervicorn appendage, communicates,
ot merely with the ante-penultimate chamber, but, by a double row of lateral apertures,
Bvith all the chambers occurring on its own side, namely those which it overlaps. The
Zommunication of the last, outer, wild-growing chamber with the penultimate is not
July by means of this double row of apertures, but (as is seen in fig. 52 5) by the ordi-
auary radiated mouth. Another view, however, may be taken of the growth of such an
ndividual as fig. 52: thus, we may suppose that absorption has taken place, opening
Foraminal communications between the last and the former chambers. Either hypo-
Ahesis would explain the fact, â€”that, as we find on breaking open very large specimens
f the normal P. lactea, the stolon-passages between the older chambers are very free and
Satulous; whereas the terminal mouth of the last chamber presents the radiate condi-
Ron; the only passage here for the sarcode being the thin slits around the strong
Srowth of hyaline shelly matter in the mouth.
b Fig. 45 represents the group of individuals to which D'ORBr6xy applied the snb-
Seneric term Gobuling; but neither this term nor that of Guttuling (another s0-called
Subgenus) can be separated from the ordinary, more or less oval, more or less pyriform,
r more or less elongate varieties of Polymorphina lactea.
S Figs. 45 & 46 are from the Hunde Islands (Dr. SUTHERLAND), in three dredgings from
5 nk fathoms. Rather common and of small size. Also from the Norway coast

MacAnprew and Barkerr) in the mixed sands.
