across individuals, owing to societies being composed of differ-

({12-14], reviewed in [15]). Organizational immunity provides
prophylactic protection to particularly valuable group mem-

means of reduced exposure risk. Additional modulation of
these social interaction networks upon pathogen exposure
can further strengthen this effect [2,12,15-18].

Changes in the behaviour of infectious individuals, or
their group members, are likely to be reflected in their
social interaction network (though experimental confirmation
