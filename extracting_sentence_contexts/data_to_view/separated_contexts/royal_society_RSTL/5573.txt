The diffusion of the molecules is not merely a passive result of the cessation of con-
Scentration, as has been hitherto snpposed. In watching closely the occurrence of the
phenomenon, I have seenf the granules start off suddenly from the central mass, with a
Z velocity which implied that they were under the influence of forces very different from
= those which cause molecular movements in them when shed from their containing cells. SThat the process requires the vital forces of the cells to be in full operation, is also
'Z proved by the fact, that any agency, such as a galvanic shock, which temporarily para-
= Iyses their functions, arrests diffusion as well as concentration ; whereas, if the former
2 were merely passive, it would take place as s0on as the concentrating power was set at
Srest-. ij T have already pointed out the sparsely scattered state of the granules in the central
g receptacles, compared with their accumulation in the branches of the offsets, in the fully
& diffused state shown in fig. 3.
