MR. 6G. J. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSZ. 299

s0 characteristic of Cyan capillata. Instead of the heart-like regularity with which
systole and diastole follow one another in the unpoisoned animal, we now have periods
of violent and prolonged systole resembling tonic spasm ; and when the severity of this
spasm is for a moment abated, it is generally renewed before the gonocalyx has had
time again to become fully expanded. Moreover the spasm itself is not of uniform
intensity throughout the time it lasts ; but while the gonocalyx is in a continuously
contracted state, there are observable a perpetual snccession of extremely irregular
oscillations in the strength of the contractile influence. It is further a highly interest-
ing fact that the convulsions are yery plainly of a paroxysmal nature. Afï¬€ter the gono-
calyx has suffered a prolonged period of conyulsive movements, it expands to its full
dimensions, and in this form remains for some time in a state of absolute quiescence.
Presently, however, another paroxysm supervenes, to be followed by another period of
quiescence, and 80 on for hours. The periods of quiescence are usually shorter than are
those of convyulsion ; for while the former seldom last more than forty seconds or 80, the
latter may continue uninterruptedly for five or sx minutes. In short, Medus, when
submitted to the influence of strychnia, exhibit all the symptoms of strychnia poisoning
in the higher animals. Death, however, is always in the fully expanded form.

(4) Curare has already been tried upon Medusz, and is stated to have produced no
effects; it is therefore especially desirable that T should first of all describe the method
of exhibiting it which I employed.
