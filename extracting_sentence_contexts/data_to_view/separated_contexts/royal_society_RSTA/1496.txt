To accelerate such progress requires the ability to not only publish
successful applications but also the failures. If failures are also routinely published, a vast amount
of time could be saved by not having each research group try the same thing. In fact, a repository
of failures could be quite valuable to the community. In the climate arena, downscaling using AI could save vast amounts of computational power
and time while maintaining the type of accuracy needed if research advances to the place where
the methods are fully trusted. Al can assist with intelligently weighing the models in CMIP runs to
produce a ‘best estimate’ rather than a simple mean or median.
