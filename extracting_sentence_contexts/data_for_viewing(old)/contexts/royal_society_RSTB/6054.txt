variable length which serves to connect the more extensive mesoderm-containing
proximal portion with the floor of the intervillous blood-space. Each such terminal
segment consists of a solid cellular core, composed of cells with nuclei similar to those
of the cytotrophoblast, and in favourable sections seen to be in direct continuity with that
layer, and of an investment of syncytiotrophoblast forming the direct prolongation of
that enclosing the proximal segment of the villus. Thus the latter segment consists,
like the chorion of which it is an outgrowth, of an investing layer of trophoblast
(differentiated into a basal cellular layer of cytotrophoblast (Langhans layer) and a
thin superficial layer of syncytiotrophoblast), and a very slender axis of mesoderm,
whilst the distal segment is solid and formed of a compact core of cytotrophoblast: and
a thin covering of syncytiotrophoblast.

Now the interest of this condition lies in the fact that the chorionic villi of the early
human blastocyst exhibit a precisely comparable structure, their distal segments being
formed of solid so-called “ cell-columns ” (Zellsiulen) of cytotrophoblast, invested by
syncytium (Pl. 18, fig. 104). The whole distal segment represents the remains of the
hypothetical solid “ primary villus” of the human embryologist and the proximal
segment, the so-called “secondary villus,” destined to lengthen pari passu with the
growth of the mesoderm into the “ primary” portion of the villus. These “ cell-
columns” are not mentioned by SeLenKa in his description of Keim §. He simply
states that the chorionic ectoderm (Langhans layer) enlarges at the ends of the villous
branches to “ einem vielschichtigen Vollgewebe.”
