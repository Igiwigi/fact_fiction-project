the plain slit it recovered its power : the same was the case with my prisms. That the
80le cause of this was the narrowness of the slit, and not any peculiar action of the colli-
mator, I verified by attaching to the stand of the theodolite a good object-glass of 8 feet
foens, and placing it at that distance from the 8lit (4/5). This arrangement gave vision
that was first-rate, and showed lines in an electric spectrum 14' beyond the last of those
that were visible in the usnal mode of observing. It follows from these facts, that the
collimator's focus should be as long as possible consistent with convenience; and I will
suggest that it should be a cassegrain instead of an achromatic. The equivalent focus
of this is from six to seyen times that of the large mirror, and I find by a rough trial
that the image is yery sharp. If the mirrors of A were glass silvered on Foucault's
Xplan, it would haye as much light as the achromatic, and be free from all chromatie
KSerror, I have recently found that the brightness of faint lines is much improyed by
Susing a cylindric lens before the slit. The slit was generally one minute wide.
I 8. The precision of the angles measured depends, on the determination of the index-
= correction, on the precision of the bisection, and on the reading of the circle. The zero
was obtained at the beginning, and also often at the end of each set, by bisecting the
Slit when illuminated by nearly homogeneous light. At first this was done by inter-
Zposing a slip of red glass; latterly, in preference, by using the flame of a Bunsen burner
