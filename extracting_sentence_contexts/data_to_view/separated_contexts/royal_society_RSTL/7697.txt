The action.
of the nitrite resembles in this respect that of the sulphate of quinine on the rays which

cause it to fluoresce. Both substances quench the effectual rays close to the surface at
which they enter. I endeavoured at the time to apply this fact to the solution of the question whether
the absorption of chemical energy was the act of the molecule as a whole, or of its
constituent, atoms. T tried to show that on the first of these assumptions it is impossible
for the self-same rays to be absorbed by a liquid and its vapour. For absorption depends
upon the rate of molecular vibration, and reaches its maximum when this rate synchro-
nizes perfectly with the rate of snccession of the ethereal wayes.
