Viewed more closely, however, it may frequently be seen that the whole
bell does nob contract simultaneously, but that, as it were, clouds of contraction pass
now over one part and now over another. Still, whether the contractions are partial
or universal, they are always more or less rhythmical. As this is the only case that
has ever been observed of rhythm as due to a constant chemical stimulus, I have
sbudied it with much care, and shall now give a full description of what appears to
me an important body of physiological facts. Ten to twenty drops of acetic acid having been added to 1000 c.c. of sea-water, and
the paralyzed bell of Sarsia having been placed in the mixture, an interval of about
half a minute will elapse before any movement begins. Sooner or later, however, the
artificial rhythm is sure to be induced, and it will then continue for a variable timeâ€”
occasionally as long as an hour, and generally for a considerable number of minutes.
