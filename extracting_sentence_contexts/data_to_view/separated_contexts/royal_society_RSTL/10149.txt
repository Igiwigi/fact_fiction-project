5, 7, 14, and 15). In the
cage of ripening s8eeds, the protoplasm may be made to contract slightly from the
membrane, and then a similar phenomenon is induced to that which occurs in Amicia
and the bast cells of Mimosa (cf. figs. 11 and 13), although in them it is not occa-
sioned by loss of vitality, bub rather from the fact that the threads are probably
extremely fine and the continuity not 80 pronounced as it is in the case. of the
parenchyma cells. In fully-ripe seeds where the cells are dead, the protoplagm always
contracts away from the cell-wall, and a similar state of things usually occurs when
the cell has been killed by the action of reagents (see figs.
