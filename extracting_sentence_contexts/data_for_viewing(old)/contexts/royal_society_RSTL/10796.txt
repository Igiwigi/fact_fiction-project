necessary for a gas flame is a source of error, as it is liable to get pinched, and the supply
of gas to be thus made irregular, and although many readings were taken with a gas
flame we found it inferior, with the appliances at our command, to an ordinary candle,
or to the SIEMENS's standard unit lamp burning amy] acetate, which has the value of
about *9 of such a candle.

In the experiments recorded in the immediately following pages a candle was used
as the comparison light. Burnt as we burnt it, open to the air but not exposed to

draughts, the light emitted was remarkably uniform. The mere fact that we could
place curves taken on different days one over the other, and that they should prac-
tically coincide, shows that the errors due to variations of the candle must be very
slight. With the Srevexs's unit lamp similar results were obtained. It may be
concluded that the figures given are reliable within a very 8mall percentage. (See
Addendum, p. 453.)

When experiments of this nature are undertaken by two people working together,
it is clearly necessary that there should be a careful comparison of the effects
on their eyes of the same quantity and quality of light. It was a matter of great
