The thin microstructured
layers may, for example, contain the third rank laminate material with a herringbone structure
depicted in fig. 13 of [75] or in the second subfigure of fig. 8 in [43]. The macroscopic constitutive
relation of the sliced material separated by these microstructured layers, is

The formula for j1, has the required invariance property that if 1/4 and —1/« are shifted by the
same constant, then 1/j, is shifted by this constant too [78,79]. Owing to this invariance we may
assume, without loss of generality, that the initial elastic phase is incompressible (1/« = 0) so that
