eye (binocular uncorrelation) [83,84], with perceptual reports
suggesting a reliance on the appearance of binocular lustre.

If we are looking for an explanation of these results in the
responses of neurons tuned to binocular disparity recorded
from the visual cortex, then there is a striking discrepancy
between the perceptual reports and the responses of neurons
in primary visual cortex. In awake, behaving monkeys, Cum-
ming & Parker [85] found that the disparity selectivity of V1
neurons was inverted when they were tested with dynamic
anti-correlated random-dot stimuli. Crucially, like humans,
the monkeys could not discriminate the depth within these pat-
terns, notwithstanding the fact that the same figures created a
disparity-specific response in V1 neurons. This certainly does
not fit with the idea of a direct correspondence between
responses in a network of V1 neurons and a fully formed
stereoscopic percept. Rather it underlines the point that V1 con-
tains a module of neurons specialized for the processing of
fine-scale binocular pattern matching, based on similarity
between the luminance profiles of features in the left and
right eyes. Neurons within a module that is fundamentally sen-
sitive to these luminance profiles will show inverted disparity
tuning functions under binocular anti-correlation [86].
