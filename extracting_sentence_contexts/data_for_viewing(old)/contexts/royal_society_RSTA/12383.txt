280 MR. G. T. WALKER ON REPULSION AND ROTATION

In the case of self-induction causing a lag, shift, or retardation of phase in
secondary current, the circumstances are described by Professor Extau THomson

follows :— ;
«Jt will be noticed that the period during which the currents are opposite, and

during which repulsion can take place, is lengthened at the expense of the period
during which the currents are in the right direction for attractive action.

« But far more important still in giving prominence to the repulsive effect than
this difference of effective period, is the fact that, during the period of repulsion, both
the induced and inducing currents have their greatest values, while, during the
period of attraction, the currents are of small amounts comparatively. There is thena
repulsion due to the summative effects of strong opposite currents for a lengthened
period against an attraction due to the summative effects of weak currents of the same
direction during a shortened period, the resultant effect being a greatly preponderating
repulsion.” y

The diagram for this is given in fig. 2.
