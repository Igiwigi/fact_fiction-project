distance from B of the point of concentration =2692 miles ;
distance from C of the point of concentration =3544 miles.

The differences of these two last from the first are far greater than the distances
of B and C from A, viz. 5* 28' 37” and 11* 27' 33”, From this it is easily inferred,
what indeed did not need this proof, that the mass in no sense whatever, even an
approximate one, attracts as if concentrated in a fixed
point. Fig. 6.
50. It is extremely difficult to obtain a simple law y
of attraction, even an approximate one, of such a mass
as that under consideration. I have, however, arrived
at one which appears to represent the facts with a con-
siderable degree of exactness, and by which we can
interpolate for the amount of deflection at any station
of the arc intervening between Kaliana and Damargida.
It depends upon the properties of the curve of which

the equation is w=S i, Let Az, Ay be the axes of \

a?
x and y, and Qaq be the curve; the axis of y is an \
asymptote, and the curve cuts the axis of z at right , bY "nd
angles at a distance Aa=a. The property of this |
curve which I am about to use is as follows. The /
