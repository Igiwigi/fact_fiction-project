there are sufficient reasons for believing, as I shall now proceed to show, that denudation
has swept away very much of the superior portion of the formation.

Though no trace of a * fault” exists at the pit, one has been detected a short distance
east of it. © It runs,” says Mr. Diyerr, © about N.E. and S.W., crossing close to the
old engine-shaft” (56 fathoms east of the pit). *I drove towards it in many places,
and always found the * coal” fail and replaced by hard and wet *deady* clay. At one
place I drove further and cut into a bank of sand full of water, which ran into the shaft
and *starved* the pump for some time. T never got through the sand, and had great
difficulty in keeping it out of the shaft. This was at about 80 feet from the surface.
The section of the beds in the” (old engine-) © shaft is identical with those in the pit.”
The accompanying diagram (fig. 2) may serve to illustrate the foregoing facts. Let the
surface of the paper represent a horizontal plane, on the leyel of the bottom of the coal-
