nation was doubtless obtained. from native collectors, and all evidence supplied

had recently borne young;
Dited breeding seasons for S. ente

ssumption. EI made attempts, during February and March, to induce these animals to copulate

hile in captivity. Two large cages were put at my disposal in one of the Monkey
ses at the gardens, and an adult male with several females put in one cage, while

the other a pair of adult Monkeys were kept.
