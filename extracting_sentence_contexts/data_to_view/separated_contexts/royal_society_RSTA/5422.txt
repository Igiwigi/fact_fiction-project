It allows all
technological equipment to be connected and interoperate. In this project, this infrastructure is
provided by the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IloT) platform Winnum [38]. As a matter of fact, this platform allows counting on monitoring data that is located in the
cyber space and is associated with specific models of equipment, processes and production plans
(schedules), which together serve as a basis for the digital twin of the described production
system. The IIoT platform allows the integration of third-party equipment, e.g. working with
CNC equipment provided by other manufacturers, given that this equipment has the adequate
process interface, special connectors that work e.g. with their web-interfaces. A physical object to be manufactured in the cyber-physical platform is called here ‘smart
product/smart workpiece’.
