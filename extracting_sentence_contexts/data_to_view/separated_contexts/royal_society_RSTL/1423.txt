The use that may be made of these experiments is as fol-
lows. From the laws of reflection we know, that the extent
of the multiplied images perceived in reiterated reflections,
between two surfaces, may at all times be ascertained when
their distance is given. It is also well known, that when two
plates are in what is called contact, we can in fact, only sup-
pose them to be extremely near each other. 'The production
of streaks, when a plain glass is laid under a prism, is a suf-
ficient proof that, even when they are in the closest contact
which can be made, the subjacent surface till acts by reflection
upon the rays that pass through the base of the prism ; for
if the contact of the two surfaces were s0 complete as to
make one solid mass of glass, no reflection would take place
within its substance. LX.
