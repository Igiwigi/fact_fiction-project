necessary to decide the question, as the effect of the rigidity of the testing machine
has not yet been fully investigated. In two instances, at least, low ranges of stress
have been traced to natural periods of vibration in the testing machine agreeing
approximately with the period of repetition.

The fact that the hysteresis loop is not necessarily a sign of failure increased the
difficulty of giving numerical values to the elastic ranges.

If the widths of the hysteresis loops are plotted as ordinates, on a range of stress
base, it will be seen that the curve obtained is approximately a straight line,
particularly for the lower ranges of stress. This line produced backwards intersects
the axis of range of stress. As the ordinate is zero at the intersection, the hysteresis
loop must disappear, or, in other words, the specimen must be completely elastic.

The actual prediction was complicated by the fact that the hysteresis loop did not
always attain a constant width for the range. In such cases the width of loop was
taken immediately after the preliminary change in “ cyclical permanent set,” shown
most clearly in the upper curve of fig. 1. ‘
