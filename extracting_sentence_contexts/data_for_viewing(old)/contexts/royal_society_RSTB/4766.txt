differentiation of the sheath into the three zones has not yet taken place.

Except in the terminal caudal vertebre, there are in Somniosus microcephalus and
Echinorhinus spinosus no calcified structures. As in the case of Hexanchus, the —
intervertebral ligaments are long, and the “centra” are represented by thick septa,
perforated in the middle by the funicle (fig. 23), The vertebral column in these fishes

is clearly degenerate, and it is of particular interest to recall the fact that in
Somniosus rostratus the vertebre are not reduced in number as they are in
Somniosus microcephalus, and they are typically Squaline in character, the double
cones being well developed, although the external crust of the arches is thin or
wanting.* Seeing that Hassr’s figures of Hehinorhinus (15, B, Plate 9) are drawn
of the natural size, it is clear that his specimen was not more than half-grown.

from region between second dorsal and caudal fins. (lor explanation of the lettering, see p. 404.)

The terminal caudal vertebrae of Hchinorhinus were not available for study; in
those of Somniosus microcephalus, as mentioned on p. 318, there are reduced vertebral
structures, namely, external patches of irregular granular calcification (Hasse, 15, B,
