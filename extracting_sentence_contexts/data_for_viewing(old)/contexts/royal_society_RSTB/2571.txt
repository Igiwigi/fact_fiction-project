pseudaconitine is distinctly the most depressant towards respiration.


PHARMACOLOGY OF PSEUDACONITINE AND JAPACONITINE. 49

It may be noted here that repeated daily administrations of sublethal doses of
pseudaconitine ave followed by a somewhat lessened effect upon the respiration. It
is probably this fact which explains the degree of tolerance (trifling though it is)
which is established towards the alkaloid.

Temperature.—The preliminary rise of internal temperature (frequently, though
by no means invariably, seen in rabbits after aconitine) is even less usual after
pseudaconitine, and this fact seems to stand in relationship with the slighter tendency
to respiratory acceleration occasioned by the latter. The ensuing fall of temperature
bears a direct proportion to the dose of the alkaloid, when the conditions under which
the animal is maintained are similar. Thus a relatively smaller dose will cause a
greater and more enduring reduction when the animal is in a cool atmosphere, and
when the loss of heat from the surface is not guarded against, than under the reverse
conditions. The maximal fall after large sublethal doses oceurs within 2) hours
of administration and amounts to 2 to 8°5 C. Return towards the normal succeeds
acceleration of respiration in point of time, the original level being reached and often
exceeded in between 4 and 54 hours after administration.

Daily administration of such doses are followed by a slightly lessened depression
of temperature and usually, though not invariably, by a shortening of the subnormal
