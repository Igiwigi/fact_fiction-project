To this
mesarch bipolar bundle a good deal of importance has been attached, owing to the
occurrence of a similar bundle, also as a transient phase, in many Zygopteridew. The
leaf-trace of Asterochlenopsis not only passes through this stage, but it also arises in the
unipolar condition which is normal for Thamnopteris and Zalesskya. The fact that all
the three genera are confined to Western Siberia lends force to these resemblances, and
~ may strengthen the presumption that Asterochlenopsis like Thamnopteris and Zalesskya
was of Permian age. The reduction in the adaxial xylem, to which attention has already been drawn,
is intelligible as an expression of a wide-spread tendency among ferns to acquire a
C-shaped leaf-trace (@wyNNE-VAUGHAN and Krpsron). But the temporary appearance
of this feature in a Zygopterid fern (e.g., Asterochlenopsis) where subsequently the
adaxial xylem attains the same development as the abaxial, is of particular interest
as a case of recapitulation.
