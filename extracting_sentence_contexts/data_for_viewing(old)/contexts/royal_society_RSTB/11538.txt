(27,34), again quite similar to experiments.

Comparing the averaged dynamical content of the MD
data (comprising 4650 Ca-distances, figure 3b) with exper-
imental findings (figure 3a), we notice that the MD results
also reveal maxima at the boundaries of the distribution.
Because only relatively few Ca-distances report on the pico-
second response of the binding pocket, the lower boundary
maximum for MD is not very pronounced in the averaged
dynamical content. Moreover, we find weak maxima around
1 and 100ns, which are similar but not identical to the
experimental results. Owing to the different nature of the
observables, IR spectra and Ca-distances in fact are expected
to represent different projections of the time-dependent struc-
tural evolution of the system. While the same timescales are
present, the amplitudes of these timescales may, therefore, be
different for experimental and MD data.

As indicated by the experimental averaged dynamical
content shown in figure 3a, the photoinduced response of
PDZ2 appears to occur in three phases which are character-
ized by timescales of 10ps, 10ns and 10 ps, respectively.

Considering the overall similarity of IR and MD time traces
with respect to timescales and general features (such as
