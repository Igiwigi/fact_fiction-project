Heaviside derived a ‘wave velocity’ under the assumption that the energy propagates along :
with the wave [7]. His wave velocity or energy velocity, vi, is the ratio of the Poynting vector to 1G
the energy density, u: :

4 ze0lEl + 5 H0lHI 1s

where €9 = 8.85 x 10-2 Fm"? is the permittivity, and jug =47 x 10-7 Hm is the permeability of
free space. Kirk McDonald provides an excellent discussion of electromagnetic momentum and
velocity in a DC circuit [8].

Hertz’s experiments dealt with standing waves in which the fields propagate back and forth
at the speed of light, but the average energy velocity is zero. The fact that electromagnetic energy
velocity may, in general, be less than c appears to have first been explicitly noted by Harry
Bateman (1882-1946) in 1915 [9]. Recently, Gerald Kaiser re-examined this question, interpreting
energy velocity as a local time-dependent characteristic of electromagnetic fields [10].

Clearly, the ratio of electric to magnetic energy relates to energy velocity. The Poynting vector
goes to zero if either field goes to zero. A concentration of electric energy with no magnetic energy
will be static, as will a concentration of magnetic energy with no electric energy. One form of
energy must transform, at least in part, to the other in order for energy to move. Only when
both forms of energy coexist at the same location can there be a progression or motion of energy.
This observation, due to Oliver Lodge (1851-1940), aids in understanding electromagnetic energy
velocity [11]. The remarkable properties of the electric to magnetic field intensity ratio were not
appreciated at the time, however.
