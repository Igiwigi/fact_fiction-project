Now if it is assumed that the chromosome
molecules may be of the same general type, then a most instructive comparison is
possible between certain cytological manifestations and the known behaviour of
keratin, to take the most familiar protein. The mechanism of molecular contortion visualized by Astbury? as a result of X-ray
analysis of keratin and other substances is graphically indicated in the diagram repro-
duced here as text-fig. 1. Convolution of the molecular thread is represented as due
to the mutual attraction, either electrical or chemical, of side-chains known to project

* It is important to notice that the conception of a submicroscopic convolution is introduced here
to account for the facts of chromosome elasticity. It should not be thought of as an explanation of spiral
structure, the physical basis of which is quite unknown.

t It should perhaps be pointed out that Astbury’s work has already entered cytology in a paper by
Naithani (1937) referred to in the footnote to p. 188 above. Naithani’s suggestion was that a molecular
change of the f-a keratin type might underlie the post-pachytene chromosome shorlening recognized
by Belling and Sax, but gave no facts of any kind to support it.
