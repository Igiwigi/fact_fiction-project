Moreover, the crystals of all three salts expand least along this
5 direction, which is therefore that of the minimum avis of the thermal ellipsoid. 5 These two facts are doubtless of significance with respect to the structure of the
‘8 molecule, apparently indicating absence of the metallic atoms or their spheres of
