gE indicated by the fact that the closing membrane of the unilateral pits is very usually
a bulged into the lumen of the adjoining conduit.
3 There is one other argument i in favour of the existence of that state of tension of
8 the sap which we assume in the foregoing, and that is the difficulty of explaining the
evasion of such a state. For the conditions inevitably lead to it. What are these
A conditions? Minute cells provided with inter-communication for liquid, but not for
free gaseous motion; their walls completely wetted and indeed eagerly retentive of
water. Such cells paitadizally swamped by a dust-free liquid containing no free gas,
for such cannot move in the tracheides. What now must ensue upon the ebb in the
tide of root pressure? Our experiments indivate that the air containing sap will not
k because of the presence of the dissolved gas before many atmospheres tension
re reached, and that contact with the wetted wall introduces no instability.
There will be, in fact, a state of mechanical stress naturally induced. It appears
â€˜as if this result was inevitable.
The capability of the leaf to withstand the stress and continue its function of

transpiration is also indicated by experiment. There will thus be brought about
slow lifting of the sap column attendant upon the discharge of water at the leaf
its supply at the root. ;
How far a mechanical stress in the sap is transmitted into the roots must at pre
be matter of speculation. But an interesting possibility suggests itself in t]
