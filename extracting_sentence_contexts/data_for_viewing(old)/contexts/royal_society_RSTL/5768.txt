The analogy between the phenomena presented by crystals in the case of light trans
mitted through them, and in the case of magnetic induction, may be fully explained by
the circumstance that in both cases the laws of these phenomena depend upon an auxiliary
ellipsoid. The diameters of the optic auxiliary ellipsoid represent the values of the
reciprocal of the elasticity of the ether within the crystal; two of its axes coincide with
the directions of the greatest and the least elasticity, the third and mean axis being
perpendicular to these. On the other hand, the axes of the magnetic auxiliary ellipsoid
are directed along the lines of the greatest, the least, and the mean magnetic induction,
and their lengths represent the values of the reciprocal of these three inductions. This
analogy becomes the more perspicuous and striking by the fact, that in the firs: case
the optic axes, 1. e. the two directions along which there is no double refraction, are per-
pendicular to the circular sections of the optic auxiliary ellipsoid ; while in the second
case, the magnetic ares, i. e. two lines such that the crystal on being suspended along
either of them, between the two magnetic poles, is not acted upon by these poles in any
extraordinary way. are perpendicular to the circular sections of the magnetic auxiliary
ellipsoid.

In crystals with only one principal crystallographic axis, both auxiliary ellipsoids, the
optic and the magnetic, become ellipsoids of revolution whose principal axis coincides
with the crystallographic axis. Tn crystals whose primitive form is a right prism with
a rhombic base, the three axes of both auxiliary ellipsoids are directed along the three
principal erystallographic axes, but in both cases there is no indication at all given
