It appears therefore, that
nearly all the phenomena of the mutual actions of a hundred
different salts may be correctly represented by a hundred
numbers, while, in the usual manner of relating every case as
a different experiment, above two thousand separate articles
would be required. Dr. YounG's Account of a numerical Table, &c. 149

Having been engaged in the collection of a few of the prin-
cipal facts relating to chemistry and pharmacy, I was induced
to attempt the investigation of a series of these numbers; and
I have succeeded, not without some difficulty, in obtaining
such as appear to agree sufficiently well with all the cases of
double decompoxitions which are fully established, the excep-
tions not exceeding twenty, out of about twelve hundred cases
enumerated by Fouxcroy. The same numbers agree in ge-
neral with the order of simple elective attractions, as usually
laid down by chemical authors; but it was of so much less
importance to accommodate them to these, that I have not
been very solicitous to avoid a few inconsistencies in this re-
spect, especially as many of the bases of the calculation remain
uncertain, and as the common tables of simple elective attrac-
tions are certainly imperfect, if they are considered as indi-
cating the order of the independent attractive forces of the
substances concerned. Although it cannot be expected that
these numbers should be accurate measures of the forces
which they represent, yet they may be supposed to be tolera-
ble approximations to such measures, at least if any two of
them are nearly in the true proportion, it is probable that the
rest cannot deviate very far from it: thus, if the attractive
force of the phosphoric acid for potash is about eight tenths
of that of the sulfuric acid for barita, that of the phosphoric
acid for barita must be about nine tenths as great; but they
are calculated only to agree with a certain number of pheno-
mena, and will probably require many alterations, as well as:
additions, when all other similar phenomena shall have been
accurately investigated.
