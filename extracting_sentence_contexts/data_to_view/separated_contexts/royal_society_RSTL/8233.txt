fig. 4 belonged
to the didactyle form, Diplopus Aymards; it is from Hordwell: besides this humerus I
had many specimens from Puy and Hempstead; and as the two genera are confined to
their respective localities, the Diplopus to Hordwell and the Zyopotamus to Puy and
Hempstead, there is no danger of intermixing their fossil remains. The humeri of
different size, which belonged to the tetradactyle 7/yopotamus, are entirely similar to
the one figured; the only difference which may be noticed consists in the fact that the
distal articular surface is relatively larger in the Diplopus than in Hyopotamus, as seen
by the fact that in the three humeri of nearly equal size measured by me, the breadth of
the articular surface is 42 millims. in Diplopus, and only 32 and 35 in two humeri of
Hyopotamus. Dimensions of the Humerus.
