no inference whatever could be drawn from them.

It will appear, however, that a neutral oxalate of copper with two atoms of water
can exist but in combination with oxalate of potash, or with oxalate of ammonia, as
a double alt.

None of the oxalates of the magnesian class of oxides is more soluble in oxalic
acid than in water, and none of them combines with that acid to form a binoxalate.
The crystals, which are obtained on mixing together solutions of binoxalate of potash
and sulphate of magnesia, and which have been supposed to be a binoxalate of mag-
nesia, are really a mixture of oxalate of magnesia and of quadroxalate of potash.
Hence there is no combination of oxalate of magnesia with oxalate of water ; which
illustrates the fact that bodies of the same class, such as these two oxalates are, have
no disposition to enter into union and form a new compound.

4. Orzalate of Lime.

'The oxalate of lime contains two atoms of water, like the oxalate of magnesia, but
parts with its water more freely than that salt. Thus 12:06 grains of the hydrated
oxalate of lime were found to lose 1'6 grain of water at 212? Fans. in the course of
two days, 1'68 grain in three days, 1:84 grain in six days, and nothing more in nine
days. The alt originally consisted of 100 oxalate of lime united to 27'85 water, of
which last it has lost 19:53 parts, and retained 832 at 212*. It is probable therefore
that the constitution of hydrated oxalate of lime is the same as that of hydrated oxa-
late of magnesia, that oxalate of lime forms only one definite hydrate, containing two
