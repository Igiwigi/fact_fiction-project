Mr. SaLMox's work above referred to, contains the fundamental theorem of the tan-
gential of a cubic, viz. a tangent to a cubic meets the cubic in a third point which lies
on the second or line polar of the point of contact with respect to the Hessian. In my
+ Memoir on Curves of the Third Order*,” I gave an identical equation relating to the
tangential of a cubic, but which is not there exhibited in its proper form ; this was after-
wards effected by Mr. SALMON, in the paper © On Curves of the Third Order.” The
equation, as given by Mr. SALMON, is in the notation of the present memoir,

—H. V+3DH. DU—IDH.DY+H.Y=0,

an equation which in fact puts in evidence the last-mentioned theorem for the tangential
of a cubic.

MR. A. CAYLEY ON THE DOUBLE TANGENTS OF A PLANE CURVE. 195

The idea occurred to me of considering, in the case of the higher plane curves, the
tangentials of a given point of the curve, viz. the points in which the tangent again meets
the curve; for by expressing that two of these tangentials were coincident, we should
have the condition that the given point is the point of contact of a double tangent. But
