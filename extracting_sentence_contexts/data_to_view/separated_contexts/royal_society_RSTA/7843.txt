This conclusion is now borne out and amplified by the results obtained at the still
lower temperature of liquid hydrogen. While these low carbon steels have, under the
influence of the severe conditions in liquid hydrogen, been unable to retain any further
modicum of their ductility, their favourable behaviour is maintained to the extent that
they continue to increase in tenacity with this further lowering of the temperature. The already specially high ratio of increase, 2-65, of 1166A/4 steel (0-14% C.) in liquid
air is, in fact, carried to 3-23, the original tenacity of 21-4 tons per square inch becoming
69-2 tons. Although many other materials in the present research show a larger
tenacity, none shows such a large relative increase as compared with ordinary tempera-
ture. With the higher carbon content, 0-37% in 1397A, the same kind of behaviour
is exhibited in lesser degree, the carbon percentage being apparently rather too high
for the best results.
