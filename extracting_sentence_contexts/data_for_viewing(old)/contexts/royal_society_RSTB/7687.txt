increased to more than their air speed, they either reoriented down-wind, or flew lower, or
even settled; they never underwent a sustained backward drift. But locusts flying over
water did not appear to react to the wind in any of these ways and were, therefore, drifted
backwards. The locusts over water did not react to the wind either directly or indirectly,
while those over the land did. Beall (1941, 1942) made somewhat similar observations on
Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus L.). Such behaviour is consistent with the idea that
active responses to the wind require a visible background, the features of which, when
prominent as on coarse-patterned land, may induce responses up to a fair height, but when
small and inconspicuous, as on reasonably calm water, induce responses only at a much
lower level.

Comparable, but less clear-cut indications that reactions to wind were in fact reactions
to the apparent movement of the background pattern, came from the observations over
land. Locusts flying well above the ground appeared to be less consistently oriented into
wind and less responsive to changes in wind speed than those seen flying close to the ground
at the same time (pp. 177, 179 and 183-185). This is the opposite of what we should expect
if the wind acted mainly as a mechanical stimulus, for its speed increases with height. But
it is just what we should expect ifthe wind acted mainly indirectly, through visual responses.
Both the apparent size of the elements in the background pattern, and their apparent speed
of movement, decrease with increasing height above the ground, so that the movement of
a given background pattern would often be inappreciable to higher fliers while remaining
noticeable enough to evoke responses from lower fliers.

The field observations thus suggest that the behaviour of locusts in wind depends on
