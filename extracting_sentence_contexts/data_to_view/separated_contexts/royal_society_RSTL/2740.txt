Theſe fins are ſmall for the fize *
of the fiſh, being ſcarcely/an inch in length, of a very
thin, delicate confiſtence, and orbicular ſhape. They |

ſeem to be chiefly uſeful in ſupporting and raiſing the
head of the fiſh when he wants'to breathe, which he
does: every: four or-five minutes, by raiſing his mouth
out of the water. This ſhews that he has lungs. and 1s
amphibious, and the fora ſpiratoria ſeem to indicate
his having branchie likewiſe; .but this I only offer as a
conjecture, not being certain of the fact, 1 muſt now;
mention the appearances of a- number, of ſmall croſs
bands, annular diviſions, or rather 74g of the'ſkin, of
the body. They reach. acroſs the body down to the baſe
of the caring on each ſide; but thoſe that croſs the back
ſeem to terminate at the lateral lines, where new rings
take their riſe, not exactly, in; the ſame line, and. run;
down to the caring. This gives the fiſh ſomewhat of' a *
worm-like appearance; and indeed it ſeems to have ſome;
of _ the properties of, this tribe, for it has 'a power. of
lengthening or ſhortening its; body to a certain degree,: |
for its own conveniency, 0r agreeable to its own inclina-;:
tion.
