Related to the phase difference (or partial phase difference), there are no good statistical
tests. This is because it is very difficult to define the null hypothesis. In fact, Ge, in [58],
argues that one should not use significance tests for the phase difference. Instead, one should
complement its analysis by inspecting coherence, and only focus on phase differences whose
corresponding coherence is statistically significant. The same kind of procedure should be used
when interpreting the gain (or partial gain).
