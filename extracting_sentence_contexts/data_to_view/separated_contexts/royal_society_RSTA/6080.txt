The ratio illustrated on the y-axis compares the values of each stress at different angles to the original 90° case, e.g. iS
the theoretical von Mises stress for the 70° case divided by the theoretical von Mises stress for the 90° case. The stress ratio is Dh

calculated using equation (6.3) while the von Mises ratio is calculated using equation (6.8). This follows the procedure set out :®

simulations include the fact that despite employing a viscoelastic rat brain model, implantation
speed does not noticeably impact the von Mises stress which results from the implantation. A crucial finding of this work is that the von Mises stress in the tissue is significantly lower
for the 90° case. The correlation between von Mises stress and strain indicates that strain in the
brain tissue is decreased by the 90° implantation method, which is encouraging for the long-
term health of the tissue surrounding the implant.
