accompanied by a slowing of the pulse, and this indicates that the latter is not dependent
on the former.

The excitability of the vagus-roots to reflex stimuli does not seem to be increased by .
casea, as a stimulus of the same strength applied to the central end of one vagus had a
<imilar effect before and after the injection of the drug. We would call attention,
'$! however, to the very extraordinary effect which succeeded the application of a stronger
W's s*timulus, an effect which seems all the more extraordinary from occurring after the

Irritation of the vagus-roots by the carbonic acid accumulated in the blood during
= the tetanic inspiration, which lasted during the irritation, at once suggests itself as a
Â© cause of the slow pulse which followed the irritation ; but the fact that the pulse was
Z not affected when the distance of the coil was 10 centimetres, although the thorax was
S tetanically expanded, seems to indicate that the slowing which followed the stronger
S irritation from a secondary coil at 8 or 6 centimetres distance from the primary was
& due to reflex action, which the first irritation had been too weak to produce.
Si From Experiment XXXV. it will be seen that after the administration of a large

great after irritation of the left, as after irritation of the right vagus. This shows that
