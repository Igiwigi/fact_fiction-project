THE ERUPTIONS OF MAY, 1902, AT THE SOUFRIERE IN ST. VINCENT. 315

St. Vincent, as since 1812 the Soufriére crater was occupied by a lake of water and
the escape of steam did not take place on a large scale, In Dominica and St. Lucia
there are many “Soufriéres” discharging sulphurous gases. The crater of Pelée
contained a “ Soufriére ” of this kind, and Professor Lacrorx has given a full account
of the products of fumarole action in Martinique.

It is rather a remarkable fact that of all the specimens which we collected of older
andesitic rocks ejected during the 1902 eruptions only one shows contact alteration.
The fresher specimens could not be expected to suffer much change by being again
raised to the temperature at which they consolidated. With the weathered rocks it
is different, for their secondary minerals would certainly be modified had they been
enveloped in the new incandescent lava. Hence we may infer that the ejected blocks
above described were mainly the materials which plugged the orifice of the volcano
and were cleared out by the rise of the magma.

The specimen which does show contact alteration is a fine grained, dark coloured
and banded rock. It consists essentially of dark brown biotite in small scales,
rounded or nearly idiomorphic when enclosed in the felspars ; hypersthene in minute
pleochroic grains; a little augite of similar habit, iron oxides and granular, usually
