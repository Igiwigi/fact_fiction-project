It was not difficult to recognize
the cause of the latter appearance. For each calicoblast which I had observed at the
superficial parts of the skeleton showed an unchanged cell-remnant at its proximal
skeletal end. This fact can be confirmed by the use of stains. SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF THE MADREPORARIAN TYPES OF CORALS, 127

When, now, the small size of the individual calicoblasts is remembered, it will be
readily seen that adjacent proximal ends would give the appearance of a continuous
band. These bands, like the “ points” in the median plane, sometimes appear
brownish.
