The
repertoire of secondary structures in large populations of short RNA polymers is limited [53]:
topologically simple RNA modules are abundant. In open RNA chains, there is a predominance
of stemâ€”loops (composed of a stem and a hairpin loop) and hairpin structures [54], while closed
RNA chains preferentially fold into rod-like structures (a stem closed by two hairpin loops) [55]. This fact is solely based on thermodynamic principles [56] and implies that, by default, short RNA
sequences will predominantly yield a handful of structures. The relevant implication of this high redundancy is that some of those abundant structures
might be the end result of random RNA polymerization (as could have been the case in prebiotic
environments [57]). With no previous selection, random polymers might have thus covered
an array of incipient functions.
