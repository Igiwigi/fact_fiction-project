number diffuses locally from that initial cluster (figure 6e),
mirroring the medial-to-lateral gradient of selectivity observed
using functional magnetic resonance imaging in human
subjects (figure 6f). On average, the location of a unit along
the medial-to-lateral axis correlates with its number preference
(D7, rpearson = 0.95, Ppearson < 0.001; excluding initial state
selective units: rpearson = 0.86, Ppearson < 0.001), as observed
experimentally (figure 6¢,1). According to our model, however,
such a medial-to-lateral direction is not universal but contingent
upon the location of the units that are activated in the initial
state So: different locations would produce different gradients,
depending on the diffusion opportunities offered by the
source. In fact, an initial vector So, containing multiple ran-
domly placed clusters of units, results in multiple coexisting
gradients that run in opposite directions on different parts of
the simulated cortex, as is also manifest in the data [16]
(figure 6i,j). Similarly, our simulations show that the convexity
or concavity of the gradient is not universal, but depends on the
spread of the initial state cluster. Overall, the diffusion process
by which we explain numerotopy is not unrelated to the self-
organizing Turing reaction—diffusion model [40], although in
our case, the large-scale topography of number regions only
obtains after smoothing of the selectivity map by a Gaussian
filter. We thus predict that higher-resolution imaging should
uncover a more intertwined topography of number preferences
