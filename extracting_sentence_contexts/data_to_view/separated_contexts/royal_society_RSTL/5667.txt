The red corpuscles also often adhere to the colourless ones. It will be seen hereafter that the corpuscles of blood within the vessels of the living
body present great yarieties of adhesiveness, according to the amount of irritation to
which a part may be subjected; such variations are als met with in blood outside the
body, in consequence of differences in the quality of the plasma. If a drop of very thick solution of gum-arabic, freshly prepared and free from acidity,
be added to about four drops of blood, the red corpuscles of the mixture will be found
to aggregate much more speedily and more closely than those of ordinary blood, a fact
ascertained some years ago by Mr. Wrarrox Joxts and some other obseryers *. The
result is the formation of dense orange masses with large colourless interspaces, but
without much regular appearance of rouleaux.
