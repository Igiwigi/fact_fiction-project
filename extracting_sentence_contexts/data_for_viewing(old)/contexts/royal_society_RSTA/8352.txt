any quadric through / will touch I at three points of the line ; and if we make it touch I
at a fourth point, it will touch I all along the line. The tangent planes to | at points
of | form a quadric line-cone K, and are represented in © by the generators of a rational
ruled quintic base surface of ’, F’,°. This has a directrix-line 4 and contains rational
normal quartic directrix curves each bisecant of 2; so that % is a double generator as

well as a directrix line of I’,5, and it is in fact a triple line on F,5. It can be shown, then,
that Y consists of Segre cubics which all contain F,° and have 4 as double line, and
that the tangent cones to these cubics at any given point P of are each composed of a
fixed prime II through 2 together with another prime through a fixed plane op also
through 4—the prime II remaining invariable as P moves on 2, and the plane op
describing a quadric line cone K,’.

The Quadric-Quartic Transformation {2, 4, 4}.

There is only one quadric-quartic transformation in which I is the general ®-surface ;
but this one is very important and second only in interest to the quadric-cubic transforma-
tion already described. It arises from the net of curves of A’ which is composed of
conics through A,, A, and some fixed point K, each of these conics being augmented by
