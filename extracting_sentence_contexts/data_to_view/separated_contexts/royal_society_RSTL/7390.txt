I think that these remarkable deductions from the latest developments of WeBER and
NEUMANN's theory can only be avoided by recognizing the action of a medium in electrical
phenomena. The statement, of the electromagnetic theory of light in my former paper was con-
nected with several other electromagnetic investigations, and was therefore not easily
understood when taken by itself. TI propose, therefore, to state it in what I think the
simplest form, deducing it from admitted facts, and showing the connexion between the
experiments already described and those which determine the velocity of light. The connexion of electromagnetic phenomena may be stated in the following manner. Theorem A.â€”If a closed curve be drawn embracing an electric current, then the
integral of the magnetic intensity taken round the closed curve is equal to the current
multiplied by 4.
