At frequent intervals the time, the current,
and the distance moved over are measured ; the ratio of the distances moved over by

the anion and the cation boundaries gives directly A from which a is at once
obtained. . The cathetometer employed was capable of giving readings correct to the tenth
of a millimetre, but from various causes the accuracy with which the position of the
margin can be read is about one-third of this. The difference in the values of p
obtained in the various readings of the same experiment amounts in some cases to
2 per cent., but the error here arises in nearly every case from the fact that in the
earlier measurements, where the distance moved over by the boundary is often less than
0°5 centim., a small error in reading the cathetometer has a very much greater
influence than later when the distance is more, hence it is found always that the
last few readings agree much better among themselves than do the earlier ones. All the readings from an experiment are therefore averaged in the following
manner ;—

Each value for p is multiplied by the distance moved over by one of the
boundaries since the beginning, the numbers thus obtained are added together and
divided by the sum of the multiplicands. When averaged in this manner, it is
