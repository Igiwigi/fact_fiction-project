as told by previous testing of a similar branch and subsequent examination of the
same branch. The vessel was then weighed, the contents evaporated to dryness and
weighed again, Sap obtained in this way contained from less than 0°1 per cent. of
dissolved matter in branches at the base and 45-55 feet up, to a maximum of 0°4 at
the top and 0°36 per cent. at the base. The residues were gummy in character, had
a slightly bitter taste, and contained appreciable quantities of reducing sugar.
Obviously, the sap does not concentrate to any pronounced extent in its upward
flow, as Professor Larmor’s theory postulates.

An Oleander growing in the Melbourne University grounds was found to exude
sap in appreciable quantity from the proximal distal ends of branches cut in
September. The collected sap left behind 1°8-2°2 per cent. of a gummy residue
having a bitter taste, but consisting largely of a reducing sugar. The fact that
the sap oozes out of the vessels when the cut surface of a separated branch is kept
uppermost shows the existence of a positive pressure at the moment of cutting,
and on examination but few of the vessels were found to contain air-bubbles which
could be driven out by pressure. After the escape from the wood has ceased, water
