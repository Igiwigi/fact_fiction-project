tion. In order therefore to make the definition include such cases, it may be necessary
to add to the definition, as given above, the following words :—* or a stronger attrac-
tion for the liquid than for the salt.” In the case of supersaturated gaseous solutions,
8uch as soda-water, Seltzer-water, champagne, &c., jt has been shown" that a glass rod,
or other body, covered with a film of foreign matter is active in liberating gas, while
the same body in a catharized state is inactive. Similar phenomena are exhibited in
the case of liquids at or near the boiling-point, which I regard as supersaturated solu-
tions of their own vapour”. A catharized body is inactive ; but if such body be drawn
through the hand or in any other way covered with a film, it immediately produces a
burst of yapour when placed in the yaporous solution. Hence in saline, gaseous, and
vaporous supersaturated solutions the action of nuclei is the same, and may fairly come
under the same definition, subject only, in the case of saline s0lutions, to the modifi-
cation aboye given, and, in the case of vaporous solutions, to the additional fact that
porous bodies, whether catharized or not, are energetic nuclei. Gathering up these
various details, a nucleus may be defined as a body that has a preferential attraction for
the salt or the gas or the vapour of a supersaturated solution, or for the liquid which
holds any one of the three in solution, separation of the constituents of the solution
being in either case the result ; only in the case of vaporous solutions, porous bodies act
as permanent nuclei.

(2) On the pure substances capable of eausing immediate crystallization, —Conclusions
cannot, obviously, be drawn from liquids that have contracted dust or products of oxida-
tion &c., 8ince such liquids are generally active as nuclei, whether in a lenticular or a
filmy form. Fixed oils require to be refined or filtered, volatile oils to be distilled,
and $olid fats to be fused and filtered or passed through flame, alcohol or naphtha
