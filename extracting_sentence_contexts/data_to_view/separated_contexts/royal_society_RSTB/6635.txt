Such an arrangement is so strange that it requires careful description,
especially since Williams, in his very brief account, refers to the crossing of these two
fibres in a chiasma. However, his figure (16 D) shows clearly that what he took to
be the chiasma does not lie in the middle line. Probably it was really the synapse
between first- and second-order giant fibres in the stellate ganglion, in fact the
structure shown in fig. 37, Plate 45. Fortunately the axons are so large that in addition to the usual neurological methods,
others less disruptive of the cytoplasm can be employed, and the arrangement of the
axons demonstrated with great clarity.
